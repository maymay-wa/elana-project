changed its outside counsel in a case involving sen alfonse 
damato rny 
the committee hired former federal prosecutor henry schuelke a 
washington attorney to replace robert bennett who is still 
handling two other cases for the committee 
the committee announcement said bennett also of washington 
advised the panel last week that his law firms diverse practice 
could lead to an appearance of conflict of interest in the damato 
case details of how such an appearance could arise were not given 
mark green damatos election opponent in 1986 has filed a 
complaint with the committee accusing him of breaking senate rules 
in the hud scandal and other matters damato has denied any 
improprieties 
schuelke will take over bennetts role of helping the committee 
determine whether to proceed with a formal investigation a review 
that is expected to take several months 
bennett is still the committees outside counsel in conducting a 
similar review in a case involving five senators who interceded 
with banking regulators on behalf of a contributor whose savings 
and loan was collapsing 
bennett also is the committees counsel in an investigation of a 
book deal by sen david durenberger rminn

randall e wise had it all a harvard 
mba a profitable computer software company but he sold his 
firm to follow a dream a dream to one day supply contact lenses to 
all the worlds egglaying chickens 
wises red contact lenses are already on 100000 chickens 
nationwide and his company animalens inc is growing 
oh sure people laughed at first wed talk to investors 
theyd say sounds neat good luck wise recalls 
but while wise is willing to joke a little about his enterprise 
hes all business when it comes to discussing the future which he 
says looks sunny side up 
before writing wise off as a cuckoo understand that there is a 
sound idea behind his scheme chickens become positively mellow 
when they see the world through rosetinted glasses or better 
yet fireengine red contact lenses 
scientists arent sure why but a rosy outlook eliminates the 
pecking order among chickens which normally tend to be pretty 
ornery critters redeyed birds spend less time fighting and more 
time laying eggs they also eat less 
according to wises calculations that translates into an annual 
savings of at least 50 cents a chicken or 25 cents per dozen 
eggs with 12 billion laying chickens multiplied by the 20 dozen 
eggs each yields a year the savings could be 600 million 
with such benefits wise is sure farmers will soon flock to buy 
his contact lenses which go for a modest 20 cents a pair or 15 
cents if bought in bulk the hard lenses are put in place in 
seconds by holding the birds head steady they stay in place for 
the life of the bird or about a year 
the challenge is to go out and sell the product especially 
when its new and different wise says this certainly falls 
into the category of being new and different 
the idea for the lenses goes back to wises childhood on the 
chicken farm his father managed in northern california in the early 
1960s 
wises dad irvin tried to produce lenses for chickens after a 
salesman told him about a farm where chickens afflicted with 
cataracts behaved better than those with normal sight 
but the technology didnt exist at the time for the lens to 
work explains wise 41 the early lenses blinded the 
chickens 
the elder wises fledgling company folded his son went off to 
college worked in the shipping industry for a time and then 
founded a computer software firm in boston eight years ago that 
prospered 
but the chickens and the lenses were still on his mind three 
years ago he sold his company for several million dollars and set 
out to pursue his dream 
i got out of computers because of this wise says and i 
still dont miss computers ive believed in this for a long time 
not that everything has flown smoothly since jumping from 
computer software to chicken eyewear 
the lenses had to be painstakingly designed so they wouldnt 
distort the chickens vision or irritate their eyes wise keeps a 
jar in his office filled with hundreds of pairs of failed test 
lenses that looks like a container of jelly beans 
i look at that and i think thats all behind us wise 
says we already know a lot someone else would have to figure 
out 
eventually a usable lens was developed wise contracted with 
several small plants around massachusetts to produce the lenses 
and field tests were conducted on farms around the country 
now wise says the testing is over and its time for his dream 
to fly 
im very confident wise says from his firms small suite of 
offices in this affluent boston suburb 1990 is going to be the 
inflection point for us when this really takes off

south carolina school principal ben nesbit 
became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for 
illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble 
we found out a couple of weeks ago that theres a chemical 
that washes drugs out of the system said nesbit whose school 
spring valley high of columbia sc has received national 
acclaim for its drugfighting efforts the students use it full 
time washing out their systems and being tested all the time 
being high 
the street name of the chemical is golden seal said 
district of columbia teacher leroy lewis jr explaining the 
herb also is popular with students in the nations capital 
this latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in 
schools is serious and must be waged in a nononsense but flexible 
manner lewis said 
kids recognize all the problems of the system said lewis a 
us government teacher at spingarn senior high school they know 
how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan 
the battle to keep the nations youngsters away from drugs has 
evolved from a mere just say no slogan devised by former first 
lady nancy reagan to a threat by the bush administration to end 
federal aid to schools colleges and universities tat fail to 
document tough policies against illegal drug use 
the tougher approach reflects the nations growing concern with 
drug abuse statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors 
drink daily and more than 60000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have 
tried cocaine 
young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction 
and the damage by addiction can be more permanent said doug hall 
of the national parents resource institute for drug education 
the government is expected to spend some 500 million under the 
drug education program this fiscal year about 180 million more 
than the year that ended sept 30 in 1986 only 3 million was 
budgeted for drug education 
almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools 
offer some sort of antidrug lessons the new national drug 
strategy says schoolbased prevention programs should be reinforced 
by tough policies on use possession and distribution of drugs 
schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend 
emerging success is hard to determine since so many of the 
approaches are new 
in texas football players are tested illinois and delaware 
laws allow spot searches of students and delaware plans to use 
drugsniffing dogs in the schools 
jefferson county ky schools notify police of every campus 
drug incident suspend students for six to 10 days for drug 
possession or use and transfer repeat offenders the pittsburgh 
board of education has decided any student convicted of trafficking 
in or possessing drugs on or off school property will be subject 
to expulsion 
drug free zone signs surround public and private schools in 
prince georges county md warning that anyone found possessing 
or distributing drugs within 1000 feet of a school yard faces 
strict penalties ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison 
education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort 
of drugfree zone programs or laws 
we see more expulsions and suspensions for use because its 
against the law said james better staff director of the 
education departments drugfree schools recognition program but 
most schools have referral and reentry programs 
at the local level education department officials estimate 73 
percent of americas 16490 school districts have written policies 
against substance abuse of these more than 90 percent involve 
notification of parents and or police suspension or counseling 
most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug 
policies for schools at most they offer general guidelines like 
those jointly developed by the american association of school 
administrators the national association of school nurses and the 
national education association 
we have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the 
locals so national groups avoid doing the same thing said lew 
armistead of the national association of secondary school 
principals 
hall vice president of the national parents resource institute 
for drug education in atlanta said we dont believe in dealing 
with these people as criminals you really cant incarcerate your 
way out of a drug problem 
hall pointed to statistics that say school buildings or 
campuses are one of the least popular places for students to use 
or distribute drugs also he said students tend to use drugs more 
at night and on weekends 
pride supports treatment on demand said hall but the 
problem is its difficult to draw the line on whether the school is 
responsible or the parents 
nesbit insisted it is a school problem because they cant 
learn when they are stoned they cant learn when theyre dead 
they cant learn when theyre in the hospital were going to be 
paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many 
people are hooked 
nesbit said his drugfighting efforts encompass more grassroots 
approaches of sending out letters of complaints to local liquor 
stores that sell alcohol to minors to encouraging temporary 
suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales 
in addition to the district of columbias citywide policies 
lewis offers earlymorning tutoring for students who want help with 
school work and to talk about whats going on with them with 
somebody they want to trust 
jenlane gee a teacher from modesto calif recognized along 
with nesbit and lewis as among the nations best teachers and 
principals complained that the governments drugfighting efforts 
have ignored elementary schools 
gee who teaches third graders at christine sipherd school said 
just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools 
because studies show that children usually decide by the third to 
fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs 
nesbit added that simply talking or acting tough wont stem 
student drug use 
i think theres a hard line emerging in the schools he 
said but theres no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make 
good decisions about their future their bodies and their values

mikhail s gorbachev broke the mold of dour 
intransigent soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world 
stage and hes been surprising nowwary western counterparts ever 
since his 1985 summit with ronald reagan 
based on his past performance theres every reason to believe 
that the 58yearold gorbachev might spring a surprise on president 
bush when the two meet off malta on dec 2 and 3 so much so that 
white house officials say extensive preparations are under way to 
prepare the american president for anything that might be thrown at 
him 
gorbachevs reform policies in the soviet union and eastern 
europe have been surprising enough to americans his style leans to 
the unexpected as well 
when gorbachev and reagan posed for pictures at the start of 
their meeting in geneva four years ago the american president kept 
mum heeding his advisers counsel not to take a chance on spoiling 
the atmosphere of his first ussoviet summit with an offhand 
remark 
the russian showed no such caution 
when a reporter told gorbachev he had been described by a fellow 
soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth 
gorbachev replied im still using my own teeth but as to the 
substance of your question both the president and i have good 
grounds to believe we can have a good talk 
later the same day after his teteatete with reagan stretched 
well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule the soviet leader 
broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides i think we will 
have a good relationship he said 
at the last snap summit in reykjavik iceland in 1986 the 
united states went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty 
reducing intermediaterange nuclear missiles gorbachev instead 
proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories 
reagan took him up on the challenge and the two men engaged in 
what was later described as historys higheststakes poker game 
seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another 
until they stumbled over the last chip reagans beloved star wars 
plan 
the american refused to concede the soviet insisted it was all 
or nothing and nothing it was 
bushs advisers have let it be known the new us president will 
not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off 
malta 
but as recently as last may when secretary of state james a 
baker iii went to moscow expecting to set a date for the next 
ussoviet summit gorbachev caught the new foreign policy chief 
off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional 
forces in europe 
the initiative broke a yearsold logjam over how to count and 
reduce the two sides nonnuclear ground and air forces in europe 
but it embarrassed baker who was unprepared for such a move and 
gave gorbachev a public relations coup 
bush facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in 
developing a policy toward the soviet union recovered at the end 
of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a 
nato summit in brussels 
but six weeks later gorbachev pulled another trick out of his 
hat 
as the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies 
gathered in paris for their annual economic summit they received a 
letter from gorbachev appealing for entry to the world economic 
community 
after decades of cold war and economic rivalry the soviet chief 
wrote that his effort to restructure the soviet economic and 
society is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and 
entire participation in the world economy 
his letter instantly became the central focus of the summit 
talks

the two deadliest weeks of the 
10yearold civil war have served only to set the stage for more 
bloodletting 
the battle of san salvador at least the first one is over 
the huge rebel offensive that began nov 11 failed to achieve its 
principal objective of persuading the government to make 
significant concessions in the quest for a negotiated solution 
indeed with the administration claiming victory and demanding 
what amounts to the rebels surrender and the insurgents promising 
to finish off the mortally wounded fascist beast salvadorans 
can only expect weeks or months more of warfare of an intensity 
unseen since early 1981 when the rebels first final offensive 
failed 
this battle against arena is a battle that cannot turn back a 
battle to sweep fascism once and for all from our country the 
rebel clandestine radio venceremos said late last week arena is 
the rightist nationalist republican alliance the governing party 
they the guerrillas tried and they lost president 
alfredo cristiani said proclaiming the military defeat of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
the government contends its forces killed or wounded a third of 
the rebel army estimated at about 7000 fulltime combatants most 
foreign journalists who spent day after day in the combat zones 
doubt the official claim that more than 1000 guerrillas were 
killed 
the figure appears inconsistent with the relatively few dead 
guerrillas seen by reporters who daily compared notes on what they 
saw where and when 
cristiani says the decimation suffered by guerrilla forces has 
been so telling that they will be capable from now on of only 
terrorist actions 
the contention is suspect as the president the defense 
minister and every colonel who went on record in the months prior 
to the spectacular push said the same thing that insurgent 
capacity had been reduced to isolated terrorist activity 
cristiani acknowledged in an interview after the fighting waned 
last week that the guerrillas are doing some things that look 
more like regrouping than withdrawing 
radio vencermos on friday referred to the 10day concerted 
assault on the capital and several provincial cities as the first 
period of offensive implying that others are in the offing 
the war began in late 1979 but its roots go back decades 
el salvador is the smallest country on the western hemispheres 
mainland with 5 million people in an area the size of 
massachusetts it is also the most densely populated 
the consolidation of landholdings by relatively recent immigrant 
families not of the centuriesold indianspanish mix that makes 
up more than 90 percent of the population disenfranchized 
hundreds of thousands of peasants who raised subsistence crops on 
collectively held village lands landless peasants became migrant 
peons who went seasonally from the coffee harvest to picking cotton 
to cutting cane the workforce of an economy that was almost 
completely dependent on the export of those three products 
the agricultural export economy made vast fortunes for a tiny 
elite the rich have mansions on their plantations sumptuous homes 
in the capitals posh western sector and houses or apartments in 
miami new york or los angeles they tune in to us television 
stations with their satellite dishes and send their children to 
us universities while the twothirds of the population lives in 
dire poverty 
peasants and workers organized widely in the 1970s by the end 
of the decade leftleaning federations demanding profound 
structural reform to more equitably distribute wealth were 
regularly putting tens of thousands of people in the street they 
probably constituted if counted together a plurality of 
salvadorans 
the growing left threatened the privileged who reacted 
ferociously about 30000 people most of them real or perceived 
leftists are estimated to have been slain by government troops or 
rightwing death squads between 1979 and 1984 when such murders 
began to decline 
repression combined with the vast majoritys manifest lack of 
economic opportunity to create a fertile field for revolutionary 
harvest 
the government and its us patron washington has provided el 
salvador 4 billion in aid this decade contend a fledgling 
democracy is on its feet the left says intimidation persecution 
and murder still await those who avow social change 
on nov 16 armed men broke into the central american university 
campus residence of six jesuit priests and educators who had been 
labeled subversive ideologues by the radical right the gunmen 
killed the priests their housekeeper and her teenage daughter 
other jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army troops enter 
the residence before the shots rang out 
the government and guerrillas sat down in mexico in september to 
discuss peace for the first time in two years they met again in 
costa rica last month but the sessions were strained and fruitless 
cristiani last week urged the rebels to admit their defeat 
come to their senses lay down their arms and incorporate 
themselves in the democratic process 
asked if that scenario was realistic cristiani said it may 
not sound realistic to the fmln 
the rev ignacio martinbaro one of the slain priests was 
vicerector of the university and head of its prestigious polling 
institute his recent surveys showed that the majority of 
salvadorans were personally uncommitted to the program of either 
the government or the insurgency 
the only cause that commanded majority support was peace

a priest who is russian orthodox by 
necessity not choice stood before his congregation in the 
cathedral of the transfiguration on a recent sunday and proclaimed 
allegiance to pope john paul ii 
yaroslav chukhnys words echoed from rome to moscow long 
competitors for the souls of eastern europe they are certain to 
reverberate back to the vatican when mikhail s gorbachev on friday 
becomes the first soviet leader to meet a roman catholic pontiff 
the 35yearold priest took the boldest step yet in a revolt 
against the forced consolidation of the small ukrainian catholic 
church into the russian orthodox church in 1946 
after his proclamation he said the ukrainian church does 
exist and it has legalized itself 
chukhny never considered himself russian orthodox he attended a 
russian orthodox seminary in moscow because it was the only path to 
the priesthood 
ukrainian catholics who kept the faith underground for two 
generations see the gorbachev trip as a sign they will regain legal 
status as a separate denomination 
with that will come a chance to reclaim confiscated churches and 
property including chukhnys cathedral and an element of national 
identity in an area that was part of poland before world war ii 
i think gorbachev is a cunning guy and he wouldnt go to meet 
the pope with nothing in his pockets said miroslav soltys a 
44yearold communications engineer and ukrainian catholic 
behind two or three locked doors i think the church already has 
been legalized 
in the soviet union religious groups need government approval 
ukrainian catholicism with an estimated 25 to 5 million followers 
in the western ukraine does not have it and many followers have 
been fined or imprisoned 
expressing the russian orthodox churchs resistance to 
legalization metropolitan filaret of kiev said the ukrainian 
church had been a source of national social and religious 
oppression during its nearly 400 years 
after chukhnys proclamation soltys and other believers took 
over the cathedral of the transfiguration where ukrainian 
catholics are dominant in the congregation 
in his liturgy for sunday oct 29 the priest acknowledged the 
spiritual leadership of john paul ii and prayed for him instead of 
patriarch pimen head of the russian orthodox church 
he recalled in an interview later i told them i had gone over 
to the greek catholic church i said forgive me if you dont 
agree but i dont feel any allegiance to the russian church 
greek catholic is another name for the ukrainian church 
chukhny said the religious tenets of the russian orthodox and 
ukrainian catholic churches are much the same and the only real 
differences are in language and the ultimate superior 
believers keep a constant vigil inside the kiev cathedral to 
prevent the russian patriarchate from taking it back on a sunday 
in november several thousand people pressed into the church and 
about 100 more strained to hear the service from the steps 
russian orthodox officials accused ukrainian catholics of taking 
over by force and have revoked chukhnys right to preach in the 
russian church but they have not tried to recover the greendomed 
cathedral built just before the bolshevik revolution of 1917 
im a religious person said the bearded young priest 
ive never been interested in politics but what i did has taken 
on a political coloring 
ukrainian catholicism has been colored by politics ever since a 
16th century agreement gave the vatican supremacy over believers in 
the ukrainian and byelorussian territory then controlled by poland 
the church kept the ancient orthodox ritual and even its name 
reflects centuries of turmoil it is known variously as the greek 
catholic ukrainian catholic and uniate church 
after being separated from the rest of the ukraine for nearly 
600 years the lvov area was reunited with it by force half a 
century ago after germany attacked poland on sept 1 1939 josef 
stalin sent the red army into eastern poland 
after the war the areas were incorporated into the soviet 
union the ukrainian catholic church accused of collaborating with 
the nazis was merged with the orthodox church which took over its 
property and buildings 
among the priests who led the merger program which soviet and 
russian orthodox officials insist was voluntary was gavriil 
kostelnik pastor of the same cathedral of the transfiguration 
priests who refused to switch were sent to prison camps where 
many died ivan gel who now leads the lay committee to support the 
ukrainian catholic church was imprisoned 18 years for nationalist 
and human rights activities and for supporting the church 
resistance to soviet rule in the western ukraine was such that 
bands of antisoviet guerrillas operated in the woods and mountains 
until the mid1950s 
gel was released in january 1987 and as gorbachevs reforms 
loosened control of religion ukrainian catholics became bolder 
services in private apartments were replaced by open rallies and 
demonstrations but organizers often were fined or jailed 
ukrainian catholics have reopened as many as 40 churches and 
gel said other priests are following chukhnys lead 
in gels life as in the region the church is part of the 
ethnic sentiment of a people dominated at various times over the 
centuries by russians swedes poles lithuanians austrians and 
hungarians 
ukrainians credit the church with keeping their language alive 
and accuse the russian orthodox church of being cowed by whatever 
power rules russia 
we need a return to freedom of religion in the soviet union as 
a principle right of a citizen in a democratic country gel said 
renewal of our nation renewal of our church is part of the 
process of decolonization of our people 
a people without a church cannot be sovereign gel said 
he sees the ukrainian church playing the role of the roman 
catholic church in poland a center of resistance to communist 
rule 
that could worry the kremlin which faces demands for greater 
autonomy or outright independence in regions along its western 
border 
as for the russian orthodox church metropolitan filaret wrote 
to the moscow news you dont need to be clairvoyant to 
understand that the restoration of the former uniate church will 
lead to religious and political struggle

early election returns monday showed 
opposition parties forging ahead of prime minister rajiv gandhis 
congress party threatening the family dynasty that has dominated 
independent india 
reports by governmentrun television said the congress party was 
leading in more races than any single opposition party but was 
falling short of enough seats in parliament to form the next 
government without entering a coalition 
the television network said that final results in 246 of the 524 
contests gave the congress party 103 seats while the national front 
coalition the major opposition force and a fundamentalist hindu 
party and two communist parties captured 112 smaller parties and 
independent candidates won the other seats 
the congress party is no longer going to be the majority in 
the next government the television commentator said who will 
form the next government and who will be the next prime minister is 
going to take some time to determine 
the election campaign that began in october was the most violent 
since india gained its independence from britain in 1947 balloting 
in the vast nation was staggered over three days wednesday 
friday and sunday and it was uncertain when final official 
results would be reported 
millions of ballots were ruled invalid by the election 
commission including those cast in 18 percent of the precincts in 
gandhis home district of amethi and it ordered that new elections 
be held monday 
by the time voting ended in indias 25 states and seven federal 
territories at least 137 people including six candidates had been 
killed in electionrelated violence since wednesday 
the election commission ruled there was widespread 
ballotrigging voter intimidation and murderous assaults and 
ordered new elections monday in onefifth of the countrys 590000 
polling booths 
the election was seen as a referendum on gandhis leadership 
since he assumed power in 1984 amid hopes he could lead india 
toward a new age 
while the congress party was expected to sweep the southern 
states it appeared to be in serious trouble in the north its 
traditional stronghold 
congress still could emerge as the single largest party making 
it the likely choice to try to form the next government of the 
worlds largest democracy but it would be forced into an uneasy 
alliance with hindu fundamentalists or the communists 
the national front coalition led by former gandhi ally 
vishwanath pratap singh was running in second place 
it was followed by the rightwing hindu bharatiya janata party 
or indian peoples party and the indiamarxist communist party 
at stake in the elections were 524 seats in the 543seat lok 
sabha or house of the people the policymaking lower house of 
parliament that will choose the next prime minister voting was 
postponed in several districts because of incomplete voter lists or 
candidates deaths and the other 19 seats will be determined in 
later elections 
opinion polls had indicated gandhis congress party would win 
from 170 to 220 seats far short of the 267 needed for a majority 
the party 415 seats in the december 1984 elections that propelled 
gandhi to power 
the congress party accepted under protest the election 
commissions order for new balloting in amethi said party 
spokesman anand sharma he denied the allegations of fraud and said 
they were a plot to embarrass ghandi who has represented the 
district since 1980 
but the decision dealt a stunning blow to gandhi who had been 
expected to easily win reelection to parliament although voter 
fraud is common in indian politics never has a revote been 
ordered in the prime ministers own backyard 
gandhis position already had been weakend by criticism of his 
leadership and reports of highlevel corruption in his government 
defeat for gandhi the grandson of prime minister jawaharlal 
nehru and son of prime minister indira gandhi could herald the end 
of the dynasty that has governed india for all but 29 months since 
it became independent 
the election will be won or lost in the hindi heartland the 
northern states of rajasthan madhya pradesh uttar pradesh 
haryana and bihar which together control more than half the seats 
in the lok sabha 
neither congress nor the opposition adopted a platform calling 
for major changes in indias domestic or foreign policy gandhis 
leadership became the main issue of a bitter campaign that claimed 
at least 182 lives since it began in october 
the 45yearold prime minister portrayed the election as a 
simple choice between stability and chaos only the congress party 
the party of his mother and his grandfather could provide 
economic improvement and fight the ethnic and religious tensions 
threatening the countrys unity he said 
the national front a coalition of five parties with regional 
religious and ideological differences capitalized on accusations 
of highlevel corruption and ineptitude and promised honest and 
efficient leadership 
gandhi was propelled to power hours after his mothers 
assassination oct 31 1984 he promised to clean up indias 
notoriously corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy liberalize the 
economy and initiate reforms that would attack poverty and 
illiteracy and prepare india for the 21st century 
but the initial aura inspired by the youthful gandhi a 
cambridgeeducated former airline pilot faded as allegations of 
corruption dogged his friends his party and his government

fifty years ago the soviet union 
invaded finland and met the fierce ghost army of whiteclad ski 
troops whose gallant fight in a hopeless cause was admired around 
the world 
the finns lost the 105day war to their huge neighbor but 
memories of their courage helped make their independence secure 
after world war ii 
the russians were badly organized and stuck out like sore 
thumbs against the white snow in their dark uniforms said capt 
toivo ahjopalo who was a junior artillery officer on the shores of 
lake ladoga on the karelian isthmus 
although the red army soldiers were well equipped their 
strategy and planning were poor ahjopalo said his artillery unit 
of two 57mm guns killed 1600 soviets in 48 hours 
it was too easy almost shameful to kill them he said 
the russians kept coming at us in straight lines and our two guns 
picked them off like flies the frozen lake was awash with blood 
a new finnish movie called the winter war will open 
thursday the anniversary of the outbreak of what may have been the 
coldest war in history several books and articles on the war also 
have been published recently 
in the era of glasnost soviet historians have increased their 
casualty figures from fewer than 50000 soviet soldiers killed to 
74000 with more than 200000 wounded 
the official finnish estimate of total soviet casualties is 
nearly 1 million a number also hinted at in the memoirs of nikita 
s khrushchev the former soviet leader 
finland a nation of 37 million in 1939 suffered 22000 
soldiers killed and 43000 wounded 
on nov 26 1939 soviet foreign minister vyacheslav m molotov 
accused finnish troops of shooting across the border near mainila 
a village in southeastern finland the finns denied it and soviet 
historians now say josef stalin used the incident as a pretext to 
invade finland four days later 
it looks very likely that stalin ordered the shots to be fired 
by his own troops said alexander dongarov a soviet foreign 
ministry researcher the soviets were worried about developments 
in europe and a possible german attack on their territory through 
finland besides there was great antirussian feeling and mistrust 
in finland at the time 
dongarov spoke with the associated press during a visit to 
helsinki 
the winter war was fought in temperatures as low as minus 49 
degrees the severe cold caused frostbite and hallucinations that 
forced guard duty tours to be reduced from two hours to 30 minutes 
adolf hitler had occupied austria in 1938 and in secret 
negotiations with the finns stalin demanded the right to build 
fortifications in the gulf of finland to protect leningrad finland 
rejected that and other soviet demands as violations of its 
sovereignty 
negotiations broke down after 18 months the finns still did not 
believe stalin would attack but field marshal carl gustaf 
mannerheim mobilized more than 180000 men near the border for what 
was called refresher training 
i was literally admiring the sky above helsinki when suddenly 
totally unexpectedly russian planes broke through the clouds and 
dropped their bombs said paul sjoblom who covered the war for 
the associated press 
minutes later he scrambled out of a bomb shelter and found the 
mangled remains of his bicycle in the street 
when the finns had fought for three months against the red army 
which sent in 450000 soldiers at the start of the war they were 
suffering from lack of reserves and ammunition 
after a soviet offensive in march 1940 mannerheim rejected an 
offer of aid from the western powers as too little too late 
and recommended a negotiated peace 
a treaty was signed march 12 that forced finland to cede large 
areas of eastern karelia to the soviets more than 400000 
karelians had to be evacuated 
the winter war demonstrated once again that when a great 
power is faced by a small nation whose only goal is to survive 
calculations of strength cannot be based on pure arithmetic 
wrote max jacobson a former finnish ambassador and statesman 
in the vast drama of world war ii it was but a short episode 
finland like a recalcitrant pawn refused to move to the square 
assigned to it by those who controlled the chessboard finally 
it had to submit to fate 
fifteen months after the battle ended finland went to war with 
the soviet union again on the side of germany

the cultivators of 200pound radishes 
and watermelons the size of small deer will get official 
recognition soon thanks to new registry for greenthumbed growers 
most of the calls i get have been is this the biggest 
pumpkin tomato or whatever said jim stephens a specialist 
with the university of floridas institute of food and agricultural 
sciences people will call up and say they have a 200pound 
radish and ask if it is a record and wed have to say we didnt 
know 
but stephens has developed rules and procedures for harvesting 
and measuring about 30 varieties of vegetables grown in the state 
already records have been established with a 10pound cabbage a 
16pound 8ounce cantaloupe and a 146pound watermelon 
one of the secrets of growing a super vegetable is to extend its 
growing season and that will make most vegetables tough and 
stringy the texture of a giant radish for instance resembles 
wood pulp 
clyde bumgardner a retired air conditioning expert in levy 
county was credited with producing floridas champion watermelon 
this past summer 
thats the one that has the official record but the year 
before i had one that was 170 pounds said bumgardner 72 the 
world record is 270 pounds so ive got a way to go

the former head of the us southern command 
says the bush administration ousted him from his post in panama for 
political reasons because he opposed us policies in that country 
i believe the policy was flawed gen fred woerner said in 
an interview in which he described the administrations goals as 
simplistic and shortsighted 
the specific language was the president decided it was time 
for a change woerner said in describing how defense secretary 
richard cheney told him in july that he was being removed and 
then when i said i was entitled to more of an explanation i was 
told it had nothing to do with performance but was for political 
reasons 
woerners contention contradicts the pentagons denial in july 
when it announced he was being replaced 
woerner a longtime latin american hand who retired from the 
army earlier this month left his post as head of the command just 
days before the failed oct 3 coup attempt to oust panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
during the attempted overthrow us troops blocked two roads in 
panama spoke with the rebel leaders and watched the firefights 
from their hillside vantage point several congressional leaders 
contended later that the united states should have stepped in to 
oust noriega 
woerner who generally opposes us troop intervention added 
the president i think in his handling of the last major event 
the failed coup demonstrated his lack of willingness to commit 
troops 
the american government started pushing for noriegas ouster 
after a series of demonstrations in 1987 the move heightened when 
the panamanian general was indicted on drugtrafficking charges in 
the united states in 1988 
president bush has repeatedly said he is not giving up on 
efforts to get noriega out of office the president also has said 
he considers noriega to be the problem not the panama defense 
forces that noriega heads and that if noriega is forced out and 
free elections are held the country will have instant improved 
relations with the united states 
woerner said that in the bush administrations policy there 
was a lot of heat generated but not necessarily sound policy or 
strategy to support us interests he said the goals of the bush 
administration were shortterm get noriega out and restore 
democracy 
you link those two together and you have what the 
administration believed was an easy objective woerner said 
that means you put your policy in the hands of noriega if 
he stays your policy fails if he goes you succeed woerner 
said i know noriega i didnt want to put the success or failure 
in his hands 
the us policy assumed noriegas ouster would remove the 
problem but woerner contended it only would create a promotion 
for the next thug 
the general said his remarks were seen as being soft on noriega 
it is very difficult to speak out on panama in a position 
contrary to the administrations without appearing to be soft on 
noriega he said 
noriega does have to be deposed for democracy to succeed he 
conceded but added the us policy cannot stop there woerner said 
he sought a plan calling for an internal opposition group strong 
us support for that group and international condemnation of the 
situation 
i do not believe a problem of this magnitude can be solved by 
external forces in the united states he said and we cant 
just transfer a democratic ideal or objective 
i said we were greatly underestimating noriegas staying 
power and that was not a popular position to take woerner said 
the answer is not military intervention he said adding we 
could intervene and take out noriega thats the easy thing its 
getting out and leaving something behind to say those american 
military men that lost their lives changed panama for the better

another cultural stereotype will 
selfdestruct when the new england school for nannies graduates its 
first male nanny 
aaron stack 18 of westfield will complete the 3month 
program dec 15 
stacks sense of humor helped him in a similar situation in 
high school when he was the only male in a preschool child care 
class 
now it has helped him parry the jests of friends who cant help 
asking if he wants to be mary poppins 
after graduating from westfield high school last spring stack 
didnt want to go to college and ruled out military service 
instead he opted for the nanny program which he learned about 
during a job fair 
the military keeps calling me but i say im going to be a 
nanny not a marine he said 
the 300 a week plus room and board that he could earn as a 
livein baby sitter appealed to him 
my pay goes into my pocket he said besides i love kids 
theyre awesome 
arthur lord vice president and director of admissions for the 
new england school for nannies said about 250 women have graduated 
from the 5yearold school stack will be its first male graduate 
were quite proud of him hes holding up the grades and he 
wont be hard to place lord said 
it raises some eyebrows when men come into a field like this 
like male nurse lord added weve tried males before theyre 
uncomfortable about being the only male in the class aarons going 
to break the door open 
stack said the program focuses on the business side of being a 
nanny as well as teaching child care and child psychology to his 
surprise a nanny can expect to have health insurance and taxes 
paid by the employer 
he acknowledges that since men have traditionally avoided such 
occupations some people question his motivation but stack said 
hes determined to be treated as a professional care giver 
hey its practice said stack who wants to have children 
some day a nanny is a practice parent

an opposition presidential candidate 
led in early returns monday after the governing partys hopeful 
conceded defeat 
jorge batlle candidate of the governing colorado party said 
sunday night before official returns were released that he had lost 
the race to luis lacalle of the national party 
both parties are centerright and both candidates have promised 
to trim down an atrophied welfare state in this small south 
american country of 29 million people 
according to the information available the future president 
will be sen lacalle to whom i extend my most sincere 
congratulations and best wishes for success in his term said 
batlle whose name is pronounced bahtlee 
lacalle said he would issue a public statement on monday but 
acknowledged that he had received congratulatory calls from 
president julio m sanguinetti and liber seregni presidential 
candidate for the leftist broad front 
the interior ministry issuing the first official returns 
shortly after midnight that results from 152 of the 8493 voting 
stations gave 10170 votes or 39 percent to the national party 
8040 votes or 30 percent to the colorado party and 3547 votes or 
13 percent to the broad front a coalition of leftist parties 
equipos consultores a respected independent polling agency 
projected the national party received 38 percent of the total vote 
compared to 31 percent for the colorados equipos did not state how 
many votes its projection was based on 
the leftist coalition broad front tallied 22 percent of the vote 
nationwide according to equipos and the fronts cndidate for 
mayor of the capital montevideo marxist doctor tabare vazquez won 
that coveted post 
batlle acknowledged that the trend indicates a majority for 
the broad front in montevideo that trend is irreversible he 
said the next mayor of montevideo will be tabare vazquez 
at stake were the presidency the vice presidency the posts of 
30 senators and 99 deputies and governments in 19 provinces 
a win for the national party would be the first time it took 
power since 1967 and only the third time this century 
uruguayans voting to replace sanguinetti and both houses of 
congress said their main concern was invigorating an economy that 
has been in decline for three decades 
things arent going to change if politics dont take a turn 
and politicians look for something different said luis suarez a 
63yearold retiree 
when we look at the outside world there have been tremendous 
advances said marcos larghero 47 a graphic designer the 
opposite has occurred here we deteriorate a little bit each year 
election officials anticipated a turnout of 90 percent or better 
of the 232 million uruguayans eligible to vote radio stations 
reported that 21 percent had voted by 11 am 
in the last elections in 1984 the main issue was who could best 
lead uruguay back to democracy after a 12year military regime that 
trampled human rights stifled political opposition and ran the 
economy to the ground 
batlles greatuncle jose batlle y ordonez forged modern 
uruguay during his presidencies in 190307 and 191115 using huge 
surpluses from beef and grain exports batlle y ordonez established 
the 8hour work day a minimum wage retirement pensions and paid 
vacations 
batlles father luis batlle berres used reserves built up 
during world war ii to promote local industry by blocking imports 
during his 194751 presidency he also expanded social programs 
today public education through college is free the state 
provides mortgages and insurance as well as pensions runs the 
banking system and employs 270000 uruguayans or about onequarter 
of the work force 
however salaries are so low that teachers bus drivers and 
others frequently go on strike retirees can hardly live on their 
pensions and the quality of public services has declined teachers 
earn about 84000 pesos 110 a month 
the gross national product now 8 billion and real wages 
recovered modestly under sanguinetti but inflation now at 825 
percent did not unemployment at 14 percent in 1985 is down to 9 
percent 
lacalle and batlle pledged to reduce inflation balance the 
national budget sell gold reserves and pay off some of uruguays 
63 billion foreign debt and sell inefficient public companies 
they also pledged to open the economy encourage competition 
through deregulation and restrict the right of organized labor to 
strike 
lacalle took the lead in public opinion surveys analysts said 
partly because he convinced voters he would seek solutions 
gradually on the basis of negotiation not right away or by force 
uruguays aging politically conservative population includes 
650000 retirees a majority of voters are 40 years old or more 
lacalle a 48yearold attorney and senator and a member of a 
prominent political family pledged to form a coalition government 
and said he would offer cabinet posts to leaders of other parties 
the new president takes office march 1 1990 and congress and 
the departmental governments begin feb 15

food prices will go up again in 1990 but farm 
exports probably wont crop production may equal or exceed this 
years output but that will depend on the weather 
its forecasting time at the agriculture department when 
hundreds of bureaucrats economists consultants researchers 
commodity traders bankers food processors and even a few farmers 
gather to hear the latest predictions 
many foreign governments notably the soviet union japan and 
members of the european economic community also watch the annual 
conference for tidbits that may help their agricultural trade 
fortunes 
the departments 66th annual conference outlook 90 will run 
from noon tuesday to noon thursday during that time dozens of 
general sessions and individual meetings will cover the overall 
international and us domestic situation plus separate sessions 
for various commodities and other topics 
much of the outlook for 1990 already has been described in 
general terms by usda analysts in recent reports 
for example consumer food prices which rose 41 percent in 
1988 probably climbed about 6 percent this year the sharpest 
annual increase since 1981 analysts have been saying the 1990 
increase wont be that sharp if there is normal weather 
the usda also reports that agricultural exports which provide 
much of the financial base for farmers did well in 1989 reaching 
almost 40 billion the most since the record 438 billion in 1981 
but exports in 1990 department analysts have been saying those 
will be down because of lower prices and reduced volumes expected 
for some key commodities 
the net cash income of farmers rose to record levels in recent 
years peaking at 599 billion in 1988 this is the money farmers 
have left over in a calendar year after deducting cash expenses 
from gross cash income 
however 1989 net cash income will drop to a range of 52 
billion to 57 billion according to usda economists that reflects 
greater expenses from more cropland being put back into production 
this year along with sharp declines in government payments 
the outlook for 1990 farm income will depend greatly on national 
and international weather and crop situations particularly for 
wheat soybeans and feed grains livestock expansion or 
contraction also will reflect crops and markets 
thus the conference will attempt to fill in many of the gaps 
concerning the supply and demand for commodities in the coming 
year but those arent the only concerns 
conditions affecting farmers and rural americans will be an 
important focus of outlook 90 with such topics as farm finance 
new action on rural development rural transportation policy the 
wellbeing of rural families and children and housing for older 
farm workers organizers said 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter will keynote the 
conference on tuesday afternoon and will participate in discussions 
on the federal budget national economy and the financial health of 
agriculture 
james r donald chairman of the departments world agricultural 
outlook board will review the us and world outlook for 
agriculture 
various commodity briefings and discussions are scheduled for 
wednesday along with rural development and forestry another 
highlight will be usdas formal 1990 outlook for food prices by 
economist ralph r parlett jr 
the concluding meetings on thursday morning will include 
sessions on dairy and farm financial prospects and global trade 
policies yeutter is scheduled to lead discussions on us trade 
negotiations and how those are expected to affect american farmers

increased fivefold from 1984 to 1988 reaching a value of 1738 
million and the report by the departments foreign agricultural 
service says the trend is expected to continue 
the leading foreign suppliers are australia with a 38 percent 
market share thailand 27 percent and the united states 24 
percent 
overall including domestic production pet food sales in japan 
are expected to double in the next five years the report said

food 3593 million fish food 343 million and bird seed 98 
million 
many new pet food products especially upscale gourmet treats 
have been introduced the report said the rapidly 
strengthening yen makes imports more pricecompetitive 
another factor has been the promotion by foreign pet food 
manufacturers who have set up subsidiaries in japan also japan 
eliminated all tariffs on pet food imports on april 1 1989 
japanese pet owners traditionally relied on leftovers to feed 
their pets and have started buying products specifically made for 
pets only in recent years 
by 1987 30 percent of the pet owners in tokyo had purchased 
pet food the report said this compares with more than 70 
percent in the united states and most european countries

president bush may get his chance to test 
whether courts will approve a lineitem veto if housing secretary 
jack kemp has his way 
kemp said sunday he may ask the president to test a lineitem 
veto on housing projects earmarked for funding by congress over the 
administrations opposition 
i am going to do everything i can to make sure that congress 
does not earmark monies including asking the president to perhaps 
test on a lineitem veto those programs which heretofore have just 
been shoved down our throat by congress kemp said on nbcs 
meet the press 
the chief of the department of housing and urban development did 
not say which specific programs would be involved 
on oct 24 bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house 
was seeking legislation on which bush could exercise a lineitem 
veto and then allow the courts to decide whether he acted legally 
fitzwater told reporters at that time we are looking for a 
vehicle that might be a suitable test case but at this point we 
dont have one 
congressional democrats contend that under the constitution 
presidents do not have lineitem veto authority and they have 
vowed to challenge any such move by bush in court 
kemp was questioned about a 42 billion housing initiative 
which bush announced on nov 10 unlike congressional housing 
proposals the presidents program called home ownership 
opportunities for people everywhere or hope would not provide 
any money for new construction of lowincome housing 
kemp said the administration plan concentrates on promoting 
ownership because at the heart of the american experience and 
dream is the desire to own a home and were going to do everything 
we can to reorganize hud with an eye on giving people that chance 
the bush initiative would provide 728 million for the homeless 
to be equally matched by states local government or private 
groups for housing and support services such as social and mental 
health programs 
hud officials have estimated that the united states currently 
has about 600000 homeless people

sens dennis deconcini and alan cranston bear 
more blame than three other senators accused with them of 
improperly intervening with regulators in connection with the 
lincoln savings and loan association a former top regulator says 
edwin j gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board on sunday insisted that the five lawmakers improperly 
pressured him as a favor to lincoln owner charles h keating jr 
they were asking me to withdraw a regulation for their friend 
gray said i said were not going to do that 
two congressional committees are investigating the failure of 
the irvine califbased lincoln sampl which is expected to cost the 
taxpayers up to 25 billion 50 for each american family 
according to rep jim leach riowa 
the five senators intervened with federal regulators in 1987 on 
behalf of lincoln and keating who gave them a total of 13 
million in campaign and other political funds the other three are 
sens john glenn dohio donald w riegle jr dmich and john 
mccain rariz 
all five senators have said they violated no law or rule of the 
senate and they have disputed grays account of the 1987 meetings 
but the senate ethics committee two weeks ago appointed an 
outside counsel to investigate charges that their intervention 
constituted a conflict of interest 
asked on abcs this week with david brinkley whether any of 
the senators were more culpable than others gray said yes 
absolutely senator deconcini who made the proposal who has 
continued to stonewall and deny it and senator cranston who 
received 850000 in corporate donations from keating for three 
voter registration projects he favored after the senators two 1987 
meetings with federal regulators 
meanwhile m danny wall the nations chief savings and loan 
regulator acknowledged on the brinkley show that he made mistakes 
in connection with the massive lincoln sampl failure but said he has 
no plan at this point to resign 
wall head of the office of thrift supervision said he believed 
that as congressional investigations proceed time will indeed be 
kind to us president bush said two weeks ago he had not ruled 
out replacing wall 
mccain and glenn insisted on the brinkley show that they did 
nothing wrong in connection with the lincoln case 
any implication that i have done something wrong in this case 
is just flat wrong and i resent it with every fiber in my being 
glenn said 
mccain said it was a serious mistake on my part to have not 
immediately made reimbursements for trips taken on keatings 
corporate plane but he insisted that inquiries eventually will 
clear him of any rulebreaking 
i did nothing that i wouldnt do for any major employer or 
economic factor in my state mccain said 
according to regulators lincolns money in the form of sampl 
deposits insured by the federal government was lost to an 
elaborate pyramid scheme of phony real estate and other deals 
by keating

the washington areas largest shopping 
mall says it goofed in allowing santa claus to give kids a book 
that offers a rude awakening santa doesnt exist 
its just so absurd the irony of it said linda smyth of 
vienna va a nurse who took her 4yearold son logan to visit 
st nick last week at tysons corner center heres santa handing 
out the one thing saying he doesnt exist 
after at least one mother complained officials at tysons corner 
center pulled the book a pee wee christmas from santas sack 
and replaced it with stickers and fingerprinting kits 
what can i say tysons general manager jim foster told the 
washington post on sunday we screwed up 
foster said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books 
looking for an appropriate one but somehow missed the subplot that 
says santa isnt real 
one of a series about a group of children called the pee wee 
scouts the book relates the tale of a 7yearold named sonny who 
is ridiculed by his friends because he says he believes in santa 
but by the storys end the boy admits he knows the chubby man with 
the white beard and red suit is a fake 
author judy delton who said her series has sold more than 2 
million copies told the post the book was meant for 7 and 
8yearolds and was not intended for a mall santa claus to give 
away to younger children 
last year foster noted dentists objected to the candy canes 
santa gave to youngsters 
you try to pick something thats noncontroversial foster 
said sometimes you just cant win

some top performers of the folk 
music boom returned to the caffe lena to play a few tunes in memory 
of the owner of the coffeehouse that helped launch their careers 
the memorial sunday included performances by loudon wainwright 
iii rosalie sorrells david bromberg and dave van ronk 
the music was filmed for a documentary about the folk music 
shrine and its founder lena spencer who died oct 23 at age 66 
from injuries sustained in a fall 
the onehour documentary for the bbc and pbs will memorialize a 
driving force in folk music said director stephen trombley 
who grew up in nearby ballston spa and now lives in london 
the upstate new york coffeehouse helped launch bob dylans 
career and featured arlo guthrie don mclean and pete seeger 
among the performers sunday was jack landron the first musician 
to play at caffe lena when it opened in 1960 landron dedicated a 
song called a little traveling music to spencer because he 
said some of us think of death as a journey 
such a lasting folk club had to happen somewhere and couldnt 
have happened just anywhere trombley said a lot of places 
wouldnt have accepted lena saratoga springs is a wacky town 
and one of the few places it could have happened 
christine lavin who worked as a waitress at caffe lena in the 
mid1970s said spencers encouragement made her stick with her 
music career spencer occasionally thrust lavin on stage to build 
her confidence she said 
lena thought i had talent and wanted to give me a chance 
said lavin whose performance at the memorial included a 
batontwirling drill 
when i twirled here lena was a nervous wreck because she 
didnt have a lot of extra microphones lavin said but i 
convinced her i had enough control not to smash the mikes 
blues artist rory block said she was thankful spencer never let 
business interfere with who she booked at the club spencer let 
block play in the early 1980s when she wasnt a big enough draw to 
fill the tiny coffeehouse she said 
i never had a financial arrangement with lena said block 
who now has five albums behind her at the end of the night 
whatever she paid me she paid me and she paid performers every 
penny she could afford and probably a little more

accusing nicaragua of sending 
surfacetoair missiles to leftist rebels the rightist government 
has suspended diplomatic and commercial ties with its central 
american neighbor 
president alfredo cristiani made the announcement in a televised 
address sunday a day after military authorities said they 
discovered two light planes in el salvador that were delivering 
shoulderfired missiles to the rebels 
nicaragua denied involvement and suggested such an accusation 
could endanger regional peace 
the nicaraguan president daniel ortega said it gave his people 
honor and pride that a government of assassins of priests and 
religious workers broke relations 
he urged other countries to break ties with el salvadors 
usbacked government until it has punished the assassins 
ortegas was an apparent reference to the nov 16 massacre in el 
salvador of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
at a university other jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army 
troops enter the residence before the killings 
cristiani has ordered an investigation into allegations the 
military was involved the murders occurred in the heat of a rebel 
offensive that turned the capital into a combat zone and was the 
largest of the decadeold civil war 
the government has accused church leaders of sympathizing with 
and even aiding the rebels on sunday authorities arrested an 
american church worker and accused her of storing weapons 
one of the planes that allegedly carried weapons from nicaragua 
crashed saturday in eastern el salvador and troops recovered mostly 
soviet weapons including 25 shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles 
three crewmen died and the fourth committed suicide 
authorities said 
the other plane apparently had its cargo unloaded after landing 
in the southern part of the country and was torched by the crew 
who fled photographers for us news organizations who saw it 
sunday said trenches dug near the plane were filled with burned 
debris 
the three photographers were detained briefly sunday for 
entering the area without government permission 
cristiani told a news conference that relations with nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government would remain suspended until ortega 
stops intervening in el salvador or loses in national elections 
feb 25 
in a statement issued in managua the nicaraguan government 
denied any connection with the two planes 
it quoted foreign minister miguel descoto as saying the 
salvadoran government should think about the seriousness of the 
declarations and actions that the news media are attributing to 
them and about the serious implications in the regional peace 
process 
ortega cristiani and three other central american presidents in 
august signed agreements in tela honduras to demobilize the 
nicaraguan contra rebels by dec 5 and pledged to ban all aid to 
insurgents 
missiles and other weapons said to have been taken from the 
wreckage of the plane that crashed were displayed at cristianis 
news conference introduction of such missiles into the war by the 
rebels would threaten a key government advantage control of the 
air 
as cristiani spoke sounds of renewed fighting automatic 
weapons and exploding rockets could be heard after a pause of 
several days 
later the military said in a statement that an army patrol had 
sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer on the 
northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and c47 warplanes 
chased them as they fled up the slopes of san salvador volcano 
the aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours 
the arrested american was identified as jennifer jean casolo of 
thomaston conn she is a representative of christian educational 
seminar a san antoniobased ecumenical group 
maj mauricio chavez caceres an armed forces spokesman said 
40000 rounds of ammunition for usmade m16 rifles 40000 
rounds of of ammunition for sovietdesigned ak47 rifles 203 
blocks of tnt and 403 detonatorcaps were found at ms casolos 
house during a 2 am raid and at other locations he did not 
specify 
chavez said the arms cache proves church involvement with 
the rebels he did not elaborate 
john blatz a spokesman for the christian educational seminar 
said by telephone that ms casolo has been in el salvador since 
1985 he called the accusations ridiculous and part of their 
the governments persecution of the churches thats clear 
more than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raided 
by security forces since the rebels launched their offensive nov

delonte washington plopped on his 
headphones deftly fingered the computer keyboard and gleefully 
watched as the screen exploded into brightly colored pictures and 
the machine talked about the days reading lesson 
for thirdgrader washington and many other students the time 
spent in the computer laboratory is a favorite part of the school 
day yet regulations for the federal chapter one program bar some 
of his schoolmates from using the same lab because their families 
arent poor enough or theres not enough federal money to serve all 
the eligible children 
barring such use of computer equipment is a waste of material 
and community resources and it doesnt help education in general 
said warren simmons director of instructional support programs for 
prince georges county md 
the money could be stretched farther if you had the 
opportunity to say well if these computers are not being used 
for a certain part of the day then other atrisk kids can use 
them he said 
the frustration felt by simmons and other educators made the 
chapter one program a prime topic of discussion at this falls 
national education summit 
several states report that large numbers of computers 
purchased by federal funds are idle at nigh while adult education 
classes that need them either do without or use scarce tax dollars 
to buy other equipment said a statement signed by president bush 
and representatives of the governors who attended the twoday event 
the federal government spends about 4 billion a year on chapter 
one a program that provides remedial classes teachers and 
equipment to help bring educationally disadvantaged children up to 
par 
clearly by every account chapter one is one of the most 
effective federal programs said michael edwards manager of 
congressional relations for the national education association 
but according to the nea the number of students served in 
chapter one fell from 7 million in 198081 to 57 million in 
198889 while the number of children needing the extra help 
increased to 85 million 
in prince georges county chapter one provides an 8 million 
budget for about 8100 eligible lowincome students the county has 
104000 students 
washington and about 246 other students at langley 
parkmccormick elementary school are chapter one students they 
scored poorly on academic tests and were identified as needing 
educational services to raise their achievement level 
im glad to get the special attention he says 
the computer lab is one of the favorites said jeri taylor 
who oversees the schools program the students always want to 
know is today the day we go to the lab 
like most chapter one schools langley parkmccormick strictly 
follows the rules to identify students and to allow only designated 
children to use its equipment and remedial education material 
that means that computers other educational materials and even 
teachers and assistants can be used only by designated students 
and sometimes are idle 
langley parkmccormick has been able to leap over some of the 
regulation hurdles 
in a school as large as langley parkmccormick with a total 
student body of 681 we have such a large population of chapter 
one kids that we are not as affected as other schools said ms 
taylor 
langley park is one of only two elementary schools in the county 
to be equipped with a stateoftheart ibm computer laboratory 20 
terminals for chapter one children 
last year langley parkmccormick won special permission to use 
the computer lab which was made for the county and is connected 
into one main computer for an evening class of english as a second 
language six hundred adults enrolled

rudolph the rednosed reindeer who turns 50 this year saved 
more than just christmas when he pulled santas sleigh by the light 
of his famous snout he saved his creator robert may from 
financial ruin mays daughter recalls 
my father said that rudolph was the only reindeer in history 
that kept the wolf from the door said virginia herz of novato 
calif it was definitely the highlight of his life 
may was an advertising copywriter for montgomery ward in chicago 
when he invented the little reindeer originally called rollo as 
a promotional gimmick in 1939 
the store handed out millions of copies of the story annually 
until the paper shortages of world war ii it reintroduced rudolph 
in 1946 but gave up the copyright to may the following january 
his daughter said 
it proved a turning point for the may family fortunes 
may had the story commercially published with some success in 
1947 and it was released in 1948 as a 9minute theatrical cartoon 
but it was in 1949 that rudolph really took flight when 
songwriter johnny marks married to mays sister put rudolphs 
story to music and it was recorded by gene autry 
from what i hear it was gene autrys wife who really liked 
the song a lot and encouraged him to sing it herz said 
the song sold millions of copies during the 1949 christmas 
season she said in 1974 it became the basis for an animated 
television special 
rudolphs popularity translated to concrete gains for the mays 
herz said 
the family was able to move from a small apartment to a 
fourbedroom house the house that rudolph built may would 
joke and the copyright residuals paid for college for mays six 
children 
the copyright now is held by a company formed by mays children 
and managed by herz 
before his death in 1976 may donated his original manuscript 
and the original pencil illustrations to dartmouth college which 
he attended his children donated their collection of rudolph 
memorabilia to the schools baker library where it is displayed 
annually 
the display features a largerthanlifesize rudolph statue that 
once graced the may lawn in suburban chicago 
people would drive by and show their kids theres rudolph 
herz said 
for herz sharing childhood with the worlds most famous 
reindeer provided an interesting juxtaposition of real life and 
fantasy 
right after the song came out and rudolph was still in his 
heyday i was still believing in santa claus she said rudolph 
definitely existed for me i just thought my father wrote a story 
about him it was kind of a unique experience 
the rudolph bonanza gave may a feeling of accomplishment he 
hadnt experienced before she said 
being in the montgomery ward ad department all those years 
wasnt really that exciting she said it was a real gift in 
the whole way that wards had given it back to him so it brought 
him a lot of joy 
may was kind of an underdog herz said hence his story of 
the reindeer that gets called names and refused entry into reindeer 
games 
in a way rudolph is almost his story she said

restaurant on dec 8 in honor of sen arlen specter rpa 
specter insisted that the lunch was definitely not 
fundraising and its definitely not political 
the senator was asked whether he had considered avoiding mason 
since mason was cut loose from the mayoral campaign of republican 
rudolph giuliani in september because of remarks about blacks and 
jews 
jackie mason and i have a deal specter replied im not 
going to do any standup comedy and hes not going to advise me on 
arms control reduction or budget matters 
hes a friend of mine specter said everybody gets a rap 
for one thing or another 
mason resigned under pressure as giulianis honorary campaign 
chairman after suggesting in an interview with the village voice 
that jews were supporting black democratic candidate david dinkins 
because of jewish complexes 
mason also called dinkins a fancy shvartze with a mustache 
according to newsweek shvartze is a yiddish word for a black 
person 
mason later apologized saying im a comedian not a 
politician 
despite the flap mason does not plan to curb his interest in 
politics said publicist bobby zarem 
probably from a political point of view there is a question 
in peoples minds about what jackie should or should not be doing 
in politics zarem said but jackies a smart man hes 
interested in what happens to our country and what happens to our 
city 
mason met specter at president bushs inauguration last january 
according to zarem

and larry pressler rsd are frequent participants 
the lunch at elaines is designed so specter can meet people 
in new york in the publishing literary and theater worlds zarem 
said its totally for fun a completely nonpolitical thing 
he said 
the lunch is partly designed by zarem to return a favor zarem 
said 
specter said he helped zarem a longtime baseball fan meet 
philadelphia phillies outfielder len dykstra over the summer zarem 
said he wanted to reciprocate 
the invitation reads the pleasure of your company is 
requested by jackie mason at a luncheon in honor of arlen specter

participation in the pennsylvania society an organization that 
brings together pennsylvania politicians for a weekend in new york

hours after communist authorities 
released him from jail jiri ruml found himself on a frigid 
windswept podium speaking to 300000 czechoslovaks who share his 
desire for democratic reform 
i had dinner in ruzyne last night the underground publisher 
told the rally referring to the prague jail where he was 
imprisoned until his saturday night 
it wasnt the hotel he added noting a nearby hotel of the 
same name 
a chant rose from thousands at the joyous rally what did you 
have 
ruml smiled mine was good since im on a diet it was cherry 
cake and coffee he said as laughter swelled from the throng 
let them communist leaders eat that cake the crowd 
chanted 
cherry cake at the castle put stepan on a diet the 
demonstrators roared in an acerbic reference to the overweight 
miroslav stepan a communist hardliner who resigned as pragues 
party boss saturday and was dumped from the ruling politburo today 
ruml joined other singers and speakers from the czechoslovak 
underground many banned from performances for two decades who 
found their public voices again sunday at the festive rally 
they were recognized by the masses who remembered their works 
and recited their lyrics despite all official efforts at enforced 
forgetting 
alexander dubcek the leader of the failed prague spring refoms 
of 1968 received jubilant applause throughout his speech although 
many listeners admitted being baffled by his thick slovak accent 
and his use of language heavily laden with communist jargon 
the crowd roared in approval as he called on the soviet union 
east germany and bulgaria to join poland and hungary in apologizing 
for participating in the warsaw pact invasion that crushed his 
reforms movement 
our people want the truth without delay and that should be 
one of the first steps of the new central committee he added 
to thunderous applause 
playwright vaclav havel whose works are banned from his country 
and who has spent more than three years in prison since 1979 for 
his opposition to communist rule also was cheered 
a moment of silence settled over the elated throng when the rev 
vaclav maly asked for a moment of silence for pavel wonka a 
dissident who died in jail in 1988 
as premier ladislav adamec appeared before the crowd they 
chanted adamec adamec 
adamec introduced as a guest was invited to address the 
the huge rally after an unprecedented dialogue with opposition 
leaders earlier in the day 
his presence at the rally was a dramatic departure for the 
normally reclusive leadership accustomed over decades to simply 
issuing orders by decree and to addressing crowds carefully 
choreographed to deliver shows of support 
as i said on television last night i will gladly explain my 
opinions and listen to anyone who wants to find a common 
language adamec said 
thank you thank you the crowd roared in response 
but the crowds goodwill quickly turned sour when adamec urged 
the people to shorten a general strike set for today from two hours 
to two minutes 
the plea viewed as an attempt to render the strike meaningless 
drew loud boos and whistles from the crowd

drug dealers owe the state 333 million in 
unpaid taxes and penalties on their pot cocaine and other illegal 
uppers and downers and the revenue department has collected only 
2339296 
but officials say the tax on illegal drug sales does more than 
bring in revenue it gives prosecutors an easytoprove charge that 
can mean a longer prison sentence or a better bargaining position 
when defendants want to plea bargain 
revenue chief ed rolfs whose office made the estimate of how 
much is owed said his agency became more active in trying to 
collect taxes on illegal drugs earlier this year after the 1987 
law survived a legal challenge he said it may collect 500000 
next year 
the prosecutors are using it said david johnson director 
of the kansas bureau of investigation prosecutors i think take 
it very seriously and i know law enforcement takes it very 
seriously 
at least 18 other states have taxes of some kind on illegal 
drugs according to the council of state governments in lexington 
ky 
and as of october west virginia connecticut massachussetts 
and michigan were considering similar measures according to the 
council 
under the kansas law dealers are taxed 100 on each ounce of 
marijuana 200 on each gram of cocaine or controlled substance 
sold by weight and 2000 for 50 doses of drugs sold by dose 
usually prescription drugs obtained illegally 
the law provides that a dealer who pays the tax will get a tax 
stamp to put on his bags bottles and vials the stamps are plain 
2inchsquare stickers green for marijuana blue for controlled 
substances sold by weight and red for controlled substances sold by 
dose 
so far only eight people have bought a total of 377 stamps 
worth a total of 415550 and most of the buyers are probably 
stamp collectors officials said 
the state assesses people for taxes when it is notified of drug 
busts it has made 291 such assessments since the law went into 
effect and collected 1923746 in back taxes and penalties 
the 1987 law prohibits the disclosure of the names of people who 
buy the stamps a provision designed to protect a persons right 
against selfincrimination dealers are liable for the tax and an 
equal amount in penalties and can be sentenced up to five years in 
prison and fined another 10000 
the idea is to try to make it more costly to be in that 
business said rolfs who cosponsored the kansas legislation 
rolfs said the amount collected is small because local and 
federal law enforcement agencies already have the right to seize 
property used in dealing drugs nola foulston a prosecutor in 
wichita said some people caught dealing drugs dont have much to 
seize 
its like squeezing blood out of a turnip sometimes she 
said 
supporters of the law like to say that gangster al capone went 
to prison for tax evasion not racketeering or murder but some 
prosecutors only infrequently use the drug tax law in their cases 
ms foulston said her office had filed tax charges in about 20 
of the 600 drug cases it has handled this year her office has 
three lawyers working on drug cases she said and they dont have 
time to document and file tax charges each time someone is arrested 
district attorney nick tomasic in kansas city said he doesnt 
use the law because most of the people he prosecutes in drug cases 
are smalltime criminals 
its not like theyve got a big house we can seize or a big 
car we can seize he said they end up with a courtappointed 
attorney 
last year defendants in topeka and neighboring osage county 
challenged the law saying that paying taxes for drugs would be 
tantamount to violating their right against selfincrimination 
guaranteed by the fifth amendment two state district court judges 
agreed 
the state supreme court upheld the law as constitutional in 
march the justices unanimously ruled that the law contained 
sufficient protections and labeled the defendants fears merely 
trifling or imaginary hazards 
according to the council of state governments the other states 
with such taxes are alabama arizona colorado florida idaho 
illinois maine maryland minnesota montana nevada new mexico 
north carolina north dakota rhode island texas utah and wyoming

mayor jeffrey s book longtime 
democratic party activist and michael dukakis delegate at the 1988 
national convention has joined the republican tide rolling across 
the state 
i have to focus on whats real book said ive gotten 
older and more conservative i was a democrat because i perceived 
that party to be the most effective party for what i wanted to 
accomplish 
i am now a republican for the same reason said book a 
harvardeducated politician who last month at age 30 was reelected 
to his second twoyear term without opposition 
his central florida city has only about 7000 residents but 
books switch last month was big news among politicians statewide 
because of his activity on a number of local state and national 
democratic groups 
such switches provide a big boost to the gops goal of making 
florida its first majority state in the south since reconstruction 
said state party chairman van poole 
any time we get an elected official to switch he usually has 
a following that stops and thinks poole said 
democrats are hoping to reverse that trend when they meet at a 
party convention this weekend in hollywood 
the 1980s have been filled with victories for republicans in 
florida in 1980 there were 3087427 registered democrats and 
1429645 republicans as of two weeks ago there were 3063673 
democrats and 2298005 republicans 
were getting four out of every five new people who 
register said gop state spokesman stan smith 
the 1988 elections were a new highwater mark george bush 
enjoyed his widest margin in florida republican connie mack picked 
up a us senate seat two republicans were elected to the state 
cabinet for the first time and the party gained three us house 
seats 
since then us rep bill grant switched parties giving the 
gop a majority for the first time in floridas congressional 
delegation at least 40 state officeholders have changed parties 
after democratic rep claude peppers death at age 88 
republican ileana roslehtinen won a special election in august for 
the seat pepper held for the democrats since 1962 
we continue to climb and theyre in an airplane in a tailspin 
they cant pull out of poole said 
next years florida elections will have farreaching effects 
gov bob martinez struggling in the polls will try to become the 
first twoterm republican governor in recent florida history while 
the party tries to cinch another postreconstruction first for the 
south control of the florida state senate the republicans can do 
it if they win four new seats 
the legislature will draw new boundaries after the 1990 
elections florida one of the nations fastestgrowing states 
will gain at least three congressional seats and possibly four 
after the 1990 census 
pooles opposite number cubanborn attorney simon ferro of 
coral gables said the democrats can reverse the trend quickly by 
defeating martinez next year 
we foresee there will be a halt and then a swing back in 1990 
and 1991 ferro said the governorship constitutes a very 
substantial advantage to a party when it comes to maintaining the 
focus of the people on party politics 
the democrats opposing martinez include us rep bill nelson 
state sen george stuart and alcee l hastings the recently 
impeached federal judge 
democratic leaders are trying to head off a divisive primary by 
rallying early behind nelson a onetime space shuttle passenger 
they see as having the diverse appeal needed in florida 
nelson has concentrated early on conservative southern democrats 
who have been voting republican in statewide elections the 
democrats say they can win them back republicans say the 
democratic registration majority exists on paper only 
divisiveness has hurt the democrats however ferro himself won 
the party chairmanship in a tense backroom battle with former us 
rep kenneth mackay who narrowly lost the 1988 senate race to mack 
book said ferros defeat of mackay was the final straw in his 
decision to switch parties mackay a fiscal conservative with a 
pristine record on ethics was clearly the best choice to get the 
party turned around book said 
mackay now the state campaign chairman said democrats still 
represent the true beliefs of most floridians 
a lot of it is not ideology theyve been turning away because 
they think weve lost our vitality mackay said

the tokyo stock exchanges key index rose to its 
fourth consecutive record high closing today while the dollar 
declined against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 39706 points or 109 
percent closing at 3688153 the previous record was 3648447 
set friday when the index climbed 19755 points 
dealers attributed the continued rise to stabilized external 
factors such as foreign exchange rates and prospects for lower us 
interest rates 
the us federal reserve board recently lowered the nations 
federal funds rate a shortterm lending rate between commercial 
banks 
normally trading on the last day of the month is inactive 
but today it was different said yutaka yoshino a trader with 
nikko securities co 
he said todays trading was very active as investors expected 
further rises in the index for their december transactions which 
start tuesday 
investors bought a wide variety of issues including steel 
shipbuilding and trading house shares yoshino said 
recent democratization in eastern europe also encouraged 
buying because many investors think such changes in the eastern 
bloc will provide them more business opportunities he said 
an estimated 1 billion shares changed hands on the first section 
monday up from fridays 900 million 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14335 yen down 045 
yen from last fridays 14380yen finish it opened at 14318 yen 
and ranged between 14305 yen and 14338 yen 
dollaryen dealing was inactive in tokyo as trading was 
dominated by buying of the west german mark said minori takeuchi 
a chemical bank trader 
the dollar opened lower in tokyo following a similar downswing 
overseas as market players sold dollars to buy the west german 
currency 
west germany is expected to become a major beneficiary of the 
recent moves toward democracy and economic reform in eastern europe 
shortly before the market closed the japan broadcasting corp 
reported that the united states may announce plans for a troop 
reduction in europe but ms takeuchi said it would have little 
impact on the market 
in the past market players have bought dollars on rumors of 
us arms reductions 
if you only look at the defense budget the arms reduction in 
europe may improve the us deficit ms takeuchi said but 
what are military personnel going to do after they return to 
america that may increase the unemployment rate in the united 
states and that does not necessarily improve the situation

clyde rabideau saw horsedrawn wagons 
deliver grain to his downtown elevator never required his 
customers to sign contracts and occasionally loaned them money 
after 52 years in the grain business rabideau has decided to 
retire and close his elevator 
im 78 its time to go said rabideau who knows it wont 
be easy to leave its rough 
he glanced anxiously at his watch reached for his old portable 
radio and at precisely 150 pm turned it on 
the announcer read the days highs lows and closing prices for 
corn soybeans and wheat rabideau recorded the numbers in his 
ledger as he has done for decades 
the ritual soon will end perhaps as early as dec 1 
when the last grain stored at the elevator has been sold 
rabideau will put the radio back on the corner of his desk return 
the ledgers to the huge steel vault and walk away 
this elevator was built in 1918 so it was built for the horse 
and buggy he said 
rabideau grain is a rural island in downtown kankakee a 
northwestern illinois city of 100000 
when the elevator opened it was perfect for the single grain 
wagons pulled by tractors or an occasional team of horses 
it just wasnt made for these 500bushel trucks said 
rabideau they cant get into the driveway very well and the 
traffic right downtown is terrible 
rabideau was born on a farm near clifton in 1911 but decided 
early that life on the land was not for him 
there was no money in it and way too much work he said 
he worked four years at a hospital and attended gallagher 
business school for a year it was mary gallagher who sent him to 
see claude carter at the grain elevator for a job 
rabideau was paid 15 a week 
i tell that to people now and they think it just cant be 
so he said but working on the farm meant working for 10 
or 15 a month 
buying and selling grain was only part of the business 
we did grinding of corn and oats for dairy cattle plus mixing 
hog and poultry feed rabideau recalled 
in 1972 he bought the business from carter 
his customers were his friends a handshake was his bond 
we made many contracts these past 52 years said rabideau 
we never had one of them signed by any customer 
only twice in half a century did that cause a problem 
once in a while some of our customers would need a few 
hundred dollars said rabideau if we were in a position to 
help out we would 
through the years retired farmers have stopped in the elevator 
office to chat with rabideau and other friends and neighbors 
in the end we were buying grain from their children and 
grandchildren he said 
most of the grain delivered to rabideau was sold to processors 
in the area 
rabideau will take some mementos with him the brass 
thermometer on the wall and his old brass grain probe 
and he will take something even more valuable 
ive had and still have many fond memories of working with 
our farmers he said theyre a grand bunch of honest and 
hardworking people

the mother and friends of an american 
church activist arrested in el salvador denied the accusations of 
salvadoran police that she had hidden explosives and ammunition for 
leftist guerrillas 
jennifer is working for the church said audrey casolo the 
mother of 28yearold jennifer j casolo she is working to help 
the poor people 
salvadoran police on sunday arrested ms casolo and seized a 
cache of ammunition they said was buried under her house in san 
salvador police briefly exhibited ms casolo for reporters sunday 
but she was not provided an opportunity to comment 
ms casolo of thomaston is a representative of the christian 
educational seminar an ecumenical group based in san antonio 
texas that provides tours of el salvador to visiting americans 
sen christopher j dodd dconn said he was assured by the 
salvadoran ambassador in washington dc that ms casolo would 
not be harmed 
maj mauricio chavez caceres an salvadoran armed forces 
spokesman said 40000 rounds of ammunition for usmade m16 
rifles 40000 rounds of ammunition for sovietdesigned ak47 
rifles 203 blocks of tnt and 403 detonator caps were found in ms 
casolos house and at other locations 
chavez said the cache proves church involvement with the 
farabundo marti national liberation front the guerrillas of el 
salvador salvadoran authorities said they were tipped off to the 
arms cache by a rebel deserter 
friends noted that ms casolos arrest came amid a wave of 
harassment and arrests of church workers of various denominations 
in el salvador six jesuit priestprofessors were slain nov 16 and 
witnesses said the military was involved 
since her 1983 graduation from brandeis university ms casolo 
has worked with the church and the poor after receiving her degree

kitchen in chicago and taught english to refugees in maryland

government officials they would go to refugee camps the 
cooperatives they had down there from the left to the right she 
tried to give the delegations a real feel for what was going on in 
el salvador 
another friend of ms casolo from new haven who once worked 
with her in el salvador said she suspects the ammunition was 
planted by agents of the salvadoran government 
theyre trying to frame her to justify the actions taken by 
the military against international church workers in the last two 
weeks said the friend ann lutterman theyre trying to imply 
that churches are responsible for the violence which is 
ludicrous 
john blatz a spokesman for the christian educational seminar 
called the accusations against ms casolo part of their 
persecution of the churches thats clear 
at times family and friends have wanted ms casolo to return to 
united states but ms casolo felt she had a calling among the

city governments are willing to be soldiers in 
the battle against drugs but need more than just fighting words 
from the bush administration mayors attending an annual conference 
said 
mayor terry goddard of phoenix president of the national league 
of cities said sunday the federal government must do more to fight 
illegal drugs viewed by americans as the gravest problem facing 
the country 
and yet weve heard all the rhetoric we heard drug czar 
william bennett make all the right analyses and then the mountain 
labored and out came a mouse there were no new resources no new 
commitment to fight drugs goddard said at the conference 
attended by 5000 officials 
the federal government needs to step in said seattle mayor 
charles royer give me a break about the federal governments 
money just because they print it doesnt mean they earn it 
with such a large chunk of federal tax being funneled into 
defense it is hard to get funding for local programs royer said 
mayor andrew young a former us ambassador to the united 
nations said major cuts in military spending wont come soon 
despite the improved relations between the united states and the 
soviet union and the growing independence of eastern europe 
a 5 percent cut in military spending may be realistic but i 
dont see a drastic dismantling of the military empire young 
said we must wait and see if the changes are maintained we were 
doing pretty well in china and all of a sudden they clamped down 
young said the lack of federal resources to resolve domestic 
problems is rooted in the lack of decisive national leadership 
the problem with washington is that nobody will make a decision 
about anything he said 
cleveland mayor george voinovich said that inadequate public 
education is the root of the drug problem somehow we have to 
get these kids as early as we can and teach them not to use 
drugs he said 
when i was elected in 1977 crack was not even in our 
vocabulary now it is the symbol of a lost generation of 
people who are not safe on the streets royer said 
vice president dan quayle canceled a scheduled address today due 
to a death in his family jack kemp secretary for housing and

former president carter said the ethiopian 
government and eritrean rebels invited former tanzanian president 
julius k nyerere to help mediate talks to end 28 years of civil 
war 
the accord marks the end of preliminary negotiations between the 
two sides that should lead to substantive talks to stop the war 
carter told the atlanta constitution in an interview published 
today 
the decision to invite nyerere to join him as cochairman of the 
main talks was the last of 12 items on the agenda for preliminary 
talks carter said during a diplomatic shuttle mission through 
sudan and ethiopia 
although the preliminary talks in nairobi almost broke down 
twice both sides got what they wanted by saturday carter 
said all that remains is to name observers to the main talks he 
said 
carter said it may be several weeks before a decision is made on 
the time and place of the talks because the government and eritrean 
peoples liberation front delegates must confer with leaders at 
home 
delegates from both sides agreed on most negotiating issues two 
months ago in atlanta and resumed the talks in nairobi to conclude 
the preliminary talks carter said 
carter said he expects nyerere who has been traveling in the 
far east to accept the invitation he has indicated in the past 
that he would if the invitation came from both sides and not just 
from me carter said 
while the negotiating teams took a break sunday carter flew 
through sudan and ethiopia 
he met for 90 minutes in khartoum with sudanese president omar 
hassan ahmed bashir whose government will begin preliminary peace 
talks with rebels in southern sudan on friday carter helped 
arrange the talks to help end sudans civil war but will not be 
directly involved 
in addis ababa carter met with ethiopian president mengistu 
haile mariam and three members of the sudan peoples liberation 
army the sudanese rebels whose headquarters is in ethiopias 
capital 
carter who initiated the eritrean peace talks said he was 
pleased with their progress but cautioned 
there were a couple of times when the talks almost broke up 
when one side or the other announced that they were leaving there 
is still a lot of misunderstanding a lot of mistrust

james a bivens was convicted in march of poaching 1088 eggs 
he was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined 500 plus 100 for 
each egg taken from the beach on singer island the fine amounts to 
109300 
in court documents bivens attorney argued that the fine is 
illegal because state law allows a judge to levy a 100 fine per 
unit of marine life 
but when does marine life begin 
an egg according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes a 
life when it is hatched is not a turtle assistant public 
defender louis carres wrote hence the universal question which 
came first the chicken or the egg 
bivens is appealing the county court fine to circuit court last 
week a threejudge panel set jan 18 for oral arguments 
prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new to 
them but ridiculous nevertheless 
if you kill an egg its not going to become a turtle 
obviously said barbara schroeder sea turtle recovery 
coordinator for the state department of natural resources

loyola university barred a student group from 
meeting on campus unless it reverses its support of womens right 
to choose abortion and to use contraception 
the womens center at the roman catholic school cannot be 
recognized as an official student group if it insists on advocating 
abortion rights and contraception said university spokesman joseph 
marren 
its a freedom of speech issue the antichoice position is 
clearly represented on campus said david gandolfo a womens 
center member 
he said the womens center was founded on campus in 1978 and had 
its constitution approved by the administration in 1982 
the catholic church teaches that abortion is murder and forbids 
the use of artificial contraceptive devices 
on one occasion loyola officials stopped the group from 
distributing illinois public health department packets on aids 
each of which included a condom 
the dispute follows controversies at other catholic universities 
this fall over publication of an advertisement in student 
newspapers urging attendance at nov 10 abortionrights rallies 
at marquette university in milwaukee the business manager for 
student publications was fired for running the ad and two students 
were suspended from their posts on the newspaper staff 
student editors at georgetown university in washington dc 
refused to publish an edition of the school newspaper when they 
were barred from running the ad 
the ad ran in the student newspaper at the catholic university 
also in washington prompting protests from antiabortion advocates 
and a critical letter to the editor from a university official

the public has become too complacent about 
educating people to prevent the spread of aids according to a 
study that shows the gay community alone has taken the threat 
seriously 
the report by the citizens commission on aids released today 
urges vigorous new educational programs to boost aids prevention 
which the group says is hampered by continuing public 
misconceptions about the disease 
a basic assumption for prevention methods has been to scare 
people to death and theyll change their behavior said carol 
levine the commissions director aids prevention is much more 
complicated than that 
the report says education has stemmed the spread of aids in the 
gay community but it points to the growing number of adolescents 
and nondrugusing women infected with hiv the virus that causes 
aids as evidence that educational efforts do not reach all those 
at risk 
the report attacks what it labels 10 myths about aids such as 
aids education for drug users is a waste of time and money 
because they are unconcerned about their health 
another myth the report says is that if people are given 
accurate information they will change their attitudes and 
behavior 
for example levine said the dangers of smoking have been known 
for decades but smoking has only begun to decrease in recent years 
we dont have that amount of time or else well lose a 
tremendous amount of our young people she said of the aids 
epidemic 
the report offers facts and recommendations to counter commonly 
held misconceptions as well as examples of successful education 
programs 
the commission is a private independent group that was formed 
in july 1987

in defining his own vision of a communism that 
works mikhail s gorbachev has endorsed a humane socialism 
that he insists might even have to adopt traits of modern 
capitalism to stay relevant 
in the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation with 
capitalism we clearly underestimate the importance of much that 
has been done by humanity over the centuries the soviet 
president said in remarks published sunday 
the new face of socialism is its human face this fully 
corresponds to the thought of marx gorbachev said in the 
communist party daily pravda because its creation is the chief 
goal of restructuring we can with full justification say we are 
building humanitarian socialism 
he said achievements attained under capitalism like equality 
of all before the law and general prosperity should not be 
dismissed because of ideology 
gorbachev also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they 
lack a clear blueprint citing the precedent of soviet founder 
vladimir lenin 
there is a deepseated belief that lenin supposedly had a 
completed program for the development of socialism in our country 
but in fact he had no such completed program he said 
in czechoslovakia the latest east bloc country in political 
upheaval alexander dubcek the leader of the 1968 prague 
spring reform movement that was crushed by soviet tanks read 
gorbachevs remarks as proof of the kremlin leaders support for 
change in east europe 
for communists the wording socialism with a human face is 
inseparably linked with dubcek and the prague spring 
gorbachev has declared his support before for economic and 
social change in eastern europe but by appropriating dubceks 
words he made his point dramatically 
some in prague took gorbachevs comments as a public admission 
that the 1968 invasion which led to dubceks overthrow was a 
mistake the soviet union has not yet renounced the invasion as it 
has the 1979 invasion of afghanistan 
as recently as last year the kremlin was vigorously defending 
the intervention in czechoslovakia as necessary to block 
antisocialist forces soviets also avoided any comparisons 
between what dubcek tried to do and gorbachevs reforms the 
difference is 20 years foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov once said laconically 
pravda said the 2page article was a synthesis of gorbachevs 
recent thoughts on the future of socialism and his own program for 
perestroika or reconstruction of the economy and society 
the soviet leaders major theme seemed to be that socialism must 
modernize even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary or risk 
becoming irrelevant he offered no quick answers but said the 
process would take years into the 21st century 
he defended the 1917 revolution that brought the communists to 
power in the former russian empire as a worldhistorical 
breakthrough to the future but said socialism has often been 
perverted since 
for the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism human 
individuality was ignored the development of the personality was 
slowed he said

jim and tammy ministries held its last 
church service at a shopping center and supporters said they plan 
to meet in the future at an unnamed hotel 
a ministry spokesman said sunday that supporters wanted to keep 
the location secret because they are tired of walking through 
reporters and television cameras to get to church 
earlier this month the ministry reached an agreement with its 
landlord to move out of the shoppers world plaza by thursday 
stewart gilman owner of the plaza said sunday he did not know 
where the ministry would go 
tammy faye bakker who led several services this month at the 
shopping center was visiting her husband at a rochester minn 
federal prison sunday 
jim bakker is serving a 45year sentence after being convicted 
of fraud and conspiracy charges connected with the nowdefunct ptl 
ministry 
reporters were kept out of sundays services but listened 
through the door as about 40 people worshiped inside

hardly anyone showed up at a 
thanksgiving party for the poor but a food bank will distribute the 
hundreds of pounds of leftovers 
caterer john kostik said he had hoped to serve at least 700 
needy people at his banquet hall in this pittsburgh suburb 
thursday twentyfour showed up fewer than the 35 volunteers who 
offered to help serve the food 
after his plight was publicized kostik and his wife jane both 
40 gave out food to about 80 people friday but still had about 200 
pounds of turkey 210 pounds of potatoes 60 cases of bulk corn and 
more than 200 pumpkin pies left 
kostik said his use of the word needy on the flyers may have 
discouraged some people in the neighborhood home to many 
unemployed former steelworkers and senior citizens from showing 
up 
we dont have a lot of street people in east pittsburgh he 
said this is a quiet depressed area with a population that is 
too proud to ask for help 
kostik said he mailed dozens of public service announcements 
about the feast which cost him 1000 to newspapers and 
television and radio stations but apparently none were used 
volunteers posted flyers throughout the neighborhood but that 
didnt help either 
kostick said he was disappointed at the turnout 
i was left with a real empty feeling but the media attention 
helped us after the fact he said 
the greater pittsburgh community food bank will distribute the 
leftovers to poor families said joyce rothermel the groups

swiss voters rejected an attempt to abolish the 
countrys army by the year 2000 but the measure won much more 
support than expected in what one pacifist called a slap in the 
face of the establishment 
the government tried to put on a brave face after 1052218 
voters or 356 percent of those who cast ballots voted in favor 
of the proposed constitutional amendment that stated simply 
switzerland has no army opposed were 644 percent 1903797 
voter turnout sunday was 69 percent the highest for a 
referendum since the 1971 measure that gave women the right to 
vote the antiarmy vote was well above the 30 percent predicted by 
polls 
the government had urged voters to reject the proposal saying a 
credible defense policy is vital to guarantee the countrys 
independence and neutrality 
defense minister kaspar villiger said he would set up a panel to 
analyze criticisms voiced about the 625000strong army and 
attributed the strong antiarmy vote to the relaxation of tension 
which happily dominates the international scene 
supporters were stunned 
the result is unbelievable said andreas gross spokesman 
for the coalition of pacifists and leftwing groups that collected 
the 100000 signatures necessary to force the referendum it is a 
slap in the face for the establishment 
if 500000 people can bring changes in prague then the high 
proportion of yes votes should give the swiss government food for 
thought he said referring to the prodemocracy movement in 
czechoslovakia 
the social democratic party describing the vote as 
sensational called for an examination of defense policies as 
a priority the law should be changed to allow conscientious 
objectors to perform civilian duties a statement from the party 
said 
eugen luethy chief of general staff admitted the size of the 
antiarmy vote had exceeded his expectations but declared the 
result provided a continuing solid basis for the armed forces 
the vote followed weeks of impassioned debate rare in normally 
reserved switzerland 
many swiss were shocked that the countrys centuriesold 
military tradition should be called into question by the proposal 
even though switzerland has not fought in a foreign war since 
1515 it can field more men per square mile than any other country 
in the world but israel 
switzerland has more artillery pieces than neighboring west 
germany and a fleet of battle tanks half that of france 
the defense ministry says military defense costs 31 billion 
annually army opponents say costs are nearer 63 billion taking 
into account salaries in defenserelated areas and the cost to 
privatesector employers of releasing staff for the annual callup 
currently every swiss man is required to do military service 
starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20 followed by 13 
callups of two to three weeks until age 50 
in a bid to relieve pressure on the countrys tight labor 
market the defense ministry this year announced reforms to end 
military service at the age of 42 by 1995 
supporters of the army maintain that switzerlands defense 
tactics spared the country the horrors of involvement in world war 
ii 
others argue that switzerland stayed neutral because it curried 
hitlers favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to the 
germans

the muchmaligned donkey is making a 
comeback in texas and other states where ranchers know that 
coyotes keep their distance when the stubborn beasts are making 
asses of themselves 
its the deliberate disposition of the donkey and the 
animals innate dislike of canines that makes it useful guarding 
goats and sheep against coyotes and other predators said rancher 
nanci falley 
state officials say the donkey guard an oldtime form of 
protection is enjoying a resurgence on ranches around the country 
its such a natural thing for a donkey said ms falley who 
also sells the guard animals its not something that requires 
training they have a natural instinct to run dogs and coyotes out 
of their territory 
a wellplaced kick from an angry donkey also known as the 
burro or ass is usually enough to drive away any predator 
experts say 
ranchers have known this for years but a new environmental 
consciousness has helped promote the use of predator controls like 
guard animals instead of poisons that can enter the food chain the 
low price of the donkeys doesnt hurt either 
prices range from 75 to 135 for females and 20 to 60 for 
males about 1800 of the animals currently stand sentry on texas 
ranches 
groups such as the montanabased american council of spotted 
asses have been promoting the use of the animals in other states as 
well 
the texas department of agriculture includes donkeys as well as 
guard mules and llamas in a comprehensive predator control program 
it launched in 1988 the program also employs traps lights sirens 
and propane cannons to frighten away coyotes and wild dogs 
texas leads the nation in raising sheep with 19 million and 
angora goats with 15 million the texas wool and mohair 
industries were worth a combined 66 million last year officials 
said but ranchers lost about 9 million worth of livestock to 
predators coyotes are blamed for more than half the damage 
thats where the donkeys come in 
ranchers put a donkey out to forage with a herd soon the donkey 
adopts the flock as its own and begins defending it against 
coyotes and other canines 
the best way to choose a guard donkey is to let the animal get 
acquainted with its herd then introduce a dog into its pen to see 
if it repels the canine 
if the mule or donkey shows aggressive behavior toward the 
dog then youve got a good guard donkey said andy feild 
predator management specialist for the texas agriculture department 
some ranchers report more success with jennies or female 
donkeys and geldings neutered males some jacks or intact males 
are overly aggressive with their herds 
but ms falley has raised donkeys for 23 years and said she 
doesnt believe good guarding is a sexually determined trait 
i would say about 85 percent make real good guards she said 
as she stood in a corral with donkeys mary ann rachel hickory 
jackson and dandy 
though the donkey of fable is obstinate and stupid ms falley 
an inspector for the american donkey and mule society 
characterizes the animals as wise and regal 
they dont hurry they do things in their own time she 
said petting a monthold burro she calls little toot 
ms falley said she began relying on donkeys to protect her 
goats and chickens after she moved to her ranch in lockhart 
northeast of san antonio in the 1960s and found that predators 
considered her livestock groceries

the shiite moslem extremist group hezbollah 
has established a network of operatives in west africa that may be 
preparing attacks against western targets a newspaper reported 
today 
hezbollah agents are active in the ivory coast senegal gabon 
zaire and possibly other countries the los angeles times reported 
citing unidentified us and french officials 
as western intelligence agencies have focused on iran and 
lebanon hezbollah may have moved to create an alternative arms 
network in west africa as early as 1986 the newspaper said 
french authorities believe a hezbollah cell played a prominent 
role in planting a bomb aboard a french airliner that exploded 
over niger in september killing 171 people 
tehrans reach now extends into hezbollah communities in west 
africa and it seeks to duplicate there what it did in lebanon a 
us official said 
the proiran hezbollah or party of god has claimed 
responsibility for taking western hostages and terrorist bombings 
in lebanon 
on saturday spanish police said a hezbollah cell had tried to 
smuggle 18 pounds of plastic explosives into spain according to 
the newspaper it said 10 people were arrested in a plot to attack 
targets in europe 
in recent months french officials have discovered security 
breaches at their embassies in guinea gabon senegal and tunisia 
involving the sale of passports and intelligence cables to 
hezbollah agents the newspaper said 
in the most serious incident a french consular official in 
conakry guinea provided 100 identity cards and 60 passports to a 
shiite cell the times said the scheme surfaced when a lebanese 
national carrying one of the passports blew himself up with a 
homemade bomb in london last summer french diplomats told the 
newspaper 
in dakar senegal officials reportedly caught a french embassy 
employee selling french identity cards to another group of 
lebanese and in brazzaville gabon where the doomed uta french 
airline flight originated a security breach involved stolen 
diplomatic cables the newspaper said 
most of the french consular officials involved were contract 
workers who had served in beirut or had lebanese connections 
french officials said several were arrested 
we dont believe the cells are being created to destabilize 
the countries they are in said a french official but all 
these countries offer bases for operations against the west 
they are in the courtyard of europe and security is 
notoriously lax in west africa the official said 
intelligence officials suspect the agents operate among tens of 
thousands of shiite muslim emigres who work in the region a state 
department source told the times there was no evidence that iran 
has sponsored the implantation of the cells

christian army commander michel aoun 
today rejected a 48hour ultimatum by the new president and said he 
would die fighting for lebanons honor 
military sources denied reports that gen aouns force and 
president elias hrawis backers were massing troops 
there is absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a 
collision is imminent the fronts are as they have been since the 
sept 22 ceasefire one ranking officer said on condition of 
anonymity 
aoun in an interview on french television said i shall 
defend myself and the free christian areas to the last man i 
shall be in the forward lines of my troops and shall die fighting 
for lebanons honor 
i do not recognize mr hrawi his election under syrian 
occupation is unconstitutional aoun said the interview are also 
broadcast by christian radio stations 
hrawi elected by parliament friday to replace assassinated 
leader rene mouawad told reporters sunday he would not permit the 
existence of two rival governments in lebanon and said he would 
replace aoun as army commander within 48 hours 
if he stays i must say with much regret that he will have 
to bear the consequences hrawi said at his temporary 
headquarters in east lebanons syriancontrolled bekaa valley town 
of chtoura 
hrawi 64 sacked aoun as head of an interim military cabinet on 
saturday but the measure was a mere formality because aoun still 
controls the military and has ignored the order 
he still is general of the army perhaps for no more than 48 
hours after which if he stays he will become an officer of this 
army hrawi said 
hrawi pledged to rule from the traditional seat of lebanons 
maronite heads of state in suburban baabda east of beirut where 
aoun has set up his command in the bunker of the shellbattered 
presidential palace hrawi and aoun are both maronites 
whatever is left of baabda even if it is one room when his 
situation is over it will be my residence hrawi said 
that touched off reports that an attack was imminent and that 
the syrian army was moving in reinforcements to evict aoun from the 
hilltop baabda palace five miles east of beirut 
christian and moslem military sources reported no troop movement 
a ceasefire called by the arab league sept 22 halted six 
months of savage artillery battles across beirut between aouns 
20000 troops and the syrian army killing at least 930 people by 
police count 
hrawis aides say he is counting on the appointment of a new 
army commander to shake the troops loyalty to aoun 
aoun has rejected an arab leaguebrokered peace plan approved by 
lebanons parliament in taif saudi arabia last month because it 
fails to provide for a total syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
syria maintains 40000 troops controlling 70 percent of lebanon 
under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate aoun contends the 
syrians have become an occupying force because they sided with the 
moslems in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the taif accord which hrawi has pledged to carry out provides

president in hopes his opposition national party would reverse 
three decades of economic decline in this oncerich south american 
nation 
in montevideo a marxist doctor easily defeated all rivals to 
become mayor of the countrys capital and largest city 
eight hours after polls closed sunday the interior ministry had 
issued tallies from more than half of the 8493 voting districts 
that gave sen lacalle a comfortable lead 
lacalle who will take office march 1 has pledged to work with 
people of all political stripes in reforming uruguays 
statedominated economy and easing its foreign debt burden he 
pledged to build a governing coalition 
on the basis of party and independent tallies jorge batlle of 
the governing colorado party the son and grandnephew of 
presidents acknowledged his bid had failed 
the future president will be sen lacalle to whom i offer my 
most sincere congratulations and best wishes for success in his 
term said batlle a 62yearold senator who ran unsuccessfully 
for president in 1966 and 1971 
according to the interior ministry the national party received 
430846 votes or 398 percent compared with 325879 or 307 
percent for the colorados the leftist broad front coalition 
finished third with 168830 votes 
the rest of the vote was split among six smaller parties about 
232 million voters or 80 percent of those registered took part 
in the mandatory balloting election officials said 
lacalle 48 in brief comments to reporters at his partys 
headquarters said his would be a government of national unity 
after accepting the congratulations of broad fronts presidential 
candidate retired gen liber seregni lacalle said he would issue 
a public statement later today 
lacalles party which last held executive power in 1967 was 
expected to receive the biggest bloc but not a majority in the 
30seat senate and 99member house of deputies

privileged an exultant vazquez told several thousand cheering 
supporters outside his partys headquarters

martins 37 a clothing wholesaler the next step is national 
power if we govern well here the rest of the country will 
support us 
in campaigning to replace president julio m sanguinetti who 
was elected in november 1984 and took office in march 1985 to 
replace a military dictatorship lacalle focused on uruguays 
economy 
under sanguinetti unemployment dropped from 14 percent to about 
9 percent and the deficit was halved to about 45 percent of gross 
national product 
but inflation refused to go below 57 percent payments on the 
63 billion foreign debt cut sharply into public programs and 
standards of living continued to decline 
i think were the same as we were four years ago and some 
people are worse off than before said jorge de melo a 
26yearold metalworker 
when we look at the outside world there have been tremendous 
advances said marcos larghero 47 a graphic designer the 
opposite has occurred here we deteriorate a little bit each year 
lacalle made no promises that uruguay would soon take its place 
among the worlds wealthier nations as it was for the first half 
of this century 
but he said inflation would decrease to 20 percent exports 
would increase by 20 percent to 2 billion a year and unemployment 
would continue to decline throughout his fiveyear term 
to resolve the foreign debt lacalle proposed to sell some of 
uruguays 3 million ounces of gold reserves and buy investments 
that would generate interest to help pay the debt 
lacalle has pledged to sell inefficient public companies cut 
federal bureaucracy and encourage foreign investment

defense secretary dick cheney said 
no us troops will be withdrawn from europe without a superpower 
agreement on conventional arms the dutch government said today 
the comment followed news reports that quoted cheney as saying 
more troop reductions have been made possible by the continued 
erosion of the soviet military threat in europe he reportedly 
said this during his flight to the netherlands from washington 
cheney who was scheduled to travel to brussels for an annual 
meeting of north atlantic treaty organization defense ministers 
was not immediately available for comment 
the dutch defense minister relus ter beek quoted cheney as 
saying he expected the viennabased talks on conventional forces in 
europe to be followed by another round of disarmament negotiations 
between nato and the warsaw pact 
withdrawal of american troops from the european continent 
will take place only after a conventional arms agreement the 
dutch official told reporters after meeting with cheney for several 
hours sunday and today 
ter beek said he was promised by cheney that the pentagons 
plans for cutting 150 billion to 180 billion over the next five 
years would not affect the nato alliance before a conventional arms 
agreement is concluded 
the conventional arms talks are aimed at achieving parity 
between the number of troops deployed in europe by nato and the 
warsaw pact 
cheney said he expected further troop reductions once a 
conventional arms agreement is completed probably some time next 
year according to ter beek 
a conventional arms agreement would include withdrawal of at 
least some of the 300000 us troops stationed in europe as well 
as reductions in the number of soldiers and conventional weaponry 
being deployed by the other nato allies most of the us troops 
are in west germany 
we were very pleased to hear that the us secretary also 
assumed an initial agreement in vienna will be followed by 
another round of talks aimed at further conventional troop 
reductions ter beek said 
the dutch official said he and cheney also discussed the swift 
movement for democratic change in eastern europe including 
czechoslovakia where demonstrations have resulted in the ouster of 
several hardline communist leaders 
ter beek said the two agreed on the need for full support for 
perestroika mikhail gorbachevs policy of restructuring the 
soviet political and economic system

sirens howled and church bells 
rang today as millions of people observed a nationwide general 
strike and filled streets and city squares in the largest 
demonstration so far against communist rule 
wenceslas square in central prague was jammed with hundreds of 
thousands of flagwaving workers marching beneath the banners of 
their factories firms and offices 
we dont want you anymore the crowd roared in a chant that 
echoed off the high 19thcentury buildings surrounding the square 
a halfmile long boulevard 
in a frenzied effort to avert the twohour strike seen as a 
referendum on demands for their ouster the countrys communist 
leaders early today dumped three more hardliners from the ruling 
politburo they feared the strike would draw workers to the 
prodemocracy movement which was launched by students 
intellectuals and artists 
they also endorsed a dialogue with the opposition and agreed 
to a parliamentary inquiry of the brutal police crackdown on a 
peaceful student rally nov 17 that touched off the east blocs 
latest popular revolt and the state news agency said the 
government had lifted most forms of censorship 
the concessions followed unprecedented talks sunday between 
opposition leaders and communist premier ladislav adamec who later 
joined reformer alexander dubcek at the head of a rally and told 
about 300000 demonstrators that authorities were ready to listen 
to their demands 
demands for free elections and an end to oneparty rule were 
plastered over the windows of shops hotels and restaurants that 
shut down for the strike which began at noon 6 am est 
staterun television which has played a key role in the 
dizzyingly rapid popular revolt here broadcast footage from 
industrial centers around the country showing crowds of hundreds 
of thousands attending strike rallies 
at the largest enterprise in the slovak capital bratislava the 
companys radio even issued instructions on how to go about the 
strike television said 
huge crowds of strikers were seen in bratislava the east slovak 
industrial center of kosice the mining center of ostrava on the 
polish border and in usti nad labem the heart of industrial north 
bohemia 
there was no estimate of how many workers went on strike but 
the television footage and the crowds in prague suggested the 
strike was a major success for the opposition 
state radio said all enterprises were affected although most 
had skeleton crews on duty so production would not be completely 
disrupted 
it has to go to the very end said jana cervenkova one of 
those protesting on wenceslas square as long as the communists 
rule it is going to be as messed up as it was for the last 40 
years 
look gustav how thick the crowd is the masses chanted 
referring to president gustav husak who headed the crackdown on 
democratic reforms that dubcek tried to institute in 1968 
dubcek to the castle they yelled referring to the 
presidential residence husak replaced dubcek in 1969 
sirens wailed and church bells pealed across the land at noon to 
signal the start of the strike 
people jangled keys and rang little bells of their own in a 
symbolic signal to the communists that their time in power is up 
the last bell is ringing the fairy tale is over they 
chanted 
a radio announcer called the strike the highest form of 
struggle for democracy and said it had been made necessary 
because of the mistakes of the regime 
later a representative of the student strike committee that 
initiated the protest proclaimed on the radio that protests which 
began 11 days ago would continue until a clause enshrining the 
communists leading role is struck from the constitution 
czechoslovakia is the latest east bloc country to be caught up 
in the reforms avocated by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the mass protests began nearly two weeks ago and have resulted in 
the ouster of a number of leaders including czechoslovakias 
communist party chief milos jakes 
state television announced it reduced its workforce for todays 
strike and the foreign language service of the ctk news agency 
reported it would stop transmission for 15 minutes in a symbolic 
gesture of solidarity 
radio carried interviews from numerous factories hospitals and 
enterprises with officials also expressing their solidarity 
i waited like you a long time for this valter komarek 
head of the forecasting institute of the academy of sciences told 
workers at the vysocany plant in prague 
removed today from the politburo were miroslav stepan who 
resigned as prague party boss saturday trade union boss miroslav 
zavadil and josef lenart the longestserving politburo member 
their ouster and the addition of seven largely unknown 
politburo members left an untried 13man ruling party body whose 
longest serving member slovak party chief ignac janak joined in 
april 1988 on friday seven politburo members were ousted but 
activists had demanded further personnel changes and have expressed 
skepticism the new politburo is willing to bow to demands that the 
communists relinquish power 
new party chief karel urbanek is one of just three on the 
13member politburo to have survived the recent shakeups 
on sunday night he pledged for the first time to open a 
dialogue with all levels of society including opposition groups 
and communist party members ousted after dubceks failed reform 
movement

surgeons today undertook the nations first liver 
transplant from a living donor a mother whos giving a third of 
her liver to her 21monthold daughter 
if successful the operation at the university of chicago would 
provide a solution to a severe shortage of organs for children who 
need transplants doctors said 
more than 700 babies a year in the united states need liver 
transplants and as many as half die for lack of a donor 
teri smith 29 was rolled into surgery at 735 am to begin 
the operation in which the left lobe of her liver was to be 
transplanted in her daughter alyssa said a spokeswoman at wyler 
childrens hospital at the university of chicago 
she was as eager to get started as she was a month ago when we 
first proposed this to her hospital spokeswoman mary fetsch said 
today she has not displayed any signs of doubt or hesitation 
dr christoph broelsch led the surgical team in a twophase 
operation that began with removal of a portion of mrs smiths 
liver said ms fetsch about 3 hours into the mothers operation 
doctors planned to prepare her daughter for the transplant the 
entire procedure was expected to last eight to nine hours 
in a way i kind of fear for her but im confident everything 
will turn out ok said alyssas father john l smith 27 of the 
san antonio suburb of shertz texas 
alyssa suffers from an oftenfatal liver disorder called biliary 
atresia the disease blocks liver bile ducts backing up bile in 
the bloodstream and the liver and is the leading cause for liver 
transplants involving children 
until now the only regularly performed living donor transplants 
have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments 
liver transplants from living donors have been performed only 
three times in brazil australia and japan one child has died 
in those cases the operation were emergencies performed on 
critically ill children said dr peter whitington head of the 
university of chicagos pediatric liver transplant program the 
chicago hospital has spent more than a year planning the program 
and last august authorized 20 such operations to determine if the 
procedure is viable 
dr william d paine who directs the liver transplant program 
at the university of minnesota health sciences center said 
transplant specialists around the country were closely monitoring 
todays operation 
because cadaver livers are usually from adults they are too 
large to be transplanted into childrens small abdominal cavities 
small children are at risk of dying while waiting for a 
suitable cadaver donor said whitington 
alyssa had been waiting for a cadaver liver transplant for more 
than a year when the smiths heard about the university of chicagos 
plans for the experimental program in august 
its a waiting game when you are waiting for a liver said 
mrs smith a fourthgrade teacher you dont know if shes going 
to have a bout with some illness that causes her to go into a liver 
failure and a liver not be available at that time 
the chicago hospital has been a pioneer in liver transplants 
broelsch became the first surgeon in the united states to 
transplant part of a liver from a cadaver into a child in 1986 
last year he performed a twoforone operation in which two 
children received transplants from one cadaver liver 
whitington said the living donor transplant is just the next 
step in assuring a steady supply of liver grafts 
he said the procedure holds the promise of a lower rejection 
rate since the grafts would come from a close relative match 
better genetically and could be transplanted immediately also the 
operation could be performed electively before a child becomes 
critically ill 
before authorizing the program the university studied ethical 
considerations and decided that the risk to the donor was low 
whitington said 
the liver regenerates itself an adult liver will grow back to 
normal after the operation and the segment transplanted into an 
infant will grow with the child 
whitington said the hospitals guidelines stress that no 
pressure be applied on family members to be donors 
the only thing i wish is that they could say yes this will 
work said mrs smith there is a possibility it will not be a 
100 percent success but we realize her chances should be better

the supreme court today rejected the appeal of 
a hollywood calif man who sued the senate judiciary committee 
over its unanimous vote last year favoring justice anthony m 
kennedys appointment to the high court 
the court without comment let stand rulings that threw out 
monte lees lawsuit 
kennedy did not participate in considering lees appeal or in 
the courts action today 
lees suit contended that the committees 14 senators violated 
his rights by voting for kennedy without investigating allegations 
of wrongdoing against the nominee 
lees allegations arose from kennedys participation in 1986 as 
a member of a 9th us circuit court of appeals panel in a ruling 
unfavorable to lee according to court documents lee had been 
challenging the doctrine of judicial immunity in the case 
the senate judiciary committees unanimous vote was taken jan 
27 1988 the full senate confirmed thenpresident reagans 
nomination of kennedy by a 970 vote feb 3 1988 
a federal trial judge dismissed lees lawsuit and the dismissal 
was upheld by a 9th circuit court panel last june 5 
the appeals court said the senators are absolutely immune under 
the constitutions speech and debate clause from being sued over 
their alleged failure to investigate kennedy properly 
the case is lee vs biden 89591

kentucky law enforcement officials sued for 
stripsearching a woman charged with operating her car without 
proper registration or insurance lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that 
stripsearching people accused of minor traffic violations 
generally violates their rights 
karen masters pleaded not guilty aug 21 1986 to driving her 
car with expired registration plates and failure to maintain auto 
insurance 
she was ordered to return to court on oct 23 and was given a 
card to remind her of that date by mistake the judge recorded 
mrs masters next scheduled appearance as oct 16 
jefferson county police officers arrested mrs masters at her 
home oct 21 for failure to appear in court on oct 16 
after police dropped off her two young children with mrs 
masters mother they handcuffed mrs masters and took her to jail 
a female attendant frisked her and ordered her to open her 
blouse in front of a window and in view of other people about four 
hours later she was taken to another room where she was ordered by 
another female attendant to take off all her clothes for a more 
thorough search 
after putting on a jail dress mrs masters was placed in a cell 
with other prisoners she was not released until later that evening 
throughout her ordeal mrs masters repeatedly protested that 
her arrest was a mistake she showed police her reminder card 
as evidence she had not failed to report for her court date 
mrs masters later sued four police officers and the head of the 
county corrections department for allegedly violating her rights 
the law enforcement officials said they should be immune from 
such a suit largely because of a 1985 court consent decree that 
settled an unrelated case involving overcrowding at the county jail 
the decree authorized strip searches of inmates at the jail when 
they are transferred from one area to another 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last april rejected the 
county officials arguments aimed at killing mrs masters suit 
we have found no authority approving a practice of conducting 
a strip search of a person arrested for a simple traffic violation 
in the absence of at least reasonable suspicion that the person 
might be carrying a weapon illegal drugs or other contraband 
the appeals court said 
the consent decree did not give the police power to ignore 
clearly established principles protecting rights of people accused 
of minor traffic offenses the appeals court said 
the case is frey vs masters 89576

the coast guard intensified its search this 
morning for five missing fishermen after a cutter and a jet spotted 
white flares in the area where the lobster boat disappeared 
the men aboard the 72foot heidi marie out of stonington 
conn were reported missing wednesday after they failed to call 
the boats owner james p garbo 
the coast guard found fishing markers from the lobster boat 
friday and identified an emergency floating radio beacon as 
belonging to the vessel 
petty officer elizabeth brannan said the cutter spotted a white 
flare about midnight sunday prompting rescuers to launch a 
nighttime jet search about 200 miles south of nantucket 
the jet sighted a flare but while they were searching 
they werent able to confirm the source before having to turn back 
to refuel brannan said 
the hunt was stepped up early today and in addition to the two 
cutters on the scene it included five jets from as far away as 
north carolina that would cover 8400 square miles of ocean she 
said 
petty officer ellen harrington said it was not known if the 
flares were related to the missing vessel adding that white 
flares are not generally considered distress flares but we have to 
consider that they are 
officer jack mason described sundays effort as a fullblown 
search using navy aircraft from massachusetts maine new york and 
north carolina as well as the two 270foot cutters from boston 
there were no immediate plans end the search for the fishermen 
mason said we go as long as we feel theres reasonable hope 
he said 
coast guard officials have said there was still some reason to 
believe there could be survivors the vessel was equipped with a 
highquality inflatable covered life raft that held up to eight 
people 
during the five days of searching rescuers have used 
sophisticated equipment and special flare searches while 
crisscrossing 10000 square miles of sea under mostly fair weather 
conditions and good visibility 
garbo declined comment sunday through his attorney tom clinton 
he has not yet spoken publicly about the incident although his 
wife said he is in constant touch with the coast guard 
the crew members were identified as michael hare capt mark 
middleton 33 ray gould arthur banks and ray morris all in their 
twenties the coast guard said

theres a cold front bearing down on malta 
the mediterranean island where president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev are going this weekend to warm up their 
relationship 
it could rain on their sail according to the weather forecast 
bigtime summits at sea are like that the last time there wa 
a lot of planning goes into such a meeting but things still go 
wrong the churchillroosevelt meeting in placentia bay in august 
of 1941 is an example at that meeting the two leaders drafted 
the atlantic charter a policy of aid to great britain at a time 
when the united states was neither legally nor emotionally 
committed to full participation in the war against germany 
it was the forerunner of many such other meetings between 
leaders churchill brought not only a large delegation of military 
men to the meeting but also 90 grouse 
in the 1969 book the first summit theodore a wilson writes 
that hms prince of wales arrived at the meeting point with marines 
and a band arrayed on the quarterdeck and everyone on board in 
place for welcoming ceremonies 
the battleship made a sudden burn to starboard and to 
everyones surprise headed out to sea wrote wilson there had 
been a mixup about time zones and the ship was 90 minutes too early 
the prime minister was furious and banged about the main deck 
hunting a target for his wrath wilson wrote but nothing could 
be done except to steam in a great circle all of this was hidden 
in morning mist 
then dramatically the mist broke to reveal a dazzling 
panorama he continued the camouflaged british warship a 
white ensign stirring over its stern found itself in the midst of 
many other armed ships of all sizes and shapes all displaying the 
stars and stripes their decks lined with cheering seamen 
overhead droned american patrol planes on the deck of the 
british battleship their pilots could discern a pudgy figure in 
some kind of naval uniform a united states heavy cruiser just a 
short distance away bore on its quarterdeck another figure sitting 
patiently in a wheelchair

the supreme court today left intact an 
overland park kan ordinance restricting the ownership and 
possession of pit bull dogs 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague 
lawyers for 13 owners of dogs told the justices the 1987 
ordinance does not even attempt to offer a standard for the 
police or dog owners to use when trying to determine whether a 
particular dog is subject to the ordinance 
antipit bull laws and ordinances are now sweeping the 
country the appeal said and constitutional challenges on 
vagueness grounds have been mounted in dozens of counties and 
states with inconsistent results this ordinance is among the very 
worst offenders 
the appeal said trial judges in california florida minnesota 
and washington state have struck down antipit bull ordinances for 
being too vaguely worded 
the overland park ordinance deems pit bull dogs dangerous 
animals that must be kept indoors or restrained and muzzled at 
all times 
pit bull dogs are defined by the ordinance to include 
staffordshire bull terriers american staffordshire terriers 
american pit bull terriers or dogs that have the appearance and 
characteristics of being predominantly of those breeds of dogs 
the ordinance also requires pit bull owners to acquire a 50000 
liability insurance policy to compensate for any damage caused by 
the animals owners who fail to comply may be criminally liable 
and could face substantial fines and up to 30 days in jail 
a state judge and the kansas supreme court upheld the ordinance 
noting in its ruling last april 4 that no constitutionally 
protected conduct is being limited the state supreme court said 
the ordinance is worded precisely enough 
the ordinance as interpreted by the overland park police 
department applies only to animals in which pit bull dog 
characteristics predominate the state court said ultimate 
godlike precision is not required 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the dog owners said 
the ordinance on its face lacks even a rudimentary core meaning 
the case is hearn vs overland park 89412

the court without comment let stand a ruling that the five 
were prosecuted fairly 
convicted of racketeering and related charges were james coonan 
and edna coonan james mcelroy richard ritter and william bokun

group that terrorized the manhattan neighborhood for 20 years until 
the mid1980s

to his subordinates 
mcelroy was described as a chief enforcer bokun as a killer and 
cocaine dealer and ritter as a cocaine dealer and loanshark

ritter said police illegally searched his apartment bokun said 
he was denied adequate legal representation after his attorney was 
forced to withdraw eight weeks into the trial because of illness

because the judge barred a psychiatrist from testifying about the 
mental illness of a prosecution witness

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a telephone company ordered to notify customers along with their 
monthly bills of their right to join a lawsuit against the company 
the court without comment let stand a colorado ruling that the 
companys freespeech rights are not violated by requiring it to 
include such notices with its bills 
the case stems from a suit accusing mountain states telephone amp 
telegraph co or mountain bell of antitrust violations 
five individuals and a corporation sued on behalf of mountain 
bells 12 million residential and 235000 business customers in 
colorado 
the federal communications commission in 1982 ordered mountain 
bell to offer customers a choice of whether they wanted to continue 
paying the company to maintain telephone wiring within their home 
or business 
the telephone company notified customers it would assume they 
wished to continue the service unless told otherwise 
the suit against mountain bell said that tactic violated 
antitrust law by misleading customers the suit seeks to force the 
company to refund fees paid for wiring maintenance 
the average claim per customer would be between 35 and 50 
a state judge said that because the suit is in behalf of all 
mountain bells colorado customers a classaction claim all 
customers must be given a chance to take part or exclude themselves 
that decision entails risk if mountain bell wins the case any 
customer who chose to participate would be required to share in 
paying the legal costs 
the state judge ordered customers be notified of their options 
along with monthly bills from the company 
those who sued mountain bell said it would cost them 500000 if 
the notices were mailed separately but only 300000 if the notices 
were included in the bills 
the colorado supreme court in july upheld the order that the 
notices be sent with the monthly bills 
there is no danger that a customer would somehow construe 
the notice as an endorsement by mountain bell of the class action 
or a concession on its part that the pending lawsuit has merit 
the state court said the notice merely provides class members 
with objectively neutral information 
the state court rejected arguments that the notice procedure 
conflicts with a 1986 us supreme court ruling 
the justices in that case allowed a california utility company 
to exclude from its billing envelopes messages by a consumer 
protection group 
the colorado court said mountain bells case is different 
because the notice of the lawsuit is devoid of economic 
ideological or political advocacy what we are dealing with here is 
a legal notice 
mountain bells appeal was supported by numerous banking credit 
card gasoline and utility companies 
the case is mountain states telephone vs district court of

east germanys communist party today 
criticized its 23 millionmember youth organization for breaking 
away and said the leadership in czechoslovakia was paying a 
bitter price for resisting reform 
the official party newspaper neues deutschland said the decision 
by the freie deutsche jugend or free german youth to abandon the 
party could threaten the youth groups future 
the group the traditional stepping stone to success for the 
communist leadership including party chief egon krenz announced 
friday it no longer wanted to be the helper and fighting 
reserve of the party 
in a commentary neues deutschland spoke of a loss of 
confidence in the youth group which it said is struggling for 
a new profile and perhaps for its existence 
another communistrun daily the berliner zeitung offered east 
germanys harshest criticism to date of czechoslovakias rulers 
saying they were paying the bitter price for the grave errors of 
the past 
the commentary traced the troubles of the party leadership in 
prague to refusing political reforms and to the illusory risky 
business of trying to choke the call for democracy with police 
clubs 10 days ago 
it was referring to the police crackdown on demonstrators in 
prague on nov 17 the severity of the crackdown sparked an 
unprecedented series of protest that has forced the ouster of 
hardline communists including party chief milos jakes 
the national democrats one of the smaller parties long allied 
with the communists appealed today for a more effective and more 
humane socialism in east germany 
the comments by party leader fred dumke echoed soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs remarks sunday in pravda gorbachevs 
statement was seen as an endorsement of the 1968 prague spring 
slogan of socialism with a human face adopted anew by 
prodemocracy protesters in czechoslovakia 
in another sign of the east german partys own problems 
communist sources said sunday that huge amounts of money earned 
from communist partyowned businesses in east germany are 
unaccounted for 
party reformers have urged an inquiry to determine if the 
revenues were diverted the sources said 
the charges of revenue diversion concern money earned at 
businesses including trading firms and hardcurrency shops set up 
to earn west german marks and other foreign currency the party 
sources said sunday on condition of anonymity 
earnings of the roughly 100 companies total from 38 billion to 
65 billion per year much of which is unaccounted for the 
sources said 
these companies have misappropriated money that belongs to the 
people one source said 
the party sources said several highranking reformminded 
communists whose names were not disclosed have called for an 
investigation to determine where the money went 
the enterprises included electronics and transport companies and 
an art trading company among many others the party sources said 
they said the enterprises include the east berlin company 
intrac specializing in trade in chemicals and metals and a 
company identified only as one for internal and foreign trade in 
radioactive and stable isotopes 
such an investigation would be only the latest show of 
discontent with the party 
the party has lost about 200000 people or 10 percent of its 
membership in the past two months neues deutschland quoted 
central committee member heinz mirtschin as saying in its weekend 
edition 
krenz facing a battle for his political career at a party 
congress next month has been trying to shift attention to abuses 
that can be blamed on his predecessor erich honecker 
krenz however was a member of honeckers inner circle and 
former chief of the countrys security apparatus 
honecker was ousted oct 18 and replaced by krenz who has 
presided over the opening of the berlin wall and an official 
commitment to reform 
among krenzs moves toward powersharing have been to propose 
roundtable talks with the opposition similar to the 
discussions that led to dramatic political changes in hungary and 
poland

prime minister rajiv gandhis party 
today failed to win a majority in elections for only the second 
time in 42 years as voters deserted it for a new centrist alliance 
and a fundamentalist hindu party 
incomplete results from the election for a new parliament showed 
the congress party with more seats than any single opposition group 
but far short of a mandate to form the next government alone 
that leaves gandhi in the difficult position of trying to form a 
coalition government the first in the history of the worlds most 
populous democracy 
the fundamentalist bharatiya janata party capitalizing on a 
rise in hindu nationalism appeared destined to be the pivotal 
player its leader said today he would see to it that they 
congress fall from power 
president ramaswamy venkataraman dissolved parliament tonight 
the first formal step toward seating a new parliament gandhi is 
now a caretaker prime minister until his party or the opposition 
manage to form a new government 
the election was a major blow to gandhi who had been tainted by 
allegations of government corruption and ineptitude his family 
dynasty has governed india for all but five years since it won 
independence from britain in 1947 
gandhis leadership also had been called into question by the 
widespread vote fraud and violence in the election that claimed 137 
lives making it the bloodiest balloting in modern indias history 
the election for seats in parliaments policymaking lower house 
started wednesday and was scheduled to end sunday but revoting 
was ordered in some districts because of alleged fraud balloting 
ended today and by sundown winners were declared in 373 of the 525 
races 
state television compiling results from the election 
commission said the congress party had 160 seats its party allies 
had 17 
a majority in the new parliament and with it the mandate to 
form a new government requires 263 seats 
the centrist national front a fiveparty alliance led by former 
defense and finance minister vishwanath pratap singh had 81 seats 
singh an excongress party member was once gandhis ally but is 
now the prime ministers most outspoken political foe 
the bharatiya janata which won just two seats in the last 
elections in 1984 had 69 the rest of the seats went to smaller 
parties and independents 
many undeclared seats are in states where the national front was 
expected to do well 
the congress partys poor showing could hurt it in the search 
for coalition partners or trigger a revolt against the prime 
minister by colleagues in his own party 
if congress wants to win anything the prime minister must 
go said independent analyst bhabani sen gupta with rajiv 
gandhi very few things are possible without rajiv gandhi many 
things are possible 
the congress party dismissed the possibility of a coalition with 
the bharatiya janata party 
we will contemptuously reject any overtures from the bjp 
theres no question of aligning with them congress spokesman 
anand sharma said congress is not in a tearing hurry to seek a 
coalition with anyone 
india has never had a coalition government and the prospect 
plunged many into confusion to create a coalition the president 
would ask the party with the most seats to try to muster enough 
partners for a parliamentary majority if that fails the president 
could ask another party to try to forge a majority in alliance with 
other parties 
gandhi 45 the grandson of indias first prime minister 
jawaharlal nehru was plunged into the leadership when his mother 
prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated in 1984 
his party then took an unprecedented 415 of the seats in the 
lower house 
the initial euphoria over a young seemingly dynamic leader was 
soon tarnished by allegations of government corruption and 
ineptitude 
the trouble came home to roost in gandhis own election district 
of amethi where the outcome of his race for reelection is still 
in limbo 
gandhi was expected to win easily when the remote area of dusty 
villages voted on wednesday but the national front complained of 
widespread fraud by congress party activists and another vote was 
held today in about 18 percent of the district 
polling officer uday raj pandey estimated more than 50 percent 
of the voters showed up in amethi 
there were few issues in the campaign apart from being for or 
against gandhi and the congress 
another factor in the election was a revival of hindu 
fundamentalism 
the surge followed hindumoslem riots earlier this month that 
left more than 300 people dead the riots were sparked by a 
campaign to build a temple on the site of a 16th century moslem 
mosque 
moslems voters also may have abandoned the congress party their 
traditional election choice because the government did not prevent 
the riots most of those who died were moslems 
parliaments lower house has 543 seats but only 524 were at 
stake in the elections no election was held for a seat with an 
unopposed candidate 
the elections for the rest of the seats were postponed 
indefinitely because of incomplete voter lists or candidates

the supreme court today refused to let public 
schools cut off educational help to severely handicapped children 
even though they may not be able to benefit from such services 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a new 
hampshire school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded 
13yearold boy 
the case has attracted widespread attention from educators and 
state and local government officials nationwide who supported the 
appeal by the rochester nh school district 
in other action today the court 
dealt a blow to new york citys campaign to halt the spread of 
homelessness by refusing to revive a local law successfully 
challenged by developers 
the justices without comment left intact a ruling that a law 
banning conversion or demolition of singleroomoccupancy housing 
unconstitutionally confiscates private property 
turned down an appeal by kentucky law enforcement officials 
sued for stripsearching a woman charged with operating her car 
without proper registration or insurance 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that 
stripsearching people accused of minor traffic violations 
generally violates their rights 
left intact an overland park kan ordinance restricting the 
ownership and possession of pit bull dogs 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague 
the boy in the handicappededucation case identified as timothy 
w has been severely handicapped since he was born two months 
prematurely dec 8 1975 
rochester school officials said he is incapable of learning even 
rudimentary skills 
timothy has consistently exhibited profound mental and 
developmental retardation deafness and blindness a persistent 
convulsive disorder and severe cerebral palsy they said he is 
virtually immobile suffers from spasticity and has contracted 
joints 
but the boys mother and some therapists painted a somewhat 
different picture they said he sees bright light smiles when 
happy cries when sad listens to television and music and 
responds to touching and talking 
at issue is the duty of states and local school officials under 
the federal education for all handicapped children act which 
provides federal aid and in turn requires programs to help such 
children 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled in may that under 
the law it is the states responsibility to experiment refine 
and improve upon the educational services it provides to 
handicapped children and not to exclude handicapped children if 
there is no proof that they can benefit from the existing program 
that a state might offer at a particular time 
a chief aim of the law is to help the most severely handicapped 
the appeals court said as it reinstated a lawsuit by timothys 
mother seeking educational services and 175000 in damages 
rochester school officials said the appeals court ruling means 
states and cities will be forced to divert scarce resources from 
those who can benefit to children who cannot be helped 
they said the federal government contributes less than 300 to 
the 15000 a year it will take to provide educational services to 
timothy 
among those supporting the school officials appeal in the 
handicapped case were the national school boards association the 
american association of school administrators the national league 
of cities and the national conference of state legislatures 
the school boards and school administrators in a 
friendofthecourt brief said the appeals court ruling could have 
devastating consequences 
they quoted therapist lynn miller who at one time testified for 
timothy but said she since has changed her mind 
to spend money and require teachers to help someone incapable of 
learning is not only a misuse of money it raises false hopes in 
the childrens families she said it results in a burnout in 
teachers therapists and social workers 
the case is rochester nh vs timothy w 89515

legislators today gave final approval to a plan 
putting the small baltic republics on the road to economic autonomy 
from moscow next year and possibly issuing their own currencies 
deputies from the tiny republic of estonia stood and cheered 
after the soviet parliament approved the measure on a vote of 
29667 another 37 deputies abstained 
a final vote on the bill had been delayed from friday after a 
sharp debate on whether the move amounted to an effort to tear 
apart the soviet system 
president mikhail s gorbachev presided over the sessions friday 
and today and supported the bill as a step toward economic reform 
the tass news agency said the law goes into effect jan 1 and 
gives lithuania latvia and estonia the right to engage in 
independent economic activity and envisages equal participation in 
union activity 
baltic deputies stressed that the law gives them more control 
over factories now controlled by government ministries based in 
moscow they say it does not exclude the possibility of issuing 
their own currencies 
one deputy from the soviet far east nikolai danilyuk said 
friday he opposed the bill because i would not like to become a 
participant in the disintegration of our great state 
but estonian prime minister indrik toome said that only a 
radical restructuring giving the republics more autonomy could save 
the soviet union from disintegration that he said was caused by too 
much control in moscow 
the law was given preliminary approval in july and sent to 
legislative committees for further work

cholesterol screenings in shopping malls and 
other public settings can be dangerous because of an alarming 
potential for inaccurate results and risk of infection a federal 
official said today 
given todays concern for the spread of aids and hepatitis 
these findings are particularly disturbing richard kusserow 
inspector general of the department of health and human services 
said in testimony presented to a house subcommittee 
kusserow said he was concerned that public screenings are 
growing by leaps and bounds private companies are jumping in 
manufacturers are promoting their products by saying anyone can use 
them and he said many screenings are conducted in a 
carnivallike atmosphere 
kusserow recommended federal regulation of all cholesterol 
screenings that are not conducted by health care professionals 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house small business 
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities said he is 
concerned that with inaccurate screening results people can be 
lulled into a false sense of security they may not see a doctor 
they may not change their diets and they may not exercise 
over time not knowing they are in the danger zone could cost 
them their health and even their lives wyden said 
an investigation by the inspector general requested by wydens 
panel found that basic rules of hygiene were often ignored 
qualifications and training of testers varied widely and public 
screenings often lacked the optimal conditions needed to produce 
accurate results with portable analyzers 
the public in general is not aware of these shortcomings and 
does not know what to look for in safe highquality public 
screening programs said the report 
in addition screening staff may be placing themselves as well 
as screenees at risk due to marginal observation of the basic rules 
of hygiene and infection control procedures the report said 
cholesterol screenings are conducted at shopping malls 
pharmacies health clubs village halls and a variety of other 
public settings the report said it found no reliable national 
statistics on prevalence of screenings but said that because of 
greater awareness of the link between high cholesterol and heart 
disease demand for screening is increasing significantly 
at a time when over 60 million adult americans may currently 
have high blood cholesterol placing them at risk of heart disease 
it defies common sense to allow unregulated public screening to 
continue wyden said 
his subcommittee has been studying medical testing and its 
finding that a quarter of all such testing was being done in 
unregulated settings led to a 1988 law that brings all clinical 
laboratories under federal regulation the health care financing 
administration is drafting regulations to implement the law 
the law provides that some medical testing may be exempt from 
its provisions but the inspector general recommended public 
screenings be included in the regulations because federal 
regulation is clearly called for in order to safeguard the 
public 
sixteen states regulate public cholesterol screening but 
regulations in four of them have not yet been implemented the 
report said 
the report was based on a review of state and federal laws and 
regulations research studies and reports as well as interviews 
with 250 experts and public officials it also included a special 
field survey in which investigators participated in 71 public 
cholesterol screenings that were randomly selected in 10 states and 
the district of columbia 
the investigators test results were not analyzed for accuracy 
but participants observed the conditions under which the tests were 
conducted and rated them against the guidelines issued by the 
national cholesterol education program a consortium of 
organizations coordinated by the national heart lung and blood 
institute 
investigators said that contrary to the guidelines the 
atmosphere at many screenings was frenzied with little or no 
privacy for those being tested and that many times testers had no 
professional experience and minimal training 
nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was drawn 
with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or milked which 
can dilute the sample with material from between the cells and give 
a lower than true result 
also the investigators reported that a third of the testers 
wore no gloves some who wore no gloves handled money and collected 
blood samples 
though investigators did not see any lancets being reused one 
reported that at a pharmacy staff were observed inspecting 
lancets lying on the table because they were afraid they had put a 
used one back in with the new ones 
contrary to the ncep guidelines less than 20 percent of the 
investigators who were screened were told that screening is only a 
guide to potential problems and not a diagnostic test 
the investigators also reported that while hospitals conducting 
screenings frequently provided physician referrals forprofit 
screeners rarely even mentioned referral

an archaeologist says as many as 48000 
people might be buried in previously occupied graves at two 
cemeteries 
it may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend 
just what has gone on out here said phil diblasi an 
archaeologist who has excavated about 100 graves at eastern and 
greenwood cemeteries during an investigation for the state attorney 
generals office 
some graves were found to contain the remains of as many as six 
people and graves containing the remains of three or four are a 
common occurrence diblasi said 
remains from previous burials were found so often in a section 
of eastern cemetery that about 70 infants bodies were buried only 
10 to 18 inches deep in an effort to avoid bones employees have 
told investigators 
the investigation has led to the indictment of three employees 
who ran the louisville crematory and cemeteries co inc 
a jefferson county grand jury returned a 60count indictment 
against the company in july also indicted were charles alexander 
jr the executive director since may 1986 clifford b amos sr 
the board president who had been acting executive director from 
1980 to 1986 and robert copley vice president of the board who 
began working for the company in october 1987 
all three men have resigned and all have pleaded innocent to the 
charges 
they are to be tried in february on charges that include the 
reuse of graves and abuse of corpses if convicted they could 
receive prison terms ranging from 188 to 268 years plus fines of 
up to 4000 
diblasi said his excavations during the last four months 
indicated that graves were being reused as early as the mid1920s 
in eastern cemetery 
cemetery records indicate it was probably full shortly after the 
turn of the century 
comprising 15 acres eastern had enough room for about 18000 
bodies under existing cemeteryindustry standards but an estimated 
51000 bodies have been buried there meaning 33000 were 
improperly buried according to diblasi and a report by another 
investigator filed in the court case 
the report of jim caldwell an investigator for the attorney 
generals office also estimated that about 15000 too many bodies 
were buried at greenwood 
the 141yearold cemetery company came under scrutiny in may 
when bob allen a gravedigger and maintenance worker for eight 
years called the attorney generals office to report the alleged 
burial practices caldwells report said 
during the subsequent investigation caldwell found human bones 
stored throughout eastern cemetery in a trucks glove 
compartment in a tool box in a storage shed in dirt piles and 
even in a fast food hamburger bag his report said

a simple case of a knapsack stuffed with 
10900 that was found in a private yard has turned into a fourway 
court battle that is full of contradictions and suspicions 
the knapsack turned up on may 1 1986 behind the home of david 
and lona stussy the first party claiming the money 
stussy says he saw the knapsack between 6 am and 630 am 
that day when he left for work he said he was in a rush so he 
didnt look inside it but called from his office and asked his wife 
to check it out 
mrs stussy apparently didnt rush to look at the strange pack 
lying in her back yard but a livein babysitter kathleen jensen 
says she spotted it when taking out the garbage 
then she and mrs stussy took a closer look 
mrs stussy says she immediately saw loose bills but didnt see 
all of the cash and didnt mention it at the time 
jensen says she didnt notice any money in the bag until after 
police picked it up later that morning she is not making any claim 
on the money 
claimant no 2 is the stussys former livein handyman jerry 
moore who says he found the knapsack after midnight long before 
the stussys got up 
however moore saw no money only what looked like burglary 
tools and says he was stunned when lawyers told him more than a 
year later that cash was found in the pack 
in any event stussy eventually called police and when officer 
john e pielow arrived he looked in the bag and found 10900 in a 
brown gunnysack 
in minnesota the law allows finders to become keepers if six 
months pass without anyone claiming lost property after the 
deadline passed the stussys filed a claim 
enter claimant no 3 the minneapolis police relief association 
the police pension fund decided it wanted the money under law if 
an officer finds money that doesnt get claimed the money goes 
into the pension fund 
the association insists officer pielow is the legal finder of 
the money because he was the first to look inside 
then the fourth contestant nowell freeman stepped forward 
freeman a cabinetmaker and real estate agent in suburban 
wayzata insists the money and the knapsack were stolen from his 
car april 30 1986 when he parked it near the stussys home to 
walk a girlfriend around lake of the isles 
freeman has some solid evidence to back up his claim a police 
report he made on the night of the theft the report describes the 
pack right down to the brand name 
but even freemans claim contains a discrepancy because the 
police report says he originally claimed a theft of 4000 in cash 
which he says was for a down payment on real estate he now claims 
that much more cash was stolen 
so far the legal battle has produced a 2inchthick pad of 
legal documents yet nowhere in that paperwork is there an 
explanation for how the knapsack ended up in the sussys backyard 
i dont think well ever know unless the person who was dumb 
enough to put 10900 in bills in the knapsack comes forward 
said lawyer mark karney who represents the stussys

the financial times quoting vietnamese officials in hanoi said 
the first repatriations probably would be on a 120seat boeing 737 
chartered by the hong kong government it said hong kong also was 
considering chartering larger aircraft or troop carriers and 
passenger liners capable of carrying up to 1000 passengers 
the repatriation has to start before the sailing season starts 
again in february or march maude said on bbc radio last year 
no fewer than 32000 people arrived in hong kong from vietnam we 
cannot possibly tolerate that happening again 
britain says most of the 56000 people sheltered in hong kong 
have not fled political or religious persecution but simply are 
seeking a better standard of living than that available at home 
each is being screened in accordance with standards set down by 
the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees 
only 13000 have been declared genuine refugees 
referring to us objections to britains plans for forcible 
repatriation maude said the united states has agreed that there 
is nowhere for these people to go other than back to vietnam 
asked whether britain would be relieved if another country 
offered to take 5000 or 10000 of the boat people he replied 
there would still be 30000 to 35000 left there are no takers 
for these people there has been unanimous agreement in the 
international community that there is no place for these people to 
go other than back to vietnam 
the foreign office has said britain would likely pay 
compensation to the boat people it sends back so they can buy tools 
and seeds it has said the sum would be similar to the 600 paid to 
boat people who go home voluntarily 
so far fewer than 400 people have returned voluntarily to 
vietnam

the ruling party said today the 
opposition had won the first free vote in four decades on a 
referendum postponing presidential elections to give the fledgling 
movement more time to organize and become better known 
final results were not expected until tuesday but the 
presidential candidate of the ruling socialist party formerly the 
communist party conceded that voters sunday approved the 
referendum backed by opposition parties 
we can be certain that the number of yes votes was higher 
than the no votes said imre pozsgay the popular socialist 
candidate 
the results would mean that a new democratic parliament to be 
chosen by june will elect the president of the new hungarian 
republic if voters had rejected the referendum they would have 
elected a president directly on jan 7 
opposition groups favored postponing the vote until after 
parliamentary elections saying that otherwise they could not 
sufficiently organize a serious challenge to pozsgay they hope to 
win strong representation in the new parliament giving their 
candidate a better chance at the presidency 
they also proposed that the presidents powers be curtailed 
with 913 percent of the ballots tallied 502 percent favored a 
direct election before the parliamentary elections and 498 percent 
were for postponement until afterward said pal kara secretary of 
the referendum committee in parliament told journalists 
kara said the voted yet to be counted could swing the vote the 
other way final results were not to be made public before tuesday 
he said 
the turnout represents 582 percent of hungarys 78 million 
eligible voters kara said above the 50 percent needed to make to 
vote binding 
the plebiscite is the first free vote in hungary since 
communists came to power more than four decades ago 
it comes just a month after a new republic was declared in a 
symbolic rejection of communist rule and parliament adopted 
legislation opening the way for the free multiparty elections 
the turnout marked an important step in the countrys drive 
for democracy said tibor vidos the executive director of the 
opposition free democrats it shows people are interested in 
deciding their own future 
the ruling socialist party which replaced the recently 
dissolved communist party and several other opposition groups had 
agreed on direct voting for the first president of the republic 
before the parliamentary elections 
however the league of free democrats and three other groups 
expressed concern that if pozsgay won in early presidential 
elections too much power could be concentrated with the ruling 
socialists before a democratic parliament can been chosen 
they gathered more than 100000 signatures on a petition calling 
for the referendum 
the powers of the new presidency include commanding the armed 
forces calling elections and dissolving parliament 
three other questions on the ballot dealt with traditional 
aspects of the governing partys power 
whether the workers militia created to protect the party 
should be dissolved 
whether the party should remove its organizational cells from 
the workplace 
and whether it should make a public accounting of its assets 
with the militia in the process of being dissolved parliament 
voting against continued politization of the businesses and 
factories and agreement to open socialist party books voting on 
the latter three issues was purely symbolic

opposition presidential candidate 
rafael leonardo callejas a ustrained economist claimed victory 
today in honduras third free election this decade official 
returns were incomplete 
i invite my opponents to join me in reconstructing honduras 
callejas of the national party told a cheering crowd at election 
headquarters early this morning 
in unofficial returns representing about 67 percent of 
precincts callejas had 595807 votes or about 502 percent to 
526110 or about 445 percent for carlos flores of the governing 
liberal party 
official returns much slower in coming out showed a narrower 
lead after announcing callejas had 44538 votes to flores 43383 
late sunday the electoral tribunal announced that its computer had 
crashed and it closed for the night 
we may have to start over said mario arnaldo barrientos a 
member of the tribunals information committee in an interview at 
the computer center today he said the problem may have been 
related to the large volume of incoming results but tests were 
being run 
minor parties took the rest of the vote only a plurality was 
needed to win 
if the present trend continues callejas will win said 
liberal party treasurer jorge roberto maradiaga in a telephone 
interview the people will regret this 
if callejas takes office on jan 27 for a fouryear term he 
will become the first opposition candidate to take power in a 
peaceful vote in 57 years 
the winner faces grim problems in this underdeveloped nation of 
about 5 million a stagnant economy an unpayable debt and wars in 
two bordering countries el salvador and nicaragua on sunday el 
salvador suspended relations with nicaragua and accused it of 
arming leftist salvadoran guerrillas 
in this violent central america where the youth of our 
neighbors is spilling its blood the people of honduras have given 
a yes to peace and a no to blood callejas said in an earlier 
victory statement at party headquarters sunday night 
callejas like flores has made it clear that he wants 
ussupported contras fighting nicaraguas sandinista government 
to leave honduras but he also fears honduras will alone have to 
deal with getting rid of the contra fighters if us aid stops 
he offered no new ideas for achieving that end during the 
campaign on sunday he called for central american presidents to 
reconstruct the peace process in the wake of el salvadors 
decision to break with nicaragua 
he also said he would be willing to accompany azcona to any 
summit that might take place before jan 27 
callejas has promised to privatize governmentowned companies 
cut government spending and open the nation to foreign investment 
the international monetary fund has suspended loans on dec 1 
because honduras has refused to negotiate over payments on old debt 
honduras owes 32 billion most of it to international 
institutions and the united states is holding up 70 million in 
fiscal aid until honduras makes an arrangement with those 
institutions 
callejas 46 comes from a landowning family and was trained as 
an agricultural economist at mississippi state university 
he attributed the elections results to hard work and the 
desire for change and pitched his campaign against the government 
of president jose azcona hoyo saying eight years of liberal 
government had only made things worse 
also at stake were three vice presidential posts a 130seat 
unicameral congress and 289 mayoralties voting was by party slate 
with no ticket splitting allowed 
the nationalists appeared to be gaining a congressional 
majority and national party candidate nora melgar claimed victory 
in the capital of tegucigalpa 
more than 22 million people were registered but voting was 
concentrated at relatively few locations and some people had to 
travel long distances 
turnout was nevertheless heavy and observers reported few 
irregularties 
the problems dont appear to systematically favor one side or 
another said an observer for the organization of american states 
the last time there was a partytoparty transition came in 
1933 when tiburcio carias andino of the national party took over 
from liberal vicente mejia colindres carias didnt allow another 
vote until 1948

existinghome sales last month remained steady 
at their highest level since january a real estate trade group 
said monday and analysts expect singledigit mortgage rates to 
sustain sales well into the new year 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
352 million the same as septembers revised rate and the highest 
since januarys 355 million rate the september rate was 12 
percent above augusts 348 million sales 
the realtors survey falling mortgage interest rates and an 
earlier government report of a 12 percent increase in new housing 
starts in october make things look somewhat brighter for the 
housing market in the future said economist rob rosenblatt of 
the mortgage bankers association 
rosenblatt and the realtors chief economist john a tuccillo 
predicted that mortgage rates will remain low into next year with 
rosenblatt suggesting they could fall as low as 9 percent by early 
next spring 
overall home financing conditions probably will stay quite 
favorable in the months ahead tuccillo said 
rosenblatt also said he expects octobers new home sales to post 
a sharp rebound from septembers 14 percent drop which analysts 
said resulted from a spike in mortgage rates to above 10 percent 
fixedrate mortgages fell steadily from 1010 percent to 982 
percent during october according to the federal home loan mortgage 
corp and had dropped to 974 percent by last wednesday 
lower rates are sustaining sales at a healthy clip said 
realtors president norman d flynn buyers priced out by higher 
rates earlier this year are in the market now 
for a year the federal reserve pushed interest rates higher to 
battle inflationary pressures but since last spring the central 
bank has been gradually easing its grip on credit allowing 
mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer and business loan 
rates to fall 
the realtors said the national median price for an existing 
singlefamily home was 92100 down 2200 from september the 
median price means that half the homes sold for more half for less 
the west posted the only increase in sales in october up 34 
percent to an annual rate of 610000 units the realtors said the 
median price for a home in the west was 142200 5400 below the 
september cost 
sales were unchanged from septembers 134 million unit rate in 
the south where the median home price was 83400 down 1000 
from september 
sales declined 1 percent in the midwest to 980000 and dropped 
17 percent to 580000 units in the northeast the median price for 
a home in the midwest was 70900 1300 below the september 
price and 143300 in the northeast 2400 below the september 
cost

presidential palace in the comoro republic and killed the longtime 
ruler of the indian ocean island nation staterun radio comoro 
reported today 
officials at the comoro embassy in paris said sunday nights 
attack was led by a former army commander who recently resigned in 
a dispute with president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
the excommandant ahmed mohamed led an undetermined number of 
men in the assassination said an embassy official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he said mohamed had been arrested and was 
in custody 
the head of the supreme court mohamed djohar will head an 
interim government as dictated by the constitution the official 
said he stressed that it was an assassination not a coup 
life in the capital appeared calm today bruce thompson manager 
of the galewa sun hotel told the south african press association 
everything was normal 
radio comoro monitored on the frenchadministered island of 
mayotte reported that abderrahmane 70 was killed in a firefight 
between the rebels and members of his 300man presidential guard 
one guard was reported killed 
the presidential guard is better equipped and trained than the 
700man regular forces formerly commanded by mohamed it was not 
immediately known whether any guard members were involved in the 
assassination plot 
the rebel forces launched their attack in the capital of moroni 
on the main island of grand camore at about midnight sunday the 
french news agency agence francepresse reported

three weeks ago abderrahmane who ruled the island for all but 
three years since 1972 won a referendum that permitted him to seek 
a third sixyear term when his current term expired next year 
official results showed it passed with 925 percent of the vote 
but observers complained of ballotbox stuffing voter harassment 
and destroyed ballots 
opposition figures in paris said abderrahmane had jailed 
political leaders who complained he had concentrated too much power 
in his own hands 
abderrahmane was first elected president of the comoran 
government in 1972 when the archipelago was still a french 
possession 
the comoros unilaterally declared independence in july 1975 and 
abderrahmane became head of state he was overthrown a month later

mercenaries led by frenchman bob denard he established an islamic 
republic and ran unopposed for reelection in 1984 
abderrahmane survived coup attempts in 1983 1985 and 1987 his 
government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981 
south african president fw de klerk sent a message of 
condolence addressed only to the acting head of government 
condemning the senseless assassination 
de klerks foreign minister pik botha said south africas 
trade representative in the comoros reported the situation was 
under the control of the security forces and that everything was 
calm

romanias exiled king on monday urged president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to discuss romania 
during their summit meeting and take action to improve conditions 
in the country 
i think that they must be able to take some sort of measures 
to change the situation in romania during the dec 23 summit 
said king michael 
the king said the principle of noninterference in the internal 
affairs of nations does not apply in romanias case because it is 
led by a power that exercises state terrorism to muzzle its 
people 
he accused romanias hardline leader nicolae ceausescu of 
persisting stubbornly in morally and physically destroying the 
romanians referring to changes occuring in other east european 
countries michael said it is time that the same happens in 
romania 
but responding to a question he said he doubted that a popular 
uprising was likely soon in romania because of the governments 
repressive nature 
michael said he and his family have received death threats 
periodically since he went into exile in 1948 and that such 
threats have intensified they certainly come from the secret 
police he said 
michael who holds a british passport and lives near geneva has 
said he considers his abdication as not valid because he acted 
under coercion from the sovietinstalled government

it took two passes in a hydraulic lift but 
first lady barbara bush finally got close enough to the top of the 
national christmas tree to crown it with a white plastic star 
monday 
mrs bush was joined on the somewhat bumpy journey in the 
hydraulic lift to the top of the 35foot tree by her 3yearold 
granddaughter marshall and joseph riley president of the 
christmas pageant of peace 
the lift operator left the threesome a few feet short on his 
first try 
mrs bush who has been topping off the national christmas tree 
every november since 1981 signalled to him to lift them higher 
and on the second try she and riley managed to get a silver pole 
holding the outsized plastic star in place 
marshall seasonally garbed in a bright red dress with a red 
ribbon in her hair took it all in stride waving to her mother 
margaret bush and preschool classmates on the ground below 
when the ride downward was briefly halted marshall called out 
cheerfully but insistently hey when are we going down get me 
down here 
perfect pronounced mrs bush as the white cage finally 
perched on terra firma she took marshall over to shake hands and 
pose for a picture with the lift operator national park service 
tree worker kevin guard 
i thought she was coming over to chew me out guard said 
afterward she just said thanks 
guard 35 was pressed into service when the park service found 
itself with a rented lift but no operator 
i was scared to death he said im in trees trim them 
cut them down make them safe 
asked how he wound up with the job of hoisting the first lady 
and kin up to the top of the living christmas tree guard said 
it just happened i usually drive a cherry picker they didnt 
have an operator so i did it 
mrs bush has said that topping off the tree was one of her 
favorite duties as the vice presidents wife and when riley asked 
her last year if she wanted to keep doing it she leapt at the 
opportunity becoming the first first lady to do so 
she called marilyn quayle wife of vice president dan quayle 
and mrs quayle told her to go right ahead aides said 
the tree a colorado blue spruce transplanted to the ellipse 
from a farm in york pa in 1978 will be adorned with a 1000 
more white stars representing president bushs thousand points 
of light and several thousand red and blue lights over the next 
two weeks 
bush keeping up a tradition that president coolidge started in 
1923 will throw the switch to light the national tree at nightfall

a convention recruiter who had hoped public 
fervor was quelled when he promised city officials he would no 
longer take clients to a posh topless nightclub has learned that 
signs of the controversy still exist 
jordy tollett director of the houston civic center has found 
his explanation has become a giant endorsement for the nightclub 
printed in large yellow letters at the bottom of a 
40footby20foot billboard for ricks restaurant and bar are 
tolletts words our clients want to go there 
in september the houston post reported tollett had spent more 
than 2000 entertaining male clients at the club with funds from 
the greater houston visitors and convention bureau 75 percent of 
which come from taxes the civic center department with a 26 
million budget oversees the george r brown convention center 
among other facilities 
in his defense the mayoral appointee said he was wooing 
convention business 
unfortunately ricks just happens to be something thats very 
wellknown tollett said at the time they clients just 
wanted to go there i couldnt say you cant go there 
tollett was admonished privately by mayor kathy whitmire and 
subsequently promised never to take clients there again 
since then ricks owners have spent 6000 a month for three 
billboards 
the billboard also features endorsements from robin leach of 
lifestyles of the rich amp famous and penthouse magazine 
but the appearance of tolletts words has embarrassed him and 
angered mark henry the new president of the convention bureau 
i have limited sympathy for their discomfort because im very 
proud of my business and the city of houstons better off for it 
said robert watters an owner of ricks 
but there were sore feelings over the matter at ricks which 
boasts an expensive and sophisticated atmosphere 
its the same old hypocrisy thing said watters who said 
the convention bureau solicits its membership each year and 
privately acknowledges that conventioneers flock to the cabaret 
but he said publicly bureau officials complain about the club 
he said at first the endorsement was attributed to the bureau 
itself but after henry called several times to complain watters 
said the sign was changed to reflect tollett as author of the 
statement

the supreme court refused monday to allow new 
york city and perhaps other communities to enlist unwilling 
developers in the fight against spreading homelessness 
the justices without comment left intact a victory for 
developers who said new york city violated their rights by banning 
conversion or demolition of hotels that offer a haven for the poor 
elderly and ill 
the high court acted in more than 200 appeals but in an unusual 
move refused to grant full review in any so far this term the 
number of such grants is well behind previous terms 
in other developments the court 
refused to let public schools cut off educational help to 
severely handicapped children even though they may not be able to 
benefit from such services the court rejected an appeal by a new

allowed a woman charged with minor traffic violations to sue 
kentucky law enforcement officials who stripsearched her after her 
arrest 
left intact an overland park kan ordinance restricting the

the soviet union formally recognized 
monday the right of poland to evolve a political system free of 
outside interference 
in a joint declaration at the end of a fiveday visit to the 
soviet union by prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki head of polands 
noncommunist government the two nations expressed their concerns 
about a reunified germany 
the soviet union and poland welcomed the developing democratic 
landscape in east germany but voiced the conviction that the 
relationship between the two germanys must respect the border 
between east and west 
maintenance of the border has an unusually important 
significance for the maintenance of stability and security in 
europe the statement said 
both the soviet union and poland suffered deeply from nazi 
aggression during world war ii and polish officials have expressed 
concern about the potential emergence of a powerful unified germany 
in the heart of europe 
mazowieckis election aug 24 ended more than 40 years of 
communist rule in poland and has contributed to opening the way for 
other east european nations to introduce democratic reforms 
the moves have the support of president mikhail s gorbachev 
who says they are necessary for eastern europe to catch up to the 
west 
mazowiecki a former solidarity editor and close adviser to lech 
walesa exchanged views on the east bloc with soviet leaders 
concluding that the process of democratization is allowing the 
nations the freedom to choose their own form of government 
poland and the soviet union are to develop as before their 
alliance relations on the basis of mutual trust recognizing the 
free choice of the development of the socialpolitical path full 
reciprocity and noninterference in internal affairs it said 
they are determined to develop goodneighborliness and 
alliance relations between the two countries on the basis of new 
political thinking the document said 
it formalized the soviet guarantee that it would not interfere 
in the internal affairs of its east european neighbors even if 
they chose to reject communism 
the primary polish aim of the visit was to gain public soviet 
acceptance of the new government many of whose members come from 
the solidarity free trade union movement 
apart from developments in eastern europe the visit focused on 
economic issues the question of historical blank spots parts 
of history the communist authorities have rewritten or suppressed 
and the situation of the estimated 2 million soviet citizens of 
polish origin 
the statement said the soviet union was ready to maintain its 
supply of oil and raw materials in exchange for delivery of polish 
manufactured goods 
both sides agreed to coordinate future development of trade as 
poland converts its centrally planned economy to a marketoriented 
system trade with the soviet union accounts for onethird of 
polands foreign trade 
the hopes of many poles for a clear kremlin statement on the 
massacre of 4300 polish officers in the katyn forest in the soviet 
union during wold war ii were not met 
most poles and western historians believe the officers were 
murdered by the soviet secret police in 1940 the soviet union says 
the nazis were guilty 
on sunday mazowiecki made an emotional visit to the forest 
about 250 miles west of moscow and took part in a roman catholic 
mass in honor of the dead 
the statement said both countries believe that clarification of 
historical issues and above all the katyn question would 
strengthen their ties the two countries also agreed to create 
conditions to improve the situation of poles living in the soviet 
union 
the poles will be guaranteed the right to develop schools to 
teach the polish language create their own cultural societies and 
be able to attend church services 
mazowiecki traveled to leningrad on monday to meet with 
intellectuals in a city with which poland had close ties before the 
1917 bolshevik revolution 
some of polands most prominent poets lawyers and political 
activists of the 19th century studied in st petersburg as the 
city was known then and mazowieckis advisers say he is interested 
in reviving the ties 
mazowiecki was applauded warmly by about 50 intellectuals when 
he encouraged them to develop independent political and cultural 
initiatives

presidentelect luis lacalle whose 
national party gained ground in congress but fell short of a 
majority said monday he would try to form a coalition government 
his centerright national party won 374 percent of the votes in 
sundays general elections compared with 288 percent for the 
colorado party which has been in power 197 for the broad front 
and smaller totals for five other parties according to official 
count of 904 percent of returns 
the colorados also are centerright the broad front alliance is 
leftist and includes the socialist party communist party and 
former tupamaro guerrillas who tried to overthrow a colorado 
government in the late 1960s 
lacalles party was was projected to win 12 of the 30 senate 
seats and 38 places in the house of deputies which has 99 members 
he said meetings will be held this week to build a governing 
coalition which we consider indispensible for the correct 
functioning of the government 
taking a customary morning stroll beside a beach near his home 
the presidentelect said im aware the task that awaits me is 
very difficult but i always knew that 
president julio m sanguinetti of the colorados and jorge 
batlle the partys unsuccessful presidential candidate indicated 
support for a coalition 
sanguinetti who was barred by law from seeking another term and 
remains in office until march 1 said he did not see any 
particular inconvenience in opening the coalition to the broad 
front 
liber seregni the fronts presidential candidate told lacalle 
his party is disposed to talk in the search for solutions our 
country needs 
uruguay a small south american republic between argentina and 
brazil suffers from chronic inflation and economic stagnation 
a modest recovery occurred during sanguinettis fiveyear term 
but wages and pensions remain low the cost of living has risen 82 
percent this year and the gross national product of 8 billion 
improved by only about 1 percent 
public services in uruguay were a model for the continent in the 
1950s now schools and hospitals are deteriorating and electricity 
and gas are so expensive many people must use them sparingly 
lacalle a 48yearold senator pledged in his campaign to 
curtail inflation by negotiating a reduction of uruguays 63 
billion foreign debt thus freeing more public funds for other 
uses he proposes to sell some of the 3 million ounces of gold 
reserves and invest the money to earn interest 
areas in which talks with the broad front may founder are the 
foreign debt and lacalles plans for deregulation and getting the 
government out of an economy it has directed for decades 
labor and leftist political parties oppose paying the debt and 
fear selling state enterprises over to private owners may result in 
pay cuts and the loss of jobs 
we say we dont have to pay one cent of the foreign debt 
said julio marenales a founder of the tupamaros that money 
should be invested in the country

a reduction in us troops in western europe 
is an option president bush will bring to his meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev a white house spokesman said today 
but press secretary marlin fitzwater said the administration 
does not want to get the cart in front of the horse in 
discussing any such reductions prematurely and before consulting 
with nato allies 
any actions that we would suggest or recommend would only be 
with the appoval of our allies fitzwater said 
fitzwater said bush also will raise with gorbachev at the dec 
23 shipboard summit the issue of continued shipments of 
sovietbloc arms to leftist rebels in el salvador 
he noted that among weapons found over the weekend in the debris 
of a crashed nicaraguan aircraft destined for a salvadoran rebel 
base were sovietmade sa7 missiles 
bush will tell president gorbachev that the introduction of 
surfacetoair weapons in a guerrilla war in el salvador is a 
dangerous escalation of a conflict contrary to highlevel soviet 
assurances fitzwater said 
despite soviet promises to use their influence for peace in 
central america it is clear the sandinistas and their marxist 
allies continue to destabilize the legitimate democracies of the 
region fitzwater said 
conventional force reduction in europe will remain the subject 
for ongoing international negotiations fitzwater said 
noting the nations tight budget posture he said if there 
are arms control agreements or changes in military posturethat 
allow us to make defense spending cuts we certainly are willing to 
do that 
responding to reports that the upheaval in eastern europe could 
lead to major cuts in us defense spending fitzwater said 
certainly the two presidents in malta will talk about arms 
control and military force structure those discussions will bear 
on future decisions about changes in our own military posture 
asked whether bush planned to bring troop cuts to the table at 
malta fitzwater said the president will have in his mind all of 
the options that are available to him the president wants to be in 
a postion to discuss the situation with the soviet leader to be 
responsive and to be in a positon to then go to our allies and say 
heres what our discussion produced 
as the president considers the budget as he considers all of 
the options that might be available to us as a result of the 
reduction of soviet force strength there are all kinds of numbers 
floating around fitzwater added 
the events in eastern europe are expected to dominate next 
weekends superpower summit although bush and gorbachev also will 
be discussing arms control trade and regional conflicts from 
nicaragua to afghanistan

friends of british journalist john mccarthy who 
is held hostage in lebanon marked his 33rd birthday monday with a 
demonstration at the foreign office demanding it do more for his 
release 
they signed a giant card to celebrate his birthday his fourth 
in captivity released white doves and took out an ad in a beirut 
newspaper to appeal for him to be allowed to contact his family 
a dove is a symbol of peace said jill morrell a close 
friend of mccarthy we are releasing them as a gesture of freedom 
in the hope of galvanizing the foreign office to do more 
mccarthy a worldwide television news journalist was kidnapped 
april 17 1986 as he drove to beirut airport to fly home after 32 
days in lebanon 
it happened two days after the bombing raid on libya by us 
warplanes based in britain 
no group has claimed responsibility for mccarthys abduction and 
only in april 1988 did word emerge from released french hostages 
that he was alive no communication has been received from him and 
his captors have released no photos or videotapes 
mccarthy is among 18 westerners missing in lebanon and believed 
held by proiranian shiite moslems held longest is american terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
other missing britons are terry waite the anglican church envoy 
who went to beirut to try to free the hostages brian keenan a 
teacher holding british and irish citizenship alec collett a new 
yorkbased british journalist whose kidnappers say they killed him 
and jack mann a retired airline pilot 
the friends of john mccarthy ms morrells organization 
published a fullpage paid ad in beiruts leftist newspaper 
assafir 
to the people who are holding our friend john mccarthy we 
appeal to you to allow him contact with his family through 
whatever means you choose it said 
ms morrell said she wants evidence the foreign office is 
working for the hostages 
for 3 years we have had nothing but words she said when 
someone important like terry waite is among the hostages you would 
imagine the government moving heaven and earth to get them out 
but that hasnt happened they have just one person keeping an 
eye on the hostage situation the government is just standing by 
and letting it happen britain is tolerating what is happening to 
john and the other hostages ms morrell said 
a foreign office spokesman said several foreign office officials 
are following up every lead 
as foreign secretary douglas hurd said only one week ago we 
continue to make every effort to secure his release and the release 
of the other hostages said the spokesman he added that hurd 
would meet with ms morrell as soon as his schedule allowed 
probably after the new year holiday 
the friends of john mccarthy was formed six months after he 
disappeared and ms morrell also a tv journalist has been waging 
a campaign on mccarthys behalf 
it includes fundraising demonstrations and 150 billboards 
around london that say close your eyes and think of england 
john mccarthy has been doing nothing else for three years 
the billboards and a tv commercial were produced for free by the 
advertising agency bartle bogle hegarty 
theres a very strong feeling by people in the media to use 
whatever talents they have to help and this is what we can do 
best said stef tiratelli the executive responsible for the ad 
campaign 
inch by inch we have made progress said robin corbett an 
opposition labor party lawmaker involved with the campaign two 
years ago the government insisted there was no link with iran and 
the hostages and that has changed 
ms morrell said she is sure shell see mccarthy again 
other people have been released after a long time and theyre 
ok she said theyre in bad shape but theyre ok which gives 
me hope

the countrys main 
antiapartheid alliance monday called for an internationally 
supervised inquiry into allegations a police death squad 
assassinated government opponents 
the mass democratic movement a coalition of opposition groups 
said the inquiry should examine the possible complicity of 
topranking government officials including law and order minister 
adriaan vlok and president fw de klerk 
the movement also demanded the dismantling of the security 
branch of the national police force 
without such steps the movement said a few individuals will 
be made scapegoats while the biggest criminals those in command 
will be able to continue business as usual 
the movement said the international commission of jurists should 
send prominent judges from overseas to participate in an inquiry of 
the allegations based on recent claims by three former police 
officers that they were involved in a death squad 
dirk coetzee a white former police captain told the 
antiapartheid newspaper free weekly he commanded a squad of black 
constables that carried out assassinations in the early 1980s 
his statements meshed in many respects with those of two black 
former officers david tshikalange who like coetzee has fled south 
africa and butana nofomela who is on death row and received a 
stay of execution after making his allegations in an affidavit 
obtained by human rights lawyers 
lt gen lothar neethling one of the police officials 
implicated by coetzee on monday demanded a printed apology and 
200000 in damages from free weekly saying the newspaper had 
defamed him and placed his life in danger the newspaper quoted 
coetzee as saying neethling commander of the police forensic 
laboratories had concocted a poison for use in political 
assassinations 
de klerk in interviews published over the weekend by the 
washington post and newsweek magazine said the charges would be 
investigated right to the core to ensure that all the facts come 
to the table 
i will not stand for this sort of thing he said if the 
allegations prove to be true there will be action 
however the mass democratic movement said the entire 
government including de klerk must be forced to account for the 
allegedly broad scope of death squad activity 
recent circumstantial evidence tends to confirm our belief 
that there has been government complicity at every level in the 
operation of these death squads the movement said 
wideranging and drastic action is needed to put an end to these 
apartheid crimes 
there have been widespread calls for the appointment of a 
judicial commission to investigate the allegations but the mass 
democratic movement said the participation of overseas judges and 
south african human rights lawyers would be needed to ensure that 
governmentappointed south african judges on the commission pursued 
their task effectively 
the movement demanded the government compensate the families of 
activists allegedly killed by death squads it also said south 
african diplomats should be expelled from countries where south 
afican security officials were suspected of having carried out 
international terrorism

christian army commander gen michel aoun 
rejected an ultimatum to leave the presidential palace and said 
monday he would die fighting even with kitchen knives sticks 
and stones 
aoun told a news conference in his bunker beneath the 
shellbattered palace east of beirut that he was recruiting 
volunteers to meet a possible assault by the 40000 syrian soldiers 
stationed in lebanon 
military sources discounted reports of military buildups in 
mountains above the palace in the baabda suburb and along the line 
that divides moslem west beirut from the christian eastern sector 
a ranking moslem army officer said privately there is 
absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a collision is 
imminent 
he said the fronts are as they have been since the 
ceasefire that began sept 22 ending six months of fighting 
between the syrians and the 20000 men of aouns christian army 
units 
elias hrawi the newly elected president who gave aoun the 
ultimatum issued a statement at his temporary headquarers in the 
syriancontrolled bekaa valley town of chtoura urging christian 
troops to support him 
gen aoun is placing the lebanese nation at an impossible 
destructive and reckless option that leads only to the underground 
shelters while the presidency has decided to lead the nation 
out of the death mill to peace said hrawi a maronite catholic 
like aoun 
it is the legitimate governments right to employ all means 
and potenial to recover what has been usurped from it 
on sunday the president gave aoun 48 hours to leave the palace 
in his bunker the 54yearold general said sarcastically monday 
that hrawi should have been considerate enough to make it 72 
hours to give me enough time to pack and leave 
mr hrawi has no forces of his own to fight me with aoun 
said he will have to rely on syrias occupation forces 
aoun calls the syrian soldiers an occupation army and has 
declared a war of liberation to drive them out the syrians are 
in lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping mandate issued in 
1976 one year after the beginning of a sectarian civil war that 
has taken more than 150000 lives 
the syrians have the means to attack me from the air aoun 
said i might be killed in such an air attack i am going to die 
fighting ill fight even with kitchen knives sticks and stones to 
defend lebanons honor 
he said he had opened recruitment centers all over the free 
christian areas to take volunteers to share in the final battle 
for the defense of lebanon he said and accused syria of wanting 
to eliminate lebanon 
simon bitar 22 said outside the palace he had volunteered 
along with at least 8000 other young christians that number could 
not be confirmed 
after president amin gemayels sixyear term ended in september 
1988 with parliament unable to agree on a successor aoun led a 
christian cabinet in competition with a moslem government for 14 
months 
he rejected hrawis election friday as unconstitutional as he 
had the election of president rene mouawad who was killed 
wednesday 17 days after he was sworn in 
by unwritten covenant followed since independence from france in 
1943 lebanons president is a maronite the prime minister a sunni 
moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
aoun has denied syrian charges that he was behind the attack on 
mouawad on monday he repeated his own accusation that the syrians 
killed mouawad who was their staunch ally 
the general also opposed parliaments approval of a peace plan 
worked out by the legislators in weeks of negotiations at taif 
saudi arabia that is designed to give moslems an equal share of 
power 
christians were the majority in 1943 and have dominated the 
government army and judiciary since but moslems now make up about 
55 percent of the population 
reporters who went to the bunker saw an antiaircraft battery at 
the palace entrance and soldiers pouring mud as camouflage on an 
armored personnel carrier and a tank 
western journalists who toured souk elgharb and dhour 
elshweir the main gateways to baabda from syriancontrolled east 
lebanon said they did not see syrian reinforcements

when does a sea turtle egg become a 
turtle that twist on the old chickenegg debate is at the heart of 
an appeal by a man convicted of poaching more than 1000 sea turtle 
eggs 
some species of sea turtles are endangered so state law treats 
offenses against turtle life harshly 
james a bivens was found guilty in march sentenced to 60 days 
in jail and fined 500 plus 100 for each egg taken from the beach 
at john d macarthur beach state park on singer island for a total 
fine of 109300 
bivens appeal claims the fine is illegal because state law 
allows a judge to levy a 100 fine per unit of marine life 
an egg according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes a 
life when it is hatched is not a turtle bivens lawyer wrote 
in court briefs hence the universal question which came first 
the chicken or the egg 
oral arguments on the appeal are set for jan 18 
prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new one 
to them but ridiculous nevertheless 
if you kill an egg its not going to become a turtle 
obviously said barbara schroeder sea turtle recovery 
coordinator for the state department of natural resources 
but bivens thinks the laws concerning turtles are too vague 
just as a chicken is not an egg and when one eats eggs for 
breakfast one is not eating chicken a marine turtle is not a 
turtle until it comes out of its egg assistant public defender 
louis carres wrote on bivens behalf 
most of the eggs dont even turn into turtles said the 
public defender although he did not know what percentage of sea 
turtle eggs usually hatch 
carres did not defend his clients motive saying he was 
probably up to no good when caught with the eggs and should 
have been fined 500 for having them

the bush administration threatened today to 
suspend all us financial support for the united nations if the 
general assembly upgraded the status of palestine liberation 
organization 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler also condemned 
as objectionable a resolution under consideration in the un 
food and agricultural organization to channel food assistance to 
palestinians on the west bank and in gaza through the plo 
we strongly support humanitarian assistance to the palestinian 
people she said noting that the american contribution this year 
is 63 million 
the plo should not be a conduit for international assistance 
to the palestinians ms tutwiler said 
the united states continues to believe that raising this type 
of political issue in a meeting of a technical un body is wholly 
inappropriate it does nothing to contribute to the settlement of 
the political issue involved and does substantial harm to the 
faos credibility as an organization worthy of us support 
the plo has observer status as an organization the move afoot 
would elevate the plo to observer status as a state in the general 
assembly 
the united states opposes any enhancement in the un of the 
status of the selfproclaimed state of palestine ms tutwiler 
said 
she said the united states was making it clear in notes to 
various governments and to officials at the united nations that 
any action to change the plo status will have the most serious 
adverse consequences 
asked if us support would be withdrawn the spokeswoman said 
we feel so strongly about this we would cut off funds

three avowed revolutionaries were 
cleared this morning of trying to overthrow the government but the 
jury was still considering racketeering complaints 
after 18 days of deliberations the jury was allowed to return 
its partial verdict after it told district judge william young it 
was unable to decide whether two of the defendants were guilty of 
racketeering 
the jury also said it couldnt decide whether the two and the 
third defendant patricia levasseur were guilty of racketeering 
conspiracy for their roles in a series of bombings and robberies 
that began in 1976 
the government had contended the incidents were part of a plot 
to overthrow the government of the united states and as such 
constituted seditious conspiracy a charge rarely used since the 
civil war 
the judge had urged the jury to try and reach agreement on the 
remaining racketeering charges but the jury responded that it was 
quitting for the day and would resume deliberations tuesday 
prosecutors allege raymond levasseur his wife patricia and 
richard williams were members of a terrorist band that robbed banks 
and bombed buildings along the east coast from the mid1970s to 
1984 
the trial began in january and jurors got the case nov 6 
working through many weekends the jury took just one day off for 
the thanksgiving holiday 
defense attorneys have argued that the charges are vague and 
that there were other groups operating at the time the defendants 
are alleged to have plotted against the government 
jurors have asked to review some physical evidence in the case 
including footprint charts and testimony from a currency analyst in 
connection with one of the alleged bank robberies they also have 
asked for help in defining a seditious enterprise 
lawyers are reluctant to speculate what was happening in the 
jury room or how long a verdict on the other charges might take 
some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to be 
expected considering that the trial has taken 11 months and 
included testimony from about 200 witnesses 
when the trial began the defendants described themselves as 
north american antiimperialists who believe armed resistance is 
one of the necessary responses to apartheid racism sexism the 
massacres of native peoples and capitalistbacked wars 
there were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury 
selection in march 1988 prosecutors dropped charges against thomas 
manning and jaan karl laaman already serving lengthy sentences on 
other charges mannings wife carol manning pleaded guilty to 
sedition and other charges and a separate trial was ordered for 
laamans wife barbara curzilaaman

of her role and her past history there

talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds 
of ammunitions and explosives this is hardly a case of someone

home said firzwater

the berlin wall that for years was a 
symbol of communism is rapidly entering the capitalist marketplace 
as entrepeneurs hawk chunks of it as the perfect christmas gift 
impromptu businesses around the country are shipping the rubble 
of demolished sections of the wall to the united states and selling 
pieces in stores by telephone by mail order and on the street 
one of our retailers says the two hottest items this christmas 
will be pieces of the berlin wall and the dancing flowers said 
richard a dale vice president of sales and marketing for hyman 
creative products in this detroit suburb 
the dancing flower is just a joke but this is not to be taken 
as a joke we offer this because it has commemorative value for all 
time dale said 
there are some very real feelings associated with it it 
stands for oppression and hardship and we try to respect that 
said bob schnur hyman vice president of finance 
hyman will package twoounce pieces of concrete from the 22 
sections of the berlin wall that have been knocked down since east 
germany opened the barrier between east berlin and west berlin the 
chunks for sale through department store chains come in boxes 
with certificates of authenticity 
service merchandise stores and the st louisbased may 
department store co have commitments to sell wall chunks dale 
said hyman also is talking to k mart corp bloomingdales main new 
york city store has taken 200 rocks to test demand buyer jack 
gandolfo said 
the chunks are expected to sell for 10 
schnur said his company has the most abundant supply of wall 
rubble 35 tons and plans on shipping in up to an additional 15 
tons 
other walldealing ventures include bampp imports a company 
formed by a house painter and a car salesman in munster ind 
bampp has been taking about 300 requests a day by phone and by 
mail coowner paul wells said his company has sold about 500 
pounds of concrete already 
authenticating the chunks is costly and bampp partner william 
bell acknowledged that someone could fraudulently sell ordinary 
concrete chunks as pieces of the wall 
actually if somebody wanted to do it they probably could 
its just a matter of morals bell said we have three pieces 
of paper with ours a us customs declaration an affidavit of 
authenticity and the shipping papers people are real willing to 
believe us they just want some measure of proof 
jameson broadcast inc which produces and sells radio 
programming sent 5000 nuggetsize pieces to nearly 100 stations 
in all 50 states as well as stations in dublin ireland and new 
zealand 
wllzfm a jameson client in the detroit area gave 25 chunks to 
listeners who sent requests by facsimile machine saying why they 
wanted the pieces and 25 to callers 
one listener a former us soldier who served at the wall 
wanted a piece of the miracle something he thought hed never 
see 
the distributors say most people want a piece of the wall for 
the historic value 
im 36 and anyone who spent part of their childhood in the 
early 60s will be able to relate to the idea of the berlin wall 
and what it stood for schnur said khrushchev said he would 
bury the us kennedy made his speech in berlin there were 
airraid drills bomb shelters the wall coming down signals an 
end to that era 
dale appeared on a radio show recently and said one listener 
called the station and asked how to get a chunk of the wall the 
person said one of their relatives died trying to get across the 
wall he said 
the companies wouldnt disclose their costs some havent seen 
the bills yet for shipping the rubble from berlin wells said 
shipping runs about 4 a pound 
and they wont reveal the contacts that enabled them to acquire 
parts of the wall 
my partner had to have a lot of contacts for this to happen 
dale said but its still going on right now and i wouldnt want 
to jeopardize our returns 
bampp admitted we get it from a friend there actually its 
vandalism

despite the easing of eastwest 
tensions european defense ministers monday urged the united states 
to remain strongly committed to the defense of their continent 
the ministers representing european members of the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization welcomed the rapid changes in 
eastern europe but cautioned the allies should keep up their guard 
we need to be careful said spanish defense minister 
narcis serra who is president of the eurogroup made up of a dozen 
european nations in nato 
the statement comes amid reports the united states is planning 
sharp cuts in the pentagons budget the reports have raised 
concern about the united states future ties to europe 
us defense secretary dick cheney arrived in brussels from the 
netherlands for tuesdays start of a twoday meeting of alliance 
defense ministers at nato headquarters 
serra said the european defense chiefs put off until tuesday 
discussions of possible us defense cuts wanting to hear 
firsthand from cheney 
in the netherlands cheney promised that no us troops would be 
pulled out of europe without an eastwest agreement on reducing 
conventional or nonnuclear arms the dutch government said 
dutch defense minister relus ter beek quoted cheney as saying he 
expected the conventional arms talks in vienna to be followed by 
another round of disarmament negotiations between nato and the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
withdrawal of american troops from the european continent 
will take place only after a conventional arms agreement ter 
beek said after meeting with cheney 
according to the dutch official cheney said the pentagons 
budgetcutting work would not affect the western alliance before a 
conventional arms pact was reached the defense department is 
drawing up plans to cut planned increases in us military spending 
by 180 billion in the 199294 budget years 
the united states has 340000 troops based in western europe 
most of them in west germany 
cheney was quoted in us newspapers as saying that more cuts in 
american forces in europe than now under consideration may be 
possible because of the erosion of the soviet military threat 
the stunning political reforms in eastern europe have prompted 
talk of a reduced or different role for the military alliances 
in the future 
but the european defense ministers cautioned that periods of 
rapid change and transformation may carry risks of their own 
even after promised arms reductions by the soviet union and its 
allies the warsaw pact still will retain military forces which 
substantially outnumber those of the alliance in europe the 
ministers said 
the presence of us nuclear and conventional forces in europe 
remains vital to the security of europe just as europes 
security is vital to that of north america the ministers said 
we therefore reaffirm the high priority that we attach to the 
continuing us commitment to the defense of europe 
they called for a successful conclusion of the conventional arms 
talks we need a prompt agreement at vienna serra said 
nato officials expect an accord to be completed next year 
such an agreement would lead to hefty cuts in tanks armored 
troop carriers and artillery pieces in an area spanning the 
atlantic to the ural mountains in the soviet union president bush 
in may urged big reductions in us and soviet troops stationed in 
europe by 1993 
the european officials also said there have been improvements in 
some contributions to nato the subject has been a sore point in 
the alliance critics in the united states complain that some 
european members dont do enough for the western defense while 
washington does too much 
but the europeans said italy luxembourg norway spain and 
britain have increased planned defense spending and that spain for 
the first time agreed to contribute to natos military budget 
nato defense ministers meet twice a year in their role as the 
defense planning committee france which is outside natos 
military structure does not attend iceland which has no armed 
forces has observer status

a colombian jet with 107 people aboard 
crashed in flames today outside bogota and officials said all on 
board were killed a caller to a radio station claimed drug 
traffickers bombed the jet 
witnesses reported seeing the avianca airlines boeing 727100 
explode before it plummeted to the ground at about 715 am 
hours later a person called the caracol radio network and said 
the extraditables a shadowy group linked to the medellin drug 
cartel bombed the plane because police informants were on board 
the caller did not identify himself and there was no way to 
authenticate the claim 
the airline refused comments on reports the plane exploded col 
edgar leal chief of national police in the state said 
investigators had not found anything to indicate a bomb blew it up 
avianca spokeswoman patricia duarte said the plane crashed into 
a hilly area just south of bogota the capital she said all 101 
passengers and six crew members were killed 
rcn radio quoted officials at the control tower at el dorado 
airport in bogota as saying the jet crashed three minutes after 
taking off for the city of cali 190 miles to the southwest 
it quoted the flight controller as saying the pilot reported 
everything normal seconds before communication with the plane was 
lost 
the plane exploded in the air and then fell to the ground and 
caused a huge explosion said jairo alba who witnessed the 
crash alba interviewed by the rcn radio network said the jet was 
destroyed 
radio stations quoted other witnesses as saying they saw smoke 
pouring from one of the three engines and then seeing the plane 
blow up 
the plane was flying along when suddenly it exploded broke in 
two and fell in flames and smoke witness alfonso moreno told 
radio caracol 
i heard explosions and i thought there was some problem with 
transformers in the electrical station but i looked up and saw a 
plane explode in the air and bodies and pieces of luggage were 
falling another witness mario vasquez said 
the chief of the civil aviation authority col jorge gonzalez 
said the crew of a colombian air force jet flying in the area saw 
two explosions on the jet he spoke to the radio networks rcn and 
caracol 
no one on the ground appeared to have been hurt gonzalez said 
caracol said flight 203 just cleared the southern edge of this 
city of 6 million when it crashed witnesses said wreckage was 
scattered for miles 
the nationalities of those on board were not immediately known 
boeing co spokesman tom cole in seattle said the company would 
send investigators to bogota to help determine the cause of the 
crash 
the government of president virgilio barco declared war on drug 
traffickers in august and since then there have been several 
bombings and other attacks but none on a large scale 
the person who claimed responsibility on behalf of the 
extraditables said six informants on the plane were targeted 
because they gave police information that led to the discovery of 
the hiding place of the head of the medellin cocaine cartel 
the extraditables take their name from the us justice 
departments list of 12 colombian drug suspects most wanted in the 
united states the head of the medellin cartel pablo escobar tops 
the list 
last week authorities raided a jungle hideout and escobar 
reportedly came close to capture 
the last major passenger jet crash in colombia occurred march 
17 1988 when an avianca boeing 727100 crashed into a mountain 
near the northern city of zulia killing 138 people 
on july 27 1985 an air force transport plane crashed in the 
amazon jungle killing all 74 people aboard the military plane was 
carrying passengers because of a airline strike

thirteen blacks including 
three policemen have been killed in the latest outbreak of 
factional fighting and political unrest in natal province police 
said monday 
six policemen have been killed in the province in the past week 
police have not said whether the attacks on the policemen were 
connected and the report of other killings sunday gave few 
details feuding among political groups rural clans and criminal 
gangs have claimed more than 3000 lives in the zulu areas of natal 
in the past three years 
most of the fighting has been between supporters of inkatha a 
zulu political organization headed by mangosuthu buthelezi and 
members of the banned united democratic front a multiracial 
organization 
the front supporters oppose the participation of buthelezi and 
inkatha in the kwazulu homeland government buthelezi condemns the 
fronts use of boycotts and encouragement of economic sanctions 
against south africa buthelezi also opposes the guerrilla tactics 
of the african national congress which is affiliated with the 
united democratic front 
african national congress leader walter sisulu recently freed 
from prison blamed the natal violence on the governments policy 
of dividing blacks into tribal homelands 
in a speech sunday in transkei the homeland of the xhosa 
people sisulu said the policy of divide and rule is one which 
we will destroy he said the frequently interrupted attempts to 
bring the natal factions together in peace talks had been 
resuscitated 
police headquarters in pretoria said monday that 10 black 
civilians had been killed in natal in the past 24 hours 
also police said a black municipal policeman was hit on the 
head with a blunt instrument and killed sunday in the township of 
steadville near ladysmith a black sergeant was shot to death by 
three blacks as he got into his car after visiting a colleague in 
gamalakhe near port shepstone on saturday night and a reserve 
constable was surrounded by a group of 15 blacks and stabbed to 
death as he left a rural homestead near inanda on friday night 
the report said most of the violence occurred at kwamashu a 
black township on the outskirts of the indian ocean city of durban 
where 25000 people had marched to the police station sunday to 
present a petitition accusing the police of brutality united 
democratic front supporters say most kwazulu police favor inkatha 
and buthelezi is the chief of the homeland police 
police did not say whether the violence preceded or followed the 
march but one man was found stabbed to death one beaten to death 
and two burnt to death a black constable defending himself 
against a crowd fired birdshot killing a man police said two 
other men and a 15yearold boy were stabbed by crowds in three 
separate incidents police said unknown attackers shot or stabbed 
to death other black men in several townships in the province

republican j marshall coleman said today 
he will seek a recount and contest the results of the governors 
race which he narrowly lost to democrat l douglas wilder by less 
than half a percentage point 
in official returns certified today by the state board if 
elections wilder received 897139 votes to 890285 for coleman out 
of nearly 18 million ballots cast for a margin of 6854 votes or 
38 percent 
colemans announcement came about three hours before the state 
board of elections announced the official results of closest 
gubernatorial election in virginia history 
the unofficial returns from the nov 7 election had shown wilder 
defeating coleman by 6852 votes 
coleman said previously he probably would seek a recount if the 
certified margin of wilders victory was less than one halfpercent 
of the 178 million votes cast or about 9000 votes 
coleman had until dec 7 to request a recount but today was the 
deadline for contesting the election to the state legislature 
because of alleged irregularities 
in an election as close as this one irregularities which 
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a 
greater importance coleman said in a letter to leaders of the 
democratcontrolled general assembly 
susan fitzhugh secretary of the board of elections said there 
is no precedent for a statewide recount she has declined to 
estimate the length of time or cost of the recount which would be 
overseen by a panel of three judges headed by the chief judge of 
the richmond circuit court 
wilder has distanced himself from debate over whether coleman 
should accept the certified vote 
weve said all along the ball is in the losers court 
wilder spokeswoman laura dillard said 
wilder has proceeded with plans for his inauguration jan 13 as 
virginias third straight democratic governor and has named a 
transition team 
the grandson of slaves and former state senator from richmond 
was elected lieutenant governor in 1985

a prosecutor told a judge today he will 
put officials on the stand to support the states contention that a 
former exxon tanker skipper should not escape prosecution for 
causing the nations worst oil spill 
at a pretrial hearing in the case of joseph hazelwood state 
assistant attorney general leonard linton jr said he planned to 
call several coast guard officers and a state environmental 
official as witnesses 
linton told superior court judge karl johnstone that he also 
planned to put on the stand residents of ellamar a prince william 
sound village from which the exxon valdez was seen after it became 
impaled on bligh reef 
hazelwood was captain of the 987foot tanker when it ripped its 
hull open on the reef early march 24 after leaving the alaska oil 
pipeline terminal at valdez the vessel spilled nearly 11 million 
gallons of heavy north slope crude oil into prince william sound 
shortly after the spill exxon fired hazelwood a veteran 
mariner from huntington ny 
hazelwood 43 is accused of reckless endangerment operating a 
vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil all 
misdemeanors and three felony counts of criminal mischief 
his trial is set for jan 22 
hazelwoods lawyers have said they would try to get his case 
thrown out on claims of immunity a flawed sobriety test and other 
grounds 
defense motions included claims that hazelwood received immunity 
from prosecution when he reported his ships grounding and the oil 
spill the morning it happened a law intended to encourage 
selfreporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills 
provides protection against selfincrimination laywers contend 
they say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against 
hazelwood grew from his report to the coast guard that the exxon 
valdez was aground and leaking oil 
linton said however that discovery of the spill was 
inevitable he contends the position that hazelwoods informing the 
coast guard ultimately led to the evidence against him is 
groundless 
a federal judge in fairbanks refused last month to block 
hazelwoods trial in state court 
the oil blackened hundreds of miles of shoreline killed tens of 
thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted lucrative 
fishing seasons exxon said it spent more than 1 billion on oil 
spill claims and cleanup work and state officials say the cleanup 
suspended for the winter is unfinished 
the case was moved from valdez to anchorage because of concerns 
that publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an 
impartial jury the port in southcentral alaska relies heavily on 
the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial fishing interests 
if convicted of the three felonies hazelwood faces a possible 
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and 100000 in fines

the president dissolved parliament on 
monday leaving prime minister rajiv gandhi and a caretaker 
government to see india through what could be weeks of 
postelection uncertainty 
gandhis congress party had overwhelming control of parliament 
but voters in the worlds most populous democracy took it away in 
three days of elections that began wednesday and left the party 
far short of a majority 
to retain power congress must find partners for would be the 
first coalition government since india became independent of 
britain in 1947 
the prime minister who won a landslide victory for the congress 
party two months after the oct 31 1984 assassination of his 
mother prime minister indira gandhi was leading his own race for 
reelection to parliament 
vote tabulations put congress ahead of any single opposition 
group but not far enough to govern alone 
the party of gandhis grandfather jawaharlal nehru has been 
out of power only once for 29 months that began after an election 
loss in 1977 to an alliance that later came apart the prime 
ministers during those 29 months were moraji desai and charan singh 
president ramaswamy venkataraman took the first step toward a 
coalition monday by dissolving parliament on the cabinets 
recommendation parliament normally is dissolved before elections 
but indian law does not require it 
growing opposition to gandhis leadership was reported within 
his party 
if congress wants to win anything the prime minister must 
go said bhabani sen gupta an independent analyst with rajiv 
gandhi very few things are possible without rajiv gandhi many 
things are possible 
when all votes are counted the president probably will ask the 
party with the most seats to try assemble a majority in the 
543seat lok sabha or house of people the lower house of 
parliament where the power lies 
many opposition leaders argued the president should turn to the 
party or alliance with the most popular support regardless of the 
number of seats involved 
the two largest opposition groups the fiveparty national front 
and the rightwing hindu bharatiya janata indian peoples party 
opened talks on a forming a coalition 
yashwant sinha spokesman for the janata dal or peoples party 
the main group in the national front said the national front 
will form the next government 
our position will be quite clear in the next two or three 
days we will know who will be in the government who the 
leader will be and we will approach the president and tell him 
that we are in a position to form the next government 
state tv compiled results from the election commission by 
monday night winners were known for 400 of the 525 seats at stake 
in the elections held wednesday friday and sunday 
congress party and its smaller allies had 193 seats and the 
national front 89 the opposition alliance is led by vishwanath 
pratap singh a former congress party member and trusted cabinet 
minister 
bharatiya janata which wants to transform india from a secular 
to a hindu state had 70 seats the others went to smaller parties 
and independent candidadtes 
singh 58 was expected to win his constituency in northern 
uttar pradesh state but the count was delayed by floods 
both congress and bharatiya janata dismissed the possibility of 
a coalition between them 
we will contemptuously reject any overtures said anand 
sharma a congress party spokesman congress is not in a tearing 
hurry we refuse to think of compromising on principles to form the 
government we do not go to anybody to seek support 
he acknowledged something did go wrong in the election but 
insisted the party was solidly behind gandhi 
lal krishna advani president of the bharatiya janata party 
said i will not make deals with the congress party i will see 
to it that they fall from power his party won only two seats in 
1984 
gandhi a former airline pilot was carried to power a wave of 
sympathy after sikh bodyguards killed his mother and congress 
captured an unprecedented 415 seats in the lok sabha 
euphoria greeted his promises to moderize the nation of 880 
million people and prepare it for the 21st century but soon was 
dispelled by allegations of corruption and ineptitude in gandhis 
government 
most corruption reports teemmed from newspaper investigations of 
alleged kickbacks in a 1986 deal with bofors the swedish arms 
manufacturer 
several papers claimed bofors paid up to 50 million in 
kickbacks to get a 14 billion artillery contract gandhi denied 
such payments were made but could not shake the scandal

the communist party daily pravda in its loudest 
praise so far for the political changes in czechoslovakia on 
monday called it a natural and appropriate process of renewal 
the pravda commentary also indicted the old czechoslovak 
leadership for letting its chance to oversee reform go by saying 
it waited vacillated for every step forward made one step 
back 
in a similar vein soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri 
gremitskikh said the government hopes the growing dialogue among 
political groups in czechoslovakia will further the renewal of 
socialism in czechoslovakia 
asked about the absence in the soviet press of a congratulatory 
telegram from president mikhail s gorbachev to the new head of the 
czechoslovak communist party karel urbanek gremitskikh dismissed 
it as having no significance 
he lack of the customary telegram could have been construed as a 
sign of disfavor but gremitskikh attributed it to logistical 
problems saying the telegram is on the way and will be 
published so there is nothing dramatic in its delay 
he also indicated the soviet union wont reject the 1968 
sovietled warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia to crush the 
prague spring reform until the czechoslovak leadership does its 
own historical revision 
if there is to be a reevaluation it has to be a 
reevaluation by everyone gremitskikh said 
pravda concluded that czechoslovakia is once again on a 
crossroads there the natural and appropriate process of the 
renewal of socialism which started earlier in other countries of 
eastern europe is taking place 
correspondent s vtorushin commented that czechoslovakia has the 
advantage of being able to look to the other eastern european 
reforms in east germany hungary and poland to profit from 
their experience 
soviet tv repeatedly has broadcast footage of the hundreds of 
thousands of protesters in pragues streets and newspapers have 
carried accounts of the leadership reshuffle as well 
despite the soviet unions recent problems with strikes 
particularly in coal mines that involved hundreds of thousands of 
workers tass on monday carried a brief factual account of 
czechoslovakias general strike as well

the european community commission said 
monday it has signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with 
the soviet union that goes beyond similar deals signed in the past 
14 months with hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
the pact provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas on 
soviet industrial goods by 1995 and cites a dozen areas in which 
the two sides plan to establish economic cooperation an ec source 
said 
these include science and technology banking transport 
agriculture environmental protection energy raw materials and 
mining the accord excludes trade in goods considered to be 
sensitive militarily according to the source who asked not to be 
identified 
he said the agreement calls for reciprocity in trade benefits 
that is the objective of this accord to get an effective 
access to the russian market for ec products the source said 
officials could not give an assessment of the economic impact of 
the agreement 
ec trade with eastern europe is small it totaled 56 billion in 
1987 the last year for which complete figures are available 
ecsoviet trade that year was only 246 billion 
the agreement with moscow was reached after five days of talks 
between ec commission and soviet negotiators it must be approved 
by the 12 ec states and the european parliament 
that is a formality however given the ecs interest in 
increasing economic links with eastern europe and getting access to 
its market of 390 million consumers 
the soviet accord negotiated in about four months is the 
fourth the ec has signed with an east european nation in just over 
a year 
it signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with 
hungary in september 1988 a more limited deal with czechoslovakia 
covering only trade in manufactured goods was signed in december 
1988 and an agreement with poland was signed sept 19 
these accords follow a june 25 1988 agreement under which the 
ec and the moscowled comecon trade bloc after years of ignoring 
one another signed a mutual recognition agreement in luxembourg 
the ec on monday also widened market access for farm and textile 
goods from poland and hungary through the measure which will be 
in effect only during 1990 the ec suspended import quotas for the 
two countries that are fixed through the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the world trade body 
in a statement the 12 ec foreign ministers said the oneyear 
lifting of quotas was an exceptional solution to an exceptional 
problem and represents no change in the ecs overall position on 
quotas in world trade 
the move follows an ec decision nov 6 to increase market access 
for industrial goods from poland and hungary 
the ec foreign ministers were notified of the agreement with the 
soviet union but did not discuss the issue in depth 
the soviet accord goes further than any other deal the ec has 
signed with an east european nation notably by subjecting nuclear 
energy safety and mining to economic cooperation sources said 
also on monday european community external relations 
commissioner frans andriessen called developments in czechoslovakia 
of the last week a cause for profound rejoicing throughout 
europe 
political reform and economic liberalization in czechoslovakia 
form part of a wider process which for the first time in more than 
40 years offers to future generations the prospect of a europe no 
longer riven by division he said 
ec officials said it was too early to speak of a widening of the 
accord with czechoslovakia 
the commission is still negotiating trade and economic 
cooperation agreements with bulgaria and east germany talks with 
east germany are in an exploratory stage but will likely be 
speeded up by next weeks visit to east berlin by andriessen 
east germany has asked the ec for an accord on trade and 
economic cooperation the ec has broken off talks for closer 
economic ties with romania in view of its human rights record

he had been in a column of workers many in stained overalls 
that poured into the street after sirens from two fire trucks 
bedecked with the blue red and white national flag sounded the 
beginning of a twohour general strike 
the column joined tens of thousands filling the street to listen 
to speakers addressing them from atop a flatbed truck 
signs called for free elections an end to oneparty rule and 
free trade unions 
others greeted the civic forum the opposition group that sprang 
to life earlier this month after police brutally suppressed a 
peaceful student demonstration 
i never voted said varga who said he makes about 350 a 
month slightly less than the average pay of a bluecollar worker 
i knew that these elections were always faked 
on top of the truckturnedplatform workers mingled with 
students and actors waiting to speak even three policemen wanted 
to contribute 
one after another they called for a change in the system 
drawing rousing cheers and chanted slogans long live the 
students these are the demands of a free people and 
thanks to the forum 
one worker demanded that all czechoslovak communists who helped 
the warsaw pact invaders crush the prague soring reforms be 
brought to trial 
it was at the ckd plant where varga works that the last 
general strike was proclaimed two days after the invasion of aug 
21 1968 
jeers and shouts of shame went up when another speaker 
cited the name of a ckd worker who was elected to the partys 
ruling politburo in a reshuffle of the leadership less than 12 
hours earlier he is not one of us the crowd chanted 
this is just the beginning someone in the crowd said as the 
rally ended with czechoslovakias national anthem 
we will continue now we will go to wenceslas square for a new 
demonstration this is the 11th day he said 
its fantastic said a worker who identified himself only as 
martin imagine this comes after half a century of no freedom 
first under the nazis and then under the communists 
martin said he went to the united states after the 1968 invasion 
but returned a year later because i was homesick 
flags were lowered from many windows of the drab apartment 
blocks facing the 400yardlong front of the plant the largest of 
the ckd group two men stood atop a building swinging a flag 
precariously close to the edge of the roof 
where is the peoples militia someone asked referring to 
the communist partys paramilitary force that had been guarding the 
gates of all factories in recent days 
at one point they were officially reported to have been asked 
to help police to maintain public order during the giant 
demonstrations havent seen them was the answer from another 
bystander but they have sent word that they will never act 
against the workers

rafael leonardo callejas the 
opposition national partys winning presidential candidate called 
monday for talks with members of the liberal party on solving 
honduras economic crisis 
the only way to solve the problems of inflation and 
unemployment is to create an economy thats strong and 
productive said callejas who beat carlos flores of the 
incumbent liberals in elections sunday 
callejas a 46yearold ustrained agricultural economist 
also accepted congratulations from minor party candidates and the 
us embassy on his victory flores did not make a concession 
statement 
callejas inauguration jan 27 will mark the first peaceful 
transition of power to an opposition party in honduras in 57 years 
what hondurans have accomplished should prove to be an 
inspirational example to other peoples of the region who also seek 
democracy the us embassy said in an obvious reference to 
neighboring nicaragua 
the problem of central american peace will be one of the first 
and most difficult to confront callejas the country borders el 
salvador and nicaragua and honduras has long served as a base for 
ussupported contras trying to overthrow the sandinista 
government 
el salvador broke relations with nicaragua on sunday over arms 
smuggling to salvadors leftist guerrillas and callejas said he 
would be willing to participate in a central american summit if 
incumbent president jose azcona hoyo is agreeable 
callejas has said peace is vital to his effort to attract new 
foreign investment to honduras there has been no significant new 
investment in years but he suggested no new ideas during the 
campaign 
he has said he supports the presence of us troops on training 
missions for as long as central america remains unstable 
other problems callejas will face include high unemployment 
estimates put the figure at 1 million in a nation of 52 million 
war refugees inflation a 32 billion foreign debt on which 
no payment has been made this year and an economy closed by 
protectionism have all combined to leave honduras one of the 
poorest nations in the hemisphere with a per capita annual income 
estimated at 500 
callejas said in a radio interview monday that he would not 
devalue the lempira which has been pegged at 21 against the us 
dollar since 1918 although the current black market rate is 41 
however callejas said he would attempt to install a twotier 
system with a 21 rate for things like petroleum and medicine with 
a free or different rate for other trade 
callejas a moderate conservative who admires president carlos 
salinas de gortaris efforts to modernize mexico has also promised 
to decentralize the government sell some stateowned companies 
cut the budget and create incentives for export and investment 
official vote totals were stalled by computer problems but 
unofficial vote totals gathered by radio and television showed 
callejas with a clear lead over flores 
with about 67 percent of the vote in callejas had 595807 
votes or about 502 percent to liberal carlos flores 526110 or 
about 443 percent 
callejas said he believed his party would take 69 or 70 of the 
unicameral legislatures 130 seats as well as the mayoralty ot 
tegucigalpa the capital and largest city 
the mayoralty of the secondlargest city and commercial center 
san pedro sula was in doubt but a strong nationalist showing 
there showed how deeply callejas had cut into the liberals 
traditional strongholds 
the liberal party didnt lose the people of honduras lost 
said party treasuere jorge roberto maradiaga 
flores who reportedly was in san pedro sula released no 
statement monday his newspaper la tribuna headlined callejas 
claims victory 
below was another headline conservatives also win in 
uruguay

mission control directed 
discoverys astronauts to remain in space at least an extra 90 
minutes today because of high winds in californias mojave desert 
the earliest new landing time for the secret military mission 
was 431 pm pst one orbit later than planned 
the winds were not as strong as the 30 mph gusts that forced 
nasa to call off a landing attempt on sunday but they were high 
enough at nearly 20 mph to make landing conditions unacceptable at 
all three shuttle landing runways 
mission control commentator billie deason said forecasters 
expected conditions to be acceptable at runway 17 on rogers dry 
lake at the new tentative landing time 
the five astronauts reportedly deployed a spy satellite during 
their mission 
sundays postponement marked the sixth time in 32 shuttle 
flights that a landing has been delayed by weather 
nasa initially rescheduled the landing for 432 pm pst today 
but mission control decided to bring the shuttle back at 252 pm 
pst to reduce sun glare about an hour before landing the crew was 
to ignite the shuttles reentry rockets for the fiery dive through 
the atmosphere 
the change to the earlier landing opportunity takes advantage 
of higher sun angle thereby reducing sun glare on discoverys 
windows during landing deason said sunday night about 1 hours 
after nasa announced the landing delay 
nasa said today that the forecast was acceptable for this 
afternoon with a clear sky and 12 mph wind gusting to 17 mph 
mission rules dictate that a shuttle not land during the day if a 
crosswind exceeds 17 mph or 12 mph for night landings 
the delay does not pose a threat to the astronauts because 
discovery carries enough fuel and other supplies to remain in orbit 
at least through tuesday 
discoverys commander is air force col frederick d gregory 
his crew members are air force col john blaha the pilot and 
mission specialists navy capt manley carter jr f story musgrave 
and kathryn c thornton 
in announcing the delay mission control also said the 
astronauts continued to be in excellent condition but a 
militaryimposed news blackout that has shrouded most of the 
mission kept space agency officials from discussing the crews 
reaction to the delay 
if bad weather persisted at edwards other available landing 
sites included white sands nm or cape canaveral fla the 
national aeronautics and space administration prefers edwards 
because of the long wideopen runways 
discoverys flight began wednesday with a dazzling nighttime 
liftoff at cape canaveral it was the third shuttle launch after 
dark and sundays landing was to have been only the third at night 
the afterdark blastoff was dictated by the shuttles cargo and 
its mission 
sources close to the project have said that the astronauts 
achieved their main goal thursday when they released the 2ton 
300 million satellite to eavesdrop on communications in the soviet 
union europe africa and the middle east 
the astronauts also reportedly conducted experiments connected 
with the star wars missile defense system it was believed the 
astronauts also conducted research into how people can serve as 
military observers in space 
as discovery headed home the space shuttle columbia was being 
prepared for a 10day christmas mission to deploy a navy 
communications satellite and retrieve a scientific payload that has 
been orbiting the earth for nearly six years columbia is scheduled 
to be moved to the launch pad at cape canaveral on tuesday

the bush administration threatened monday to 
suspend all us financial support for the united nations if the 
general assembly recognizes palestine as a country 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said there was 
no such nation and it did not meet the un criteria for membership 
it was not immediately clear whether the us threat would 
thwart the drive planned by a number of arab countries later in the 
week in the general assembly 
the united states does not have veto power in the assembly but 
its support for the united nations is essential to functioning of 
the world body 
the us assessment for 1988 was 216 million of which 65 
million was paid in october 
any action to change the plo status will have the most serious 
adverse consequences for the un ms tutwiler said 
the assembly on wednesday is due to begin a debate on the 
arabisraeli conflict with particular attention to the west bank 
and gaza the territories were lost by jordan and egypt to israel 
in the 1967 mideast war 
palestinians in the territories have been demonstrating against 
israeli control for nearly two years all the arab governments 
meanwhile recognize the plo as the only legitimate representative 
of the palestinians 
earlier this year the world health organization which is a 
un agency and the world tourism office which is affiliated with 
the united nations considered giving the plo membership 
secretary of state james a baker iii threatened in may to 
suspend us assistance to any world organization that recognized 
palestine as a state both groups deferred further action 
the plo has observer status at the united nations the move 
planned within the general assembly would give it observer status 
as a nation rather than as an organization 
in a parallel drive several arab governments were trying within 
the food and agriculture organization in rome to channel assistance 
to palestinians on the west bank and in gaza through the plo also 
they would give the plo national recgonition within the food and 
agriculture organization 
ms tutwiler in behalf of the state department denounced that 
drive as well 
we strongly support humanitarian assistance to the palestinian 
peopple she said 
but the official added the plo should not be a conduit for 
international assistance to the palestinians the united states 
continues to believe that raising this type of political issue in a 
meeting of a technical un body is wholly inappropriate it does 
nothing to contribute to the settlement of the political issue 
involved and does substantial harm to the faos credibility as an 
organization worthy of us support 
the united states opposes any enhancement in the un of the 
status of the selfproclaimed state of palestine ms tutwiler 
said 
reading from a prepared statement the us official said 
palestine does not satisfy the criteria for statehood or meeting 
the membership requirements of the united nations 
she said the state department had sent messages to several 
countries outlining the us position and was making its views 
known at the highest levels of the united nations in new york 
asked if us support would be withdrawn if the assembly went 
ahead ms tutwiler said we feel so strongly about this we would 
cut off funds

a project to feed bald eagles with deer killed on 
the highways is failing because the eagles are too finicky federal 
officials say 
the us fish and wildlife service has been collecting mule deer 
carcasses along highways especially those close to the foothills 
west of denver and bringing them to the rocky mountain arsenal as 
eagle food 
but the bald eagles apparently are uninterested in the deer 
officials said leaving the agency swamped with dead deer 
weve got a third of a refrigerated semitrailer filled up and 
were still averaging four deer a day from across the area said 
wildlife service biologist mike lockhart 
lockhart said the pilot project may have to be suspended if so 
the business of disposing of road kills would fall back to county 
crews which typically dump the animals at landfills 
the state wildlife division reports about 1000 deer killed 
annually on roads throughout the front range 
fish and wildlife service biologist pete gober in lakewood said 
monday the project began in early november when eagles arrive to 
winter at the arsenal it probably will continue as long as the 
eagles stay march he said

prosecutors proposed 100 fines monday as 
the total penalty for three state social workers accused of failing 
to report suspected abuse before a toddlers death during toilet 
training attorneys said 
this gives the appearance the state wants to give this case 
away said nat white attorney for defendant shirley duboise i 
almost fell out of my chair when they made the offer 
twoyearold bradley mcgee died july 28 after being repeatedly 
dunked headfirst into a toilet and pounded with pillows because he 
soiled his diaper prosecutors say 
his mother and stepfather thomas and sheryl coe of lakeland 
have been charged with firstdegree murder and the social workers 
were accused of failing to act on earlier complaints the couple had 
abused their son 
prosecutors offered the plea bargain monday only to state 
department of health and rehabilitative services program 
administrator kenneth houk supervisor judy ross and caseworker ms 
duboise who were charged with the seconddegree misdemeanor aug 
31 amid controversy over the boys death 
the misdemeanor charge carried a maximum penalty of 60 days in 
jail 
another hrs caseworker margaret barber was charged with 
aggravated child abuse in addition to the misdemeanor charge no 
plea offer was made to her the attorneys said 
as a result of the case the legislature earlier this month 
allocated 39 million to pay for more caseworkers to prevent child 
abuse 
we make plea offers in cases every day the fact that this is 
a highprofile case makes no difference to me said assistant 
state attorney john aguero who refused to comment on the details 
of the plea bargain 
any offer would have to be approved at a pretrial hearing dec 
28 aguero said 
both white and jack wilkins the attorney for houk said they 
would advise their clients to take the deal only if it involves a 
nocontest plea in which they do not have to admit guilt ms ross 
attorney glen brock was not immediately available for comment he 
was out of his office visiting clients 
even if its a small fine nobody wants this on their 
record wilkins said 
i think 100 is fair white said my feeling was that even 
if they were found guilty the judge would not be able to impose a 
stiff sentence anyway 
houk ms ross and ms barber were temporarily suspended but 
have returned to work ms duboise quit her job aug 3

a textbook used for introductory college 
economics courses throughout the united states is being translated 
into russian for use in a nation looking for new economic ideas 
the soviet union 
campbell mcconnell professor of economics at the university of 
nebraskalincoln wrote the popular textbook economics in 1960 
in its 11th edition the book has been translated into portuguese 
spanish german and french 
mcconnell recently completed a foreword for the russian 
translation which mcgrawhill book co expects will take two to 
three years to complete in his introductory comments mcconnell 
addresses the reduction in the past two decades of the high 
economic growth rates that characterized the soviet economy after 
world war ii and acknowledges the vigorous responses of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev mcconnell also reviews the role of 
a competitive price system in achieving and maintaining an 
efficient allocation of scarce resources 
it is perhaps in providing an overview of the functioning of a 
competitive price system that this russian translation of my text 
will be of most interest to soviet students and academicians who 
are involved in the new thinking he writes 
mcconnell says he tried to make clear that the us market 
system is not without faults and that going to a market economy 
may solve some of the soviet problems but it is not a panacea 
university spokesman david ochsner said there is a client for 
the book but the arrangements were made by mcgrawhill and he did 
not know who the client was calls to the publisher were not 
immediately returned

the class system that mysterious code the british 
like to believe is uniquely their own has suffered a double blow 
in recent days 
first comes a survey saying that britons for all their 
fascination with accents dress and good form are no more 
classconscious than any other nation 
no sooner has that shocking revelation been digested than a 
schools association brandishes statistics to show that the old 
school tie no longer binds 
only the other day prime minister margaret thatcher was telling 
parliament the old classbased order is being replaced by one 
based on merit ability and effort this is the new britain the 
britain for the 1990s 
appropriately enough the grocers daughter who leads the 
conservative party made her remarks during the first house of 
commons session to be televised television like income tax and 
traffic jams is one of the great levelers of class in britain 
british social attitudes a survey published this month by 
social and community planning research an independent research 
institute finds that britain is fairly average by most social 
indicators 
after studying data from britain italy austria holland west 
germany hungary the united states and australia the study 
concludes britain does not emerge as an especially 
classconscious or classbound society such differences as there 
are have been talked up as much by british observers as by anyone 
else 
meanwhile a survey for the independent schools information 
service points to massive changes in the makeup of the socalled 
public schools the private institutions from eton downward that 
have long been regarded as bastions of the upper classes 
the survey reports that only six percent of public school kids 
attend the same schools as their parents and that 41 percent have 
parents who werent educated in public schools 
the myth of the old school tie has been finally nailed said 
david woodhead national director of the service the picture 
that emerges is of a highly critical body of parents unfettered by 
traditional loyalties or by prejudice 
and yet debate rages on as to whether britain is a classbound 
nation the daily telegraph calls it the great british 
obsession while another newspaper today devotes two pages to 
demonstrate that the old class divisions that were based on money 
and family lineage are being replaced by snobbery a game anyone 
can play 
in january the newspaper the independent commissioned opinions 
from writer emma tennant and eton headmaster eric anderson 
ms tennant said that despite appearances to the contrary 
social class still holds this country in its grip while anderson 
argued the opposite 
he wrote that class barriers were crumbling and pointed to 
studies showing that by the year 2000 70 percent of all job will 
require brains not brawn compared with only 30 percent in 1945 
if the class system is a divisive force it is not a very 
effective one he wrote and even if some parents still chose 
eton just for the social cachet we take the boy anyway in the 
confidence that we can teach him better values 
the duke of westminster doesnt believe that mrs thatcher even 
after 10 years in power can break down all the conventions built 
up over the centuries 
the class barriers have been broken down to a huge extent 
although certain conventions are adhered to he said in an 
interview 
accent is still a great pigeonholer but nobody watching bbctv 
news can help being struck by the gallimaufry of regional accents 
that predominate among its reporters from chainsaw ulster through 
edinburgh burr to midlands twang the plummy bbc voices of 30 years 
ago would be laughed out of the studio

a lack of state funding is delaying 
courtordered freedom for a retarded man who has been confined for 
31 years at a state hospital attorneys said monday 
bernt murphy a 51yearold who has the mental capability of an 
8yearold has a fulltime job and is ready to move from a group 
home on the hospital grounds to a private community group home 
according to lisa marcy of the legal center for the handicapped 
however she said the state division of handicapped services 
must approve a contract for murphys care at the home at an 
estimated annual cost of 60000 
murphy was declared psychotic and committed to the state 
hospital in 1957 after he was ruled incompetent to stand trial on 
rape and murder charges 
doctors at the hospital said in 1972 that he had been cured of 
his insanity however the utah supreme court ruled in june 1988 
that murphy was retarded not insane and must be allowed to return 
to the community 
a 12member committee assembled by district judge pat brian to 
coordinate murphys rehabilitation believes he is now ready to 
leave the hospital marcy said 
he has exceeded everyones expectations she said she told 
the judge she had hoped to see murphy leave the hospital by 
thursday 
murphy is working as a dishwasher and helper at a local cafe 
earning the minimum wage she said 
brian said he would accept the committees plan but not before 
handicapped services explained the delay he set a hearing for jan 
22 to review the case 
last february murphy was permitted to move into the group home 
on the hospital grounds and take the job as long as he wore an 
electronic ankle bracelet while outside the hospital three months 
ago brian allowed him to remove the bracelet

up to 48000 people were buried in graves 
that were already occupied at two cemeteries in a practice dating 
to the 1920s according to investigators for the state attorney 
generals office 
three former officials of louisville crematories and cemetery 
co the citys oldest cemetery company are to stand trial in 
february on charges resulting from the investigation of eastern and 
greenwood cemeteries 
it may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend 
just what has gone on out here university of louisville 
archaeologist phil diblasi said in a recent interview 
some graves contained the remains of as many as six people and 
graves containing the remains of three or four are common said 
diblasi whose team examined about 100 graves at the two cemeteries 
in eastern louisville 
remains from previous burials were found so often in a section 
of eastern cemetery called babyland that about 70 infants bodies 
were buried only 10 to 18 inches deep employees have told 
investigators 
jim caldwell an investigator for the state attorney generals 
office reported finding human bones throughout eastern cemetery 
in a trucks glove compartment a tool box a storage shed dirt 
piles and even a fastfood hamburger bag 
caldwell said he found ashes from 244 cremated bodies many of 
them unidentified in a cabinet and on shelves in the celler of the 
crematory at eastern 
diblasi said he and caldwell also uncovered several buried 
headstones although there are some unmarked graves at the 
cemeteries thousands have headstones 
in july a jefferson county grand jury indicted three officials 
on 60 counts including reuse of graves and abuse of corpses 
charles alexander jr executive director of louisville 
crematories and cemetery since may 1986 clifford b amos sr 
board president and acting executive director from 1980 to 1986 
and robert copley board vice president and a company employee 
since 1987 face 188 to 268 years in prison and fines of up to 
4000 if convicted the company could be fined up to 112 million 
the three men resigned from the company 
diblasi said he had determined that the practice of reusing 
graves had been going on long before the three joined the company 
this isnt something that started with these folks back in the 
70s as was first suspected he said 
diblasi said his teams excavations indicated that graves were 
being reused as early as the mid1920s at eastern cemetery records 
indicate it was probably full shortly after the turn of the century 
eastern which occupies 15 acres had enough room for about 
18000 bodies under existing standards but investigators estimate 
about 51000 were buried there according to diblasi and caldwell 
caldwells report estimated that about 15000 too many bodies 
were buried at greenwood that would put the estimated number of 
bodies in previously used graves at both cemeteries at 48000 
louisville crematories and cemetery a 141yearold company 
which has mostly served louisvilles poor and middle class also 
operates schardein cemetery 
the company came under scrutiny in may when employee bob allen 
called the attorney generals office caldwells report said 
allen a gravedigger and maintenance worker said graves were 
reused throughout the eight years he worked for the company he 
said that at one point within the past year a skull was dug up and 
inadvertently left sitting atop a dirt pile during a funeral 
the grieving family never saw the skull and we put it back in 
the hole after they left he said

fortyfour states now require school teachers 
to pass competency tests up from just 10 in 1980 the american 
institutes for research said monday in its annual teacher testing 
survey 
the notforprofit scientific research firm which specializes 
in behavioral and social sciences said only 10 states required 
teacher testing for elementary and secondary schools back in 1980 
now the only states that do not administer competency tests are 
alaska iowa michigan new hampshire south dakota and vermont 
teachers have had little problem passing the tests according to 
the study which was conducted as part of the federally funded eric 
clearinghouse on tests measurement and evaluation the 
clearinghouse which is operated by american institutes provides 
information on educational testing and evaluation 
states commonly use two types of tests to assess teacher 
competency certification tests for graduates of teacher education 
programs and admissions tests for people who apply to teacher 
education programs before they can be enrolled most tests are 
standardized variety but a few states use customized tests created 
exclusively for their own jurisdiction 
thirtysix states now administer teacher certification tests 
twentysix states require admissions tests and 18 states require 
teachers to pass both admissions and certification tests 
although some states with testing programs do not collect and 
report passing rate information the survey said the passing rates 
on certification tests range from a low of 69 percent in delaware 
to a high of 97 percent in kansas 
on admissions tests passing rates range from a low of 58 
percent in colorado to a high of 95 percent in nevada

prospects for peace in central 
america battered by fierce battles this month between salvadoran 
rebels and the government were further set back by el salvadors 
break in relations with nicaragua 
the move sunday by rightist president alfredo cristiani capped a 
series of events that indicates more tension conflict and war lies 
ahead in the troubled region 
cristiani who suspended relations to protest the alleged 
shipment of sophisticated arms from nicaragua to el salvadors 
leftist rebels called nicaraguan president daniel ortega a 
puppet of international communist aggression 
ortega said he was glad not to have relations with a genocidal 
government that kills priests 
he was referring to the salvadoran air forces strafing and 
rocketing of populated neighborhoods of the capital in response to 
a new guerrilla offensive and to the slaying of six jesuit 
educators on nov 16 a witness has testified the killers of the 
jesuits wore army uniforms 
two regional counterparts president jose azcona of honduras and 
oscar arias of costa rica expressed their regret at the rupture in 
relations 
now the process of peace in the region has stagnated 
azcona told reporters last weekend he said the break makes his 
borders with both countries more tense and exacerbates even more 
the regions social and political crisis 
arias the principal author of a 1987 regional accord designed 
to bring peace to the wartorn isthmus issued a communique saying 
he laments the break in relations because it expresses the 
gravity of the developments of the past days 
immediately after announcing the suspension of relations 
cristiani said he would not attend next weeks summit of central 
american presidents set in managua the session is intended as a 
follow up on the arias peace plan 
the costa rican president issued an urgent call monday for a 
change of venue cristianis reason for balking was the site a 
country he contends is aiding the effort to topple his government 
in managua roberto lopez geissel the salvadoran charge 
daffaires said his country had been planning for several months 
to upgrade the mission name him ambassador and increase the staff 
and office space 
nicaragua withdrew its charge daffaires and other diplomats 
from el salvador on nov 18 as a precautionary measure 
el salvador recalled its ambassador after the sandinistas came 
to power in a 197879 revolution and the salvadoran embassy was 
fired upon lopez geissel said since then the mission has been 
headed by a series of six charges daffaires he said 
the schism came only days after developments that complicated 
matters on the regions other war front between the sandinista 
army and usbacked contra rebels 
negotiations in washington between the two sides broke down last 
week on saturday ortega responded bitterly to honduran 
expressions of concern about sandinista army concentrations near 
nicaraguas border with honduras 
these hondurans are crazy said ortega well put our 
troops wherever the hell we want to as long as theyre in our own 
country 
he said the honduran army should pull on its pants and kick 
out the contras who are threatening the territorial integrity of 
honduras 
about 10000 antisandinista rebels have been camped for nearly 
two years in honduras near the nicaraguan border some reportedly 
have been filtering back in to nicaragua where combat has 
intensified in recent weeks 
ortega last month ended a truce with the contras 
honduras has an army that is very valiant when it comes to 
killing its own people but not valiant enough to kick out the 
contras said ortega using some of the regions most incendiary 
language in months 
a salvadoran politician who has been a topranking diplomat said 
the apparent victory of rafael callejas a conservative in 
honduras presidential election sunday further clouds a complicated 
regional scene 
there is great fear that a farrightist axis will form between 
honduras and el salvador and that the demobilization of the contras 
will not be brought off said the diplomat commenting on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the honduran armed forces were particularly worried 
about a victory by callejas who they view as less insistent on 
demobilization and expulsion of the antisandinista force

democrat l douglas wilder was declared 
elected governor monday but republican j marshall coleman asked 
for a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities in 
virginias closest gubernatorial election 
colemans announcement came about three hours before the state 
board of elections reported that wilder received 897139 votes to 
890285 for coleman out of nearly 18 million cast for a margin of 
6854 votes or 38 percent 
unofficial results had shown wilder the nations first elected 
black governor ahead by 6852 votes state law allows for a 
taxpayerfunded recount if the margin is less than half a percent 
coleman a former state attorney general said he would seek a 
recount and ask the democratcontrolled general assembly to 
investigate alleged election irregularities in the nov 7 balloting 
in a notice to general assembly leaders stating he intends to 
contest the result coleman said voter registration lists used in 
the election contained the names of people ineligible to vote 
in an election as close as this one irregularities which 
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a 
greater importance coleman said in an accompanying letter 
colemans attorney william h hurd declined to give details of 
the allegations there are a number of areas that were looking 
into he said 
coleman had until dec 7 to request a recount but monday was the 
deadline for contesting the election because of alleged 
irregularities 
he said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and other 
information convinces him that the proceeding is no longer 
necessary to safeguard the accuracy and integrity of the election 
democrats have no problem with colemans request for a recount 
but his contesting the election is a very cynical approach to 
politics said virginia democratic chairman lawrence h framme 
iii 
the entire electoral process was marked by a high degree of 
integrity framme said 
wilder the states lieutenant governor said he would proceed 
with plans for his administration that began just after he claimed 
victory election night he will be inaugurated jan 13 
the recount will be overseen by a panel of three judges headed 
by the chief judge of the richmond circuit court if coleman 
proceeds with contesting the election after the recount the matter 
would go before the privileges and elections committees of the 
general assembly said state sen stanley c walker president pro 
tempore of the senate 
walker who once won a contested election for his senate seat 
said the proceeding would resemble a trial with both sides 
presenting witnesses and evidence to the legislators the 
committees recommendation would go to the full house and senate

the council of state ruled monday that moslem girls 
may wear islamic scarves to school if it does not cause 
disruptions but the decision seemed unlikely to end the 
controversy 
the ruling by the council frances highest administrative 
authority leaves it up to school authorities to judge on a 
casebycase basis whether the wearing of the hijab scarf 
constitutes an act of pressure or provocation of proselytism or 
propaganda 
education minister lionel jospin had sought the ruling after 
weeks of heated arguments 
wearing the hijab which covers the hair ears and neck is not 
incompatible with the principle of secularity in so far as it 
constitutes the exercise of the freedom of expression and 
religious belief the council said 
the principle of secularity in public schools has been the law 
in france since the roman catholic church was officially separated 
from the state in 1905 the latest controversy arose seven weeks 
ago when three moslem teenagers in creil a town north of paris 
refused to remove their scarves 
the school principal ernest chenieres applied a 1937 law 
prohibiting all religious symbols from school and denied the three 
girls the right to attend class until they removed the scarves the 
girls refused and the issue became the center of a national debate 
similar cases arose in marseille avignon montpellier and 
poissy and the arguments became linked to the issue of immigration 
particularly attitudes toward immigrants from moslem countries of 
north africa 
the council of state has noted there can be no general and 
absolute prohibition of the scarf jospin told reporters after 
the ruling by the 90member council he said he would circulate new 
guidelines to schools 
it is a debate that touches on freedoms so it should not be 
regulated in a rigid way from on high he said 
both conservatives and communists criticized the ruling 
saida chella a 17yearold high school student in avignon who 
left school in october because the principal refused to allow her 
to attend classes wearing a hijab said starting tomorrow 
morning i will go to school with my scarf the principal cant 
refuse me that 
alain juppe secretarygeneral of the conservative rally for the 
republic opposition party said the socialist government lacked the 
courage to pass a new law clarifying the matter and was dumping the 
problem back on the schools 
if the law is not clear enough it the government must 
present parliament with legislation that would clarify the 
situation he said 
andre lajoinie head of the communist group in the national 
assembly said the government was backing away from the principle 
of secularity 
bruno megret no 2 man in the extremeright national front that 
has campaigned for years on an antiimmigration platform said 
the question being posed is not that of neutrality of schools 
but that of the colonization of france 
the national education federation frances largest teachers 
union said the councils ruling was a return to square one 
it said the ruling interpreted existing law but teachers were 
seeking precise regulations that would guarantee the secularity 
of public service education

an american bar association task force monday 
called for streamlining deathpenalty appeals but said even its 
proposed changes would allow a convicted killer to fend off 
execution for six years 
the task forces lengthy report offered generally less severe 
reforms than those proposed by a committee appointed by chief 
justice william h rehnquist earlier this year 
for example the aba task force recommendations would require 
states to pay for qualified lawyers to represent death row inmates 
for all their appeals 
civil liberties lawyers had denounced the rehnquistappointed 
committee led by retired supreme court justice lewis f powell 
for failing to assure the competence of such lawyers 
the aba task force report said assuring qualified lawyers not 
only assures fairness but also avoids unnecessary delays in the 
process 
the report recommends imposing a oneyear deadline for someone 
whose murder coviction has been upheld on direct appeal in state 
courts to seek federal court help powells committee has 
recommended a sixmonth deadline 
no such deadline exists now and the average time between 
someone being sentenced to death and actual execution is over eight 
years 
the aba task force report has been sent to congress where it 
joins the powell committee report the task force report will be 
presented to the abas policymaking house of delegates at its 
february meeting 
ronald a klain chief counsel to the senate judiciary 
committee was quoted by the national law journal as saying he 
expects the task force report to be a very very seriously 
considered document 
the committees chairman sen joseph biden ddel already has 
proposed legislation that adopts some of the powell committees 
recommendations 
there are more than 2200 convicted murderers on death rows 
across the nation but only 119 executions have occurred since the 
supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 
the task force said its yearlong study was aimed at shortening 
the total time for reviewing deathpenalty cases but noted that 
some reasonable amount of time is still indispensable for a 
thorough consideration of the issues 
we should no longer see the aberrant case that is still in 
litigation after nine or 10 years the report said but it 
would be unrealistic to expect the review process will take 
less than approximately six years if all available appeals are 
pursued

the communist leaders of east germany who 
were late and reluctant themselves in embracing change said monday 
the czechoslovak party is paying the bitter price of resisting 
reform 
pressure for more rapid change at home continued in leipzig a 
center of the reform movement 200000 activists marched and a 
rally speaker demanded a referendum on german reunification 
some demonstrators carried placards for german unity and the 
issue dominated the weekly leipzig rally for the second monday in a 
row 
the east german leadership resists reunification but has 
mentioned as an alternative a vaguely phrased idea of confederation 
with west germany 
officials in bonn the west german capital said chancellor 
helmut kohl had a plan that called for several intermediate steps 
leading to reunification 
they said he would present it to parliament on tuesday zdf said 
kohl planned to discuss the formula with president bush by 
telephone 
government spokesman hans klein said kohl might go to east 
germany for a summit dec 19 but would not decide until the 
communist party congress scheduled to end two days earlier 
in an interview with bild a masscirculation newspaper in west 
germany mayor wolfgang berghofer of dresden gave a gloomy 
assessment of prospects for the east german party 
the people have already taken our power away bild quoted 
him as saying the leading role of the communist party is already 
history 
berghofer has been mentioned as a possible challenger to party 
chief egon krenz who will seek reelection at the december 
congress 
communist leaders criticized the 23 millionmember freie 
deutsche jugend youth group for leaving the party but reserved 
their harshest comments for hardliners in prague 
undoubtedly a storm is raging on the vltava the party 
newspaper berliner zeitung said referring to the river that runs 
through the city it is bringing the czechoslovak communist party 
the bitter price for the grave errors of the past 
it criticized the hardliners for clinging to the heresy that 
amid the radical reforms in economics in the political sphere 
everything could stay as it was the paper cited the illusory 
risky business of trying to choke the call for democracy with 
police clubs ten days ago 
freie deutsche jugend the traditional stepping stone to success 
for krenz and other members of the leadership announced friday it 
no longer wanted to be the helper and fighting reserve of the 
party 
the frontpage editorial was the harshest east german criticism 
of its warsaw pact ally to to date 
east germany stopped police repression of public protest in 
early october and reform ideas have gained momentum since 
berghofer 46 is not a member of the central committee or 
ruling politburo but has become prominent among reformminded 
communists because of the way he handled unrest last month in 
dresden 
he was quoted as telling bild only two or three well known 
names or perhaps none will remain in the leadership after the 
party congress and the communists will become only one party 
among many 
for 40 years the communists have claimed to get more than 99 
percent of the votes in elections berghofer predicted the true 
count in free elections would be less than 20 percent 
elections have been promised for late next year or early 1991 
democratic awakening an opposition group said monday it would 
establish itself formally as a political party at a convention dec 
1617 in leipzig the party congress is schedled for dec 1517 in 
east berlin 
democratic awakening has about 10000 members and is considered 
more conservative than the largest opposition group new forum to 
which more than 200000 people belong

mutineers led by a former army 
commander attacked the presidential palace in the comoro republic 
and killed president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane longtime ruler of 
the indian ocean island nation officials said monday 
the rebel leader former commandant ahmed mohamed resigned 
recently in a dispute with the 70yearold president an official 
at the comoro embassy in paris said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the sunday night assassination was not a coup and that 
mohamed was under arrest the number of attackers was not divulged 
and the official said he did not know if anyone else was seized 
abderrahmane was killed in a firefight between rebel soldiers of 
the regular army and his 300man presidential guard state radio 
comoro said it said a guard officer also was killed 
the head of the supreme court mohamed djohar took over as 
leader of an interim government as dictated by the constitution 
the official said the government declared a 40day period of 
mourning 
abderrahmane had survived coup attempts in 1983 1985 and 1987 
his government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981 
the sunday attack took place in the capital of moroni on the 
main island of grand camore home to half the nations 
predominantly moslem population of 500000 the comoros which lie 
between mozambique and madagascar were governed by abderrahmane 
for all but three years since 1972 
the former french colony is among the worlds poorest and least 
developed nations with an estimated annual per capita income of 
339 about 60 percent of the population is younger than 20 
abderrahmane will be buried tuesday on his native island of 
anjouan said radio comoro monitored on the frenchadministered 
island of mayotte 
the fighting apparently did not spill into the streets bruce 
thompson manager of the galewa sun hotel told the south african 
press association by telephone everything was normal the town 
is very quiet 
three weeks ago abderrahmane won a referendum allowing him to 
seek a third sixyear term when his term expires next year 
official results showed the measure passed with 925 percent of the 
vote 
the five opposition parties complained of voting irregularities 
and opposition leaders in paris said abderrahmane jailed critics 
shortly after the balloting 
abderrahmane a moslem was first elected president in 1972 when 
the archipelago was still a french possession the comoros 
unilaterally declared independence in july 1975 and abderrahmane 
became head of state 
he was overthrown a month later by ali soilih who said 
abderrahmane had amassed personal power in a dictatorial style but 
returned to power in 1978 in another coup led by french mercenary 
bob denard 
denard now 60 created the blackshirted presidential guard and 
staffed it with european soldiers of fortune he became a special 
adviser to abderrahmane converted to islam and settled in the 
islands it was not known monday whether he played any role in the 
latest episode 
the presidential guard was better equipped and trained than the 
700man regular army and many comorans came to see it as a device 
to keep abderrahmane in power 
abderrahmane resisted calls to reform his regime and accused 
france the former colonial power of fomenting rebellion against 
him 
he had long been irked by frances refusal to cede control of 
mayotte to his government the island decided in a 1975 referendum 
to remain french 
president fw de klerk of south africa sent a message of 
condolence monday addressed to the acting head of government 
condemning the assassination 
south africa is a major foreign investor in the republic the 
three islands of grand comore anjouan and moheli cover 718 square 
miles 
the republics main income is from tourism and the export of 
perfume copra coconuts cloves vanilla and cinnamon

opposition groups narrowly won a 
referendum monday that postpones the presidential election and 
gives them more time to organize against the ruling communists who 
now call themselves the socialist party 
according to preliminary results from the national electoral 
board 501 percent of those participating voted for the first 
question on the ballot should the presidential elections be held 
only after the parliamentary elections 
it was hungarys first free election in more than four decades 
and the first since the communists dissolved their party renamed 
it the socialist party and opened the way for free multiparty 
politics 
a statement from the board said the four opposition groups 
sponsoring the referendum won by only 6618 votes official final 
results were to be announced tuesday 
of the 4297454 valid votes cast in the first referendum in 
postwar hungary 2152036 favored the question and 2145418 were 
opposed 
hours earlier imre pozsgay the socialist party presidential 
candidate acknowledged the opposition had won 
the other three questions on the ballot were approved 
overwhelmingly said the electoral board statement carried by the 
official news agency mti 
it said 951 percent of voters wanted the party out of the 
workplace 954 percent said the ruling party should reveal its 
assets and 949 percent favored disbanding the workers militia a 
party army that already is melting away 
pozsgay told a news conference earlier monday while in 
eastern and central europe people by the hundreds of thousands are 
marching in the streets to express their opinion hungarians are 
going to the ballot box to express their political will 
victory for the opposition means new democratic parliament to 
be chosen by june will elect the president if voters had defeated 
the referendum they would have elected a president directly on 
jan 7 
opposition groups said an election in january left them too 
little time to organize a serious challenge to pozsgay they hope 
to win strong representation in the new parliament which would 
give their candidate a better chance at the presidency 
recent opinion polls indicate the socialist party will not win a 
majority of the seats 
pal kara secretary of the referendum committee in parliament 
said 582 percent of the 78 million eligible voters cast ballots 
the opposition alliance has proposed that parliament amend the 
constitution to allow a popular election of the president after the 
new parliament is elected it also proposed curtailing the 
presidents powers 
ivan petoe a leader of the free democrats said the president 
should not have the power to dissolve parliament under the current 
constitution the president also is commander of the armed forces 
and can call elections 
pozsgay asked about the opposition proposal to hold direct 
elections after the new parliament is elected said he was 
happy about it 
he said he had no wish to be a fully weakened presidential 
figurehead that is different from my perception pozsgay 
added however that he did not believe the head of state should 
have arbitrary power 
if parliament chooses the president pozsgay said his chances 
of getting the job will diminish because in that case the 
position is subject to political bargaining

a us health official called monday for 
federal regulation of all cholesterol screenings not conducted by 
health care professionals saying booths in shopping malls and 
other public settings can be inaccurate and spread infections such 
as aids and hepatitis 
richard kusserow inspector general at the department of health 
and human services said testers at these screenings frequently 
disregard basic rules of hygiene in collecting blood samples and 
often are poorly trained to operate the cholesterolmeasuring 
devices 
i do not think it is conducive to good medical benefit to have 
in this carnivallike atmosphere untrained people engaging in a 
procedure which has some risk to public health from infection he 
told a house subcommittee 
he added that people who are tested are going to try to depend 
on these results and the results in fact are not very accurate 
kusserow said he is concerned that public cholesterol screenings 
are growing in popularity and that they are often used by 
entrepreneurs as a marketing strategy to promote products or by 
stores to increase traffic 
the inspector general said in an interview that his office is 
conducting a criminal investigation into several scams in which 
screeners unnecessarily refer medicare and medicaid recipients to 
physicians for followup tests 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house small business 
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities said the 
scams involved screeners rigging cholesterolmeasuring devices so 
they showed higher than true levels 
both declined to discuss the investigation further 
the investigation grew out of a study conducted by the inspector 
generals office at the request of wyden as part of his panels 
continuing inquiry into unregulated medical testing 
kusserows report released at mondays hearing said demand for 
screening is growing because of greater public awareness of the 
link between high cholesterol and heart disease 
kusserow said he could not estimate accurately the number of 
screenings that are conducted yearly at shopping malls pharmacies 
health clubs village halls and a variety of other public settings 
but he called it a growth industry and said at least 10 million 
people were tested this way in 1988 
the inspector generals investigators who participated in 71 
screenings as part of the study often had a variety of health 
concerns including testers who collected blood usually by a 
finger prick and also handled money but wore no gloves and did not 
disinfect between collections he said 
kusserow said these conditions raise the risk both for testers 
and those being tested of infection from bloodborne diseases 
including aids and hepatitis 
the likelihood is not that great he said adding that he 
knew of no case in which disease has been spread through contact at 
screenings but i dont know if you want to be the 50th in line 
that day when proper hygiene is not being followed he said 
youre just asking for trouble 
according to their findings guidelines issued by the national 
cholesterol education program a consortium of organizations 
coordinated by the national heart lung and blood institute were 
usually not followed he said 
often screenings held in crowded shopping centers or stores were 
frenzied and 42 percent of them were staffed by just one person 
investigatores found that testers had little training and often 
no medical background he said the portable analyzers used at 
screenings are accurate when used properly he added but if not 
calibrated or operated correctly they often yield innacurate 
results 
also nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was 
drawn with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or milked 
which can dilute the sample with material from between the cells 
and give a lower than true result 
dr russell luepker of the university of minnesota testified 
that a study he conducted last year at several minnesota screenings 
found inaccurate results as high as 27 percent of the time at one 
site most often he said the inaccurate result was lower than the 
true level 
wyden said his concern was that people can be lulled into a 
false sense of security they may not see their doctors they may 
not change their diets and they may not exercise over time not 
knowing that theyre in the danger zone could cost us our health 
and even our lives 
kusserows study did not measure the accuracy of testings but 
one of his investigators barbara butz who directed the project 
said she was tested five times with the results ranging from 195 
to 243 milligrams per deciliter a reading of 200 is considered to 
be the desirable level 200239 borderline high blood cholesterol 
and over 240 a high level 
currently no federal regulations govern public cholesterol 
screenings and state regulation is scattered and varied kusserow 
said 16 states have laws on their books but that regulations in 
four of them have not been implemented 
a 1988 federal law brings all clinical laboratories under 
federal regulation on jan 1 1990 the health care financing 
administration is drafting regulations to implement the law 
the law however provides that some medical testing may be 
exempt from its provisions the inspector general recommended that 
public screenings be included in the regulations because federal 
regulation is clearly called for in order to safeguard the 
public

the editors of britains national newspapers said 
monday that in an attempt to ward off regulatory legislation they 
have agreed to a code of press behavior 
pressure has been building to rein in the more sensational 
tabloids as concerns have risen about the invasion of privacy 
in a joint declaration the editors said they realized 
newspapers needed to improve selfregulation 
the code to be published in each paper calls for an appointed 
ombudsman to police press behavior and safeguard standards of 
accuracy and fairness 
they will have the power to question journalists and editorial 
executives they will have the right to require prompt publication 
of statements of correction and to have their findings published 
the code said 
it sets out rules requiring a justifiable public interest if 
private lives are intruded upon and a fair opportunity for reply 
mistakes must be corrected promptly and with appropriate 
prominence 
newspapers will be barred from paying criminals for their 
stories the purchase of stories from figures in the news is common 
in british journalism 
the editors said they hope the declaration will stop moves in 
parliament to curb invasion of privacy editors said they believe 
legislation could hamper access for journalists 
on nov 20 publisher robert maxwell fired wendy henry the 
editor of his tabloid the people for publishing photographs of 
princes william and harry and of entertainer sammy davis jr that 
he found not acceptable 
the princes parents the prince and princess of wales objected 
to the photos as intruding on the childrens privacy and as a 
security concern

onetime tennessee financial wizard jake 
butcher and a close associate pleaded guilty monday to two counts 
of a federal indictment accusing them of defrauding an orlando bank 
of 39 million 
the pleabargain agreements in the complex case were entered 
before us district judge g kendall sharp shortly before the two 
men were to have gone on trial 
butcher who until 1983 headed a financial empire of 28 banks in 
tennessee and kentucky is serving a 20year prison term for bank 
fraud he lost a race for tennessee governor in 1978 and was the 
chief organizer of the 1982 worlds fair in knoxville 
also pleading guilty was earl d wilson who worked for butcher 
at the time the banks failed and is serving a 10year sentence for 
bank fraud 
butchers attorney edward garland of atlanta said related 
conspiracy charges against his client would be dropped 
the 89page indictment alleged that butcher and wilson 
orchestrated a scheme to obtain fraudulent loans from florida 
center bank in orlando in 198485 using a series of straw 
borrowers who would funnel the money to them 
butcher and wilson could not obtain loans under their own names 
because they had filed for bankruptcy and were either under 
investigation or charged with bank fraud in kentucky and tennessee 
the government alleged 
the grand jury charged that butcher and the wilsons paid former 
bank president joe f justice to make the loans justice who was 
not charged is serving a 10year sentence on similar charges in 
another case 
florida center bank collapsed in 1986 
butcher faces a maximum term of seven years and a fine of up to 
500000 on the two counts wilson faces a possible 10 years and a 
fine of 500000 
prosecutors will recommend that butchers time be served 
concurrently with the sentence he is already serving in a prison in 
atlanta garland said 
butcher had faced a maximum sentence of 71 years in prison and 
up to 45 million in fines if convicted in the orlando case 
assistant us attorney ricardo pesquera said 
pesquera would not elaborate on the pleabargain arrangements 
because he was prosecuting four other people in the same case but 
suggested he did not expect to call butcher and wilson to testify 
also pleading guilty to two counts in the 51count indictment 
issued in orlando last august was wilsons wife harriette and 
david ogle and allen hicks both of knoxville tenn frederick c 
streck of atlanta ga and michael r allen of altamonte springs 
fla pleaded guilty to one count 
the other defendants in the case generally served as fraudulent 
borrowers pesquera told the jury in the case against the remaining 
defendants harold and margaret artrip of longwood and james p 
gresham and sandra k chitwood of atlanta 
it was all part of the scheme and pattern he said asking 
the jury to look at it as a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces 
fitting together as part of a plan to cheat the bank 
lawyers for gresham the artrips and ms chitwood argued that 
all of the loans they obtained were legal and repaid to the bank 
with interest

the hohos of a shopping mall santa claus 
turned into uhohs over the weekend 
officials at tysons corner center in suburban virginia were 
shocked to discover that their jolly old elf was handing out to 
tots copies of a childrens book containing the startling message 
that theres really no santa 
there on page 86 of a pee wee christmas fresh from st 
nicks very own toy sack was the revelation by one of the books 
characters that santa claus is a fake just like his pasteon beard 
and padded stomach 
the books were yanked saturday and replaced with christmas 
stickers and fingerprinting kits but not before copies of a pee 
wee christmas had been dispensed to 300 or 400 innocent tots who 
had climbed onto santas lap in the previous week 
the mall was alerted by a complaint from linda smyth a nurse 
from nearby vienna va who had taken her 4yearold son logan 
to meet santa 
i read the story to logan at bedtime she said and he 
fell asleep before i got to the juicy part fortunately 
said tysons corner general manager jim foster what can i say 
we screwed up 
foster said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books 
looking for an appropriate santa gift but we just flat missed 
the troublesome passage in their final selection 
the book tells the tale of a 7yearold named sonny who is 
ridiculed by his friends for saying he believes in santa claus his 
friend molly decides to set him straight 
here is the juicy part that raised mrs smyths eyebrows 
sonny she whispered bravely there isnt any real santa 
claus your mom gives you the things on your list i used to 
believe in him too but when youre seven you should know 
i know that said sonny i knew he wasnt real i saw his 
beard it was just pasted on 
sonny adds that he was just pretending because its more fun 
to believe 
the book part of a pee wee scouts series that has sold more 
than 2 million copies was written by childrens author judy delton 
of st paul minn 
in a telephone interview monday she said her christmas story 
had received very few complaints 
ms delton said a pee wee christmas was written for 7 and 
8yearolds who already have learned about santa claus from 
television and playground gossip but was never meant for younger 
children 
nevertheless she said i was terribly sorry when she heard 
about the flap over her book at the tysons corner mall 
i felt really bad about it and i can only apologize she 
said 
mrs smyth said shes glad logan fell asleep while she was 
reading a pee wee christmas and hopes her son continues to 
believe in santa claus for many more years 
thats the magic of being a child she said i know one 
day hell find out but i dont want it to be like that 
foster expressed chagrin over the incident and offered this 
word of advice dont believe everything you read

two soviet soldiers held for more than 
two years by afghan anticommunist rebels were released to their 
mothers in an emotional ceremony monday in the pakistani frontier 
city of peshawar near afghanistan 
soviet ambassador victor yakunin said that a reciprocal release 
of 33 prisoners most of them captured afghan rebel fighters will 
take place this week in kabul the afghan capital 
army privates andrei lopukh and valery prokapchuk both 20 and 
clad in white hugged their mothers and wept with them as they were 
reunited at the fortresslike headquarters of the rebels 
selfstyled governmmentinexile 
im very happy that i just saw my son and i know that hes 
coming home said a tearful valentina prokapchuk 
dozens of mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors toting 
sovietmade ak47 assault rifles stood guard in their gray dress 
uniforms as pakistan police formed a security ring around the 
headquarters 
yakunin sayed gailani acting president of the socalled 
interim government and representatives of pakistans foreign 
ministry and the international committee of the red cross attended 
the ceremony 
a reciprocating gesture of good will will take place in kabul 
in a couple of days yakunin said this is a good beginning 
he called it a high act of humanitarianism 
the ambassador said that besides rebel fighters the kabul 
release will include pakistanis and citizens of sympathetic arab 
states captured while fighting inside afghanistan alongside afghan 
insurgents 
before freeing the two soviets the rebels lectured the 
prisoners mothers who were part of a sevenmember private 
delegation from the soviet union 
i understand that not only these women are weeping today 
there are probably many more weeping in the soviet union said 
farooq azam an official of the mujahedeen government 
but let me remind you that thousands of afghan mothers are 
crying over the loss of their children 
gailani called the release ample proof of our good 
intentions 
though the war is not yet over we are releasing two more 
soviet prisoners to show our humane motives in spite of the 
fact that thousands of our people are held by the kabul regime and 
the soviet union as prisoners 
rebel fighters have intermittently exchanged soviet prisoners 
during the 11yearold insurrection in afghanistan 
the puppet regime and its supporter should realize the 
plight of our nation and should leave in grace and thus stop 
further bloodshed before they are terminated by the wrath of our 
people gailani said 
iona andronov spokesman of nadezhka hope a private group 
which works for the release of soviet pows thanked the mujahedeen 
leaders and apologized for what he termed this bloody war and 
stupid war which was started by the politicians and generals 
in december 1979 the kremlin ordered more than 100000 combat 
troops into afghanistan to oversee the replacement of one marxist 
government in kabul with another and to help fight a growing moslem 
insurgency

as workers joined the prodemocracy movement started by students 
artists and intellectuals

from the ruling politburo the second major leadership reshuffle in 
three days

lifted most forms of press censorship 
the central committee approved an inquiry by a parliamentary 
commission into a nov 17 rally in which riot police clubbed 
hundreds of peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators

discussion it was decided to drop the article enshrining the 
leading role of the communists in the constitution from a new draft 
of the document every political party has the right to a leading 
role as long as it is based on results he said its not 
possible to lay this down in the constitution 
the official ctk news agency said parliament until now a 
rubberstamp body under firm communist control also would be open 
to discussion of any draft laws vladimir janku head of the 
states commission on church affairs was quoted as saying these 
would include new laws on religion that would end state control 
over churches and the criticized practice of licensing priests

the formation of independent trade unions

dubcek to the castle they yelled referring to alexander 
dubcek the ousted leader of the failed prague spring reforms 
who was replaced as party leader by husak hradcany castle a 
national symbol is the presidential residence

among the demonstrators as long as the communists rule its 
going to be messed up as it was for the last 40 years 
more than 200000 people attended another mass rally in prague 
monday afternoon continuing the series of protests that have 
yielded major government concessions to opposition demands 
vaclav klaus a spokesman for the opposition group civic forum 
called off any rallies for tuesday when the opposition meets the 
government for more negotiations communist premier ladislav adamec 
on sunday held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leaders to 
try to contain the peaceful revolt 
demands of the civic forum have been met in principle or are 
being met klaus said but he warned that the rallies would 
resume if negotiators fail to make progress toward democratic 
reforms 
the fundamental condition in our talks is the holding of free 
elections klaus told the crowd 
valtr komarek the head of the forecasting institute of the 
academy of sciences branded the current orthodox communist system 
a message from the valley of shadows 
actors and students groups in prague and bratislava capital of 
slovakia have proposed that komarek be named premier 
state tv which has played a key role in the dizzyingly rapid 
popular revolt broadcast footage from industrial centers around 
the country showing crowds of hundreds of thousands attending 
strike rallies

vaclav havel the nations most prominent opposition leader who 
said have no fear the future is ours 
when a speaker at the rally mentioned dubcek the crowd of 
100000 people responded with a deafening roar

its fairly clear that these weapons were found there 
fitzwater said monday i mean were not talking about a small 
package of pistols here were talking about tons of equipment and 
mortars and dynamite and rounds of ammunitions and explosives this 
is hardly a case of someone having a few things flipped in their 
shopping bag on the way home

prime minister margaret thatcher reaffirmed monday 
she will stay in office as long as she is wanted and said reports 
she will step down soon after the next election could not have 
been further from the truth on her objection to european 
economic community evolution toward a united states of europe mrs 
thatcher said parliament would not allow britains monetary 
budgetary and economic policy to be left to the 12 member countries 
i believe britain is right she said in a british 
broadcasting corp tv interview we are choosing between the 
british parliament and a group of people who are not accountable i 
believe our views will prevail as people look at it 
the eec would go far further and have far better results if we 
cooperate as 12 sovereign nations voluntarily cooperating on the 
things we do best she said 
mrs thatcher 64 has swept the conservatives to three 
successive election victories and is the longestserving british 
prime minister this century 
i shall stay as long as the electorate and my own party wish 
me to do not a moment longer but i hope as long as that she 
said monday adding she is fit and loves her work 
she expressed concern about the effect of next weeks 
conservative party leadership election saying i think at the 
moment uncertainty about anything connected with the government is 
not good but i would not like to use that to hinder anyone who 
wants to stand 
the conservatives have routinely endorsed her leadership since 
1975 this year she faces a challenge from 69yearold sir anthony 
meyer a rankandfile legislator 
voting is scheduled for dec 5 under tory rules she must get 
57 percent of the votes to win outright if she does not some more

attorneys for amtrak told a jury monday 
that a federal law exempts the passenger rail service from being 
prosecuted for dumping sewage into public waterways from train 
bridges 
the case marks the first time amtrak has gone to court on 
criminal charges although several western states have criticized 
its habit of flushing toilets along its rightofway 
mary and william trammel testified monday that they were sprayed 
by a dark watery substance from an amtrak train as they fished 
below a trestle over the st johns river 
attorneys for amtrak said the rail service never intended to 
violate a florida law that bans dumping sewage into public 
waterways but even if the law was broken attorneys said federal 
law exempts amtrak from prosecution 
a 1972 federal law allows amtrak to dispose of waste by dumping 
it along its rightofway because congress found the company could 
not comply with a federal health study prohibiting the practice 
attorney edward booth said 
however assistant state attorney dennis bayer told jurors that 
the florida law does count 
the charges stem from incidents in november and december 1988 
and may 1989 bayer said amtrak in those months allegedly dumped 
human waste into the st johns river and rice creek as trains 
crossed bridges 
amtrak is on trial on four counts of commercial littering and 
one count of causing a nuisance the littering charges are felonies 
under florida law 
although the statute calls for fines and jail times the state 
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped prosecutors have 
said 
the railroad has threatened to suspend service to florida where 
it carries about 1 million passengers a year if the state 
continues to press its case 
amtrak officials have said it would be too costly to put holding 
tanks on its existing trains although it hopes eventually to 
replace much of its fleet with new cars that would have holding 
tanks for all toilets 
the case is expected to go to the jury wednesday

this farming communitys hunt for a missing 
18yearold honors student ended monday when searchers found her 
body in the shallow nooksack river 
the body was identified as that of amanda stavik whatcom county 
sheriffs sgt ron peterson told a news conference 
stavik had been missing since she went jogging friday with her 
dog kyra while home from college on thanksgiving break the dog 
returned alone 
authorities believe miss stavik was abducted said peterson who 
would not comment on the bodys condition or how miss stavik died 
an autopsy will be conducted he said 
there was no evidence of a struggle on the bank near where the 
body was found leading authorities to suspect it floated 
downstream the sergeant said he said detectives were still 
looking for clues 
there were no suspects in the case peterson said 
until monday authorities had seized upon a pair of teal blue 
sweatpants recovered in the area as their only potential clue miss 
stavik was wearing that color garment when she was last seen 
whatcom county officials had asked the fbi for help and planned 
to enlist the aid of the green river task force a seattlebased 
team of detectives with expertise in abduction that was formed to 
pursue a serial killer 
the fbi helped interview classmates of miss stavik at central 
washington university in ellensburg 
the sweatpants were discovered 10 miles from the stavik familys 
home in this town of 250 people in northwestern washington state 
80 miles north of seattle and 20 miles south of the canadian border 
you think of those things happening in seattle but not here 
lobay smith said from behind the cash register at acme foods where 
customers had pledged 7000 to anyone finding mandy as miss 
stavik was known 
many of the staviks neighbors had joined the search in the 
evergreenstudded foothills and along highway 9 a busy road 
connecting seattle and its suburbs with the mount baker ski area 
miss staviks mother mary had worked to keep her mind from 
dwelling on her missing daughter 
she was very happy and positive and feeling good about 
school ms stavik said sunday she said her daughter had brought 
a japanese exchange student home for the holiday 
miss stavik was last seen about a halfmile from her home by her 
younger brother lee 13 her mother thought she had jogged the 
three miles to the south fork of the nooksack river 
lee who was visiting a neighbor at the time said it looked 
like his sister was on her way back from the river 
the sweatpants recovered near an unpaved road where garbage is 
sometimes dumped did not prove to be solid evidence 
although they are the same color as sweatpants miss stavik was 
wearing when last seen bloodhounds failed to identify the garment 
as miss staviks and her mother couldnt be certain they were her 
daughters 
detectives said their best leads may come from passersby who 
might have noticed something suspicious along the highway the road 
has about four times the traffic as normal because of a washedout 
bridge and the opening of ski season at mount baker said 
undersheriff doug gill 
were hoping somebody saw something and will give us a call 
he said 
investigators also have pulled the parole records of sexual 
predators or other criminals who were known to be in the area said 
gill

president francois mitterrand formally 
opened interpols new headquarters beside the rhone river monday 
and urged law enforcement officials from 147 countries to stop the 
trade in illegal drugs 
he told about 500 delegates at the organizations 58th annual 
conference that losing the fight against drugs would represent a 
collective failure of civilization 
the 225 million headquarters of the international police 
organization interpol replaced the organizations cramped 
facilities in the paris suburb of st cloud 
interpol acts as a clearing house for information among 147 
countries it does no investigating itself but provides members 
with data on drug trafficking terrorism and financial and other 
crimes 
interpol officials say the new offices will allow the the 
organization to expand its forensic capabilities and photo and 
fingeprint files 
it also will have a 645000 communications system capable of 
receiving and sending 7000 messages per hour by telephone telex 
and radio 
the structure will be easier to guard against attacks such as 
the bombing by the direct action terrorist group in may 1986 that 
wounded a police guard and seriously damaged the sixstory building 
in st cloud

a bogota newspaper that was bombed because of 
its coverage of colombias drug trade is getting a helping hand 
from newspaper publishers in the united states and elsewhere in its 
effort to stave off bankruptcy 
thomas c fichter of the american newspaper publishers 
association one of two trade associations coordinating a drive to 
raise funds for the troubled daily el espectador said monday the 
bogota newspaper should receive the initial instalment on a loan 
this week 
fichter said el espectador has declared that it needs 25 
million to continue publishing because of the bombing and other 
losses it has suffered from the campaign against it by the 
colombian drug cartel 
right now we have got about l6 million pledged or paid and 
there are sufficient people we havent heard from yet that we think 
will bring us to the 25 million mark fichter said 
the president of el espectador luis cano toured the united 
states in october seeking support from news organizations he said 
a car bomb that exploded near the newspapers offices on sept 2 
did 25 million worth of damage 
they had to pull out the windows and put on news roofs and 
incur other expenses not knowing where they were going to get the 
money to pay for it fichter said not to mention the fact 
their advertising lineage has been curtailed because many of the 
advertisers have been intimidated 
canos younger brother guillermo cano publisher of the paper 
was killed by drug traffickers in 1986 
two employes of the newspaper in medellin where the drug cartel 
has its headquarters were killed in october the newspaper 
suspended home delivery in medellin because of fear on the part of 
truck drivers and delivery boys 
el espectador has a circulation of 350000 cano has said it is 
losing money and facing possible bankruptcy 
fichter said i think it struck a number of people all at one 
time that something needed to be done 
among them he said were newspaper executives and bruce gelb 
director of the us information agency 
marty c davis director of public liaison for the usia said 
in a letter to executives of news organizations monday that gelb 
took his concerns to newspaper publishers who agreed to try to 
raise money to keep el espectadors presses running gelb visited 
the newspapers offices in bogota on oct l5 
fichter said anpa is working with the interamerican press 
association of miami in coordinating the fundraising campaign he 
said money or pledges had been received from about 50 donors in the 
united states canada europe and asia 
both fichter and ms davis said money would be available to help 
other newspapers after el espectadors needs had been met 
the money is a loan he said they will give it back and 
that will perepetuate it 
fichter said the fundraising effort was the largest of its kind 
that he knew of although the trade associations have helped 
troubled newspapers in various countries in the past after the 
fighting in grenada in 1984 for instance they helped the 
newspaper in the caribbean island obtain a new press to replace one 
that had been destroyed

nations hardcore smokers nearly 18 million participated in this 
years great american smokeout said dr robert j schweitzer 
national president of the american cancer society based in 
suburban decatur 
noting the large number of smokers who quit for longer than the

smokers increasing awareness of the dangers posed by cigarette 
smoking and their desire to try to quit this addictive habit 
the study also found that more younger people tried to quit for 
the day 
the poll indicated 42 percent of those in the 1834 age group

stir smokers to quit last year 86 percent of the respondents 
heard of the effort 
neither the american cancer society nor gallup released the

a leader of the afghan resistance said monday 
he hopes president bush will persuade soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev at their weekend summit to stop supporting the puppet 
regime of najibullah in afghanistan 
sibghatullah mojaddedi met with bush in the oval office to thank 
him and the american people for backing the mujahedeen rebels in 
their 11year fight to oust the sovietbacked government 
mojaddedi later told the associated press that he would ask us 
officials for high altitude antiaircraft weapons to use against 
soviet planes that he said were still flying bombing missions from 
soviet territory 
still the russians our bombing our people the mujahedeen 
from their own territory said mojaddedi 
mojaddedi did not ask bush directly for the weapons but said he 
would raise the issue before he departs washington on friday 
he also said that while he and bush did not discuss next weeks 
meeting off malta between the two superpower leaders i am sure 
that he will discuss afghanistan it is a very important issue 
gorbachev must be convinced that this is a puppet regime that 
the afghanistan people do not support this puppet regime he 
said 
mojaddedi is the president of the afghan interim government 
formed by seven main resistance groups after the soviet union 
completed the pullout of 115000 troops from afghanistan last 
february 
covert us military support for the rebels is reported to 
exceed 500 million a year but so far the united states has not 
granted formal recognition to the rebels governmentinexile based 
in peshawar pakistan 
us officials had hoped the resistance would quickly topple 
najibullahs government after the soviet pullout the rebels 
control most of the afghan countryside but so far have been unable 
to dislodge the kremlinbacked forces from the capital of kabul or 
from jalalabad and other major cities 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
that bush reaffirmed our support for the afghan resistances 
efforts to achieve selfdetermination and also expressed us 
interest in a political settlement 
he said bush called upon the afghan interim government to 
continue and increase its efforts to fashion a stable broadly 
based government responsive to the needs of the afghan people 
mojaddedi asked why the rebels have been unable to topple 
najibullah said the soviets have withdrawn partly from 
afghanistan not completely 
he said of soviet soldiers still they are fighting in the 
name of afghans inside afghanistan and he also said soviet 
planes conduct bombing runs from their own territory against 
northern afghanistan 
he charged the soviet union has doubled or tripled its support 
for the najibullah government since the pullout to at least 300 
million a month and he said the rebels did not get supplies for 
eight or nine months 
asked about factional strife among the resistance fighters 
mojaddedi called that wrong propaganda we are not fighting 
amongst ourselves we are all united sometimes it happens but 
rarely seldom 
the mujahedeen from different parties they are united and if 
we were not united we would not have achieved such progress in our 
struggle he said

a hearing on whether the tanker captain 
whose ship caused the nations largest oil spill should stand trial 
got under way monday with witnesses recounting the hours after the 
exxon valdez ripped its hull open 
one said oil was welling up alongside the tanker at a rolling 
boil 
joseph hazelwood fired as an exxon tanker captain after the 
spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil sat with his 
counsel while they argued defense motions intended to show 
hazelwood is immune from the charges against him 
defense motions include claims that hazelwood received immunity 
from prosecution when he reported his ships grounding and the oil 
spill the morning it happened a law intended to encourage 
selfreporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills 
provides protection against selfincrimination laywers contend 
that led state assistant district attorney leonard linton jr to 
argue that discovery of the spill was inevitable and that 
information about the disaster was available from a variety of 
sources not only from hazelwood 
hazelwood was in charge of the 987foot tanker when it hit the 
reef early march 24 after leaving the alaska oil pipeline terminal 
at valdez the ships cargo of heavy north slope crude oil poured 
into prince william sound blackening shores killing wildlife and 
interrupting fishing seasons 
hazelwood 43 a veteran mariner from huntington ny is 
scheduled for trial jan 22 on charges of reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil all misdemeanors and three felony counts of criminal mischief 
linton called witnesses dan lawn of the alaska department of 
environmental conservation alaska fish and wildlife protection 
trooper michael fox and mark delozier whose work as a coast guard 
investigator in valdez ended nov 1 
lawyers on both sides questioned lawn about his activities after 
alyeska pipeline service co notified him of the spill less than an 
hour after the crash 
lawn his agencys top representative in valdez at the time of 
the accident said he called his anchorage supervisor and told him 
this was the nightmare we had been dreading 
lawn said he went to the ship with the coast guard a couple 
hours after the crash and found oil welling up around the vessel 
a rolling boil if you will he said he saw hazelwood who 
appeared quiet and pensive but didnt speak to him beyond an 
introduction 
fox said he was contacted by the coast guard and assumed he was 
wanted to help deal with a drunken sailor 
i got up onto the bridge fully expecting to have to deal with 
a drunktype situation and it wasnt that at all he said 
it was a very sad quiettype situation 
fox said he was asked to obtain a blood sample from hazelwood 
because intoxication was suspected but fox said he wasnt prepared 
to collect blood and conduct an investigation without evidence of a 
crime the sample was drawn by a coast guard official about 10 
hours after the grounding 
the trooper said he was trying to figure out what problem caused 
the tanker wreck and hazelwood told him youre looking at it 
delozier who spent two days aboard the tanker after the wreck 
said he detected a strong odor of alcohol coming from captain 
hazelwood 
he said fox apparently hadnt been informed about the need to 
draw samples for alcohol screenings 
delozier also said he urged his wife to talk to state troopers 
because she recognized hazelwood from a newspaper photograph about 
a week after the accident and remembered seeing him in a valdez 
establishment that serves alcohol 
if convicted of the three felonies hazelwood faces a possible 
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and 100000 in fines

call several witnesses at the preliminary hearing 
last month the associated press reported that corbin had 
convened a state grand jury to investigate allegations of 
obstruction in the bolles case

or whether there was any connection between it and mondays charge 
bolles died 11 days after the car he was in was blown up by a 
remotecontrolled bomb

political reasons because he opposed us policies in that country

simplistic and shortsighted 
the specific language was the president decided it was time 
for a change woerner said in describing how defense secretary 
richard cheney told him in july that he was being removed and 
then when i said i was entitled to more of an explanation i was 
told it had nothing to do with performance but was for political 
reasons

inspector general recommends federal regulation of all cholesterol 
screenings that are not conducted by health care professionals

uppers and downers and the revenue department has collected only 
2339296

bring in revenue it gives prosecutors an easytoprove charge that 
can mean a longer prison sentence or a better bargaining position 
when defendants want to plea bargain 
revenue chief ed rolfs whose office made the estimate of how 
much is owed said his agency became more active in trying to 
collect taxes on illegal drugs earlier this year after the 1987 
law survived a legal challenge he said it may collect 500000

the muchmaligned donkey is making a 
comeback in texas and other states where ranchers know that 
coyotes keep their distance when the stubborn beasts are making 
asses of themselves 
its the deliberate disposition of the donkey and the 
animals innate dislike of canines that makes them useful guarding 
goats and sheep against coyotes and other predators said rancher 
nanci falley 
state officials say the donkey guard an oldtime form of 
protection is enjoying a resurgence on ranches around the country 
its such a natural thing for a donkey said ms falley who 
also sells the guard animals its not something that requires 
training they have a natural instinct to run dogs and coyotes out 
of their territory

in simpler times a politician a president 
could tailor his message to fit his audience and chances were the 
adjustments would go unnoticed 
in the era of instant communications that doesnt work very 
well television makes all audiences into one but president bush 
and some other republican leaders are trying to deal with the 
abortion issue as though the old way might still work 
the objective seems to be to deal with abortion separately 
apart from other issues thats understandable as abortion becomes 
an increasingly worrisome topic for republicans who saw it work 
against their 1989 candidates the trouble is that isolating issues 
is as difficult as finetuning speeches 
for example republicans pride themselves on a philosophy that 
seeks to keep government from intruding on private decisionmaking 
gov james r thompson of illinois who favors abortion rights 
suggested that gop tenet could be cast into doubt by a candidate 
opposed to abortion since that would involve the government in one 
of the most sensitive of private decisions 
he raised the question at a conference of republican governors 
earlier this month it already had been answered in one election 
virginia democrats made effective use of that theme in narrowly 
winning the contest for governor 
bush had said in advance there was no evidence that singleissue 
voters would make abortion a decisive issue but in the hairbreadth 
virginia verdict it almost certainly influenced enough votes to 
shape the outcome 
that points to the democratic course in dealing with abortion in 
the 1990 campaign their 1989 candidates succeeded in claiming the 
center on the issue strategists for both parties agree that is 
where the majority of the voters are pro and antiabortion 
zealotry notwithstanding my sense on this issue is that the 
american people are in the middle said william bennett the drug 
policy chief offering the governors conference some unsolicited 
advice 
but the republicans have had more trouble getting there 
bushs own position has come all the way from support for the 
1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion to ardent 
active opposition he vetoed four appropriations bills this fall 
because they would have permitted the use of tax dollars to pay for 
abortions for needy women who were victims of rape or incest bush 
would permit abortion in those cases but not with public funds 
the republican party platform advocates a constitutional 
amendment to bar abortions that doesnt bind anybody as gop 
leaders hasten to point out party platforms usually are ignored 
but it does set a starting point 
the national party position that counts is the one antiabortion 
course president bush is setting 
the bush administration has been urging the supreme court to 
overturn its original abortion decision that call is repeated in 
administration briefs on two cases that are to be argued before the 
court tomorrow on ohio and minnesota laws requiring that parents 
be notified before abortions are performed on their teenage 
daughters 
on a narrowed issue such as parental advice or consent for 
teenage abortions the opinion surveys and the political 
strategists agree that a candidate probably could find majority 
backing when it is broadened and simplified into a flat yes or no 
on abortion rights its hard to handle 
bush said there is plenty of room in the republican party for 
differing opinions on abortion and among democrats too 
on nov 14 bush met with four republican women house members 
who support abortion rights listened to their arguments but said 
his own views are not subject to change his spokesman then said 
that agreement on abortion was not a test of support that bush 
would back all republican candidates without regard to positions 
differing from his own 
two of the four house women want to move to the senate in the 
1990 elections and bush campaigned for them last week he avoided 
the abortion issue speaking as though it didnt exist 
at a chicago fundraising reception for rep lynn martin of 
illinois bush said the congresswoman has been right on issue 
after issue she thinks like i do like you do 
then he went to providence in behalf of rep claudine schneider 
of rhode island and praised her independence i always know 
exactly where she stands the president said 
flying home on air force one he vetoed another bill because of 
abortion funding rep schneider a presidential passenger said 
she was disappointed 
looking for the lessons of 1989 chairman lee atwater and other 
republican leaders are counseling 1990 candidates to take clear 
positions on abortion state them early in the campaign and stand 
firm 
bennett told the governors he wont mind if republicans are a 
minority because they stand on principle 
he holds office by appointment

imagine an american company that sponsors a 
science prize in japan to breed a succession of nextgeneration 
japanese nobel prize winners 
imagine an american company that calls itself a valuable 
source of european strength in the drive for greater efficiency 
and in competition for world markets 
what is this american company doing shooting itself in the 
foot no the company is international business machines corp and 
it is acting very much in its own selfinterest 
ibms generosity in japan europe and elsewhere may not please 
congressmen and government officials who are trying to build up the 
united states to fight foreign rivals but then thats not ibms 
goal 
ibm as its name implies is a truly international company that 
just happens to have headquarters on a wooded hilltop in a small 
town about 25 miles north of manhattan 
overseas ibm is happy to be thought of as a local company the 
perception helps the company sell more locally hire the best 
people in each country and get good treatment from local 
governments on such issues as taxes and tariffs 
c michael armstrong a native of detroit is proud of ibms 
success in spreading its research manufacturing sales and service 
operations into every corner of the world 
ibm to some degree has successfully lost its american 
identity the senior vice president in charge of ibm world trade 
corp said in an interview in his corner office earlier this year 
ibm is the very model of a modern multinational others include 
west germanys siemens ag the netherlands nv philips and to a 
lesser degree american companies such as general motors corp and 
ford motor co which are entrenched in europe and have alliances 
with japanese automakers 
the future belongs to such companies which float above national 
boundaries obeying the rules in every country where they operate 
but belonging to no country in particular 
these companies are not merely multinationals but 
transnationals transcending international borders 
it takes real effort to change perspective and see companies in 
this light most political leaders continue to miss the point by 
judging companies according to where their headquarters happen to 
be 
governments of individual nations are going to have to learn how 
to deal with transnational companies in ways that benefit their own 
people it is not an easy task because governments have less 
leverage against a transnational than against a company that does 
all its business locally 
a transnational company is like a living organism with each 
part dependent on the others for survival a government that tried 
to nationalize an ibm factory would find itself with a useless 
asset because ibm would cut the factory off from its worldwide 
system of distribution manufacturing and research 
fortunately for the united states ibm does have a strong 
commitment to this country which after all remains its largest 
single market and source of employees for example ibm has shared 
some of its most advanced computer chip technology with other us 
companies to assure itself of a steady supply of chips from outside 
suppliers 
on the other hand usbased transnationals like ibm gm and 
ford have few qualms about importing parts and even whole products 
for the american market even though making them here would create 
more jobs for americans in design and manufacturing 
the point is not that these companies are somehow disloyal or 
treacherous the point is that their interests do not always match 
the us national interest 
the issue is more important than ever now that washington is 
debating how to dole out the benefits of an industrial policy 
that is a program to improve the ability of this nation to compete 
in world markets 
harvard universitys robert b reich a professional skeptic 
put it this way in an essay earlier this year in the new republic 
our economic future as well as our national security is 
better served by developing a large corps of technologically 
sophisticated workers within the nation than by boosting the 
profitability of americas global corporations

a year after an earthquake smashed 
northwestern armenia into rubble the city of leninakan is a 
shantytown of mud and memories 
the garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket 
on a tiny wood stove the stove also heats a makeshift cabin they 
built from remains of their former apartment building next door 
far above rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on 
the fourth floor which was exposed when the side of the building 
sheared off 
were afraid of living in a large building again meruzhan 
garapetyan said 
popular songs speak of the disaster of dec 7 1988 when an 
earthquake measuring 69 on the richter scale killed at least 
25000 people and destroyed the homes of 500000 more 
oh earthquake what have you done one asks why did you 
leave so many parents without their children you covered them 
with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears 
the armenian relief agency search says 20000 people still are 
missing 2000 of them children daily life is slogging through 
mud relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return 
a quake of 71 magnitude in the san francisco area on oct 17 
killed only 66 people damage was estimated at 7 billion but much 
of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks 
in leninakan armenias secondlargest city vartan oganisyan 
and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet 
metal wood scraps tar paper and salvaged window frames 
other families crowd into halfshattered buildings construction 
huts army tents round mongolian yurts abandoned railway cars and 
even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows a few open 
cooking fires can be seen in the twilight 
electrical power is intermittent as armenia enters the bitter 
soviet winter 
children bundle up for classes in temporary unheated buildings 
they wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at 
the slightest noise 
after school they play earthquake recreating the disaster 
in the muddy streets 
hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work many 
graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave 
sofik torunyan who lost both children was there on what would 
have been her daughters 20th birthday with a cake fashioned from 
carnations 
oh my young daughter oh my love she wailed holding onto 
a friend why didnt i die too so i would not have to live 
without you 
people struggle on helping each other hospitality and pride 
remain 
a dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that 
still works a boy paints the window frame in his familys shack 
visitors are offered coffee and sweets but often there is no 
electricity to boil water 
maria tumanyan who lives in the ground floor of a severely 
cracked fivestory building insists that were making great 
progress she concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of 
broken concrete and twisted metal not the rubble remaining 
the town of spitak was leveled kirovakan and 300 villages were 
shattered 
in leninakan which had 235000 residents the quake destroyed 
99 ninestory apartment buildings 10 schools and every factory 
officials said 
reconstruction has lagged badly nikolai i ryzhkov the soviet 
premier said in november that the crash program to rebuild in two 
years already was a year behind schedule meaning virtually nothing 
had been accomplished 
residents blame disorganization central plannings failure to 
supply enough building materials and a twomonth blockade of 
armenia by ethnic enemies in neighboring azerbaijan 
many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because 
supply shipments were held up on rail lines in azerbaijan 
by early november only three new buildings had been completed 
all by the army for the army 
karlin ambartsumyan chairman of the city communist party 
committee still hopes to move 4000 families into a vast new 
suburb before years end but even that would be only onefifth as 
many as planned 
for now ambartsumyan is concentrating on getting the remaining 
homeless among the 190000 people now living in leninakan into 
construction huts and other temporary housing and getting heat for 
them before winter 
svetlana asaturyan lives in one such hut generously called a 
little house in russian but in reality a tworoom insulated 
packing crate 
she and her family of five must haul water from a block away 
use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relatives place for 
showers her washing flaps over a sea of mud 
mrs asaturyan is grateful however because they used to be in 
the remains of the towel factory where she once worked and where 
30 of her coworkers were killed 
her little house like thousands of others showed up 
without a door window glass heater wiring or furniture it was 
vandalized en route apparently by azerbaijanis whom the armenians 
accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies 
when asked about the soviet leaderships promise to rebuild in 
two years mrs asaturyan said ill be glad if i get a home 
within five years 
about 20000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments 
in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months a 
forest of 129 cranes towers over the site and buildings faced with 
local salmoncolored stone gleam in the sun 
because ninestory apartment blocks shoddily built of preformed 
concrete panels collapsed in the quake the new buildings are made 
by assembling vaultlike precast rooms foreman gennady pogosov 
said none is more than four stories high 
in may a commission of the ruling politburo blamed most of the 
deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors 
no charges have been filed said haik minasyan an armenian 
government spokesman 
only a few projects are under way in the city itself on the 
central square a statue of vladimir i lenin looks over a scene of 
devastation a ruined school department store government 
building post office shops and a sock factory 
cafes and movie theaters are gone so are most food stores and 
shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and 
potatoes at what remains of the bus station 
ambartsumyan said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half 
the original city lots because the ground is too unstable

his family hasnt seen araik sukasyan 
since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago but they 
speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a moscow 
psychic can tell them where 
we wait to find him alive said his mother galine weeping 
as she pulled out araiks school portrait she hopes publicity will 
bring word from someone who has taken him in if that happened 
the fourth grader vanished in the rubble of school no 9 along 
with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit leninakan 
during school hours dec 7 1988 
authorities say it killed 25000 people but the armenian relief 
agency search says 20000 more still are missing including 2000 
children 
they are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of 
those evacuated said ashot georgyan director of the search 
office in yerevan capital of soviet armenia he said he had no way 
of knowing how many of the 20000 were dead and how many were just 
separated from their families 
we are now continuing the search for children particularly 
orphans who were sent in groups to various points in the soviet 
union and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts georgyan 
said 
many parents like the sukasyans believe officials may have 
lost track of some evacuees 
larissa vagashakovna head of the moscow office of search said 
she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the 
missing children 
its impossible to forget the faces of these parents she 
said they havent found the corpse and they havent found the 
child where have they disappeared to 
araiks sister narina also was in school no 9 when it 
crumpled she escaped and when her mother came running from home 
narina cried momma i am alive but i cant find my brother 
for a month after the earthquake the sukasyan family watched 
workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been school no 
9 
searchers found the bodies or identifiable parts of bodies of 
420 students and 26 teachers there was no sign of 100 others 
including araik 
there were people where they found only one leg and 
identified the shoe or the skirt and they buried that said lida 
grigoryan a teacher at another school and a friend of the family 
the sukasyans searched hospitals opened every one of thousands 
of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in 
yerevan and moscow 
they found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that 
someone took him away 
in moscow there is a woman who can see where someone is by 
looking at his picture we hope she can help araiks mother 
said then she was worried again because reports say the psychics 
powers only work with an original photograph 
this is a copy she said staring at her sons young 
serious face

for fidel castro the 1980s have been the worst 
of times today with the communist world in upheaval the cuban 
president stands virtually alone in clinging stubbornly to a 
socialist orthodoxy that each year seems to have fewer adherents 
the soviet union under mikhail gorbachev has changed so much that 
castro has implied that he wonders how much longer the 
moscowhavana alliance can last 
</TEXT>

it was a moment fidel castro savored one 
could forgive him if he felt a bit smug as he stood before the 
large gathering at havanas ultramodern convention center after 
all the mighty united states had tried for years to isolate him 
and here he was about to gavel to order one of the largest summit 
meetings in history with 55 heads of government on hand for the 
festivities castro looked like a man ready to pop a champagne cork 
but that was 10 years ago the memory of that september 1979 
summit meeting of the nonaligned movement a collection of third 
world countries has long since receded since then almost nothing 
has gone right for castro and at this juncture almost 31 years 
deep into the cuban revolution his prospects seldom have looked 
bleaker most analysts say its hard to imagine any leader who 
will welcome the passing of the 1980s more earnestly than castro 
in an age of pragmatists he stands almost alone in clinging 
tenaciously to a socialist orthodoxy that each year seems to have 
fewer adherents his antiamericanism is as unbridled as ever but 
in a time when economic concerns dominate the global agenda the 
united states is increasingly looked upon as a partner for trade 
and investment rather than as an expansionist power bent on 
imposing its will on others essentially cubas view 
many third world countries angola mozambique and guinea 
bissau to name a few that castro once saw as partners in the 
international socialist movement have begun selling off inefficient 
state industries and are adopting market practices the disrepute 
of communism throughout eastern europe is widespread and the 
demands for democratic reform are becoming increasingly strident 
strikes in the soviet union and mass protests in china by workers 
and students have exposed weaknesses in the marxist approach but 
castros commitment to that course seems unbudging 
the soviet union under mikhail gorbachev has drifted so far from 
castros vision of the united states that the cuban leader has 
implied he wonders how much longer the 2decadeold moscowhavana 
alliance can last while castro rants about the imperialists 
moscow makes deals with them and there is even talk of a 
sovietamerican partnership it is no longer astonishing to suggest 
that the kremlin seems closer to washington in some ways than it 
does to havana two of the countries for which castro has felt the 
closest ideological kinship east germany and vietnam are bleeding 
refugees at a rate that leaves defenders of the socialist faith 
groping for explanations 
us officials say castros dilemma is that he cant start a 
sovietstyle reform process without robbing his own revolution of 
its identity he has been determined from the outset to create a 
society that bears as little resemblance as possible to the united 
states he has associated the united states with all of the evils 
of prerevolutionary cuban society prostitution gambling 
casinos repressive military government foreign domination 
exploitative capitalism unemployment illiteracy and disease but 
while eradicating the worst abuses of the past and eliminating us 
influence almost completely he has built a new society plagued by 
chronic shortages and showing little economic vitality 
but if castro adopted sovietstyle reforms that would call into 
question the most basic premises of the revolution one of which is 
that the united states with its disreputable value system and 
unquenchable expansionist tendencies is on the losing side of 
history he shows no sign of backtracking from that view 
will he change before he dies asks castro biographer 
georgie anne geyer no he is an extraordinarily unified 
stubborn man 
castro 63 seemed to confirm that view last january when he 
said socialism or death marxismleninism or death he has not 
retreated from his position that cuba is in the vanguard of an 
international process governed by irrevocable historical 
forces that will end with the worldwide triumph of socialism it 
is an increasingly lonely stand shared by north korea and a small 
and diminishing number of others 
no one beyond perhaps nicaragua looks to cuba for political 
and economic leadership and inspiration says sally 
sheltoncolby who served during the carter administration as an 
expert on latin american affairs 
far from mellowing as his revolution approaches middle age 
castro stresses increased reliance on moral incentives cracking 
down on ideological deviants and arresting human rights activists 
thought to be too irreverent in their criticism of the government 
this past summer castro even banned two soviet spanish language 
publications products of the glasnost era under gorbachev which 
castro felt were downright subversive according to independent 
human rights groups about 30 cubans who spoke to delegates from a 
united nations human rights panel that visited cuba last year are 
now in prison 
the us assistant secretary of state for human rights richard 
schifter says that in cuba there is complete intolerance for the 
slightest form of dissent cuban officials reply that it is 
safer to be a dissident in cuba than in most central american 
countries where nonconformists risk being targeted by death 
squads a phenomenon unknown in cuba 
1989 also produced the biggest political scandal in the history 
of the revolution in july four highlevel military and 
intelligence officers including a highly decorated army hero maj 
gen arnaldo ochoa sanchez were executed for drug trafficking 
corruption and betraying the revolution 
seven weeks later a former interior minister one of castros 
closest confidants was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse 
of office and other charges related to drug trafficking 
the cases shocked many cubans who had long been taught that 
high officials were models of revolutionary rectitude some 
analysts contend the crackdown was related less to a drive for law 
and order than to a move by castro to eliminate possible rivals and 
reformers 
a decade ago the world seemed more congenial to castro 1979 
produced for castro two new ideological allies in the hemisphere 
grenada and nicaragua the ouster of el salvadors military 
dictatorship in october of that year seemed to breathe new life 
into the leftist insurgency there in washington the carter 
administration appeared overwhelmed by crises both foreign and 
domestic 
in one unhappy fourweek period us embassies in three islamic 
countries were assaulted by angry mobs

the administration seemed especially inept when it announced the 
discovery of a soviet brigade in cuba only to ruefully 
acknowledge later that it had been there all along 
castros international reach extended well into africa where 
thousands of cuban soldiers were deployed in support of prosoviet 
regimes in angola and ethiopia 
but perhaps as a portent for the bleak decade that lay ahead 
for castro just four days before the 1970s ended the soviet union 
invaded afghanistan creating an extremely uncomfortable situation 
for castro in view of afghanistans role as a founding member of 
the nonaligned movement 
the invasion occurred less than four months after castro was 
touting to the nonaligned summit in havana that the soviet union 
was the natural ally of the movement the overwhelming majority 
of the more than 100 members in the movement criticized the soviet 
action when it came up in the united nations cuba despite 
castros role as chairman of the movement consistently cast its 
vote with moscow now even the soviets themselves have repudiated 
the invasion of afghanistan calling it a most serious 
violation of soviet norms 
for castro one of the most dispiriting events of the 1980s 
began less than 100 days after the decade began in april castro 
opened the port of mariel to cubans wishing to head north to 
florida for five months wave upon wave of cubans an average of 
almost 1000 a day escaped the island on the mariel freedom 
flotilla until castro closed the port in september the departure 
of that many cubans left the impression among many that something 
was gravely wrong with the revolution 
other reverses were to come the election of perhaps the most 
committed anticastro american president in the history of the 
revolution ronald reagan meant no respite for cuba as far as 
washington was concerned reagan steadily tightened loopholes in 
the economic embargo against cuba and also dealt setbacks to castro 
in other ways 
the cubanbacked government in grenada was ousted by a us 
invasion in 1983 reagan meanwhile was arming anticommunist 
insurgents in nicaragua and was sending largescale military 
assistance to el salvador to help counter cubanbacked leftist 
guerrillas the overall trend in the hemisphere was toward 
democracy not violent revolution castros high hopes of acquiring 
new allies in the hemisphere have been stalled 
not long after castro assumed power president john f kennedy 
was worried that cubanstyle upheavals could erupt all over the 
hemisphere as the 1980s end says sally sheltoncolby the 
growing rejection of the cuban model even by the latin american 
left is the single most startling change that has occurred in 
the hemisphere in 20 years 
domestically castro can point to some successes particularly 
in social services there is quite possibly no leader anywhere who 
pays closer attention to meeting the health needs of his people 
than castro and his efforts have produced impressive results cuba 
says its infant mortality rate is about a half to a third less than 
that of the soviet union the good health of cubans is underscored 
by the unusually large number of worldclass athletes the country 
continually produces 
castro also is able to boast that virtually every schoolage 
child has access to education a child in cuba has a much better 
chance of becoming a healthy productive adult in cuba than say 
in peru if the revolution sometimes falls short in its promise of 
a job for everybody cubas employment rates certainly have been 
much higher than the typical latin american country 
but critics such as professor irving louis horowitz at rutgers 
university maintain that the cuba that castro inherited in 1959 
was not a typical latin american country he claims cuba was the 
thirdranking developed country in latin america in 1959 and now 
ranks something like 16th or 18th because of marxist economics 
the undercurrent of dissatisfaction is obvious for many access 
to jobs education and health care is not enough there are 
powerful constraints on personal and political freedom and life 
for many is a chore rationing imposes strict constraints on both 
diet and fashion lines are long at stores and restaurants 
commuting is a nightmare and recreational opportunities are scarce 
castro has acknowledged the existence of widespread corruption 
at government enterprises he also complained about a tendency 
among cubans not to give their best effort on the job or not to 
show up for work at all despite castros exhortations the work 
ethic among many cubans is sadly lacking partly a result of a 
system that provides only meager material rewards for a days work 
as many observers see it castros vision of a nation populated by 
selfless workers who think only of the common good seems illusory 
he once said he never visited a construction site without finding 
the workers taking a break 
if reagans landslide reelection in 1984 was grim news for 
castro there was an even more ominous development seven weeks 
after reagans second inauguration the death of konstantin 
chernenko secretary general of the soviet communist party did not 
seem to be a momentous event at the time but the accession of 
mikhail gorbachev not only transformed the face of eastwest 
relations it also has raised questions for the first time about the 
durability of the once seemingly unshakable sovietcuban alliance 
analysts wonder how long the soviets will be willing to continue 
subsidizing the cuban economy at the rate of more than 4 billion 
annually particularly if the soviets continue their policy of 
focusing increasingly on domestic problems while deemphasizing 
international issues as the cuban troop commitment to prosoviet 
regimes in africa fades and castro becomes less useful politically 
to the kremlin moscows compulsion to assist cuba economically 
presumably will fade with it according to the current schedule 
the last of cubas troops will be leaving angola early in 1991 
castro can point to some achievements during the decade the 
cuban military presence in africa was a major factor in bringing 
about the removal of south african forces from angola and the 
breakthrough in 1988 toward independence in namibia 
once feared as a promoter of violent revolution and scorned by 
his neighbors castro now has normal diplomatic relations with most 
latin american countries over the past year he has attended 
presidential inaugurals in mexico venezuela and ecuador cuba even 
received the support of latin america over us objections for 
one of the un security council seats reserved for that region and 
will begin a twoyear stint on the council starting in january a 
new role for cuba as the next decade begins 
mark falcoff resident fellow at the american enterprise 
institute a research organization says the new decade might 
produce for castro a crisis of a different nature for his 
revolution 
without allies without enemies without an internationalist 
mission can cuba survive falcoff asks this promises to be 
one of the really interesting questions for the next decade and 
beyond

with a donated boat and an eighthgrade 
education a thirdgeneration fisherman tries to stem the decline 
of the waters that sustain him terry backer the first long island 
soundkeeper considers his work a legacy to his children 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as the third generation of his family to 
earn a living from the rich shellfish beds of long island sound 
terry backer grew up wellversed in the language of the sea 
as spoken by his father and grandfather it was an ancient 
language as timeless and salty as the currents and tides 
in backers lifetime that has changed new words petroleum 
hydrocarbons bacterial effluvium polychlorinated biphenyls have 
seeped into the fishermans vocabulary 
as a child says the 36yearold backer i would yell at 
people not to throw things in the water ive been hollering at my 
dad since i was 8 years old for throwing cigarette butts or soda 
cans overboard it just struck me that they didnt belong 
dad would say you cant compare a soda can to 300 million 
pounds of sewage the hell you cant its the exact same 
philosophy at work 
if a man takes offense at a stray cigarette butt how does he 
feel about pcbs in his bluefish if he finds floating soda cans an 
affront how does he cope with petroleum hydrocarbons 
terry backer has coped by learning a new language peppered with 
such terms as fax machine environmental litigation and 
regulatory process 
the time once spent fishing for oysters and pulling lobster 
traps is now given to tracking polluters and battling developers 
evenings once devoted to family are taken up with a steady agenda 
of speaking engagements at civic clubs 
terry backer long island sound fisherman has become terry 
backer long island soundkeeper an officious title for a 
400aweek job that carries no badge no benefits and no illusions 
im not naive enough to think that anything i do will have any 
immediate effect its a longterm thing i dont think i can 
change the world but i do need to start were talking about the 
family farm 
the farm is 1300 square miles of water rimmed by 570 miles 
of coast much of it gold home to 5 million people 
the population is constantly shifting to get closer to the 
shoreline says michael ludwig a connecticutbased ecologist 
with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration easily 
between 300 and 500 projects a year are proposed for long island 
sound even in this glutted market its still the most desirable 
real estate in the world 
the man who keeps watch has an eighthgrade education a bad 
back a wife two young sons and a sense of urgency he also has 
handson feetwet experience and an intimate knowledge of long 
island sound neither of which can be found in a textbook 
maybe the heart is more what this job needs than the book 
backer says 
maybe so agreed the directors of the nonprofit long island 
soundkeepers fund who chose him over collegeeducated applicants 
he knows more about the water than most marine biologists we 
deal with says robert f kennedy jr clinical professor at pace 
university school of law and supervising attorney for the hudson 
river fishermens association 
terry knows when theres stuff missing he has seen species 
disappear acres of yield grass smelt he can say there used to be 
blue crabs here but there arent any more he has an institutional 
memory that goes back three generations 
unlike many fishermen whove accepted the sounds decline and 
taken parttime jobs to supplement their income terrys never 
accepted it kennedy says he feels for the resource he loves 
it and hes decided to make a stand and fight for it 
making a stand often means making enemies backers been called 
everything from extortionist to ambulancechaser by elected 
officials throughout the region 
he goes into town board meetings where everybody hates him 
the wealthiest people in these towns will be screaming at him and 
hell state his arguments and fight with them kennedy says 
developers hate him because one of the big battles is against 
shoreline development that requires marinas marinas require 
dredging which terry opposes municipalities hate him because hes 
sued every municipality from new haven to new york 
the suits were brought during his tenure as president of the 
connecticut coastal fishermens association a group he cofounded 
to help fishermen deal with regulatory agencies and polluters 
the soundkeepers fund was established with proceeds from the 
settlement of an association lawsuit against norwalk in 1986 when 
local oyster beds were closed due to sewage contamination 
publicity about contaminated shellfish beds is a doubleedged 
sword says stonington fisherman joe gilbert on the one hand 
we need municipal and federal agencies to take note 
on the other hand he says such publicity causes sales to drop 
immediately even though pollution in one place doesnt mean 
contaminated shellfish all up and down the coast 
nonetheless gilbert approves of backers work terrys always 
working to improve the lot of fishermen he goes to a lot of 
meetings he speaks up and he speaks for a lot of people

though he still manages to go oyster fishing backers campaign 
on behalf of the sound is a sevendayaweek job its the house 
i dont own the novel i didnt write its the legacy i will leave 
my children 
he is thickset and stocky with popeye biceps unanchored 
shirttail and a face that evokes a connecticut autumn skyblue 
eyes windchapped skin and a chinful of reddishgold scrub a tiny 
gold anchor pierces one earlobe and a faded denim cap stained with 
fish blood moors his hair 
a selfdescribed walking contradiction hes a smoker who 
worries about air quality a fisherman who frequents a seafood 
restaurant then orders hot dogs for lunch 
hes also a pollution fighter who objects to being called an 
environmentalist a word that conjures up images of kooks in 
canoes treehuggers liberals 
he prefers fisherman and when asked why cites king james 
my god its a noble trade it was the apostles own calling 
there is something noble about being a fisherman about 
producing food for people to eat backer says 
however it was restlessness not nobility that led him to 
choose his fathers lobster boat over a high school education he 
also worked at a gas station then set off at 16 to see the world 
i picked crops in california i logged in oregon to give you 
an idea of the politicizing of terry backer i once owned a tshirt 
that said sierra club kiss my ax there is some confusion in 
society about just what natural resources are for 
the tshirt is long gone as is any confusion on its owners 
part the earth is for everyone backer says 
im not against progress but if progress means water you 
cant drink plants you cant grow fish you cant eat and air you 
cant breathe we need to redefine progress 
his effort on behalf of the sound began in earnest after a 
fishing trip to alaska in the early 70s it was very beautiful 
as pristine as you can get then i came back here to work with my 
father and one day while looking over the side of the boat i saw 
that the place had really gone downhill there were rafts of human 
sewage floating downriver 
each generation leaves less behind my grandfather didnt know 
it could all be consumed that it could be possible to dig out all 
the marshes how we got here is ignorance how we stay here is 
arrogance 
backers credentials as a fisherman help buttress his argument 
hes not an ivorytower environmentalist kennedy says he 
can be much more persuasive because hes able to say ive got a 
family that may go hungry because you are discharging this stuff 
into long island sound and i want you to stop or because you 
are dredging this shoal for your pleasure boat im going to lose 
income this year 
the idea that environmentalists take jobs away from people is 
still very prevalent backer says weve become 
supermarketized clean water and the first 6 inches of soil are 
what keep us all going 
people say that you cant compare worms and clams with people 
what im trying to tell them is that when the worms and the clams 
go we are not far behind 
he uses a donated 19foot powerboat to look for things that 
dont belong dead fish raw sewage detergent foam spewing pipes 
the boat is small for a reason most of the problems are right 
around the edges in shallow water with 86 sewage treatment 
plants all emptying into the sound theres always something to 
find 
on this particular sunday sundays are good days to catch 
people doing things they shouldnt be doing he finds a solvent 
leaving a sheen on the surface of the norwalk river 
backer frowns at the sight of a hen mallard dipping her bill 
into a tiny oil slick then follows the trail until the river 
narrows forcing him to turn back hell cover the rest of the 
distance on foot 
when i find something in the water thats when the real work 
begins tracking the culprit could take weeks much of the work 
is done in the office the second floor of an aging clapboard house 
overlooking an inlet 
a handlettered sign over the door says war room 
its considered good form for people involved in causes to say 
things like there are no enemies here backer says but 
there is an enemy the enemy is people companies municipalities 
whoever puts that dollar ahead of the environment thats going to 
sustain my kids youre my enemy 
far more battles take place in the hearing room than the 
courtroom every problem doesnt need to be addressed with a 
lawsuit backer says if i can go to a community and talk to 
people write letters or show up and do interviews with the local 
newspapers a lot of times thats all it takes to get people 
thinking differently 
government works best when people participate without citizen 
input the guys in the 800 suits are going to get what they want 
for the people they work for 
though the battles continue backer believes he and the sound 
already have won the war what weve won is an awareness around 
the area that someone is here and someone is watching

isle royale is a fascinating natural phenomenon 
that has beckoned indians before the birth of christ and 
archaeologists and biologists in modern times the indians mined 
natural copper from the island the scientists used it as an 
insulated laboratory to study animal behavior but now there is 
trouble one link in the balance of nature the wolf is dying out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for 40 years the wolves 
and moose of isle royale have engaged in a macabre dance of 
predator and prey before a fascinated audience of scientists and 
summer campers 
this island has been the site of one of the worlds most intense 
wildlife studies neatly confined to an 8 by 45mile laboratory 
isolated in lake superior 
now the wolves are dying no one knows why 
dr rolf peterson who for the past 19 years has been chief 
researcher for the 31yearold isle royale project fears there 
will soon be a winter when he cannot find a single wolf on the 
island where more than 50 roamed a few years ago 
until 1988 the national park service dictated a policy of 
noninterference with the wolves while researchers elsewhere 
captured the animals for blood tests and to attach radio collars 
on isle royale scientists learned what they could from aerial 
surveys and by examining moose carcasses nobody under any 
circumstances touched a wolf 
this was one of the last really unmanipulated wolf populations 
in the world former park superintendent jack morehead said from 
his office in washington where he is now is chief of operations 
for the park service these wolves were really a museum test 
specimen of wolves in the wild 
despite moreheads objections the park service last year gave 
peterson permission to collar the islands dwindling wolves 
the line was crossed now we can never say these wolves have 
never been touched by man said assistant park superintendent tom 
ferranti on the island isle royale is different for me now i 
feel a loss just knowing that 
isle royale is a rugged collection of high ridges plunging into 
tangled swamps a serrated edge of the earth rising out of lake 
superior 18 miles from canada the nearest mainland 
the indians called it minong and traveled across open lake in 
canoes to pry copper from the islands crevices today backpackers 
alight from ferry boats 
isle royale is teeming with moose more than 1600 at last 
count they were a waiting food supply when wolves from canada 
loped across the lake superior ice in what must have been 1949 the 
winter the lake froze they arrived unseen nine years after the 
island became a national park 
former park ranger bob hakala first confirmed there were wolves 
on isle royale it was november 1951 he and his wife were taking 
one last hike up feldtmann ridge before snow closed the island and 
sent them retreating to the michigan mainland in that first frost 
of winter he saw wolf tracks 
hakala also remembers the mournful sounds that came later 
you figure youre hearing the call of the wild when you hear 
that howl he says it has that sad quality 
that didnt stop a public relations campaign the next year to 
stock isle royale with four wolves from a detroit zoo the pack 
tore a housewifes laundry into strips ate a fishermans nets and 
then stalked a tourist rangers shot two of them and deported a 
third the fourth a black creature called big jim escaped and 
disappeared into island folklore 
in 1958 dr durward allen of purdue university arrived with his 
doctoral candidates to begin one of the worlds precursor studies 
of wolf predation there was precious little known about the wolf 
and its prey 
thirtyone years of research since then have told science much 
about the way wolves live allen says

these life communities are the most complex things we know 
about in the whole universe he said we are only beginning to 
unravel it 
when peterson stepped in he inherited a stable pack of about 
two dozen wolves and a celebrated study that mapped the harmony of 
nature 
something snapped the balance the population exploded by 1980 
isle royale had three wolf packs and 50 wolves it was the highest 
density of wolves recorded in the world 
just as suddenly the wolves began dying in 1981 30 wolves 
survived the winter in 1982 the population was 14 
in those two years counting new generations born and lost 
peterson figured 52 wolves died he found six carcasses and no 
conclusions 
the survivors roamed at a nervous pace evidence suggested the 
wolves were killing each other 
peterson didnt think it was anything more than an ordinary 
population swing for several more years but the wolves failed to 
make the comeback he hypothesized 
by 1988 there were just 12 animals left and the pups born each 
year were too few to replace the dying elders he persuaded the 
park service to let him capture isle royales wolves and take 
action 
blood samples taken from four of the animals last year showed 
three were exposed to lyme disease transmitted by infected ticks 
and suspected of causing reproductive failure in wolves 
the blood also showed two wolves were exposed to canine 
parvovirus a fatal disease of domestic dogs no dogs are allowed 
on isle royale but the park service suspects boaters sneak their 
pets ashore 
a third test showed the four wolves had lookalike genes in 
keeping with the theory the whole population comes from a single 
female who colonized the island 40 years ago island inbreeding 
could mean reduced fertility and the doom of the population it 
would not cause a population crash peterson thinks 
the big unknown is did disease cause the crash very likely 
it did and we will never know he said 
the only theory peterson can write off is starvation there is 
plenty of food 
a faint odor wafted on the lake breeze when he returned to the 
island last spring after a winter of teaching at michigan 
technological university in houghton carcasses of winterstarved 
moose rotted in the warm air 
over the next few weeks petersons field assistants found 
dozens of dead moose their legs tucked beneath them where they 
died in the snow there were more weak moose than wolves could 
kill more carcasses than wolves could scavenge 
meanwhile the islands wolf population dropped to 11 
the park service has not decided what to do one proposal is to 
simply let the wolves die without human intervention but isle 
royale without wolves could mean more moose more starved moose 
my own advice is just reintroduce wolves peterson says 
get with the program 
this summer peterson watched in frustration as the remaining 
wolves abandoned their traditional rendezvous sites there was no 
cohesive pack no evidence of denning no promise of pups 
where were the animals i havent the foggiest he said from 
the fishermans cabin where he keeps a graveyard of moose skeletons 
out back and writes a eulogy for wolves within 
then unexpectedly in september field assistant joanne thurber 
saw something hopeful 
she saw wolf pup tracks in the earth

coal has long been one of appalachias most 
valuable natural resources but theres something else in those 
hills thats coming into strong demand even as the coal industry 
flounders water pure mountain mineral water bottled water has 
become the fastestgrowing segment of the beverage business 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from smart shops in tokyo to the white 
house dinner table water from the mineral springs of appalachia 
suddenly has cachet and west virginia bottlers are helping quench 
the thirst of the healthconscious 
water straight out of these hills is just plain good and good 
for you they say 
out west they look at west virginia as a wild untouched 
area says tim greider managing director of quibell corp 
bottler of the states bestknown mineral water they arent 
concerned with pollution from west virginia we find that to be a 
good selling factor 
janet mcmillion coowner of the smaller numint springs co in 
lindside agrees 
a lot of people in other states and different cities like new 
york think west virginia is wilderness she says 
geary campbell spokeswoman for the international bottled water 
association in alexandria va says the 2 billion industry has 
grown dramatically in recent years 
weve seen over the past decade a growth of up to 500 percent 
in sales campbell says in 1988 alone the bottled water 
market grew by 149 percent in terms of sales which was an 
increase over all other beverage segments 
by far the most successful operation has been in rural monroe 
county about 140 miles southeast of charleston where quibell 
captures 12000 gallons of mineral water daily and trucks it 40 
miles over peters mountain to roanoke va it is bottled and 
shipped in virginia 
greiders company has increased its profits by 250 percent since 
august 1987 and has more than 200 distributors across the nation 
the executive says bottled water is becoming more popular 
because its no longer a drink for just the welltodo 
people are concerned with what they consume were finding 
that mineral water is becoming more mainstream to the american 
public greider says its the fastest growing segment in the 
beverage industry 
quibell which is sold throughout the united states was the 
first us mineral water to be exported and can be found on store 
shelves in japan and the middle east 
mineral water from west virginia is even served to president 
bush and his guests says dennis freemyer an assistant usher at 
the white house 
there are eight companies in west virginia bottling water and 
officials say that number will grow 
i certainly think it has a potential of becoming a fairly 
sizable industry that could greatly contribute to the state 
economy says ron forren director of the states public health 
and sanitation division which oversees the bottling of mineral 
water 
numint springs is the latest west virginia company to get into 
the market spending 400000 for a water bottling plant in 
southwestern monroe county 
its going to pay off this business is real profitable 
mcmillion says its providing jobs in the area its giving us 
some selfesteem and southern west virginia needs selfesteem 
forren says west virginias large number of springs and heavy 
concentration of limestone makes it a natural for producing mineral 
water 
the minerals in the springs and the bacteriological quality of 
the water apparently make it just a good sweettasting water that 
individuals like he says 
bill clark the monroe county extension agent says many of the 
hundreds of springs located in his county have highquality water 
we have tested the water and you can almost advertise that it 
has zero percent sodium its that low clark says the good 
things that water should have it has in it 
california texas and florida lead the nation in bottled water 
consumption averaging 19 gallons per capita per year while the 
national consumption rate is 64 gallons 
bill deal executive vice president of the bottled water 
association says production rankings for each state arent 
available 
right now it is still mainly regional but certainly 
especially in the sparkling category more products are being 
marketed nationally because they are primarily an alternative to 
soft drinks and alcohol campbell says

americas growing numbers of homeless people 
have problems more complex than the hobos of yesteryear no longer 
will just a meal and a bed get the job done says one innovative 
shelter director the answer in denver its computers to the 
rescue 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the denver rescue mission the oldest relief 
agency in the city isnt interested in just feeding clothing and 
saving the souls of the downandout it wants them to read write 
and understand computers too redbrick building with the blue jesus 
saves sign 
over the door director del maxfield is trying to redefine the 
goals of a shelter for t 
inside thehe homeless as well as the needs of the men 
who seek help there 
the latest innovation is a computerbased program for 
functionally illiterate adults it is part of a new 
sophistication of the old urban missions in response to changes 
in the makeup of the growing homeless population in america 
maxfield says 
in the past he says shelters were thought to be doing their 
job by providing a roof a prayer and a meal for hobos and 
alcoholics 
the new homhelters board chairman roy o howell a retired 
schoolteacher and other volunteer educators began a tutoring 
program to help the shelters wards earn high school equivalency 
diplomas 
then a year ago maxfield visited accelerated christian 
education inc in dallas to take a look at its computeroriented 
education courses for schools he worked with ace to develop 
similar programs for adults from the illiterate to those in need 
of refresher courses the resulting program began at the mission a 
few months ago 
the literacy and other programs are financed entirely by 
donations maxfield says in 1988 the denver rescue mission 
reported revenues of 717000 all of it from donations and 
interest the shelter probably has invested at least 6000 so far 
in the literacy program maxfield says 
maxfield believes in taking the mission to the streets as well 
where the homeless live he says many cannot leave their camps in 
railroad yards or under viaducts because they are afraid of being 
robbed this doesnt faze maxfield he says he developed street 
smarts at a previous job as chaplain in the los angeles county jail 
system 
the mission also has a truck that collects leftover food from 
denverarea supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods 
and it has a farm in northern colorado where interested shelter 
residents can get away from city pressures and help grow food for 
the shelter 
now maxfield is expanding the mission to include a shelter and 
vocational training center for women in a building being renovated 
nearby it is scheduled to open in january 
maxfield hopes the computers ultimately will be used not only 
for educational and vocational training but for personal 
development such as 
how to balance a checkbook he said

in the old west the fight was between the 
cattlemen and the homesteaders barbed wire vs open range in 
todays west the terms are different but the fight has a similar 
ring it pits developers with promises of riches against those who 
chose to be there because they like it the way it is

plans for a giant ski resort in this 
pristine corner of america near the canadian border have divided 
the local residents as decidedly as the methow river bisects the 
magnificent valley 
the conflict is not new in america it involves 1200 jobs and 
economic growth for a depressed rural county on the one hand and a 
radically altered lifestyle for the methow valley on the other 
a us supreme court decision this summer helped pave the way 
for construction of the 280 million early winters ski resort 
there are still formidable environmental obstacles before 
construction can begin but the supreme court decision is the 
biggest hurdle that the developers methow recreation inc have 
crossed that has brought the 3600acre resort much closer to 
reality 
washington lacks a major destination ski resort on the order of 
sun valley aspen or big sky and state officials have supported 
the project as a way to keep ski dollars at home 
there isnt a ski hill where you can stay with your family for 
a week says cal merriman owner of the 20room mazama country 
inn in the shadow of 6088foot sandy butte 
like other area business owners merriman expects the resort 
business to spill over to his operation but he is also aware of 
the changes it would bring 
a resort with accommodations for 7000 would be a small city 
and would require services such as grocery stores sewer systems 
and streets he says the social structure of the valley would 
change 
linda mills an employee of winthrop mountain sports feels the 
resort would give young people like herself more incentive to stay 
a lot of kids who graduate leave the valley she says 
people dont make much money 
okanogan county officials and many methow valley business people 
are enthusiastic about increased tax and retail revenues since the 
resort would be one of the biggest employers in the sparsely 
populated county of 30000 residents 
but there is little doubt a resort the magnitude of early 
winters would significantly change the region 
home to just 3600 fulltime residents the valleys depressed 
economy depends on tourism logging and the us forest service 
work is seasonal wages are low and there is widespread 
unemployment in the winter 
last summer i hired 10 people and kept two on in the winter 
says gene walker owner of tenderfoot inc a general store in 
winthrop there is 80 percent unemployment in the winter 
walker supports the resort as do many business owners along 
winthrops old weststyle main street just 15 miles west of 
winthrop which has 400 yearround residents the resort would 
likely be a major boost to an area that currently thrives only 
during the summer travel season through nearby north cascades 
national park 
but the area is also home to an independent collection of 
residents who came to escape urban pressures and are ekeing out a 
living to them the remoteness and lack of opportunity are a 
challenge 
one reason people move to the methow is its really hard to 
get by here says isabelle spohn of twisp a member of the methow 
valley citizens council an environmental group that challenged the 
resort in court 
a lot of us could make lots more money in the city says ms 
spohn who commutes 100 miles a day to teach special education in 
brewster we decided to make less money and live in a place we 
like 
in addition to the evergreens the wildflowers and the burbling 
streams the methow valley is wonderfully quirky 
hotels in winthrop lack television sets and telephones two 
modern conveniences much desired by visitors 
area bookstores are heavily stocked with the classics 
the confluence gallery in nearby twisp pop 800 is currently 
showing the ceramics and tapestries of zeljko kujundzic and the 
twisp pastries and savories cafe next door serves wonderful scones 
and strawberry muffins 
the local theater group is putting on oklahoma 
there is a lot of cultural diversity says pema choki an 
organic herb farmer who also waits tables at the cafe 
like other resort opponents ms choki is concerned the resort 
will ruin air and water quality wildlife habitat and the pastoral 
lifestyle of the valley 
in the planning for two decades early winters would transform 
sandy butte in the okanogan national forest into a downhill ski 
area averaging 3500 skiers a day and at the bottom a golf course 
and resort village with overnight accommodations for 7000 
it would easily be the largest community and largest job 
generator in the valley 
the methow valley citizens council a grassroots organization 
sued in 1985 
a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it saying the forest service had to 
come up with detailed measures to protect the valleys air quality 
mule deer herd and other environmental aspects 
but the supreme court ruled on may 1 that additional 
environmental impact studies were not required for the resort 
despite the supreme court victory the developers still need to 
obtain state permits and complete supplemental environmental impact 
statements on issues not covered by the high court 
still developers have said they hope to begin construction next 
year

carol burnett says it was a hoot to 
return to the theater of her childhood for her third special 
musical appearance with julie andrews 
the first was at carnegie hall in new york in 1962 the second 
at new yorks lincoln center in 1971 julie and carol together 
again which abc will televise on wednesday took them to the 
pantages theater in hollywood 
thats four blocks from where i was raised burnett says 
my grandmother and i occasionally went to movies at the pantages 
it was still a movie theater then they had a lot of premieres 
there and i can remember standing behind the ropes and watching the 
stars come in so it was a hoot to be on that stage 
burnett and andrews do a series of skits and songs for the 
onehour special 
julie and i of all people do a rap burnett says i fell 
down when she suggested it ken and mitzie welch wrote the rap song 
for us its called mamas all right and its us complaining 
about the way adults are treated by teenagers usually their own 
children 
for julie and i to do a rap was silly backstage we called 
ourselves white bread and mayonnaise 
they also do a sendup of the phantom of the opera its 
called phantom of the opry and its done as a countrywestern 
number 
julies a singer with hair as long as crystal gayles she 
says im an evil countrywestern singer with a twin sister 
banished to the catacombs of the opry shes the phantom and wants 
to make julie the star 
burnett is interviewed in her thirdfloor production office at 
the disney studios where she is making her new series for nbc 
carol amp company she points out the window to glenda jackson 
the current weeks guest star taking her lunch break outside 
on one wall of the office is a large oil painting of hollywood 
as it might have appeared in the 1940s she had the painting done 
by bruce cohen 
she puts a finger on one building and says thats the 
building where i lived with my grandmother my friend ilomae and i 
would go on the roof and shout down the air shaft people would 
yell back you girls get out of there and stop that noise 
burnett has written of her early experiences in one more 
time 
her new show for nbc probably will make its debut in the spring 
it will be her first regular television appearance in some time 
she made her tv debut as buddy hacketts girlfriend on 
stanley in 195657 the following year she was on pantomime 
quiz then spent three years on the garry moore show 
beginning in 1959 she costarred on the entertainers in 
196465 
the carol burnett show ran on cbs from 1967 to 1978 and four 
new shows were televised the following summer on abc she made 
occasional appearances on mamas family a spinoff of the show 
since then she has starred in such feature films as a 
wedding health the four seasons and annie and such 
tv movies as friendly fire the tenth month between 
friends and the laundromat 
julie and i met in 1960 when she came backstage to see me when 
i was doing once upon a mattress burnett says a mutual 
friend had said wed like each other and that usually puts you off 
we hit it off we performed together on the garry moore show and 
we worked so well together the idea was born that we should do a 
special 
it was a hard sell at cbs i was a second banana on garrys 
show julie was in camelot and nobody west of new jersey knew who 
she was she hadnt done mary poppins yet we finally got it on 
and the show won an emmy and the golden rose award at the montreux 
film festival 
burnett and andrews have never done a movie together although 
theyve talked about it 
her new series carol amp company is a comedy anthology 
conceived by matt williams creator of roseanne the halfhour 
episodes feature different characters each week and such guest 
stars as glenda jackson nell carter robert guillaume and howie 
mandel 
the appeal to me was doing different characters she says 
i cant think of any character id want to do every week a few 
years ago i thought of doing something like this then after disney 
signed matt williams they called me to meet matt he had this idea 
i liked him and what the heck 
we do this before an audience like variety but its much 
harder for me anyway on a variety show a sketch ran only seven 
or eight minutes if it didnt go over we could redeem ourselves 
with a song or another sketch this time its the entire show

nathan lane who has finally won critical 
acclaim in terrence mcnallys offbroadway hit the lisbon 
traviata knows the pitfalls and pratfalls of an actors struggle 
upward 
lane thought his breakthrough into public recognition would come 
with the play the film society in which he played the lead a 
teacher in a private school in south africa 
but it had to wait for his present role playing a hilariously 
fanatic fan of diva maria callas obsessed with hearing a pirated 
recording of her singing la traviata in lisbon 
critics praised the lisbon traviata now at the promenade 
theater and singled lane out for their highest accolades 
ive taken a big step in my career lane says i feel 
acceptance and respect this sort of critical reception does have 
an effect in the business 
only 30 now lane began perfroming as a child 
when i was in the sixth grade we did a production of around 
the world in 80 days abbreviated maybe 32 days he says i 
played the servant to phileas fogg theyre being attacked by 
indians on a train i went to hide i was a chubby kid and i took a 
little suitcase and crouched behind it i was much larger than the 
suitcase it got a big laugh 
it was like blood to a vampire i thought this could be nice 
to do i was bitten by the bug 
lane was born in jersey city nj got a scholarship and 
intended to go to college but at the last minute took a job 
touring the state in a musical about the history of new jersey 
he did dinner theater and summer stock 
eventually i moved to new york and starved he says i did 
singing telegrams sold tv guide and cookbooks by phone did 
telephone polls i called wheat farmers about what insecticide they 
were using 
lane did standup comedy with a partner he was in one of the 
boys a tv series that shot only 13 episodes then got an 
audition in 1982 for noel cowards present laughter directed by 
and starring george c scott 
it was the easiest audition i ever did he says two days 
later they called and said you got it i thought theyd get 
somebody more established in the theater it was my broadway debut 
no show since has gone as easily george c scott was such a 
gentleman so great to me like a father if hed asked me to jump 
off the brooklyn bridge i would have 
asked whether scripts are pouring in now that the lisbon 
traviata is a success lane says no then amends it to one 
poured in today 
director john tillinger who had directed lane here in 1988 in 
the film society suggested he be auditioned for the role of 
mendy in the lisbon traviata 
lane who considers himself a character actor not a comedian 
says i love working with john hes the first director in a long 
time who thought of me in terms of more than just comedy 
some people go to see the lisbon traviata without knowing 
whether its a comedy tragedy musical or drama lane says 
its a successful play lane says if they arent familiar 
with the world theyre going to enter theyre in for a big 
surprise the opera jokes are selfexplanatory stephen says 
marilyn horne sings like a truck driver i say marilyn horne is 
a truck driver she was discovered driving a fork lift in a los 
angeles gravel pit 
and after the initial realization that all the characters are 
gay the play becomes very universal 
slowly you realize it is about the fear of getting older and 
of being alone and feeling so desperate about that youd rather 
kill your lover than let him leave you 
i think its a brave play because it deliberately turns dark 
in the second act lane says by the end of the first act you 
see the darkness coming and the pain an sadness that is there if 
youre really paying attention some people feel cheated they 
thought it was just going to be laughs 
people have walked out it gets very frank the moment of 
nudity is not gratuitous for stephen to go home and see a nude 
young man there is meant to be shocking 
older men and women whom one would expect to be put off by the 
sexual frankness seem to respond to the play more than anyone lane 
says one older man told him this was an oldfashioned drama 
told in a whole new way this is the most moving experience ive 
had in the theater in 20 years

while bigbuck movies crowd into the nations theaters during 
the holiday season a number of smaller worthy films face the 
danger of being pushed out of the marketplace 
among them henry v a daring new version by kenneth 
brannagh staying together lee grants warm study of a small 
town family in trouble my left foot an inspiring tale of 
human survival with an electrifying performance by daniel 
daylewis drugstore cowboy grownup matt dillon in a highly 
original film about druggies in 1970 portland ore 
add to the list true love 
amazingly it was filmed for less than 1 million but true 
love has far more heart and humanity than todays bloated sequels 
and star ego trips notably the noxious harlem nights 
the movie contains no recognizable names or faces nor does it 
boast a high concept plot its fascination lies in its 
highspirited acting and verisimilitude to italianamerican life in 
the bronx 
director nancy savoca and her husband and coproducer richard 
guay have written a script centering on the rituals of a 
traditional wedding the bride annabella sciorra frets over why 
she is marrying michael ron eldard he is unreliable immature 
and selfish 
his qualms are just as severe he enjoys his life of freedom of 
being able to hang out with the boys whenever he wants why take on 
the hassle and responsibility of marriage 
their doubts and fears continue right up to the wedding night 
which he wants to spend with his chums its hard to imagine 
anything so dumb but thats about the only disparity in the film 
as a directorwriter nancy savoca has a marvelous eye for 
detail and human touches the interplay among the males and 
especially among the females are women so profane among 
themselves is carefully drawn and exploited for all its humor 
she also makes her actors look as if they werent acting both 
sciorra and eldard show sparks of star quality 
true love is getting a desultory release by mgmua and 
deserves time to find its audience

ballet music by giuseppe verdi london orchestra del 
teatro comunale di bologna conducted by riccardo chailly 
 
if not for anything else we should thank the french for 
insisting on ballets in their operas verdi wrote seven for his 
stage works performed in paris and these divertissements 
contain some beautiful music and an infrequent example of nonvocal 
verdi 
oboe clarinet or violin often sings the melody over the usual 
bouncing accompanying figures the score has moments of highly 
charged drama and the orchestration is always superb 
chailly induces this somewhat roughedged orchestra to give 
rhythmically taut highspirited and at times exciting 
performances the band has its high spots but an unfortunate 
number of low ones bad intonation in the brass blurry strings 
and looseknit pizzicati 
the pieces are drawn from macbeth i vespri siciliani

we too are one arista eurythmics 
 
once the darlings of postmodern synthpop enthusiasts dave 
stewart and annie lennox have at last begun to speak to all of us 
their hardedged we too are one builds on a more 
guitarheavy rhythm and blues sound and sticks with lyrics rooted 
in a strong sense of selfworth lennox plays the jilted woman in 
the powerful lead single dont ask me why and the brutal you 
hurt me and i hate you she sounds nasty and unforgiving but 
only because a man pushed her too far and she knows shes too good 
for that 
in the sharply critical the king and queen of america 
lennox and stewart comment on arrogant phony political figures who 
exploit people with empty promises people who never did anything 
to make ourselves feel proud 
the real highlights on we too are one come in its ballads 
lennox laments the death of her father and grieves over her recent 
miscarriage in angel a poignant comment on the sadness of 
death and the hope of a better life in the netherworld 
the hymnlike when the day goes down is dedicated to the 
less fortunate and downtrodden telling them all gods children 
are beautiful and pure and youre as good as all of them 
lennoxs rich alto caresses the words lending them a genuine 
sincerity as stewarts guitar weaves a gentle background 
nowadays lennox and stewart write songs that are modern without 
being threatening we too are one seems more listenerfriendly 
than some of their previous eight albums it wont scare away 
aficionados of other types of music quite an accomplishment

this seems to be the season of the olympia 
dukakis film festival since the academy award winner is 
simultaneously appearing in three major productions 
it seems that way she comments with a throaty laugh but 
actually its a coincidence these films which have been done 
over the past 2 years just happened to be coming out at the same 
time 
they are look whos talking as the nagging mother of 
kirstie alley steel magnolias as a sardonic widow in the 
smalltown comedy drama crowded with stars and dad as the 
overbearing wife of jack lemmon and mother of ted danson 
the trio may seem like a bountiful harvest from her warmly 
applauded win of the supporting actress oscar for moonstruck 
earlier this year but all were in the works before that happy 
event 
the actress was here for steel magnolia festivities and she 
appears in an interview as she does on the screen warm worldly 
wise and intelligent the oscar seems to have changed her not at 
all shes still the same olympia dukakis who did such a fine 
selling job as aunt millie in the spaghetti sauce commercials 
steel magnolias threw six volatile actresses together in a 
small southern town a potentially explosive situation but olympia 
said she and her costars sally field shirley maclaine dolly 
parton daryl hannah julia roberts had a ball 
sometimes it was very raucous and lewd and lascivious she 
chuckled we had a lot of fun together bawdy at other times it 
was very reflective philosophical we discussed life liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness 
it was really a very nice time of coming together the best of 
what happens when women are together strongly supportive and 
conciliatory nurturing caring 
no temperament everyone seemed to like their characters a 
lot you felt that everyone around you was really on target 
it was different on moonstruck she reflected recalling 
when two of the actors had a blowup and in the scuffle she had 
coffee spilled on her but she agreed the incident might have 
derived from the italian nature of the movie 
in steel magnolias dukakis was able to play her own age 
meaning 50ish for dad she had to endure two hours in the 
makeup chair as latex was applied to age her 15 to 20 years 
the makeup helped to assume the age she said also the 
clothes were specifically and carefully worked out the length of 
the sleeves the pants so that the bones showed the hump in the 
back the jewels oversized the pocketbook a little too big there 
was a kind of physical tightness about her that matched her 
feelings 
her opinion of lemmon a very serious actor i say that 
because having seen him in movies being so funny and carefree and 
bouncing off walls then to meet him and see how seriously he takes 
his work its not that he didnt joke and kid off the set but 
he was very concentrated on his work 
the actress was as surprised as anyone when look whos 
talking went through the roof no 1 at the box office five weeks 
in a row 85 million in 38 days 
im so happy for director amy heckerling and kirstie and 
john travolta she said i have to admit that i never thought 
it would have this kind of popularity i thought it was well done 
and amy heckerling has a nice way with actors there was a nice 
feeling on the set a kind of freedom to work and move around at 
the same time you feel she sets boundaries so its a nice working 
situation 
olympia dukakis is a late starter in the business born to 
greekborn parents in lowell mass she grew up in the same 
political ferment that produced her cousin michael the 
massachusetts governor and presidential candidate after graduating 
from boston college she worked as a physical therapist then 
returned to college to study theater arts 
she worked in a boston regional theater then moved to new york 
at the age of 29 with her actorhusband louis zorich she taught at 
new york university while playing in soap operas and offbroadway 
this might have been the story of her career except for a series of 
events that started six years ago 
i did a christopher durang play the marriage of bette and 
boo that nora ephron saw the actress related she 
recommended me to mike nichols for heartburn i played meryl 
streeps mother and was eventually cut out of the film he cast me 
in the play social security which ran for quite a while norman 
jewison saw me in that and put me in moonstruck 
and what has been the result of her oscar win 
we no longer have a mortgage she said with a laugh she and 
her husband live in 100yearold house in montclair nj

if a man cant be a hero to his valet can a 
pianist be a hero to the technician who tunes his piano 
yes both a hero and a friend says franz mohr about the late 
vladimir horowitz 
mohr chief concert technician at steinway amp sons accompanied 
the pianist to performances that included his heralded comeback at 
carnegie hall in 1965 his 1986 moscow concert and two appearances 
at the white house 
he last saw horowitz four days before he died during a 
wednesday session for a new recording at horowitzs manhattan home 
when mohr arrived friday for another session he was told that 
horowitz had practiced for half an hour but didnt feel well the 
pianist died suddenly nov 5 while discussing with his wife wanda 
a menu for that nights dinner to which they had invited pianist 
murray perahia 
horowitz was in a class by himself mohr said he had 
tremendous command when it comes to technique many young artists 
have technique today too but nobody has such a wide range of 
color like horowitz he had from a superfortissimo to a 
superpianissimo so soft it hardly exists when he played his last 
european tour in 1987 he played liszts consolation with such 
command it made you cry 
he played dangerously in a way in his phrasing and his 
tempos almost many times to the breaking point but never over it 
he had such clarity in fast passages you heard every note many 
pianists smear through even now at 86 he was tremendous 
listen to his last record horowitz at home unbelievable 
they were friends too mohr said many times im invited for 
dinner after a concert we had the horowitzes for dinner at our 
home they appreciated my family very much i have two boys in the 
piano business in leading positions i would say my daughter is 
getting married in february wanda said they would come 
wanda was the best critic for him he listened to her she is 
profound and knows music my wife and i love her too 
horowitzs own piano a wedding gift when he married wanda 
toscanini in 1933 was moved from his home to the basement of the 
steinway showroom three years ago his last recording was done on a 
new piano from steinway 
gesturing to horowitzs piano which he always took with him on 
tours mohr said he was planning to take this piano again on 
tour i prepared it for him he was coming in this week to look at 
it he said soon he would play in berlin hamburg and amsterdam 
maybe leningrad 
asked whether horowitz was eventempered or volatile mohr said 
i would say that being such a genius as he really was a man of 
his caliber would change emotionally hour by hour you see it in 
his playing he never played the same piece the same way 
of course he could blow up or get excited on the spur of a 
moment that some little thing is not just right that can happen 
but it is understandable 
for a technician he was very easy to work with because he 
was consistent in what he did he always had his rehearsal at 4 
pm saturday and his concert at 4 sunday he never practiced the 
day of the concert he said if he didnt know the piece the day 
before he shouldnt play it 
mohr has traveled with pianists some of them famous who played 
every day on whatever piano was available and often practiced so 
close to the time of the concert that he had no time to prepare the 
piano 
tuning is extremely important he said an action has more 
than 10000 parts consisting of wood and felt therefore subject 
to changes in humidity you have constantly to check the regulation 
of the instrument especially a piano which travels in russia i 
had two sets of tools with me plus quite a few parts like 
strings 
mohr is nervous only for the first few bars then when he hears 
the piano sounding all right he relaxes and enjoys the music 
he started his music career in performance studying violin in 
his native germany i had problems with my left wrist i came to 
the painful conclusion i couldnt pursue a musical career i was 
already 22 when i went into this tuning i worked my way through 
the factory some technicians shrink from contact with musicians 
but mohr relishes it 
steinway moved him to new york in 1962 my predecessor was 
bill hupfer he was a legend he had traveled all his life with 
rachmaninoff when he retired i took over as chief concert 
technician 
mohr recalled one horowitz incident with a smile he made me 
pretty famous when he played in berlin it was a tremendous 
success i came home on monday he called me you have to come 
back i play a second concert he said to the press in berlin if 
franz doesnt come back there wont be any second concert it 
ended up on tv and all of that

he grew up in basketballcrazed indiana and 
the irony wasnt lost on henry lee summer 
here he was cooling off in the basketball locker room at 
arizona states university activity center wearing his favorite 
black hightop sneakers with the cheers of the crowd still ringing 
in his ears 
but on this late september night people didnt come to watch 
summer play hoops in a charity pickup game the fans paid big bucks 
to see him do what he really does for a living sing 
ever since i can remember i wanted to be involved in music 
said summer in a backstage interview i started out singing at 
age 3 or 4 in a church choir i knew i could sing and when i did 
people reacted differently than when other people sang 
it wasnt that i had a better voice than everybody else i 
just know that when i do sing and im feeling what im singing 
people can feel it too i love to get people excited i noticed 
that real early on and got into it even as a kid theres a fine 
line between church and rock n roll anyway theyre both dealing 
with the human spirit 
summer now 34 is touring the country to promote his second 
album for cbs records called ive got everything 
the lp released in may has sold about 400000 copies and is 
closing in on gold status thanks to the hit single hey baby 
his selftitled debut album for the label last year had the top 
20 hit i wish i had a girl but peaked at around 
300000something in sales according to summer 
i wasnt happy with the way that album came out but it wasnt 
the producers fault said summer who writes and arranges his 
own songs and plays both acoustic guitar and keyboards i dont 
like doing things more than once in the studio you do things over 
and over and over and over i only want to do it once and thats 
it 
summers new lp which he produced himself was recorded at 
henrys house of noise his home in indianapolis 
there was equipment everywhere except the bedroom he said 
we miked the guitars in the kitchen had the drums in the garage 
and put the mixing board in my living room i just wanted things to 
sound live and most of the songs were done in one take 
i was comfortable in my house and could sing whenever i felt 
like it as opposed to being on a schedule i used my band and 
three people from john cougar mellencamps band guitarist mike 
wanchic bassist toby myers and violinst lisa germano we recorded 
everything like a band and the vibe was right when it wasnt 
happening we went and played basketball 
the lanky 6foot3 summer grew up as henry lee swartz in the 
small farming community of brazil ind population 5000 where 
he first sang at the church of the nazarene 
he was a good enough high school guard to earn a full basketball 
scholarship to western wyoming junior college but dropped out 
after one year 
i was a big fish in a small pond but that was the first time 
basketball started getting in the way of music summer said i 
remember missing half the games i was in bands and it was either 
go to the gigs or go to the away games 
summer selftaught on drums guitar and piano headed to 
jackson miss where he perfected his husky vocals in nightclubs 
and learned roadhouse rhythm and blues plus fatback southern boogie 
he returned to indiana in the early 1980s and released four 
singles and two albums on local independent labels in 198286 
before being signed by cbs in october 1986 
by then he was already known as henry lee summer 
i started going by that 15 years ago he said i was in 
band called the summer so thats where the name came from i got 
my first band together when i was 11 ive been in a million bands 
since then 
summer and his current sixpiece band have opened for eddie 
money stevie ray vaughn and the doobie brothers this year and 
currently are on richard marxs tour 
on the road he often drives himself in a minivan behind the 
bands bus and writes his melodies by humming into a tape machine 
on the seat next to him 
most of his latest songs are love ballads such as something is 
missing and whats a poor boy to do but he promises more 
uptempo stuff for his next album 
summer has three tracks ready including the song low flying 
man that he is testing out on the road with favorable reaction 
his shows usually end with a standing ovation after a few 
encores 
ive always known that i had something to say musically i 
know when im playing live a lot of people can relate to what im 
singing summer said i doubt that ill be the next bruce 
springsteen but i think ill be able to keep making records and 
reach a level maybe not platinum if i can turn out gold records 
that would be good enough for me

everyone in town knew of anna krampitz a 
deaf recluse who lived in a rundown white house next to a car 
dealership theyd see her on frequent walks to the bixby memorial 
free library where she would check out teenage romance novels 
she never married never held a job 
thats about all most folks know of her life but many know of 
her death 
anna krampitz was found frozen to death alone in the house in 
which she was born 82 years ago a home with no running water no 
central heat and just a coal stove to warm the single room in which 
she lived 
her 69yearold brother theodore was charged with neglect of 
the elderly krampitz was his sisters legal guardian and the state 
says he is responsible for the conditions in which she was living 
he has pleaded innocent and wont talk about the case trial has 
been delayed indefinitely 
i think most folks are afraid of dying by themselves said 
michael jackman of miller chevrolet co inc the business next 
door to annas house at 20 main street i dont know if that 
could be true of anna krampitz 
community efforts to reach out to her simply failed some 
neighbors say city clerk joan devine recalled that one christmas a 
boy scout troop wanted to take her a holiday basket she threw the 
contents across her battered porch 
it seems many folks have their own anna krampitz stories 
on several occasions jackman said she dumped leaves and 
shrubbery on cars parked alongside her home maybe she didnt like 
their color he said a barbedwire fence was erected between the 
dealership and the house 
conditions were a surprise and we were right next door 
nowadays something like that in a little country town you dont 
expect that to happen he said 
but authorities say theodore krampitz knew how his sister was 
living 
in a 1985 letter to the city arguing that a 30200 appraisal on 
the house was too high he wrote the house has no running water 
due to the pipes and plumbing all freezing up and breaking 
everything there is no kitchen as such no electricy sic in the 
upper part of the housethe roof leaked badly in the past and the 
plaster is off the ceilings and walls in most of the house the 
windows and the outside of the house is allin sic bad need of 
repair but im sic nn he position ot sic spend 20000 to 
repair the old place under present circumstances with my sister in 
there 
the appraisal was lowered to 24400 according to court 
documents 
because there was no plumbing krampitz took his sister water in 
jugs court records said when vermont state police detective sgt 
bernard chartier asked if he had considered getting the plumbing 
fixed krampitz said no chance cause it would just get ruined 
in no time at all 
chartier wrote in an affidavit that there was a threefoot pile 
of human waste in a room that used to be the kitchen vergennes 
police sgt john dugan said it was so cold in the house he couldnt 
even smell it 
dugan also recalls the books found all over the house even the 
bathtub was full of them and there was krampitzs diary in which 
she noted holidays and made detailed entries about the weather 
the last entry was dec 9 1988 her body was found 10 days 
later 
the department of social welfare provided fuel assistance 
checks and some of that money cannot be accounted for chartier 
wrote 
few people admit knowing anna krampitz well and those who did 
declined to talk about her but one librarian made a face when told 
that others in town had said kramptiz was crabby she looked away 
and murmured it simply wasnt true 
addison county states attorney john quinn said im aware 
that she was an unfriendly old bird but the purpose of having 
a guardianship of someone is because theyre unable to take care of 
themselves 
some 500000 elderly americans are believed to be under 
guardianship judged unable to care for themselves or their 
finances and made wards of the court this strips the wards of 
control over their lives including where they can live what 
medical treatment they receive and how their money is spent 
quinn believes the case has done a great deal to raise awareness 
about elder abuse perhaps probate judges may not have as high a 
good faith assumption now that they might have had in the past 
he said 
one in 25 older adults is abused according to an estimate in a 
1985 report to congress elder abuse a national disgrace the 
abuse takes all forms psychological and physical torment neglect 
and theft 
the krampitz case made every public official more aware of 
these kinds of conditions said city manager and health officer 
mel hawley adding he didnt realize the conditions but hes not 
certain what he could have done anna was left in the care of her 
brother there it is im not proud of this situation i dont 
think im responsible but im a part of this community 
hawley wondered what would have happened had he kicked krampitz 
out of the house i just wonder what the editorial would have 
been 
it has opened the citys eyes a lot of these things youre 
not aware of until something happens and then you say oh my 
goodness devine said 
i feel awfully bad about this one said probate court judge 
catherine fitzpatrick who supervised anna krampitzs guardianship 
i was asked by an agency do you think youve got any more i 
mean what can i say i hope not id hate to think anyone else is 
out there in this position 
when anna krampitz died she had no resources to draw on the 
state paid 885 to bury her prospect cemetery caretaker norman 
rheaume erected a simple wooden cross near the family monument to 
mark her grave 
vergennes united methodist minister rev paul andersencrowder 
remembered the stark burial attended only by theodore krampitz his 
wife and funeral home workers afterward krampitz told him im 
glad its over 
it was an unsettling kind of thing said andersencrowder 
i felt a certain amount of guilt i felt like we as a community 
really let her down

cassie brown cooks breakfast and lunch for josh 
thomas every other day when hes not on dialysis and does laundry 
for his grandmother 
i understand elderly people because im 63 years old and i 
have an older father too hes 90 said ms brown a team leader 
with the greater miami service credit consortium a volunteer 
program for the elderly and disabled 
she collects one service credit for each hour she volunteers 
working three to five hours a day she takes clients to doctors 
appointments fixes meals and runs errands she can save the 
credits for herself or donate them 
its kind of like insurance the best kind is the kind you 
never have to use said a volunteer in missouri other states 
with programs are california connecticut massachusetts michigan 
missouri new jersey new york oklahoma and the district of 
columbia only in michigan and missouri are they statewide 
service credit programs operating much like barter banks are 
run by groups ranging from a health maintenance organization 
serving hassidic jewish and italian communities in new york city to 
the area agency on aging in san franciscos mission district 
volunteers are most commonly used for respite care giving a 
break to the person with the primary responsibility for a sick or 
disabled relative federal studies show families provide about 80 
percent of care to the ailing elderly 
service credits can be used to target specific needs that are 
a public priority said edgar kahn a florida international 
university professor and head of the project at the southeast 
florida center on aging 
kahn a speechwriter for thenattorney general robert f kennedy 
and later for sargent shriver in the war on poverty devised the 
idea of service credits nine years ago while teaching law at the 
university of miami he worked out the economic implications during 
six months at the london school of economics 
the purchasing power of a service credit may or may not be 
that important but just accruing them seems to make people feel 
better he said 
in missouri 26 agencies from churches to hospices and 
neighborhood groups send servicecredit volunteers to play 
checkers read go for walks and write letters but not get involved 
in household chores bathing or medical services 
in miami 515 volunteers are working up to 6000 hours a month 
mostly performing services that were never done before and are not 
funded by medicare or other federal programs the average age of 
volunteers in a program run by the hmo in the new york city borough 
of brooklyn is about 75 
credits are recorded usually on a computer and monthly or 
quarterly statements may be mailed given at meetings or on the 
phone 
the beauty of it is that it says everybodys time is valuable 
we just cant put people on the scrap heap said kahn i think 
were really talking about a redefinition of the roles of the 
market economy and what it does well and the nonmarket economy and 
what it does well 
pressure on the government to provide more services can be 
resolved with service credit programs at little or no cost said 
kahn who also helped write the blueprint for the legal services 
program led an american bar association citizens watchdog group 
that produced a pioneering report on hunger in america and served 
as special counsel to the chairman of the navajo tribe 
the robert wood johnson foundation invested 12 million in six 
groups as a test of the concept miami is in the second year of its 
threeyear grant 
the programs are feeling that theyre riding a crest now that 
everybody feels the money isnt there to solve social problems so 
theres got to be another solution kahn said 
the mobility of the american family also played a role in his 
thinking it fills a critical gap in a community where we live as 
strangers by giving a way for people to help if this didnt go 
on neighbors could live next to each other in abject need with no 
mechanism to bring them together 
we are not attempting to reinvent the volunteer services 
said eric berry of michigans volunteer incentive service credit 
accounting program 
our programs are asked to network with the existing volunteer 
programs so if we are alerted to a caregiver at such and such an 
address if there is a church group that already has volunteers 
available that volunteer receives the service credits 
michigan which offered its first services in january has 
recruited young volunteers who can offer their credits to 
grandparents as christmas or birthday presents miami is working 
with schools to recruit teenage volunteers

it sounded more like a kennel than a corporate 
lunchroom but despite all the yelping yapping and leashtangling 
going on the luncheon for the pets for people program went 
remarkably well 
i was pleasantly surprised we didnt have any incidents at 
all said kathryn b wright director of the ralston purina 
nationwide pet adoption program that pairs senior citizens with 
homeless dogs and cats 
the potential was there to be sure but the lone cat went 
mostly unnoticed and trained dog handlers were on hand in case of 
trouble 
ive been to all kinds of parties said one guest who 
attended with his adopted dog but this is the first time ive 
been to a dog party 
the recent party was the kickoff for the third year of the 
program that has matched people with nearly 25000 pets from 180 
participating shelters hosts were actresses june lockhart of 
lassie fame and audrey meadows best known for her role as 
alice kramden on the honeymooners 
petowning seniors are healthier and happier meadows said 
but no one needs to tell you how theyve changed your life 
were very pleased with the success of the program wright 
said weve had a positive impact on two seemingly unrelated 
problems pet overpopulation and our nations lonely senior 
citizens 
the benefits of pet companionship has yet to be fully 
documented but its clear pets can provide affection 
entertainment and companionship 
a recent survey of 900 adopters found that 92 percent felt less 
lonely 91 percent were happier 80 percent felt less stress and 69 
percent thought they were healthier as a result of owning a pet 
caring for pets gave many adopters a feeling of being needed and 
even a reason to exercise for some it provided a source of 
conversation and an avenue for new friendships 
angel has certainly made a difference in gertrude knollhoffs 
life knollhoff 87 was honored at the luncheon with a special 
prize for being the oldest adopter angel part schnauzer part 
poodle accompanied her 
shes my alarm clock at seven in the morning knollhoff 
said giving the little dog a hug id sleep all day if it wasnt 
for her 
nearby a tablecloth hid all but the head of a large collie 
named coty whose chin rested on josephine ardreys knee ardrey 
said she adopted coty from a shelter because of her nieces 
concerns about her living alone at age 85 
everybody was walking right by coty she said patting his 
head nobody wanted him they said he was too big but he turned 
out to be a good dog i wouldnt give him up for nothing 
hester and herbert bryan had always owned dogs so when their 
last pet grew old and sick and had to be put to sleep they soon 
adopted another one 
i told them we didnt want a little lap dog so they gave us a 
big lap dog said mrs bryan pointing to buddy a golden 
retriever at her feet 
dan bryan said buddy eased his concerns about his parents who 
are both in their 80s my dad was in the hospital and buddy kept 
my mom company while he was gone he laid right by the door and 
barked when anyone came we didnt even know he could bark until 
then 
pets for people is a nonprofit organization financed through 
the purchase of purina products for every dog or cat adopted it 
gives 100 to the shelter to cover the adoption fee inoculations 
and spaying or neutering the adopters also receive a petcare 
starter set with a collar leash bowls and food 
any person over 60 can apply participating animal shelters help 
evaluate applicants and help them choose compatible pets 
i just cant say enough about it said nancy grove the 
executive director of the animal protective associaton of missouri 
i think the idea of taking older animals out of the shelter the 
very ones who dont get adopted as often and making them special 
to other people is what its all about 
weve often had older people come in and ask us if they could 
get a dog for free and up until now we were unable to afford 
that

with americas older population growing and 
women entering the workforce in record numbers families alone will 
not be able to handle their longterm care needs business and 
government experts agree 
caring for an aged relative can be a treasured time of 
sharing for many but competing family and career demands can 
make it a time of pain struggle and exhaustion that may stretch 
to the breaking point their capacity to care lou glasse 
president of the older womens league said at a recent 
congressional forum on eldercare 
without help for family caregivers the only alternative for 
the elderly may be a nursing home by helping prevent caregiver 
burnout we enable families to continue caring for their elderly 
members said sen john glenn dohio a forum sponsor 
the american association of retired persons found in 1987 that 
nearly 7 million americans spent 1012 hours a week providing care 
to older people more than half also worked outside the home and 
almost onethird cared for children 
as the population ages the probability is overwhelming that 
virtually every american will become a caregiver according to aarp 
with some surveys indicating as many as 25 percent of american 
workers already bear some caregiving responsibility employers are 
increasingly helping workers double as caregivers without their job 
performance suffering 
we certainly recognize that caregiving is a demanding and 
distracting job especially caring for the elderly said sarah 
mullady director of champion international corps employee 
assistance program 
champion is among a growing number of companies offering 
eldercare benefits such as unpaid leave workshops and advice 
on caring for dependent relatives and educational materials on 
aging issues and services 
employees are trying desperately to hold it all together as 
they juggle work and family responsibilities said karen leibold 
of stride rite childrens centers in addition to the mommy 
track where working mothers are unable to take demanding job 
promotions because of competing needs at home there is a 
daughter track that holds back women who care for aged 
relatives 
we as employers really have to begin taking a proactive 
stance in helping our employees meet all of these needs leibold 
said anything we can do as employers to help in their efforts 
can really create a winwin situation for everyone 
stride rite next year plans to expand the child care center at 
its cambridge mass headquarters into an intergenerational 
facility that will serve about 55 children and 24 frail adults 
half the slots will be filled with relatives of company employees 
and half from the community 
we think and we hope that its really going to address issues 
like absenteeism and turnover leibold said 
the support for eldercare benefits comes in response to mounting 
evidence that the stress of caregiving can hurt job performance 
executives surveyed by john hancock financial services and fortune 
magazine for example said caregivers took more unscheduled days 
off and left work early 
mullady recalls that her own job evaluations slipped a notch 
when she was caring for her dying 92yearold mother i was not 
at peak performance there was no way i could have been 
the prolonged stress of caregiving also can adversely affect 
mental and physical health said dr gene cohen deputy director of 
the national institute on aging studies found significant symptoms 
of depression in many caregivers and some experienced changes in 
their immune system that made them more vulnerable to a range of 
physical illnesses 
society is beginning to appreciate the ramifications of the 
remarkable demographic revolution cohen said what society 
hasnt fully appreciated is that those ramifications apply not only 
to the older individual but to the family system as a whole 
caregiving needs are expected to triple over the next four 
decades requiring further growth in the eldercare industry and 
more cooperation between businesses and state and local agencies on 
aging said harry posman acting associate commissioner of the us 
administration on aging 
glasse said employers programs are only part of the answer the 
nation needs to ensure that all americans receive the longterm 
care they need both in nursing homes and at home without putting 
all the burden on family members 
some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that 
congress may shy away from addressing the problem after biting 
criticism from senior citizens over the medicare catastrophic care 
program enacted last year

nothing short of catastrophe stops 
84yearold john minor wisdom now in his 32nd year as a federal 
appeals court judge 
it hurts to watch him walk a slight man stooped and gray he 
creaks along leaning heavily on a cane both knees are artificial 
arthritis ruined the ones he was born with surgeons rummaged 
around inside his chest recently to repair a major artery in his 
heart his aorta was about to blow out like an old inner tube 
surgery cost him six weeks in a hospital and a month at home 
but being stuck in bed didnt mean not working for wisdom a 
member of a special threejudge court handling still another racial 
desegregation case 
court fights involving race have been a large part of his 
working day since he was appointed to the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals by dwight eisenhower in 1957 he nearly always came down on 
the side of blacks fighting segregation 
the more exposure you get to this problem the more you realize 
that the blacks have had a raw deal for 300 years and that we owe a 
debt to them 
wisdom and one or more of three other judges with similar 
outlooks elbert tuttle of atlanta john brown of houston and 
richard rives of montgomery ala got most of the racial cases 
and were dubbed the four by their brethren 
four landmark decisions written by wisdom in 196567 whipped 
the crawl of school desegregation to a gallop instead of the all 
deliberate speed pace of the supreme court the 5th circuit 
imposed immediate affirmative action 
when he was appointed to the court john minor wisdom seemed 
more like a contented member of the upper crust than likely to 
shake up the deep south i was much more moderate than i am now 
it was a gradual progression in my philosophy he said 
wisdoms ancestors came in the 1840s from virginia and kentucky 
he was born in new orleans in 1905 graduated from washington and 
lee university studied english at harvard for a year took law at 
tulane 
political activism was wisdoms road to the bench at the 1952 
republican national convention in chicago he led a fight to have 
eisenhower delegates from louisiana seated instead of delegates 
committed to ohio sen robert taft the victory was the turning 
point in eisenhowers bid for nomination 
buses full of tourists used to pause in front of the wisdom 
mansion while the tour guide exalted him as the man who made 
eisenhower president 
in return eisenhower kept wisdom from becoming a much richer 
man at the time of his appointment to the 5th circuit he was a 
founding member of what is still one of the citys biggest busiest 
law firms 
decreeing racial integration for others did not change his own 
social habits much he remained a member of allwhite allmale 
exclusive clubs such conflict with his legal views did not disturb 
him 
i cant change their minds he said and they cant change 
mine 
i took a lot of kidding he recalled recently one fellow 
every time he saw me would say hey john what have you done to 
us white folks today 
amiable jibes werent enough for some wisdom found rattlesnakes 
on his lawn two of his dogs were poisoned for years they tried 
to keep me awake nights id get telephone calls between one and 
four oclock in the morning we couldnt take the phone off the 
hook because we had two kids off at school and we felt they should 
be able to get hold of us 
hostilities stayed at the harassment level wisdom never 
bothered to ask for police protection and to my knowledge i was 
never given protection he said my office door was open just 
like it is now 
despite age and aches wisdom still works in 1977 he stepped 
back to senior status semiretirement eliminating 
administrative duties but he hears as many cases as ever and often 
sits on other circuits 
i sit all over the place he said i go to san francisco 
to new york washington chicago but i am going to lessen up over 
the coming year

from time to time everyone forgets where he 
or she leaves the car keys or the car but can you imagine 
forgetting how to drive 
whether its an aged aunt grandparent or our own parents many 
of us have had some experience with older people who experience 
failing mental abilities i am surprised how many people still 
equate this loss with old age 
thirty years of research on aging tells us that when memory loss 
interferes with daily living it is not normal but the result of 
some underlying disease identifying the disease isnt always easy 
but it is extremely important for the person with this problem to 
have a medical evaluation for some the illness can be treated and 
the memory loss and confusion clear up for others the cause is a 
progressive brain disease such as alzheimers disease 
although there is no cure for alzheimers disease yet that 
doesnt mean there is no treatment good medical care from someone 
who knows the range of problems alzheimers patients have can help 
patients live as normal a life as possible and make the job of 
caring for them much easier on their families 
we estimate that 4 million people in this country may now have 
alzheimers disease about 10 percent of the population over age 
65 although uncommon in people in their 50s and 60s current 
studies indicate that by their ninth decade at least one of every 
four people will become afflicted the economic burden is at least 
80 billion a year enough to bankrupt a small nation 
because many disorders mimic alzheimers it is difficult to 
diagnose in fact diagnosis can only be made with 100 percent 
certainty by examining brain tissue after a patient dies 
nonetheless specialists at major medical centers now have an array 
of tests offering reliable diagnosis more than 90 percent of the 
time compared with 60 percent to 80 percent accuracy just 10 years 
ago 
on the federal level the national institute on aging funds 15 
alzheimers disease research centers and the us administration 
on aging and the veterans administration support longterm care 
centers important sources of research and training for those who 
deal with dementia and other illnesses of aging 
on the state level arkansas florida kentucky new jersey new 
york california illinois maryland oklahoma and virginia now 
support specialized alzheimers disease diagnosis and treatment 
centers 
no one knows for sure what causes alzheimers disease we do 
know from tissue examined under a microscope that certain brain 
cells stop working and die among the experimental treatments being 
explored are those looking at ways to stop or reverse brain cell 
death one especially exciting area involves use of substances 
produced in the brain that help nerve cells thrive this may hold 
promise for treating neurological diseases and brain damage from 
injury 
many important research advances have occurred in the past year 
for example an abnormal protein that accumulates in the alzheimer 
brain has been found in the skin and other organs one more clue 
that this is not simply a disease of the brain and a possible step 
toward a simple test for it 
another area that is of practical value involves patient care 
while average survival ranges between six and 10 years some 
alzheimers patients live more than 20 years as the disease 
progresses the need for continuous care puts great stress on 
caregivers studies of patients and their caregivers are teaching 
us how families cope and helping to prepare health professionals 
and policymakers to meet their needs 
in the meantime organizations like the national nonprofit 
alzheimers association offer patients and families services 
ranging from support groups to information on the disease and 
referrals to community services and every state and community in 
the united states has a government agency on aging to assist older 
people over half the states have task forces or commissions to 
study the problem of alzheimers in their state many offer 
alzheimers disease resource centers some with tollfree numbers 
states with large ethnic populations like california the district 
of columbia new york florida and texas have educational programs 
tailored to minority caregivers needs 
publicprivate partnerships are also springing up to meet the 
needs of caregivers one example is the administration on aging 
which is working with the alzheimers association and the robert 
wood johnson foundation to implement dementia day care and 
shortterm respite services workplace programs are being developed 
by private groups like the american association of retired persons 
and the washington business group on health in recognition of the 
growing impact of dementia on employed caregivers 
more information on the alzheimers association is available by 
calling 18006210379 in illinois call 18005726037

dont overlook the potential danger of common 
ornamental plants when making precautionary checks before visits 
from preschoolers 
the worst that happens usually involves only some anxious 
moments after little susie or johnnie is seen munching on a leaf or 
swallowing a berry but quite painful or lifethreatening 
experiences are possible 
its something like having a backyard swimming pool the 
proportion of children and adults getting into trouble is 
infinitesimal compared to everyones exposure but the danger is 
nonetheless real 
most of the bigleaf houseplants like dieffenbachia and 
philodendron can cause trouble to the unwary berries of plants 
such as privet holly and castor beans can be toxic so can bulbs 
of daffodils crocus and hyacinths pods of birds of paradise 
seeds from sweet peas acorns and all parts of oleanders the list 
is so general in fact that a basic rule is never to put anything 
in your mouth unless youre sure its safe 
to adults this is so obvious that dr donald b kunkel says 
plant poisoning questions are almost exclusively childhood 
problems 
kunkel is in his 10th year as medical director of the poison 
control center that covers phoenix and two adjoining counties it 
offers emergency guidance on all types of poison questions and a 
breakdown of last years nearly 40000 calls shows about 5 percent 
involved plants kunkel estimates 95 percent of those concerned 
children under age 5 
we get a substantial number of calls from grandparents not 
just about plants of course but all things kids are over to 
grandmas and grandpas house and its kind of a new environment 
and theyre poking through things grandparents if theyre not 
careful can become a pretty good source of poison 
kunkel a gardener believes its ridiculous to consider 
discarding plants because of potential toxicity but he recommends 
keeping houseplants above the reach of toddlers outdoors he 
suggests instruction just as children are taught to stay out of 
the street or not play with fire 
the centers 1988 calls about plants arent broken down between 
indoors and outdoors but looking at the types of plants listed 
id estimate 20 to 30 percent were indoor plants kunkel said 
most were inquiries about whether a plant is poisonous i 
dont have any figures on how many were actually hospitalized after 
treatment but it would be rare perhaps a couple dozen kids in 10 
years once or twice a year kids have their stomachs pumped out 
however its something you always worry about when you get such a 
call and there are quite a few plants if you eat enough of them 
youll have nausea diarrhea things like that 
in recent years deaths have been recorded in arizona from water 
hemlock cicuta douglasii and tree tobacco nicotiana glaula 
which grow mainly in remote areas four deaths from oleander were 
reported nationally this decade but kunkel said all involved 
adults who took it intentionally 
the kid who occasionally nibbles on the leaf of an oleander 
probably isnt in a great risk but we certainly recommend that a 
poison center be contacted and given a chance to evaluate the 
situation 
a common name for dieffenbachia is dumbcane when chewed it 
causes quick swelling of mucus membranes around the mouth and 
tongue causing difficulty in breathing death is possible fellow 
members of the araceae family such as philodendrons and caladiums 
may have similar effects african violets and begonias also cause 
concern 
fortunately most problem plants are quite bitter to taste 
discouraging the attempt but even parts of common foodstuffs can 
be dangerous so know what youre eating avoid for example seeds 
of apples leaves of rhubarb or sunexposed greenish parts of the 
potato tuber 
its wise to identify your plants in advance of any need if 
buying new plants ask the nursery people what parts if any are 
toxic the nursery often can help in identifying plant samples 
experienced neighborhood gardeners are another possibility and 
most poison centers offer illustrative brochures

healthy older people who did aerobic exercises 
in a fourmonth study improved their physical wellbeing and their 
outlook on life 
the study of 101 healthy men and women age 6083 found that 
those who participated in an hourlong aerobic exercise program 
three times a week showed improved cardiorespiratory fitness lower 
cholesterol a small weight loss and an increase in bone mineral 
content among subjects at risk of bone fractures 
the moderateintensity exercise program included a 10minute 
warmup 30 minutes of bicycling 15 of brisk walkingjogging and 5 
of cooldown exercises 
other subjects in the study participated in a yoga and 
flexibility exercise program or were part of a control group whose 
members did not change their physical activity habits these groups 
showed no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness 
while the study found no significant changes in a battery of 
psychological tests members of the aerobic and yoga groups felt 
healthier and slept better and reported improved family 
relations better sex life less loneliness and a better social 
life improved mood selfconfidence and life satisfaction and 
that they had better memory and concentration the researchers 
reported 
members of the control group noticed little change over the four 
months 
the research carried out by scientists from duke university 
medical center and the north carolina spine center was financed by 
grants from the national institute on aging and the national heart 
lung and blood institute 
results of the study led by dr james a blumenthal were 
reported in the september issue of the journal of gerontology

elderly people often consider their 
life stories to be over by the time they enter a nursing home says 
a sociologist who asked nursinghome residents to divide their 
lives into chapters 
rarely does the last chapter include their current 
situation said jaber gubrium of the university of florida it 
may end at retirement or when a spouse dies but it rarely ends 
with the nursing home 
although the elderly acknowledge their current existence in a 
nursing home they do not deem it part of their lives gubrium said 
his study funded by the national institute on aging found that 
the few people who have close relationships in a nursing home are 
likeliest to consider the institution homelike and the experience 
a meaningful part of their lives 
when we ask nursing home patients if the place is home 
theyll say no its homey but its not home one woman who did 
call the place home said her roommate was like a sister to her and 
several other people were like family to her gubrium said 
others said nursing homes would be more like home if they were free 
to come and go dependence and poor health not the nursing home 
itself separated just living from life in these people 
we chose people close to the end of life for this study 
because we wanted to see if life extends subjectively to the very 
end he said 
gubrium began his twoyear study this fall by interviewing 
residents of nursing homes adult congregate living facilities and 
the general community in the gainesville area unlike nursing home 
residents other people in the study include their current living 
circumstances as part of their lives

deutsche bank ag west germanys largest bank 
said today that it offered to buy british merchant bank morgan 
grenfell plc in a friendly cash deal valued at 148 billion 
the move was designed to block a hostile bid for morgan grenfell 
by frances banque indosuez 
deutsche banks 856ashare offer was 115 per share over 
morgan grenfells close friday on the london stock exchange 
however the announcement pushed morgan grenfells stock slightly 
above the offer price 
the bid came three days before a vote by shareholders of willis 
faber plc a british insurance services concern on whether to sell 
its remaining 99percent stake in morgan grenfell to banque 
indosuez for 719 a share 
earlier this month willis faber sold banque indosuez a 
105percent stake in morgan grenfell for 638 dollars a share 
raising the french banks stake in its british target to 149 
percent 
banque indosuez says it seeks a 248 percent stake but needs 
bank of england approval to own more than 15 percent 
in a joint statement today deutsche bank and morgan grenfell 
said the british bank will operate as a separate legal entity 
within the deutsche bank group and with a high degree of autonomy 
deutsche bank has for years held a 49percent stake in morgan 
grenfell morgan grenfell had initiated talks with the german bank 
and a number of other european financial institutions over a 
protective alliance after indosuez announced its takeover 
intentions 
indosuez however could raise its offer to willis faber make a

asia which produces 95 percent of the

silk products a united nations report has found 
asian countries traditionally export raw silk to europe where 
it was made into cloth and garments but the november report said 
major producing countries including china india and thailand have 
been exporting more finished products 
their success has been partly due to increasing demand for 
natural fibers sparked by the ecological awareness movement in the 
west the report said 
it said china which accounts for 60 percent of worlds raw 
silk plans to reduce the share of its raw silk exports to 30 
percent in 1990 from 49 percent in 1980 and to increase exports of 
finished products and fabrics to 70 percent in 1990 from 51

opec ministers resumed negotiations on 
monday in an effort to reach an oil production and price agreement 
for the first half of 1990 
seven oil ministers from the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries gathered in a hotel room to see if they could 
overcome their differences 
the oil markets adopted a waitandsee attitude toward the oil 
producers regular winter conference now in its third day north 
sea brent blend the most widely traded international crude oil 
was quoted at a spot price of 1847 a barrel in quiet dealings 
monday up slightly from 1844 late friday 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us grade of crude was 
down slightly in early trading with the nearterm contract at 
1979 a barrel down 3 cents from fridays close 
opec was at an impasse and loosely split into two camps over 
how to meet demands from kuwait and the united arab emirates for 
bigger shares of the cartels production pie sources said sunday 
we have not yet reached the stage of proposals the issues are 
so sensitive apparently that no one dares putting foreward 
proposals algerian oil minister sadek boussena said we are 
still at the starting point 
the cartels gathering formally began on saturday and the 
ministers suspended talks on sunday to reflect on their options 
opec members in the past have found such breaks as well as 
holding small group discussions in their hotels more productive 
than gathering all the ministers at the cartels vienna 
headquarters 
the ministers must decide whether to change their production 
ceiling of 205 million barrels a day and their target price of 18 
a barrel 
oil prices have been firm with opecs basket or composite 
of crude oils at 1776 a barrel lately even though analysts say 
opec members are exceeding the groups output ceiling by more than 
25 million barrels a day 
prices are more than 5 a barrel higher than a year ago because 
of strong demand for oil from third world countries and a decline 
in output from nonopec producers but opec is expecting demand to 
fall in the first six months of next year 
the oil market traditionally softens in the first and second 
quarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer cooling 
and gasoline demands pick up 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been pumping about 
double or 2 million barrels a day each what they are allowed 
under the last opec agreement underscoring their calls for bigger 
shares 
all the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling could 
be raised perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day but they 
disagree on how the increase should be parceled out 
a ministerial source who demanded anonymity on sunday 
described the two loose camps this way 
one camp led by the heavyweights saudi arabia and iran thinks 
the increase in production should be granted to those members who 
can produce more some members already are operating at near 
capacity 
this idea would allow kuwait and the united arab emirates to 
pump more and would leave unchanged the shares for saudi arabia 
iran and iraq the rest of the members would reduce their shares of 
a larger pie 
but this idea is onerous to poorer members that are more 
dependent on their oil revenues the ministerial source said 
the second camp believes all the members should give up part of 
their share to allow kuwait and the united arab emirates larger 
slices the ministerial source said 
but saudi arabia has insisted it wont accept less than its 
allotment of onequarter of the total production limit it recently 
increased its production above its quota a move analysts say is 
designed to emphasize that point 
the fallback position would be to increase production equally 
among all members the ministerial source said 
but this wouldnt address kuwait and the united arab emirates 
demands for bigger shares nor solve the problem of cheating on 
quotas which undermines opecs aims 
algerias boussena said an option being considered is an 
agreement that would not be signed by all 13 opec members 
boussena added we must have an agreement of 13 that is my 
point of view 
opec could simply roll over its existing accord as it has done 
in the past but the oil markets likely would view such a move as a 
sign of weakness

opec ministers resumed negotiations today 
in an effort to reach an oil production and price agreement for the 
first half of 1990 
seven oil ministers from the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries gathered in a hotel room to see if they could 
overcome their differences 
the oil markets adopted a waitandsee attitude toward the oil 
producers regular winter conference now in its third day north 
sea brent blend the most widely traded international crude oil 
was quoted at a spot price of 1847 a barrel in quiet dealings 
monday up slightly from 1844 late friday 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us grade of crude was 
down slightly in early trading with the nearterm contract at 
1979 a barrel down 3 cents from fridays close 
opec was at an impasse and loosely split into two camps over 
how to meet demands from kuwait and the united arab emirates for 
bigger shares of the cartels production pie sources said sunday 
we have not yet reached the stage of proposals the issues are 
so sensitive apparently that no one dares putting foreward 
proposals algerian oil minister sadek boussena said we are 
still at the starting point 
the cartels gathering formally began on saturday and the 
ministers suspended talks on sunday to reflect on their options 
opec members in the past have found such breaks as well as 
holding small group discussions in their hotels more productive 
than gathering all the ministers at the cartels vienna 
headquarters 
the ministers must decide whether to change their production 
ceiling of 205 million barrels a day and their target price of 18 
a barrel 
oil prices have been firm with opecs basket or composite 
of crude oils at 1776 a barrel lately even though analysts say 
opec members are exceeding the groups output ceiling by more than 
25 million barrels a day 
prices are more than 5 a barrel higher than a year ago because 
of strong demand for oil from third world countries and a decline 
in output from nonopec producers but opec is expecting demand to 
fall in the first six months of next year 
the oil market traditionally softens in the first and second 
quarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer cooling 
and gasoline demands pick up 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been pumping about 
double or 2 million barrels a day each what they are allowed 
under the last opec agreement underscoring their calls for bigger 
shares 
all the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling could 
be raised perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day but they 
disagree on how the increase should be parceled out 
a ministerial source who demanded anonymity on sunday 
described the two loose camps this way 
one camp led by the heavyweights saudi arabia and iran thinks 
the increase in production should be granted to those members who 
can produce more some members already are operating at near 
capacity 
this idea would allow kuwait and the united arab emirates to 
pump more and would leave unchanged the shares for saudi arabia 
iran and iraq the rest of the members would reduce their shares of 
a larger pie 
but this idea is onerous to poorer members that are more 
dependent on their oil revenues the ministerial source said 
the second camp believes all the members should give up part of 
their share to allow kuwait and the united arab emirates larger 
slices the ministerial source said 
but saudi arabia has insisted it wont accept less than its 
allotment of onequarter of the total production limit it recently 
increased its production above its quota a move analysts say is 
designed to emphasize that point 
the fallback position would be to increase production equally 
among all members the ministerial source said 
but this wouldnt address kuwait and the united arab emirates 
demands for bigger shares nor solve the problem of cheating on 
quotas which undermines opecs aims 
algerias boussena said an option being considered is an 
agreement that would not be signed by all 13 opec members 
boussena added we must have an agreement of 13 that is my 
point of view 
opec could simply roll over its existing accord as it has done 
in the past but the oil markets likely would view such a move as a 
sign of weakness 
failure to reach an agreement could bring oil prices to as low 
as 12 a barrel by the spring the anonymous ministerial source

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
dropped for the second straight week declining by three this week 
to 1037 after rising 10 times in the past 13 weeks 
but the total still reflects 126 more working rigs than for the 
same week a year ago baker hughes inc reported monday last week 
the count dropped by five to 1040 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states louisiana posted the largest 
gains with 10 new rigs while colorado had three more declines 
included a drop of five in new mexico and drops of three rigs each 
in oklahoma and california the number of rigs in texas remained 
unchanged there were no reports for other producing states

the detroit news and detroit free press published 
their first editions under a partial merger today after a 
threeyear legal battle but a possible strike may stall the joint 
operation before its a week old 
talks between the newspapers and the unions broke off sunday 
over wage and benefit demands 
william keating chief executive of the detroit newspaper 
agency which runs the combined operations said he doesnt expect 
a strike i have consistently felt that labor matters can be 
resolved and i continue to feel that way he said sunday 
detroits two major daily newspapers began publishing under a 
joint operating agreement following a vote nov 13 by the us 
supreme court which upheld lower court rulings approving the 
100year agreement 
the knightridder incowned free press declared it was a 
financially failing newspaper in april 1986 and applied with the 
news for permission to enter the operating agreement federal law 
grants newspapers exemption from antitrust law if its determined a 
merger would prevent the failure of a paper and thus preserve two 
independent editorial voices 
according to figures released nov 13 the daily circulation of 
the news the nations ninth largest newspaper is 690422 and 
832383 sundays the free press the 10th biggest paper had 
circulations of 626434 and 687537 
the newspapers merged business operations under the detroit 
newspaper agency news and editorial departments remain separate 
and independent but combined editions will be published on the 
weekend under the masthead the detroit news and free press about 
500 jobs were to be cut as a result of the arrangement 
while the newspapers prepared the first postagreement edition 
of the free press for today workers voted against ratifying a 
contract offer from the new newspaper agency and in favor of strike 
authorization 
teamsters local 372 which represents 1100 drivers and other 
circulation workers set a strike deadline of 1201 am thursday 
newspaper guild local 22 representing about 500 editorial workers 
from both papers voted unanimously to support a strike 
the members of both papers feel the money package and benefits 
were an insult to them said louis mleczko a news reporter and 
president of local 22 the publishers are going to have to share 
some of the new riches from the 100year monopoly they have been 
granted from the court 
robert h giles president and publisher of gannett co incs 
detroit news said he expected issues to be resolved before the 
strike deadline 
don kummer administrative officer for local 22 said what 
were looking at is the company testing the union to see if theyll 
strike 
press operators in the graphics communications international 
local 13n surprised other unions by ratifying the wage offer from 
the publishers but they pledged to honor picket lines if the other 
unions walked out 
in other ratification votes announced sunday the unions 
representing detroit news photoengravers workers who handle 
special inserts and sort papers and composing room employees also 
rejected the new companys contract offers 
mleczko said the publishers offered a 30perweek raise during 
the first year of a 2year contract 30 the second year and 15 
for the remaining six months and a signing bonus equal to two 
weeks pay 
the unions wanted a 40perweek raise the first year 30 the 
second and 40 for the next six months plus a threeweek bonus 
the unions also asked the newspaper to pay for increases in 
health care costs for future retirees fifty percent of those costs 
currently are paid by unions 
union members at the two newspapers have had one raise in their 
contracts since the operating agreement was announced in 1986 the 
average wage for editorial employees and production workers at the 
newspapers is 562 a week 
teamsters officials said the strike was set for thursday to give 
the employees time to get established under the new operations 
the last newspaper strike in detroit was at the free press in 
july 1980 when teamsters stayed away 12 days over economic issues

soybean futures prices fell in early trading 
today on the chicago board of trade dragging the corn market 
lower but wheat futures gained slightly on indications of renewed 
soviet buying interest 
selling of soybean futures stemmed from a continued lack of 
export demand analysts said 
an abundance of malaysian palm oil on the world market is 
forcing soybean oil prices lower and european soybean processers 
are believed to have enough beans on hand to last them through 
december said william biedermann director of research with the 
futures brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake ill 
he said the opening dip in soybean futures triggered some 
technical sell signals accelerating the markets decline the 
january contracts drop below 583 a bushel was especially 
significant 
a close below that level would turn funds into sellers and 
cause speculators to bail out biedermann said 
wheat futures were mixed and gaining boosted by fading 
prospects for substantial rainfall today in the winter wheat belt 
and by soviet purchases of wheat in europe an indication the 
soviet union has reentered the world grain market after an absence 
of about three weeks 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to 1 cent 
higher with december at 408 a bushel corn was unchanged to 1

deutsche bank west germanys largest bank on 
monday emerged as a white knight for morgan grenfell group plc 
with a 148 billion takeover offer designed to stave off a hostile 
bid by banque indoquez of france 
analysts said the 856ashare cash offer which has the full 
backing of morgan grenfells board of directors represented a 
premium over what the investment banks stock was recently trading 
morgan grenfell closed at 740 a share friday on the london 
stock exchange it had fallen as low as 4 a share earlier this 
year the stock though rose sharply in price on monday 
its a knockout bid one designed to forestall any notion 
that indosuez could top it says robert law a bank analyst at 
shearson lehman securities ltd 
parisbased indosuez which already owns 149 percent of morgan 
grenfell had no comment on deutsche banks bid a spokesman said 
but analysts said it was unlikely indosuez will make a higher offer 
last month british insurer willis faber plc sold a 106 percent 
stake in morgan grenfell to indosuez for 638 a share 
banque indosuez says it seeks a 248 percent stake but needs 
bank of england approval to own more than 15 percent 
willis faber shareholders were to meet wednesday to decide 
whether to accept indosuezs 719ashare offer for their 
remaining 98 percent stake in morgan grenfell but willis faber 
appeared unlikely to sell unless indosuez offered a higher price 
and said it was considering suspending the meeting 
in a joint statement deutsche bank and morgan grenfell said the 
british bank will operate as a separate legal entity within the 
deutsche bank group and with a high degree of autonomy 
independent for 151 years morgan grenfell was known as the 
takeover king during the mid1980s playing a role in some of 
britains biggest mergers but it failed in its ambition of 
becoming a fully integrated securities house and pulled out of 
sharedealing a year ago firing 450 employees 
john craven morgan grenfells chairman and alfred herrhausen 
a member of deutsche banks board of managing directors stressed 
the mutual benefits of the deal 
deutsche bank will get morgan grenfells strength in corporate 
finance and fund management while strengthening its position in 
the british market morgan will benefit from the west german banks 
distribution network and client base 
the acquisition of morgan grenfell is an important step for 
deutsche bank which recognizes the preeminence of the london 
market place within europe in the fields of corporate finance and 
asset management herrhausen said 
we see the combination of the two organizations as an 
excellent fit together we will form an unrivaled and powerful team 
and give the enlarged deutsche bank group a leading position in 
europe

a us bankruptcy judge has decided that 
braniff incs agreements to lease and buy new jets are valid 
enabling the troubled airline to keep its most valuable asset 
but the judge also ruled saturday that braniff must pay 3 
million to gpa group ltd an aircraft leasing company by midnight 
monday to keep five airbus a320s the airline has ordered and must 
pay for future planes within 60 days after delivery 
by continuing to take delivery of 50 airbus a320s braniff will 
have a better chance to reorganize and operate under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy act the airlines lawyers said otherwise 
the orlandobased carrier might be forced to cease operating 
entirely and sell its remaining asets 
a trial ended saturday in braniffs lawsuit against gpa group 
that claimed the irish company improperly canceled a lease 
agreement for 26 of the airbuses as a major creditor of braniff 
gpa is trying to retain the aircraft and protect itself from 
potential losses 
while celebrating judge c timothy corcorans decision that the 
lease agreement remains in effect braniffs lawyers acknowledged 
that the airline will pay dearly for its right to keep its lease 
and purchase contracts 
howard glassman a philadelphia lawyer representing braniff 
said he did not know if the airline has enough money to meet 
mondays deadline if braniff fails to pay gpa which is leasing 
the five airbus jets may sue the carrier in court to take 
possession of the jets 
since filing for protection from its creditors sept 28 braniff 
has stopped flying and laid off most of its workers who once 
totaled more than 4800 the airline which now employs about 275 
people is struggling to operate as a charter carrier 
airline analysts and experts view braniffs ability to continue 
receiving the 50 airbus jets as the companys most valuable asset 
and best chance for a successful reorganization american airlines 
has acknowledged that it has discussed with braniff the possibility 
of acquiring those planes 
braniff has been stymied however in its efforts to sublease 
the jets or sell its contracts for them 
just hours before the bankrupty filing gpa canceled its 
agreement to lease 26 airbus jets to the airline braniff sued gpa 
and several other companies involved in the leases for breach of 
contract violation of us bankruptcy laws and other alleged 
business misconduct 
because the validity of braniffs lease and purchase contracts 
was disputed the airline was thwarted in its efforts to reorganize 
under chapter 11 corcoran ruled 
lawyers representing gpa said the leasing company did not know 
whether it would appeal corcorans decision gpa which is 
privately held declined to disclose how much it could lose if 
braniff cannot meet its financial obligations for the jets or find 
a substitute buyer

grain and soybean futures closed lower monday on 
the chicago board of trade led by a steep soybean selloff linked 
to slack export demand and bearish technical signals 
soybean prices opened lower in reaction to weak demand for us 
soybeans by european processors partially reflecting the abundance 
of malaysian palm oil a soybeanoil competitor 
the opening losses triggered technical sell signals especially 
when the january soybean contract fell below the 55day moving 
average of 583 a bushel said william biedermann director of 
research with the futures brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake 
ill 
the technicals just really kicked in and we had fund and 
speculator selling all day long heavy liquidation he said 
the wheat market closed narrowly mixed with support stemming 
from agriculture secretary clayton yuetters statement that 
frances sale of 13 million metric tons of wheat to the soviet 
union was an encouraging sign that the soviets were back in the 
market for wheat 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 406 a bushel corn 
futures were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 233 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 143

opec ministers said monday they were 
closer to reaching an oil production agreement for the first half 
of 1990 
sources said the proposal would raise opecs production by 15 
million barrels to 22 million barrels a day and allow the united 
arab emirates to continue producing as it pleases 
venezuela and indonesia would give up part of their share to 
meet kuwaits demands for a bigger portion while other countries 
percentages would remain the same the sources said 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said during a break 
from talks at opecs regular winter conference that the ministers 
were discussing a new idea but he declined to elaborate 
i think the atmosphere is good aqazadeh said 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said ideas are 
getting closer 
saudi arabias influential oil minister hisham nazer said we 
will be continuing to meet 
the oil markets decided to reserve judgment analysts said 
the spot price for north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was 1844 a barrel monday afternoon 
unchanged from late friday west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude was down sharply in late afternoon trading 
with the nearterm contract at 1963 a barrel down 19 cents from 
friday but analysts said the weakness was not necessarily 
opecrelated 
traders on the whole have become more circumspect about an 
early analysis of opec trends having been caught too many times by 
the whipsaw of seemingly contradictory statements by oil 
ministers said peter gignoux who heads shearson lehman huttons 
international energy desk in london 
most of the 13 ministers of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries met in a hotel room for several hours on monday 
to see if they could resolve their differences they also met in 
smaller groups during the day 
the ministers gathered on saturday for the opening of the 
conference and then met informally on sunday part of their normal 
strategy for establishing common ground 
opec has been grappling with demands from kuwait and the united 
arab emirates for larger shares of the groups total output 
most of the ministers seem to agree that opecs current ceiling 
of 205 million barrels a day could be raised since it would more 
realistically reflect the groups actual output however there are 
disputes about how large an increase there should be and how the 
extra output should be divided 
analysts estimate that opec actually is producing more than 23 
million barrels a day kuwait and the united arab emirates each are 
pumping double their quotas of 11 million barrels a day to press 
their demands for a higher share of the total 
the united arab emirates would be excluded from the deal now 
under consideration and would continue to produce what it wants 
sources said 
prices have held at levels about 50 percent higher than a year 
ago despite the increased supply thanks to strong world demand 
and lower production by nonopec oil producers 
strong demand coupled with the fact that some members are 
producing at near capacity anyway has eased the pressure for opec 
to solve its differences on quota allocations 
if the ministers fail to take advantage of this absence of 
crisis to work out their problems their choices are striking a 
deal that isnt unanimous giving all members an equal increase or 
simply rolling over their current agreement 
but these choices would only postpone a solution to cheating by 
opec members and the oil markets likely would view any one of them 
as a sign of weakness 
such a market reaction combined with the traditional slump in 
oil demand during the spring could deeply depress prices

sales of domestically built cars and light trucks 
by the nations biggest automakers fell 44 percent in midnovember 
from a year earlier as declines by the big three continued pacing 
an industrywide slump according to figures the companies released 
monday 
the automakers reported selling vehicles at an average daily 
rate of 31032 during the nov 1120 period compared with 32436 
during the yearearlier period 
car sales were down 61 percent and light truck sales were off 
18 percent

during the period car sales fell 124 percent and light truck 
sales were off 29 percent 
the sales downturn began in early october just as the 1990 
model year got under way 
analysts predicted car purchasing in the fourth quarter would be 
substantially lower than in the third quarter because consumers 
rushed to showrooms in august and september to beat price increases 
on 1990 model cars and trucks the vehicles hit dealerships en 
masse in early october 
the continued slump may prompt the companies to further enhance 
their buyer incentives such as rebates or lowinterest loan last 
week gm expanded its oldsmobile dealer incentive program and 
boosted the incentive program on its chevrolet cars and trucks 
chrysler last week also sweetened the incentive package on its 
eagle premier cars 
through nov 20 this year vehicle sales by the eight companies 
were 26 percent behind the pace of the same period last year car 
sales were down 36 percent and truck sales were 08 percent lower

fiat said monday it will sign an agreement 
to build a new line of cars in the soviet union an important step 
in president mikhail s gorbachevs plans to increase the supply of 
consumer goods 
the turinbased automobile giant said the joint venture 
agreement would be signed tuesday the eve of gorbachevs visit to 
italy 
fiat is italys largest private industrial group and has 
produced cars in the soviet union since 1970 
fiats managing director cesare romiti and nikolai pyjin the 
soviet minister for the automobile industry were scheduled to sign 
a letter of intent for the project in rome on tuesday 
while financial details have not been released analysts believe 
that fiat and the soviet union will invest up to 14 billion 
the plant will be built at elabung 60 miles southeast of 
moscow and is expected to turn out 300000 automobiles a year when 
it begins operations between 1992 and 1993 according to industry 
sources 
the output of the model based on the popular fiat panda in 
italy would be then increased to between 600000 to 900000 cars a 
year 
out of the first years production about a fourth would be sold 
on western european markets giving the soviet side some return on 
its investment according to the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
other ageements between italian and soviet companies are 
expected to be signed during gorbachevs threeday visit to italy 
and the vatican 
among the initiatives reported in the works are an agreement 
with pirelli to produce 10 million tires a year in the soviet 
union a plant for household electronic goods by the merloni group 
and a chemical and agroindustrial cooperation accord with the 
montedisonferruzzi group 
italian officials said italy will also offer its technology to 
help convert soviet military industries into civilian ones 
in 1966 fiat became one of the first western groups to launch a 
major venture in the soviet union the togliattigrad auto plant 
which began production of fiat 124 models in 1970 has contributed 
about half of all soviet vehicles

negotiators for eastern airlines and the pilots 
union which last week called off its strike agreed monday to meet 
for federally mediated talks 
eastern spokesman robin matell said there was a preliminary 
meeting in miami monday with a negotiating session planned tuesday 
under the auspices of sam cognata of the national mediation board 
pilots union spokesman skip orr called the session part of 
contract negotiations that have gone on sporadically since the 
pilots contract became open to amendment more than a year ago the 
pilots walkout was officially a sympathy strike for the eastern 
machinists union which went on strike after 1 years of federally 
mediated talks stalemated 
eastern and the pilots have a major new difference to negotiate 
how the 2200 pilots who just ended their strike will get their 
jobs back or whether they will get them back 
a letter from skip copeland the head of easterns former 
striking pilots to eastern president phil bakes last week said 
that while a return to work was unconditional it is our 
position that all strikers should be reinstated promptly 
the letter said former striking pilots should receive seniority 
and assignments in accordance with their contract 
in a separate development monday atlantas aviation 
commissioner ordered striking eastern machinists to vacate their 
tent city headquarters at hartsfield atlanta international 
airport because of a rockthrowing incident in which a working 
eastern employee was injured 
miamibased eastern which began rebuilding without its unions 
said it has enough pilots 1850 to operate its current 
schedule of those about 1000 were hired as replacements during 
the strike and eastern contends their jobs are protected against 
returning strikers 
the two sides had been far apart on salary issues and work rule 
changes although no current details were available monday 
matell said the concessions eastern wants from the pilots were 
considered essential for the airlines effort to emerge from 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
orr said the negotiations on returning union pilots to work will 
demonstrate the companys attitudes toward its workers 
i think it would probably prevent possible litigation it 
would indicate to everyone concerned that they really do want to 
rebuild eastern with the most experienced people available orr 
said 
and it would indicate by actions rather than just words that 
they do want to work with labor groups weve never seen any 
indications of that he said 
eastern on friday amended an august request that us district 
court in miami clarify the rights of employees who are currently 
working and determine the rights of those who wish to return to 
work 
matell said no hearing date had been set 
he said there are also tentative plans for negotiations this 
week between the company and the transport workers union which 
represents flight attendants at eastern 
the flight attendants followed the pilots last week in ending 
their sympathy strike leaving only the machinists union on the 
picket lines 
under the railway labor act covering the airline industry and 
other transportation labor contracts remain in force until federal 
mediation has been tried and fails after which the union may 
strike and the company may impose its conditions 
eastern last june sought in bankruptcy court to have the pilots 
contract invalidated but then withdrew that request 
after direct talks broke down the pilots in june requested 
federal mediation there also were negotiations with the 
courtappointed bankruptcy examiner attorney david i shapiro 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
after the strike began march 4

west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
fell 19 cents to close at 1963 a barrel 
contracts between february and june finished between 18 cents

countries is holding its semiannual conference 
opec ministers completed their third day of negotiations monday 
without reaching any conclusions on production limits the issue 
dominating the talks 
we havent heard any specific opecrelated news and the

adjournment said larry lawrence manager of options and 
technical analysis for elders futures inc 
refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for december delivery lost 074 cent

6092 cents a gallon january lost 044 cent to 6043 cents and 
february declined 043 cent to 5875 cents a gallon 
analysts said the sparse volume was due partly to the opec 
meeting 
people are waiting to hear said greg dreis energy broker 
with merrill lynch energy futures once we see a decision out of 
opec well see more activity 
opec ministers are trying to decide whether to devise a new plan 
for allotting production shares according to each nations ability

sales of new north americanmade cars and trucks 
fell 44 percent in midnovember from the same period last year 
automakers reported monday in the latest indication of their 
industrys weakness 
the industrys lengthening sales slump which has been paced by 
the big three of general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp could mean automakers will lengthen their yearend factory 
shutdowns in an attempt to trim production and deflate an inventory 
backlog analysts said 
the eight major companies making cars and light trucks in north 
america said they sold an average of 31032 vehicles daily during 
the nov 1120 period compared with a daily rate of 32466 during 
yearearlier period 
car sales dropped 61 percent while light truck sales fell 18 
percent during the period 
for the big three overall vehicle sales were down 86 percent 
from last year during the 10day period 
through nov 20 of this year car and truck sales from all 
usbased manufacturers were 26 percent behind last years pace 
car sales were down 36 percent and truck sales were off 08 
percent during the yeartodate period 
the industrys sales slide began in early october as automakers 
ushered in the 1990 model year with higher prices 
analysts said monday they expected automakers to consider 
cutting production rather than piling on more rebates or other 
customer incentives to help sell cars and trucks 
were at a point in the cycle where production cuts make more 
sense said john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of new york he 
said automakers might look at extending holiday shutdowns to reduce 
production 
it would dramatize to the feds the need for lower interest 
rates and to the uaw how important it is to be sane in their 
demands kirnan said 
the united auto workers union and the big three automakers open 
contract talks this summer over replacing the pacts that expire at 
midnight sept 14 1990 
the automakers have been wrestling with bloated inventories 
since early this year trying to shrink them with dealer and 
customer incentives and shortterm plant shutdowns 
last week the uaw staged a large demonstration at chrysler 
headquarters to protest the companys scheduled february closing of 
a detroit assembly plant and the laying off of 1700 employees 
ford said its car and truck sales pace was down 13 percent in 
midnovember with car sales off 116 percent and truck sales off 
148 percent for the year through nov 20 fords vehicle sales 
were down 25 percent 
chryslers car and truck sales pace was down 33 percent in 
midnovember from the same time last year a 12 percent drop in its 
car sales was offset by a 6 percent increase in its light truck 
sales 
chryslers yeartodate car and truck sales were down 64 
percent from last year 
general motors said its midnovember car sales were down 13 
percent while its truck sales were up 41 percent combining for a 
73 percent decline for its vehicles during the period for the 
year gms car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year

a move by international business machines corp 
to reduce the electromagnetic radiation emitted by computer 
displays does not go far enough some critics said monday 
ibm was praised for taking the lead in reducing very low 
frequency radiation but several advocates of radiation reduction 
said the company had neglected to do anything about the extremely 
low frequency spectrum 
this move of ibms is partial at best and i think is a public 
relations stunt at worst said paul brodeur author of a newly 
published book on electromagnetic radiation currents of death 
brodeur said the government and private industry should work 
strenuously to cut electromagnetic radiation at 60 cycles a second 
the range associated with power lines he argues it can cause 
leukemia and brain cancer 
ibm said monday it did not do anything about the 60 hertz 
radiation because customers had not asked for it the company 
argues there is no evidence that radiation from computer displays 
is a health hazard scientific studies have been contradictory 
we dont have any active work right now on 60 hertz 
radiation paul snayd manager of ibms vdt and ergonomics project 
office said in an interview we have not visited it at all 
ibm in september introduced a line of infowindow terminals for 
midsized and mainframe computers that give off less 
electromagnetic radiation in the 15 kilohertz to 17 kilohertz 
range categorized as very low frequency 
the reducedradiation feature of the terminals was included in 
response to requests from customers in sweden and denmark not 
because of health concerns ibm said the terminals were promoted 
as lowradiation in europe but not in the united states where 
press materials made no mention of the radiation issue 
snayd said the radiationreduction feature probably will be 
introduced in future displays for personal computers some analysts 
expect that to happen next year 
no other us computer makers have said they plan to follow 
ibms lead in radiation reduction 
brodeur faulted ibm for implying the terminals were low in 
radiation when in fact they deal with only one portion of the 
spectrum but ibms snayd countered that the company had not billed 
them as low radiation in the united states at all 
when and if we do well be very precise about their 
characteristics he said 
the newspaper guild union has been leading the fight for 
controls on radiation from video display terminals david eisen 
the research and information director praised ibms radiation 
reduction 
this is certainly a salutary development and certainly 
something the unions in the united states and canada have been 
calling for for the last four years eisen said 
but he added it would be far better if they were shielding in 
the 60 hertz frequencies as well and i see no reason they should 
not be shielding for both 
electromagnetic radiation from computer displays is different 
from and less dangerous than the ionizing radiation of gamma rays 
and xrays

bellsouth corp announced monday its board of 
directors had adopted a shareholder rights plan to protect the 
company against the possibility of a hostile takeover 
company officials said the protection plan was not in response 
to any attempt at an acquisition of bellsouth the plan would take 
effect if anyone acquired 10 percent of the companys stock without 
managements approval 
the move comes as bellsouth continues a bitter fight with mccaw 
cellular communications co for control of the cellular telephone 
properties of lin broadcasting corp 
this plan will help ensure that all bellsouth shareholders 
realize the longterm value of their investment in the company by 
requiring potential buyers to negotiate with our board first 
said bellsouth chairman john l clendenin 
and the plan should provide additional protection to our 
shareholders from the negative effects of abusive 
shareaccumulation tactics by discouraging abusive tactics the 
plan promotes the fair and equal treatment of all shareholders 
clendenin said 
under the plan if any person or group acquires 10 percent of 
the companys stock without prior board approval other 
shareholders then would be allowed to buy bellsouth common stock at 
half price thus diluting the holdings of the potential buyer 
atlantabased bellsouth is the holding company for southern bell 
and south central bell which serve nine southeastern states and 
has other business interests including substantial cellular phone 
properties

the dollar fell sharply against most major 
foreign currencies monday as traders anticipated a further decline 
in interest rates in the united states 
gold prices also were mostly lower 
the psychology is definitely bearish for the dollar and 
bullish for the west german mark said earl johnson a vice 
president for foreign exchange at harris trust amp co in chicago 
traders expected interest rates to fall in this country in 
response to a slowing economy and to rise in west germany because 
of the continuing political changes in eastern europe johnson said 
a nations currency tends to follow the direction of its 
interest rates lower us rates make the dollar less attractive 
while higher west german yields make the mark a better investment 
the dollars downward trend is expected to remain in place in 
the next few weeks unless the bush administration issues new 
statistics indicating strength in the economy johnson said 
when the economy is stronger the federal reserve is more likely 
to nudge interest rates higher to prevent it from overheating 
traders will be watching as the government issues several 
economic reports this week including third quarter gross national 
product figures and personal income construction spending and the 
index of leading indicators for october 
overseas dealers also said they expected the dollar to drop 
further 
as long as there arent any major surprises from the interest 
rate side i expect the dollar to move lower under fluctuations 
said a dealer at a frankfurt bank 
late dollar rates in new york compared with late fridays 
prices included 17890 west german marks down from 18010 
16040 swiss francs down from 16095 61100 french francs down

gold prices plummeted monday amid heavy profittaking by 
speculators as the market broke a fiveday runup that had pushed 
the metal to its highest levels in almost a year 
on other commodity markets cotton futures plunged the permitted 
daily limit soybeans were down sharply energy futures retreated 
and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 520 to 610 lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in december down 
520 at 41410 a troy ounce silver fell 187 cents to 207 cents 
with december settling at 5693 a troy ounce 
mondays selloff was the steepest daily decline in gold prices 
since aug 4 and the most significant drop since the market began 
climbing sharply about six weeks ago from levels near 360 an ounce 
analysts said gold had been due for a correction after climbing 
so hard so fast and many remained bullish 
the trend remains intact said james steel metals analyst 
with the futures brokerage refco inc in new york 
but they said gold easily could fall a bit further before 
resuming its climb which has been based largely on investment 
buying stemming from the uncertain economic outlook the volatile 
stock market and worries about the rapid rate of political change 
in eastern europe 
there were no solidly bearish developments monday to prompt the 
gold selloff so observers concluded the selling reflected 
profittaking by players who had ridden the market up since 
midoctober 
i dont think were finished yet with the rally in gold or 
silver said jack barbanel managing director of first global 
asset management inc in princeton nj its healthy for the 
market not to overextend itself 
most cotton futures prices fell the daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound on the new york cotton exchange in a selloff inspired almost 
entirely by technical sell signals in the absence of fresh 
supplyanddemand news 
the trigger was the march contracts drop below the september 
low of 7220 cents early in the session said ernest simon a 
cotton analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
when it came close to it frantic panicky selling 
developed he said 
cotton settled 175 cents to 233 cents lower with march at 
7108 cents a pound and the december contract which has no limit 
pending expiration down 233 cents at 6772 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the chicago 
board of trade led by a steep soybean selloff linked to slack 
export demand and bearish technical signals 
the wheat market closed narrowly mixed with support stemming 
from agriculture secretary clayton yuetters statement that 
frances sale of 13 million metric tons of wheat to the soviet 
union was an encouraging sign that the soviets were back in the 
market for wheat 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with december at 
406 a bushel corn futures were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with 
december at 233 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower 
with december at 143 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 11 cents 
lower with january at 576 a bushel 
technical factors also were cited for mondays moderate decline 
in energy futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 08 cent to 25 cent 
lower with january at 1963 a barrel heating oil was 29 cent to 
58 cent lower with december at 6092 cents a gallon unleaded

georgiapacific corp said monday it was 
seeking to oust the board of directors of great northern nekoosa 
corp which has advised shareholders to reject georgiapacifics 
36 billion buyout offer 
georgiapacific stated it was soliciting shareholder consents 
for a special meeting at which great northern shareholders would 
vote on whether to remove the board 
its clearly time to let great northerns shareholders speak 
for themselves since their board obviously does not speak for 
them georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said in a 
statement released through his atlanta headquarters 
in a separate move georgiapacific filed motions monday in us 
district court seeking to force a great northern shareholders 
meeting to be moved up from march to within the next 30 days 
georgiapacific also sought to force great northern to disclose 
to the securities and exchange commission any steps it might be 
taking to alter its financial structure and make a takeover more 
difficult 
great northerns board on nov 21 recommended that stockholders 
reject georgiapacifics sweetened buyout offer of 63 a share or 
about 36 billion total great northern also had rejected 
georgiapacifics initial offer of 58 a share a total of about 
31 billion 
great northern stock rose 12 cents to 6162 a share monday on 
the new york stock exchange georgiapacific rose 37 cents to 
4762 a share 
great northern based in norwalk conn and incorporated in 
maine has refused to negotiate with georgiapacific over either 
offer calling the proposed buyout financially dangerous and 
illegal under antitrust law 
the company issued a news release from its headquarters calling 
georgiapacifics court motions entirely meritless and 
selfserving and said it would contest them in court 
the steppedup attack on great northern came a day before hahn 
was to meet in augusta with gov john r mckernan and attorney 
general james e tierney 
maine officials have sought assurances from both companies that 
the merger fight would not cost any state residents their jobs or 
put valuable woodlands in the hands of developers 
hahn has made no promises saying that because he does not have 
access to great northerns inside information on its maine 
holdings he cannot say for sure what georgiapacific will do if it 
wins the takeover battle 
georgiapacifics effort to have shareholders oust great 
northerns directors is separate from the federal court action 
under maine law if at least onethird of the shareholders seek 
a special meeting for voting on removal of the directors the 
meeting must be called within 60 days 
the court papers ask that a separate shareholders meeting 
already scheduled for march 20 be moved up to within the next 30 
days so shareholders can go ahead and vote on the georgiapacific 
offer 
georgiapacific in asking for disclosure of any plans by great 
northern to change its financial structure also seeks to force 
great northern to provide 72 hours notice before it makes such 
changes 
georgiapacifics motion stated that great northern shareholders 
could suffer irreparable harm if the court did not prevent the 
companys management from taking further steps to either prevent a 
takeover or restructure great northern

a ual corp stockholder said monday he had 
proposed a shareholder resolution demanding the resignation of 
uals board of directors contending they were not acting in the 
best interests of the company 
professor paul s dempsey a transportation law expert from the 
university of denver said he had asked uals board to include the 
proposed resolution in the proxy statement for the airline 
companys annual meeting next spring 
dempseys demand is another sign of discontent among ual 
shareholders who saw the price of their shares skyrocket several 
months ago on takeover overtures only to plummet following a failed 
buyout attempt by pilots and management of uals united airlines 
the investor group coniston partners already is asking ual 
shareholders to support its efforts to oust most ual board members 
and replace them with directors who would put the company up for 
sale or engage in some other transaction to boost shareholder value 
dempsey contends that uals directors have become greedy and 
should be replaced or forced to take steep pay cuts and lose some 
of their selfawarded perquisites 
im less concerned with increasing shareholder value in terms 
of trying to find another buyout than i am with getting the company 
back to running an airline and focused on trying to shore up their 
market position dempsey said in a telephone interview in 
chicago where he is a visiting professor at depaul university 
dempseys complaints include the ual boards decisions in august 
and september to award themselves golden parachute severance 
plans consisting of 20000ayear lifetime salaries and unlimited 
firstclass travel benefits for themselves and their spouses the 
board members would have received the benefits whether or not they 
continued to serve on the board after the planned pilotmanagement 
buyout 
the benefits were revoked when the deal collapsed in october due 
to a lack of bank financing for the 675 billion bid 
dempsey also attacked ual chairman stephen wolf who stood to 
gain more than 76 million if the deal had gone through 
ual spokesman joe hopkins declined to comment on dempseys 
demands he said uals next annual meeting had not been scheduled 
but the meeting usually is held in april 
uals stock fell 87 cents to 16875 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange 
dempsey who has written several books critical of airline 
deregulation said he has owned 100 shares of ual for several 
years his ownership of more than 1000 worth of ual stock 
qualifies him to propose a shareholder resolution according to 
securities and exchange commission rules 
under the rules ual must publish the resolution in its proxy 
statement unless it can persuade the sec that it fails to meet 
certain technical requirements such as word limits and the timing 
of the filing of the proposal 
dempsey said he expects ual to raise objections to his proposal 
he said such resolutions usually are defeated by shareholder votes 
if they make it into proxy statements 
but dempsey said he hopes to succeed by tapping the 
dissatisfaction of other shareholders 
its a way to get an issue on the front burner of a 
corporation and embarrass some board members and get them to act 
responsibly and that is what im trying to do with this dempsey 
said

the failing miller amp rhoads department 
store chain on monday abandoned a plan to reorganize under federal 
bankruptcy law and said it would seek to sell all its assets 
the reversal came just four months after the centuryold 
regional department store sought chapter 11 protection from 
creditors and sought to reorganize as a smaller company 
certainly everybody in the company is disappointed 
president john e stokely told a news conference at the companys 
flagship store in downtown richmond 
stokely said the chain filed a plan in us bankruptcy court on 
monday that contemplates the sale of all assets 
he said the companys current circumstances and financial 
condition led the board of directors to conclude that a 
reorganization as a profitable going concern is not feasible 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code a company can 
function under court protection while it devises a way to pay its 
bills 
miller amp rhoads had 14 stores in july when it filed for 
bankruptcy court protection since then the company has begun 
arrangements to rid itself of six of its less profitable stores 
including one in north carolina the rest of its stores are in 
virginia 
stokely said negotiations are continuing to sell four of the 
eight remaining outlets to may department stores co of st louis 
stokely said none of the sales transactions would be completed 
before the end of january the chain will operate normally through 
the christmas season he said 
stokely estimated it would take four to six months to complete 
the sale of all of 104yearold miller amp rhoads assets he said 
jobs should be available to the majority of the companys 
approximately 2000 employees through the sale of the chains 
properties to other retailers

legislators approved major concessions from the 
kremlin on monday granting the baltic republics the right to issue 
their own currency and take a share of profits from centrally 
controlled factories 
after four months work the supreme soviet gave final approval 
to a plan launching lithuania latvia and estonia on the road to 
economic autonomy from moscow beginning jan 1 
in other action the legislators gave preliminary approval to 
the soviet unions first law explicitly repudiating years of press 
censorship 
deputies from the tiny baltic republic of estonia smiled stood 
and cheered after the legislature approved the economic 
independence measure on a vote of 29667 thirtyseven deputies 
abstained 
its a very big step forward lithuanian communist party 
chief algirdas brazauskas said in an interview after the vote 
estonian legislator mihail bronshtein an economist called the 
vote a big victory for his republic 
president mikhail s gorbachev who presided at the debate also 
had praise 
we need such a law to move us forward on the road to economic 
reform he told more than 400 legislators who had gathered in the 
kremlin 
his chief economic adviser deputy premier leonid i abalkin 
said the baltics would be taking brave radical steps and 
blasted opponents for a presumption of guilt that the republics 
would take advantage of the law to the detriment of the rest of the 
country he said the government had made several major concessions 
in giving up some control of the baltics economies that have been 
under moscows jurisdiction since the soviet takeover of the 
independent states in 1940 
the law says natural resources in the baltics long plundered by 
moscowcontrolled ministries are to be used in the interests of 
the republics and the union baltic legislators said this meant 
the republics will have the prerogative on how resources are used 
control of the republics financial system is to be in the hands of 
independent republican banks except for branches of the soviet 
national bank 
abalkin said that provision meant the baltics could develop 
their own currency for use within the republics although they 
would still be required to use the ruble in dealing with the rest 
of the country 
politicians and economists in the baltics are considering 
setting up their own currencies because the value of the ruble has 
plunged but they indicated the time is not yet ripe to take such a 
radical step 
one deputy said the provision would allow the republics to 
create their own separate fiefdoms 
the law also gives the republics a say over how the incomes of 
businesses on its territory is spent and legislators said this 
meant the republics would get half of their profits 
control of pipelines and highways running through the baltics is 
to be decided on agreement of the central government and the 
republics but abalkin said such items would remain in moscows 
hands 
a final vote on the bill had been delayed from friday after a 
sharp debate on whether the move amounted to a renewal or an effort 
to tear apart the soviet system 
a deputy from the soviet far east nikolai danilyuk said friday 
he opposed the bill because i would not like to become a 
participant in the disintegration of our great state 
gorbachev said friday the baltics can move toward economic 
independence under the new law only within the framework of the 
federation and all 15 republics will be allowed to have such 
status in 1991 
the law was given preliminary approval in july and sent to 
legislative committees for further work 
the press law which goes to committees for further work 
declares that the press and other mass media are free censorship 
of the mass media is not permitted 
mass media can be owned and operated by government and social 
organizations work collectives creative unions religious 
cooperative and other groupings of citizens of the ussr it 
said greatly loosening the traditionally tight control of the 
media 
it says distribution of materials revealing state secrets 
calling for violence or overthrow of the government or containing 
propaganda of war racial nationalistic religious exclusivity 
or intolerance and pornography can be banned by a prosecutor 
the soviet press traditionally has been on a tight rein and 
communist party officials frequently have pressured editors to keep 
unfavorable materials out even before the law was passed however 
gorbachevs glasnost policy of openness made many subjects no 
longer taboo 
gorbachev last month met with newspaper editors and accused them 
of giving the impression the country was on the brink of disaster 
hurting his reform effort he reportedly demanded the firing of at 
least one editor who nevertheless remains at work

the us dollar was lower against the japanese yen 
tuesday morning while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
fell marginally 
the dollar which opened at 14333 yen down 002 yen from 
mondays finish here ended morning trading at 14345 yen it 
ranged from 14333 to 14347 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 major issues lost a marginal 
970 points or 003 percent ending the morning session at 
3687183 the index was a 3976points gainer monday attaining a 
record 3688153 close 
the index was lower since the opening because market players 
were afraid of a rapid rise in share prices following the hefty 
gain the previous day securities dealers said 
satoru nagayoshi a dealer with new japan securities co 
attributed the nikkeis slight loss to technical sellings by nomura 
securities 
trading was active he said mainly because the yen has been 
stable on the foreign exchange market 
meanwhile in exchange dealings the dollaryen rate moved 
narrowly as market players stepped to the sidelines after a similar 
waitandsee mood in new york said a trader with the bank of tokyo 
the yen remained higher against the dollar as participants 
bought it by selling the west german mark for profittaking he 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the mark has been stronger than almost any other major currency 
after the recent reforms in eastern europe 
since many market players who expect west germany will be the 
major beneficiary of the movements in eastern europe still have a 
large demand for the west german currency technical selling of the 
mark against the yen in tokyo will last only temporarily said 
the bank of tokyo trader 
bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said tuesday that the 
central bank will conduct concerted intervention if the market 
continues to fluctuate excessively kyodo news service reported
