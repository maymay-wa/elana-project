hijacker who wanted to crash a boeing 737 with more than 100 people 
aboard into a government building in the brazilian capital 
thursday officials said 
the airliner hijacking left one person dead and four wounded in 
the central brazil city of goiania 850 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro and 150 miles northwest of brasilia the capital 
the gunman was shot as he left the boeing 737 and tried to board 
a small getaway plane with a hostage after the rest of the 
passengers and crew of vasp flight 375 were released unharmed 
officials said 
authorities said the hijacker shot and killed the airliners 
copilot and wounded three other crew members they described the 
hijacker as mentally disturbed 
federal police chief romeu tuma told reporters in goiania that 
the hijacker received several bullet wounds throughout his body and 
was in critical condition 
tuma identified the hijacker as raimundo conceicao 28 airport 
officials said no americans were aboard 
the police chief said conceicao told the control tower at 
goianias santa genoveva airport that he wanted to slam the 
boeing 737 into a ministry building in brasilia but later agreed 
to take a smaller plane 
holding a 38caliber revolver and taking the boeings pilot 
with him the hijacker descended from the jet parked on the runway 
at the airport 
a small brazilianmade bandeirantes plane was to take him and 
the pilot to brasilia said air force spokesman col eden 
avolinsque 
the hijacker had demanded to talk to president jose sarney about 
the countrys economic policies which he thought were wrong said 
goiania police spokesman morton luiz 
police shot at him as he left the plane and he turned around 
and shot the boeing pilot whom he had taken as his only hostage 
avolinsque told the associated press in brasilia he ran off into 
the bushes and police following close behind shot him 
pilot fernando murillo silva was shot in the leg avolinsque 
said 
we had orders from the president not to negotiate with the 
hijacker and not to refuel the plane avolinsque said 
hundreds of heavily armed federal and state police and uniformed 
army troops had surrounded the jet isolated at the end of a 
runway vasp a domestic carrier is a portuguese acronym for 
viacao aerea sao paulo 
vasp spokeswoman mona cury said flight 375 was on its daily run 
from the amazon jungle city of porto velho to rio on the southeast 
atlantic coast when it was hijacked 
the hijacker ordered the airliner be flown to brasilia but the 
government refused to let it land said luiz after nearly running 
out of fuel the jet landed in goiania 
he told the control tower he was against the economic policies 
of president jose sarney and insisted on going to brasilia he 
didnt make any other demands luiz said by telephone from 
goiania 
earlier vasp and the rio airport authority had reported a 
passenger also was killed but later denied the information 
tuma flew from brasilia to goiania to direct negotiations with 
the hijacker he said the man showed signs of mental 
disturbance 
luis carlos ferrini a vasp employee at the goiania airport 
said soldiers were taken to an identical plane to study it for a 
possible invasion 
live tv reports from goiania showed soldiers with rifles 
creeping up to the plane and then running away 
avolinsque said the hijacker boarded the plane during a 
refueling stop in belo horizonte 290 miles north of rio 
about 20 minutes after takeoff he got up and walked toward 
the cockpit a steward said thats not the toilet and the man 
turned and shot him injuring him in the head avolinsque said at 
a news conference in the air force ministry 
avolinsque said the hijacker entered the cockpit shot copilot 
salvador evangelista in the head and a flight engineer in the leg 
and ordered the pilot to fly to brasilia 
vasp said the plane carried 98 passengers and seven crew members 
when the plane landed in goiania in the early afternoon the 
hijacker permitted the injured crew members and another steward to 
be taken from the plane 
evangelista later died luiz and air control officials said

mayor tom bradley on wednesday proposed a 
plan intended to cut the number of trucks traveling on highways 
leading into the nations secondlargest city during peak traffic 
hours 
bradleys plan which will be submitted to the city council for 
approval is intended to keep 70 percent of heavyduty truck fleets 
that normally operate during peak trafic hours off the road 
bradley was joined by rerpesentatives of the areas trucking 
industry as he announced the plan he said he did not blame 
truckers for los angeles traffic woes but he said it was their 
turn to help alleviate the traffic congestion that afflicts the los 
angeles area 
no one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy 
bradley said the old saying if you got it a truck brought it 
still largely applies but there is no reason so many truck 
deliveries must be made during these peak rushhour travel times 
bradley said 
the mayors plan would allow only 30 percent of large truck 
fleets to operate on city roadways from 6 am to 9 am and from 4 
pm to 7 pm 
the 30 percent of the trucks that fleet owners decide to operate 
during peak hours would have to display a city certificate that 
could cost up to 60 stiff fines would be levied if a trucker 
operated without the certificate 
trucks weighing 29000 pounds or more would be subject to 
certification under the bradley plan 
the 60 certificate fee would help fund a multiagency rapid 
deployment force that bradley said would quickly clear snarled 
surface streets and freeways of brokendown trucks and cars 
the plan includes partial exemption for owneroperators of 
single trucks they are allowed to use city roads either in the 
morning or the evening rush hour the plan will also allow for a 
casebycase exemption 
city sanitation turcks and certain hazardous materials 
collection trucks also will be exempted under the bradley plan 
although the plan will only allow 30 percent of the largefleet 
trucks that currently travel during rushhour analysts with the 
mayors office estimate the partial exemption for owneroperators 
and the casebycase examption will result in a cut of about 50 
percent

decision said willard holmes director of the vancouver art 
gallery 
holmes was among the jurors who decided that none of the 380

awarded the 20odd finalists will be displayed at an exhibition 
opening oct 11 
the contest was organized by the federation of canadian artists 
and sponsored by canadian forest products ltd 
the theme of the competition for which only british columbia 
artists were eligible was water and its usefulness to 
industry about 380 entries by 300 artists were submitted 
we didnt see any work which we felt we could support for the 
prizes holmes said tuesday i had reservations about taking 
part in this event and those reservations have been confirmed 
he said the jurors first looked at color slides of all the 
entries and couldnt reach a decision they then looked at the 
originals of about 20 potential winners without success 
canada forest spokesman gordon armstrong said his company was 
disappointed with the jury decision but has told the artist 
federation to keep the prize money and use it as it sees fit

hundreds of people from around the 
country want to buy the antiquated penny parking meters that lined 
the streets of this philadelphia suburb for more than 30 years 
but officials say the proposed sale has turned out to be a big 
headache 
initially the township planned to trade in the 167 meters for 
new ones but decided to sell them after being flooded with 
purchase requests said john m schoenberg the townships finance 
director 
if i had any idea about the problems i probably would have 
thought twice schoenberg said wednesday 
the township council scrapped a plan last week to sell the 
meters for 100 each through a lotterybymail after a resident 
charged the proposal was unfair because it gave preferential 
treatment to current and former residents taxpayers and business 
owners 
the resident greg leonberg said the plan did not comply with a 
state statute on the disposal of municipal property the township 
either must open up bidding for the meters hold a public auction 
or trade them in he said 
because of the controversy schoenberg said the township is 
considering holding some form of bidding or auction 
more than 600 prospective buyers have indicated they want a 
meter schoenberg said 
in august the community of 16000 residents replaced the 
oldfashioned meters with nickel meters the old meters which 
dated from the 1950s took a penny for 12 minutes of parking but 
replacement parts became hard to find 
leonberg said he is even considering buying a meter although he 
said they have no value at all

she may be a hit in her homeland but 
miss nicaragua is strictly a miss in the united states a victim of 
chilly relations between nations 
yankee administration behaves worse than a fool they deny 
visa to the belle screamed a headline wednesday in the 
progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
the newspaper said the reigning miss nicaragua 19yearold 
gabriela robleto barquero was denied a us visa this week to 
enter puerto rico for an international beauty contest 
but a us embassy official in managua said not even beauty 
queens can thaw the icy relations between nicaragua and the united 
states which has since 1981 backed the rebels known as contras who 
are seeking to overthrow this countrys leftist sandinista 
government 
she is just one of thousands of nicaraguans to whom weve been 
unable to provide visa services because of the actions of the 
nicaraguan government said the diplomat speaking in a telephone 
interview on condition of anonymity 
the nicaraguan refusal to issue visas to us diplomatic 
personnel prevents us from replacing our diplomats he said 
the embassy cannot function in a normal manner when nicaraguan 
actions are keeping us severely understaffed 
the embassy stopped issuing visas to nicaraguans in july 
shortly after nicaragua expelled us ambassador richard melton and 
seven diplomats accusing them of trying to undermine the 
government the united states responded by expelling nicaraguas 
ambassador and other diplomats 
the us embassy official said wednesday that the state 
department had in july requested official visas to replace the 
eight ousted american diplomats he said those requests were not 
processed american tourists do not need visas to enter nicaragua 
miss nicaragua is not the most prominent victim of the visa war 
however 
the united states last week failed to process half of the 
requested visas requested by president daniel ortega for a visit to 
the united nations in new york and the organization of american 
states in washington 
the state department claimed the requests were made too late 
ortega responded by canceling his trip

tired of teenagers driving dangerously fast 
judge james foley came up with an educational punishment that 
officials say may save lives by making the youths think twice 
youngsters convicted of going 80 mph or more in macon county are 
ordered to spend a day with highspeed accident victims many 
unable to move more than their eyeballs in the hospital beds where 
they live out their lives 
ive been on too many phone calls from the highway patrol 
saying that some youngster was killed in a car wreck im sick of 
that said foley a county prosecutor for 23 years before 
becoming an associate circuit judge 1 years ago he is 53 
im trying to reach youthful drivers who have 50 years ahead 
of them you expect kids to make mistakes but if you let them do 
nothing about it but mail in a fine then what have you done to 
modify their behavior 
foley has sent about 30 speeders aged 1621 to the university of 
missouri health sciences center at columbia for a day of talking to 
doctors nurses and other staff members along with some of the 
patients the youngsters then have to write an essay about what 
they learned 
if they fail to go to the hospital and write the essay they 
risk losing their licenses the hospital trip does not keep them 
from having to pay fines of 150200 
i really chew on these kids so theyll know what they did 
foley said 
nobody making the trip to columbia has reappeared before him for 
speeding the judge said although one youth was later ticketed in 
another county 
in one essay a 17yearold boy who had been caught going 94 mph 
summed up the effect of touring the intensive care unit where 
tubes and wires keep patients alive this scene was more 
disgusting than watching all of the friday the 13th movies 
consecutively 
he added although everyone makes mistakes not everyone gets 
by as easily as i did some people will pay for their highspeed 
driving for the rest of their lives 
another speeder wrote that he gave up his motorcycle i have 
lost my nerve and dont want to have my luck run out i want to 
live a long life 
at the hospital the teenagers get a picture of what happens 
from the time a patient is admitted through treatment and 
rehabilitation said kathleen cain who runs the program and is 
coordinator of the hospitals head and spinal injury prevention 
project 
they expect to see blood and guts and be frightened she 
said the real reality for them is seeing somebody trying to 
learn to eat or learn to speak they see people doing things as 
basic as learning how to comb their hair 
for the most part the patients are the same age as the speeders 
which ms cain said has a profound impact on them 
the day slowly grows on them they dont come in and 
immediately see something thatll knock their socks off she 
said as the day goes on they get quieter 
one turning point in their feelings she said is having lunch 
with a 21yearold quadriplegic it makes a real impact on them 
hes pretty blunt with telling them what his life is like 
ms cain and foley said it is too early to assess the programs 
impact on the speeders but both believe it is paying benefits 
at least we can see where we get their attention and they 
learn something she said

a university research center here has started 
to unlock the secrets of the centuriesold chinese tradition of 
using herbs deer antlers dried seahorses and other exotica as 
medicines 
some scientists believe the medicines could help improve modern 
health care 
chinese medicine also has long been popular in japan and sales 
have boomed in recent years 
sales of herbs have gone up because they have preventative 
functions and do not have side effects said lau pun cheung 
president of the 600member chinese medicine merchants association 
of hong kong 
the chinese medicinal material research center at the chinese 
university of hong kong was set up 12 years ago to investigate the 
traditional prescriptions and disseminate its findings 
the program involves compiling an exhaustive englishlanguage 
database on chinese medicine and conducting experiments with 
traditional prescriptions to determine their efficacy 
we wish to open up this treasure house of information to 
worldwide research director chang hsonmou explained of the 
centers computer system that stores botanical chemical 
pharmacological and clinical reports of common chinese herbs 
the data is constantly updated with information from about 180 
journals from china he said 
chang acknowledged that some communist chinese authorities 
originally resisted the program claiming that giving foreign 
researchers access to information about traditional medicine was 
similar to giving away state secrets 
they later backed down chang said and the center now stores 
more than 700 items used in chinese medicine including herbs 
ginseng the white root of a carrotlike plant shells insects 
frog secretion deer tails and minerals such as sulphur and gypsum 
scientists at the center are analyzing selected prescriptions 
made of such material in search of active ingredients that could 
provide clues to developing new drugs 
chang said researchers recently analyzed a series of popular 
formulas known as anshen zhenjing or tranquilizers and 
discovered an active ingredient with effects similar to the popular 
western drug valium 
although these herbs have been used for generations the 
active component had not been uncovered he said the 
centers scientists have learned how to synthesize the compound 
which has attracted the interest of five pharmaceutical companies 
the center also is using modern detectors to examine herbs used 
by chinese hospitals for treatment of serious heart conditions such 
as acute myocardial infarction the blocking of the heart vessel 
this is not a placebo chang said of the prescription the 
result seems to be quite good 
another project involves basic research into the use of chinese 
medicine to reinforce the bodys immune system 
this is a hot topic because of aids chang said but he 
cautioned that the center is not trying to develop a wonder drug to 
cure that fatal disease the chinese immunology approach is to go 
slow to recover your natural balance he said 
the experiments are designed to separate the useless from useful 
in chinese medicine chang said he expressed skepticisim for 
example that any of the hundreds of traditional chinese 
prescriptions for hepatitis can be effective 
we have analyzed only a few but i am doubtful he said 
chang said well over half the respondents to a 1983 university 
survey said they used traditional medicine or acupuncture to 
supplement western medicine 
maurice chung general manager of bristolmyers hk ltd said 
the usbased international pharmaceutical company is keeping an 
eye on the centers research 
it could develop new leads he said its new ground a 
new field 
other programs in hong kong also are bringing traditional 
chinese medicine into the computer age 
for example the research institute of the local chinese 
medicine practitioners association has developed a system in which 
a patients symptoms are entered into a computer program that then 
determined what traditional prescription would be best 
the program is used primarily by junior practitioners to help 
them learn the art of diagnosis said chan yingchee president of 
the institute

oh youngsiks followers have threatened to disrupt olympic 
events including sundays mens marathon a 26mile run through 
the heart of seoul unless he is freed 
the marathon vulnerable because of its length and route is 
expected to be wellguarded by police strung out along the 
boulevards and by commandos trailing along in armored vehicles 
but some questioned whether seouls militant students were the 
main target of the steppedup security since the students favor 
symbolic street clashes with police rather than car bombs or other 
terror blows against innocent civilians 
had authorities detected a sudden threat from international 
terrorists such as the shadowy ultraleftist japanese red army 
categorically no said an american official who works 
closely with the south korean security authorities 
this informant who like most security officials here spoke on 
condition of anonymity suggested that the koreans reinforced their 
security apparatus simply because it had grown more lax since 
opening day sept 17 they had let their socks down a little 
bit he said 
of the korean protective net involving more than 100000 
security personnel the american said its working and not only 
have there been no big plots there have not even been attempted 
plots 
were more concerned now about the mood swings of the korean 
people the antiamericanism 
seoul newspapers have been flooded with letters and calls from 
ordinary koreans angry over the us athletes unruly arrogant 
behavior during the opening ceremony americans boisterous 
cheering at sports events the biased reporting by us news 
media of an olympic boxing incident in which korean officials 
attacked a referee and the theft of an expensive bar ornament by 
two us swimmers 
on tuesday night another american got in trouble runner johnny 
gray was arrested after he kicked a taxi door in a dispute with the 
driver he was later released 
meanwhile down at the olympic village where the athletes 
reside village directorgeneral ryu keunha has other things on 
his mind 
he told the korea times that his security people would 
thoroughly check names of departing athletes against official lists 
to ensure that none tries to defect 
we will pay our utmost attention to prevent any undesirable 
incidents he was quoted as saying 
in an unusual move the seoul government eager to establish 
relations with east bloc countries has announced it will not grant 
political asylum to any athletes who seek to defect

the states highest court censured a district 
court judge wednesday for discourtesy rudeness and sarcasm to 
a woman involved in a domestic dispute case who later was slain by 
her husband 
the state supreme judicial court recommended private censure for 
somerville district court judge paul a heffernan for his courtroom 
treatment of pamela nigro dunn who was murdered by her husband 
paul in august 1986 
private censure involves no fine penalty or loss of judicial 
power 
the case stemmed from charges by mrs dunns family that 
heffernan humiliated and belittled her in court hearings 
the high court dismissed allegations of a pattern of such 
conduct by heffernan noting that he granted mrs dunns request 
for court protection from her husband it said no connection 
existed between heffernans courtroom demeanor and her murder 
heffernan 55 of boston did not return phone calls seeking 
comment his attorney thomas dwyer jr said the judge accepts the 
sjc ruling 
carole nigro mrs dunns mother called the ruling too lenient 
im not saying he was the cause of her murder but just the way 
he handles women in court is wrong 
a central incident in the case stemmed from a march 14 1986 
hearing before heffernan in which mrs dunn who had been beaten by 
her husband sought permission to return to retrieve her clothes 
from her husbands house 
at that hearing heffernan interrupted mrs dunn and said i 
dont think its the role of this court to decide down to each and 
every piece of underwear who owns what as a matter of fact i find 
it a little ridiculous to be involved in it 
at a march 26 1986 hearing with both husband and wife present 
heffernan told dunn lets get this matter resolved ok you 
want to gnaw on her or she on you fine but lets not do it at the 
taxpayers expense 
five months after that hearing dunn murdered his wife and 
disposed of her body at a town dump he has been convicted of 
firstdegree murder 
heffernan was rude and sarcastic during portions of the dunn 
proceeding a single listening to the tape recording of those 
hearings establishes those facts the justices said in their 
11page ruling 
the decision noted that heffernans loud deep voice and 
physically imposing manner contributed to the intimidation of 
mrs dunn 
the court said it was troubling for the future that 
heffernan refused in testimony before the state commission on 
judicial conduct to admit his demeanor was intimidating 
dwyer heffernans attorney said heffernan had voluntarily 
withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and had no mmediate plans to 
resume hearing them and he said heffernan has tried to tone down 
the resonance of his voice in court

metzenbaum dohio said wednesday he had notified the justice 
department 22 months ago of the allegations a constituent raised 
against anthony 
the fbi informed me that they completed their investigation of 
mr anthony in november of 1987 the senator said why has it

family physicians are grossly underpaid 
relative to surgeons and other highpriced specialists says a 
longawaited report laying the groundwork for potentially massive 
changes in the way medicine is practiced in the united states 
ordered up by congress three years ago the 2000page survey 
released wednesday is certain to spark sharp debate in the medical 
profession and beyond 
if the study recommendations were applied immediately heart 
surgeons would suffer a 45 percent reduction in their medicare fees 
and general practitioners would receive a 65 percent raise 
but because of the complex and emotionally loaded issues 
surrounding any discussion of health care not to mention the 
competition for dollars and cents no one is predicting an early 
and literal application 
that is not to say the preliminary skirmishing will not begin 
immediately and be intense 
dr william l roper head of the federal agency that pays the 
medical bills for more than 31 million elderly and disabled 
americans on medicare held out the prospect wednesday that there 
are some things a budgetconscious congress might want to do in 
1989 before the megadebate is completed 
for example he said congress might use the study as a 
rationale for trimming some medicareapproved payments from the top 
end of the scale without adding much or anything at the bottom end 
nobody is going to get 65 percent more from medicare next 
year for example he said 
even the father of the 23 million study told reporters it 
would not be practical to implement its recommendations at once 
harvard medical economist william c hsiao said a fiveyear phase 
in period might be needed 
hsiaos study pointedly does not say any category of physician 
is overpaid or underpaid in actual dollars and cents but rather 
that the way they divide the financial pie is unfair and 
potentially detrimental to sound medical treatment 
officially it is entitled a national study of resourcebased 
relative value scales for physicians services 
in simplest terms what hsiaos work suggests is that if a 
physician faces the option of performing surgery or using an 
equally promising but less financially rewarding treatment the 
present fee system encourages surgery 
his proposal would attempt to change that 
you can predict that under the new system doctors will be 
willing to spend a lot more time with patients to examine and 
counsel them hsiao said right now physicians are being 
penalized financially for spending time with patients 
moreover he said the changes could encourage more young 
doctors to go into primary patient care and lower the overall cost 
of medical treatment 
roper who heads the health care financing administration 
hailed hsiaos work although he expressed reservations about 
whether it should serve as the basis for a wholesale revision of 
medicare pay scales 
ropers agency contracted for the 23 million study he said it 
provides a scientific basis for what medical observers have known 
for some time 
he cautioned that the new system advocated in the report would 
not necessarily constrain overall medical costs which are rising 
far faster than any other segment of the us economy and could 
worsen the problem if the resulting income redistributions 
encourage those physicians who face fee reductions to increase the 
volume or intensity of services 
even though the impact of the report is likely to take years to 
percolate throughout the health care system the attention it is 
generating within the profession is intense 
the journal of the american medical association is devoting its 
entire next issue to the subject and the amas house of delegates 
will vote in december on whether to endorse hsiaos plan 
while the study originated with a congress struggling to get a 
handle on skyrocketing medicare costs it also could affect the way 
private insurers determine how much they will pay for particular 
services 
and although doctors technically are not limited in how much 
they charge by how much public or private insurance will pay their 
insured patients their customers become acutely aware of the 
cost of medical care when they have to pay part of the bill out of 
their own pockets 
the first summaries of hsiaos work along with an editorial 
commentary by roper appeared in the new england of journal of 
medicine at the same time the study was formally delivered to hcfa 
hsiao tried to determine how much work is involved in 2000 
duties performed by doctors in 14 specialties he and colleagues 
took into consideration malpractice insurance premiums and other 
costs specialty training time mental effort technical skill 
physical effort and psychological stress 
for each task he came up with a nonmonetary value for 
instance a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a family 
practitioner is 248 while a wellbaby visit is 64 an appendectomy 
is 621 a pacemaker insertion is 620 and a triple coronary bypass 
is 2871 
to figure out how much doctors will get these values would be 
multiplied by a monetary conversion figure if the figure were 1 
for example a wellbaby visit would be worth 64 and an 
appendectomy 621

compassion even when hes laying down the law seldom does one 
hear this couple sound so understanding and kind 
mezzosoprano birgitta svenden of vuollerim sweden made her 
debut as erda who comes out of a hole in the ground near the end

george bushs proposed tax break for saving 
doesnt amount to much of a benefit according to most analysts 
although one washington economist says it could be an incentive for 
new parents to set aside money for a childs college education 
under the right conditions says john makin of the conservative 
american enterprise institute after 20 years a savings account at 
withdrawal using the vice presidents proposal would have earned 
225 percent more than under current law 
but that assumes an account could earn 10 percent a year which 
it generally would not now and that the family was in the 28 
percent tax bracket which would cut out a large number of families 
that the proposal is designed to help 
joseph minarik of the urban institute used a different 
calculation and reached a decidedly less upbeat conclusion i 
dont think it is a good idea the benefit to the saver is quite 
small he said 
in addition minarik said any benefit to the saver comes 
dollar for dollar from the federal treasury and because the 
government is spending more than it takes in enactment of the bush 
proposal would mean the government is borrowing so the individual 
can save some might suggest thats not necessarily a wise thing 
for the government to do 
makin acknowledges that its going to look a lot less 
attractive if you are talking five years of contributions rather 
than 20 and a 15 percent tax bracket rather than 28 percent 
its better than nothing but its not going to change the 
world dramatically he says 
according to makins calculation a couple in the 28 percent 
bracket fortunate enough to deposit 1000 a year for 20 years and 
earn 10 percent could withdraw 57275 and after subtracting the 
20000 principal and paying tax be left with 26838 without the 
bush incentive the money would have earned 4936 less or 21902 
bush offered the broad outlines of his proposal while 
campaigning tuesday in columbus ohio he billed the plan as an 
incentive for low and middleincome americans to save more and 
thus foster economic growth 
under the proposal a taxpayer could set aside up to 1000 a 
year in an account leave it intact for at least five years and 
earnings on the money would be taxfree until withdrawn the full 
1000 a year would be available only to people with adjusted gross 
incomes of 50000 or less the benefit would decline as income 
rises above that figure and disappear when income tops 60000 
the bush proposal should not be confused with individual 
retirement accounts since the 1986 tax overhaul any worker not 
covered by a company pension may contribute up to 2000 a year to 
an ira and pay no tax on the contribution or its interest until 
withdrawn workers who have a company pension and make less than 
50000 may qualify for some deduction 
but the big difference between iras and the bush plan is the 
deduction most workers may fully deduct their ira contribution no 
one could deduct the annual contribution under the bush proposal 
the only tax benefit would be deferral of taxes on interest earned 
by the annual contributions 
stephen moore of the heritage foundation has not analyzed the 
bush proposal but said that generally conservative organization 
supports encouraging increased saving through tax incentives rather 
than by raising taxes 
some in washington are suggesting a federal sales tax to 
encourage saving they reason that since the tax would apply only 
to money that is spent most people with a choice would choose to 
save 
robert mcintyre director of citizens for tax justice a liberal 
research organization views the vice presidents proposal as a way 
to undo the tax overhaul enacted in 1986 this is just another 
move to turn it around he said 
mcintyre calculated that the bush plan would be worth an extra 
471 to a couple in the 28 percent bracket whose 1000 
contribution earned 10 percent a year for 10 years whats the 
point he asked 
he said the far more valuable iras are used by only 8 percent of 
people at the 30000 income level 
nobody uses them because they dont have the money and they 
wouldnt have the money for the less attractive accounts that 
bush proposed mcintyre said

if animal scientists have their way american 
consumers some day may be eating bacon that has its roots in china 
the agriculture department says a historic agreement to import 
chinese breeding swine has been reached and that the pact may 
help upgrade the us pork industry 
deputy secretary peter c myers said wednesday the contract 
involves usdas agricultural service chinas ministry of 
agriculture and the chinese national animal breeding stock import 
and export corp 
the imports will include 144 pigs of the meishan ming and 
fengjing breeds he said the animals will be used in research 
studies under a cooperative agreement with the usdas meat animal 
research laboratory at clay center neb the university of 
illinois and iowa state university 
no other details of the agreement were announced but a 
department spokesman jim greene said the financing arrangements 
were handled by the two universities 
myers a hog farmer from missouri said china has about 100 
breeds of swine that represent a unique reservoir of unexplored 
germplasm that could offer potential benefits for the us 
industry germplasm is semen and other genetic material 
this unexploited source could prove to be very valuable to 
the us research programs on resistance to diseases parasites and 
improvement of some production traits he said china has a 
long history in the domestication of pigs that can be traced back 
for at least 6000 years 
according to usda reports china also is the worlds largest hog 
producer at the end of 1983 for example china had an inventory 
of 2985 million hogs compared with 558 million for the united 
states at that time 
a goal of the import program is to cross the chinese breeds with 
us breeds to increase litter size and at the same time maintain 
the quality and lean yield of pork the breeds being imported have 
three to four more pigs per litter than the average us breed 
the animals will be imported in late march 1989 after spending 
60 days in quarantine in china and meeting other health 
requirements they will be quarantined again for 120 days at usdas 
animal import center in fleming key fla before being released 
for research 
roger j gerrits of the departments agricultural research 
service said scientists hope to conduct at least five years of 
research to evaluate the animals and determine if they should be 
released for use by the us swine industry 
gerrits said that us swine geneticists recognized the 
potential value of chinese swine more than 10 years ago but 
satisfactory health and quarantine requirements were not 
completed until last year 
the three breeds selected for the research studies are highly 
prolific he said us geneticists estimate it would take at 
least 30 generations of conventional selection to increase the 
litter size of the average us swine breed to the level routinely 
produced by these chinese breeds

the agriculture department says it has resumed 
research into the growing and use of kenaf a fibrous plant that 
can be used to make paper after a decade of being on the back 
burner 
howard e waterworth coordinator of kenaf research for usdas 
agricultural research service said wednesday that 300000 is 
being spent this year in kenaf studies through agency laboratories 
in lane okla and weslaco texas another 300000 is scheduled 
for 1989 
industry trials including test runs by several us 
newspapers indicate that pulp from kenaf makes newsprint paper 
that is as sturdy as woodpulp paper but generally is brighter 
consumes less ink and has less ink ruboff waterworth said 
kenaf can be grown in southern us states such as texas 
florida georgia mississippi and california he said the plants 
grow 15 to 18 feet in height in less than five months and can reach 
about 22 feet an acre yields 7 to 10 tons of dry fiber 
the peoria ill journalstar in 1977 was the first newspaper 
to make a press run on kenaf newsprint at least eight other 
newspapers have had similar tests including the most recent in 
july 1987 at the bakerfield californian 
agency research on kenaf was suspended in 1978 when supplies of 
paper pulp were plentiful and prices were down waterworth said 
the usda has spent about 900000 to support commercial 
development of kenaf through private industry since 1986 and the 
new funds for research are expected to give additional support 
to that enterprise he said

the soviet union has bought an additional 
250000 metric tons of us corn for delivery during the coming 
year says the agriculture department 
the sale announced wednesday raised total corn sold to the 
soviets in the last four weeks to more than 375 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn the 250000 tons of corn would be about 985 million 
bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 26 million 
a fiveyear longterm grain agreement with the soviet union will 
expire sept 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one 
or at least an extension of the current agreement

congress is preparing to force the 
environmental protection agency to combat a mounting wave of 
infectious medical waste washing up on the nations shores 
the latest step in the process came wednesday when the house 
energy and commerce committee gave voicevote approval to 
legislation that would require creationtodisposal controls on 
things such as used syringes 
the action all but guaranteed that before adjourning next month 
congress will respond to the tides of used syringes and 
aidscontaminated materials that appeared this summer in lake erie 
and at beaches in new york and new jersey 
the bill which backers say will be passed next week by the full 
house is similar to legislation approved in august by the senate 
staffers on both sides of the capitol say they expect no problems 
resolving differences between the two plans 
the illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an 
epidemic said rep thomas luken dohio principal sponsor of 
the house bill much of this waste is infectious it can 
literally kill people all of it is repulsive and frightening 
luken said that in youngstown ohio a physician put used 
syringes in a trash bin kids found the needles and played 
doctor with them giving each other injections that could have 
proved fatal 
the legislation would require epa to set up a system to track 
infectious medical waste generated in new jersey connecticut and 
the eight states bordering the great lakes 
however the regional demonstration program could become 
national in scope because any state would be allowed to opt for 
coverage under rules that would require a paper trail from waste 
generation to disposal 
tracking helps stop midnight dumping luken said 
hospitals and clinics will now know where their medical waste is 
going and so will epa 
the bill proposes stiff penalties a civil fine of up to 25000 
for each day of violation and a maximum criminal penalty of 15 
years in prison and a daily violation fine of up to 50000 
committee members said congress is being forced to act because 
epa had failed to issue regulations first proposed 10 years ago 
but then quickly dropped ensuring proper disposal of waste 
created in hospitals laboratories and clinics 
this is not just a question of a bloody syringe washing up on 
a beach on the east coast said rep ron wyden dore the 
medical waste system in this country is broken and inefficient and 
is regurgitating what it cant keep down

a new jersey consultant charged with insider 
trading involving a navy contract discussed the project with a navy 
assistant secretary who has been named as a target in the 
governments defense procurement probe according to the 
consultants attorney 
charles a mills of beachwood nj who had served as a 
consultant to the navy in a project to develop a new generation of 
blimps agreed wednesday to pay 9315 to settle a civil complaint 
filed by the securities and exchange commission in us district 
court 
the sec said it was continuing its investigation and its 
complaint cited a meeting between mills and a certain then 
assistant secretary of the navy whom it did not identify further 
however sources speaking on condition of anonymity indicated it 
was melvyn paisley who was assistant secretary of the navy for 
research engineering and systems and has since been named as a 
target of a justice department probe into pentagon purchasing 
practices 
lawrence barcella paisleys attorney said his client has not 
been subpoenaed or otherwise notified by the sec that he is the 
subject of an investigation moreover he said the sec complaint 
does not imply that the unidentified assistant secretary did 
anything improper 
according to the sec complaint mills in his role as a 
consultant from february to may 1987 had access to confidential 
information about competing bids for a contract worth 1689 
million to develop a prototype of a radarsurveillance blimp to 
help protect navy fleets 
through meetings with naval officials including one on march 
13 1987 attended by the unidentified assistant secretary mills 
learned the officials favored a bid from a joint venture of 
westinghouse electric co and airship industries ltd of 
cardington england the sec alleged 
john d schupper mills attorney said his client told him 
wednesday that he met once with paisley and other officials for 
five or 10 minutes but was not certain of the date 
the navy announced the contract award june 5 a day earlier 
according to the sec mills purchased receipts on the 
overthecounter market in the united states for the purchase of 
airship industries stock which is traded in london and sydney 
australia 
mills sold the receipts june 8 and 9 earning a profit of 
4658 the agency said without admitting or denying the charges 
mills agreed to return the profits and pay an equal amount as a 
penalty 
the sec also said certain assistant secretaries of the navy 
were briefed on the bid award june 3 and 4 by that time paisley 
who was appointed assistant secretary in 1981 was out of 
government according to barcella 
the blimp contract had a potential value of 3 billion if the 
navy had decided to build a fleet of airships however the program 
was scrapped following agreement between the reagan administration 
and congress in late 1987 on a plan to reduce the federal budget 
deficit 
schupper said mills had not believed he did anything wrong and 
cooperated fully with the sec 
in light of his health and his financial resources he 
believes that the settlement represents a fair resolution of 
conflicting conclusions drawn from basically the same facts 
schupper said 
the justice department is investigating whether private 
consultants many of them former pentagon employees paid bribes to 
defense department officials for inside information about 
contracts chiefly within the navy the probe became public in june 
after subpoenas were issued in the case no one has been charged 
yet 
investigators have searched paisleys home looking for evidence 
that he took payments from defense contractors while he was at the 
pentagon investigators also have alleged in court papers that 
while paisley was a consultant to mcdonnell douglas corp he 
improperly provided the company with secret pentagon documents 
about its competitors 
through his attorney paisley has said the government has 
provided no evidence to support such allegations

congress and the white house may be about to 
accomplish something theyve not done since harry truman was 
president enact all federal spending bills before the start of 
the fiscal year 
although its not likely to spark a giddy citizenry into 
launching fireworks approval by saturday of all 13 spending bills 
would be a political coup for both parties 
its already inspired people on both ends of pennsylvania avenue 
to begin publicly patting themselves on the back 
were showing that we can govern rep tony coelho 
dcalif the no 3 house democratic leader said wednesday 
the warning has been taken to heart said president reagan 
he was referring to a promise he made in january that if the 
spending measures were wrapped into a single piece of legislation 
he would veto it 
as the start of the new fiscal year approaches lawmakers and 
the administration are working out disputes that in ordinary years 
could take weeks or months to resolve 
thus reagan who signed his first appropriations bill for the 
new year on july 19 signed the sixth into law wednesday a measure 
appropriating 88 billion for military construction 
in addition a 15 billion spending measure for the commerce 
justice and state departments and a 108 billion transportation 
bill were on his desk legislative action on the five remaining 
appropriations measures was scheduled for today and friday 
this is no ordinary year its an election year and republicans 
and democrats want to avoid any blame for a replay of last years 
budget embarrassment 
in an election year neither side wanted to face 
responsibility for a massive cr said sen ted stevens ralaska 
using the initials for continuing resolution legislative 
lingo for a giant spending bill 
this helps incumbents period said coelho the more you 
make the process work the more you help incumbents 
last december after a year of inconclusive squabbling between 
congress and the white house reagan signed a 1400page 600 
billion behemoth that contained all the money federal agencies 
needed to function this year within hours of receiving it the 
president signed it the alternative was shutting down the 
government 
in january an angry reagan used his nationally televised state 
of the union address to promise to veto any similar bill this year 
congressional leaders called on the president to work with them to 
smooth out any disputes that might arise and pledged to avoid a 
catchall measure for 1989 
the most serious stumbling block this year had been defense 
spending 
but on wednesday congress and the white house resolved a 
longrunning dispute over star wars and arms control restrictions 
with both the house and senate approving a pentagon authorization 
bill that made congressional action possible by friday on a 
separate 300 billion pentagon spending measure 
the quickerthanusual action this year is due in part to last 
falls budget summit agreement between reagan and congressional 
leaders in that pact both sides agreed to broad spending totals 
for 1989 leaving only lesssweeping issues to be worked out 
coelho and other democrats are crediting their own leadership 
for the rapid movement of the spending bills 
we announced at the beginning of the year that wed do it 
coelho said 
even if all 13 bills are not enacted by 1201 am saturday 
there would be little immediate impact federal workers deemed 
essential including the military would be permitted to work 
over the weekend government agencies would not have to shut down 
unless spending legislation was not in place by monday

for president reagan his trip to new york for 
the united nations general assembly meant a dramatic farewell 
appearance for fellow guests at his hotel it meant something of a 
nuisance 
for reporters and photographers it meant scrambling up and down 
stairwells waiting in line in a hotel kitchen and getting stuck in 
an elevator 
reagan spoke at the un on monday making his seventh 
appearance there and his last before he leaves office in january 
after his speech he went to the united states mission to the 
united nations for lunch its just across the street so most 
people would walk presidential security however required that he 
make the crossing by motorcade 
</TEXT>

then it was off to the waldorfastoria hotel a few blocks away 
the waldorf had warned its guests of what was coming 
it is my great pleasure to tell you that president ronald 
reagan will be staying in the waldorf towers during your stay in 
the hotel manager richard j cotter said in a letter handed out 
at the registration desk 
unfortunately however it may mean some inconvenience for 
you cotter added to ensure the presidents safety the park 
avenue entrance will be closed from 530 to 730 pm on monday 
evening please be so kind as to enter and exit the hotel from the 
lexington avenue area 
one woman entering the hotel from lexington avenue still found 
herself inconvenienced when she was asked by a white house aide to 
step aside while the traveling pool of journalists made their way 
through the door 
but were staying here she protested 
</TEXT>

once inside the pool was taken by elevator to a holding room on 
the 33rd floor to wait until it was time to walk up three floors to 
where the president was holding the first in a series of meetings 
with foreign leaders 
after a brief picturetaking and questionasking opportunity 
the scribes scrambled back down to the holding room to file stories 
by telephone and wait for the next meeting 
in a few minutes however a harried assistant manager of the 
hotel showed up to announce that the room set aside as the holding 
room turned out to be part of a suite rented to a permanent hotel 
guest so it was out in the hall for the reporters and their 
telephones

<TEXT>
the next event after the series of meetings was an evening 
reception in a room decked with magnificent crystal chandeliers to 
get to it reporters were ushered through the kitchen past tray 
after tray of dirty dishes before standing in line to have 
security officers check their equipment 
next morning reporters were assembled in their thirdfloor 
press room and taken to three elevators for the ride back up to the 
33rd floor to wait for more meetings at the ninth floor one of 
the elevators got stuck for 10 minutes 
word of the mishap apparently even got to the president 
when the media people arrived on the 36th floor for reagans 
meeting with foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan of pakistan the 
president told them you seem like youve been breathing hard 
im trying to pick out the ones who had to walk up the stairs

lawmakers are mapping efforts to override 
president reagans veto of tightened curbs on textile apparel and 
shoe imports but they concede it will be difficult 
its going to be an uphill fight but it can be done with a lot 
of hard work and a little luck rep butler derrick dsc said 
wednesday after reagan vetoed the measure and called it an example 
of protectionism at its worst 
at a rose garden ceremony wednesday reagan also signed 
legislation to phase out virtually all tariffs between the united 
states and canada the canadian parliament has yet to give final 
approval to the measure and as a result it is uncertain whether 
the freetrade plan can be launched next year as scheduled 
the textile bill designed to protect american companies from 
foreign competition would freeze textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels for the rest of the year and limit subsequent growth to 
1 percent a year 
it would freeze nonrubber footwear imports at 1987 levels with 
no provision for any increase in market share for foreign producers 
expanded market share however would be the reward of countries 
that bought more us agricultural products thats a sweetener 
designed to win over farm belt lawmakers wary lest asian 
textileproducing countries retaliate against the stiffened import 
limits by slashing purchases of american wheat and feed grains 
reagan called the uscanada pact a hallmark of free trade 
and the opposite of the textile legislation he had just vetoed 
protectionism does not save jobs reagan declared he said 
the bill would have disasterous effects on the us economy 
it would impose needless costs on american consumers threaten 
jobs in our export industries jeopardize our overseas farm sales 
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for 
us exports reagan said 
at a time when american exports are booming the united states 
must not embark on a course that would diminish our trade 
opportunities he said 
he added that the measure could break the clothing budgets of 
many american families 
on capitol hill a house override effort was tentativeliy set 
for next tuesday in votes thus far however sponsors have never 
mustered the twothirds they need to pass the measure into law over 
reagans objections 
the house approved the bill 248150 on friday earlier the 
senate passed the measure 5936 sponsors said they now were 
perhaps eight votes short of what they need and vowed to mount a 
lastditch effort to turn the tide 
democrats were quick to pounce on reagans second veto of 
textile trade legislation in the last three years they have been 
portraying the measure as designed to shield bluecollar workers 
from layoffs brought on by burgeoning textile and apparel imports 
maybe ronald reagan will be remembered as a great president 
said derrick but not by the american textile worker 
the reagan administration likes to pretend that it was an 
innocent bystander to the foreign assault on our textile apparel 
and footwear industries but thats not true said house speaker 
jim wright dtexas in failing to implement the trade laws the 
white house has been an accessory to the assault

new crimes and new punishments are created in 
an antipornography measure approved by the senate including life 
prison terms for child selling and 250000 fines for transmitting 
obscene dialaporn messages 
the chamber voted 970 to approve the obscenity measure tacking 
it onto a controversial family leave bill with an uncertain future 
final action on the twopart bill was expected late today 
the unanimous vote on the obscenity amendment followed hours of 
senatorial handwringing over child porn profiteers a few 
constitutional reservations and several references veiled and 
unveiled to the demands of a political season 
those who vote against this ought to do so at their own 
peril said sen orrin hatch rutah its time for the us 
senate to set the standard in this area for us to stand up and do 
what we should do and i know that everybody in this body 
recognizes this filth problem 
the amendment sponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc makes 
it easier to prosecute crimes and secure civil penalties in cases 
involving child pornography and obscene materials the measure also 
sets stiff fines and prison terms including 20 years to life for 
buying or selling children for use in child pornography 
it was added to a bill requiring large companies to offer at 
least 10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave to employees with 
medical crises or new babies thurmond has been among the 
conservatives leading the charge against the leave bill 
but thurmond and hatch complained that although the child 
pornography bill had 45 cosponsors other members blocked it from 
coming up in the judiciary committee for seven months they said 
this was the only way to bring it to the floor 
the thurmond amendment would 
ban buying and selling of children for use in child pornography 
ban the use of computers to distribute or advertise child 
pornography 
require producers of sexually explicit material to document the 
ages of persons appearing in the material 
give states clear authority to regulate obscene or indecent 
programming on cable and subscription television services this 
would overturn a supreme court decision 
raise the maximum penalties for transmitting obscene 
dialaporn messages from six months in jail and a 50000 fine to 
two years and 250000 
make it illegal to sell or possess obscene material or child 
pornography on federal lands individuals could be fined up to 
5000 and sentenced to six months in jail for possession up to 
250000 and two years in jail for sale 
make it easier for prosecutors to file civil forfeiture suits 
against people possessing obscene materials and set fines of up to 
250000 for people who possess obscene material in violation of 
obscenity statutes 
not voting on the measure were sens lloyd bentsen dtexas and 
dan quayle rind the two vice presidential nominees and spark 
matsunaga dhawaii 
sen arlen specter rpa cited several areas of constitutional 
concern including what he called the very troubling federal 
lands provision 
he said it would encompass the entire virgin islands and indian 
territory national parks military bases and federal buildings 
the senate is trying to protect children not trying to reach a 
soldier who has an obscene book in his car specter said 
but thurmond insisted his bill is constitutional and said 
congress shouldnt waste time quibbling we are trying to ban 
obscenity he said if you want to protect the children of this 
country youve got to take a stand

social security in sickness and in health 
has been one of the democratic partys most potent political 
weapons of the 1980s 
this election like the past two finds the democratic candidate 
accusing his republican rival of harboring malevolent intentions 
toward the program that 38 million retirees disabled workers and 
their dependents rely on 
the social security issue was of scant help to jimmy carter and 
walter mondale against ronald reagan but michael dukakis is hoping 
that this fall it will give voters pause about backing george bush 
the 210 billion retirement and disability program on the verge 
of bankruptcy five short years ago now is piling up huge 
surpluses its trust funds which grew to 69 billion last year 
will add 40 billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to 646 
billion by the end of 1995 
dukakis in last sundays debate accused bush of planning to 
raid the social security trust fund to help reduce the deficit 
and pay for tax cuts and pentagon weapons 
bush has said repeatedly he will not touch social security it 
is the one program he plans to exempt from his flexible freeze 
to curb the deficit 
a bush spokesman david sandor dismissed dukakis raid charge 
as an effort to terrorize americas elderly into political 
submission 
the republican commissioner of social security dorcas hardy 
points out that dukakis recently used 27 million in surplus 
pension funds to help balance the massachusetts budget 
social security didnt save carter or mondale but sen bob 
dole rkan said it was the issue that cost republicans control 
of the senate in 1986 
dukakis advises when it comes to social security and george 
bush dont read his lips read his record 
as president of the senate he cast a tiebreaking vote on may 
9 1985 against exempting social securitys costofliving 
adjustment from a fiscal 1986 budget freeze the tally was 5049 
that freeze never materialized reagan after initially 
supporting it abandoned the package and it died afterwards he 
adopted a handsoff policy toward social security that he has stuck 
to and which bush promises to emulate 
in 1981 in the throes of social securitys difficulties and in 
his quest to cut federal spending reagan sought sweeping cuts in 
benefits for early retirees and others congress eliminated college 
students benefits and some others but refused to go along with 
the steepest cuts 
in this campaign as in 1986 mr senior citizen himself 
88yearold democratic rep claude pepper of florida will be on 
the airwaves attacking the republicans on social security the 
national council of senior citizens is running pepper ads attacking 
bush and distributing posters that scream bush whacked my social 
security on may 9 1985 
dukakis has charged that bush would have to raid the trust 
fund if he is serious about reducing the deficit while buying 
more military weapons and cutting the capital gains tax 
in fact the growing trust funds already help reduce the deficit 
although social securitys trust funds technically are listed 
apart from the governments other accounts they are lumped 
together for purposes of the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
federal law prohibits spending social securitys reserves on 
other programs but every dollar added to the trust funds reduces 
the overall deficit 
and since the trust funds must be invested in interestbearing 
us securities they reduce the amount the government must borrow 
in private markets the government uses the funds generated by 
selling bonds to social security to cover the operating deficit in 
the rest of its programs 
still there have been calls for changes in social security 
outside the immediate political debate 
bushs two main economic advisers martin feldstein and michael 
boskin have been prominent academic critics of social security 
feldstein has argued that social security depresses private 
savings he also has proposed restricting costofliving increases 
to the consumer price index minus 2 percentage points 
boskin in a 1986 book too many promises the uncertain 
future of social security proposed to revamp social security to 
separate its insurance and welfare aspects 
robert strauss the former democratic party chairman and 
cochairman of the national economic commission touched off a 
firestorm sept 20 when he said that if the budget is to be 
balanced then we have to go to social security medicare and 
entitlements generally and we have to go to defense both the 
dukakis and bush campaigns disavowed strauss statement 
other democrats have spoken favorably of making more retirees 
pay income tax on their benefits only one retiree in 10 now is 
taxed on social security

the first major revision of the nations 
pesticide control law in a decade is headed for president reagans 
desk with praise from lawmakers and lukewarm support from 
environmentalists 
after 10 years weve seen a major breakthrough agriculture 
committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt said at a news 
conference wednesday following senate approval on a voice vote 
the measure cleared the house last week and sponsors expected no 
problem with the administration over the measure which would 
accelerate safety reviews of potentially hazardous chemicals 
sprayed on crops 
the bill designed to speed the banning of pesticides too 
dangerous for use would set a nineyear deadline for finishing 
environmental protection agency reviews of some 600 active 
pesticide ingredients 
completion of the work would not come until the year 2024 at the 
present pace according to the general accounting office 
the bill also would take a sizeable financial load off taxpayer 
shoulders and hand it to pesticide manufacturers most government 
indemnities to companies for banned chemicals would be phased out 
the industry would pay for the safety reviews as well as a large 
portion of storage and disposal costs 
the measure also would reauthorize for three years the 1947 
federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act which got its 
last facelift in 1978 since then a decade of efforts to speed up 
the safety reviewing process has produced nothing more than 
political snarls 
environmentalists have been calling for tightened pesticide 
controls for more than two decades amid evidence that some of the 
26 billion pounds a year of chemicals sprayed on crops can cause 
cancer birth defects and other health problems eventually the 
pesticides find their way to american dinner tables 
lawmakers did not paint the bill as a fullscale answer to the 
pesticide issue missing was any effort to cope with the problem of 
pesticide contamination of groundwater which provides the basic 
drinking supply for an estimated 113 million americans 
seventythree pesticides have been reported in groundwater in 34 
states the capitol hillbased us public interest research group 
reported recently after examining epa records the agency says it 
is now trying to determine the extent of contamination with a 
nationwide survey 
lawmakers held out the possibility wednesday that they could 
tackle the groundwater program when congress returns to washington 
next year 
now we have to tie together our agricultural programs and our 
environmental goals and enact a groundwater program to protect the 
health of the american people said leahy he had backed 
inclusion of groundwater features but was unable to command a 
majority on the agriculture committee 
flanking leahy at a news conference sen richard g lugar 
rind said groundwater provisions are on the agenda for next 
year 
it has much more of a constituency than it had before lugar 
said before it was much more of an environmental interest now 
it has considerable farm interest 
environmentalists were lukewarm in their assessment of the bill 
as passed the bill does not even qualify for a bronze 
medal said rick hind of the us public interest research group 
on a scale of one to ten this deserves a three it gives 
congress another excuse to postpone important items like 
groundwater farm worker safety and food safety 
laura rhodes of capitol hillbased public citizen said the group 
was pleased that congress has at long last begun reforming this 
countrys ineffective pesticide laws but we are hungry to see 
congress tackle food safety groundwater and farm worker safety 
provisions next session 
the bill isnt perfect but its a necessary first step to a 
rational pesticide policy said janet s hathaway project 
attorney of the natural resources defense council the group took 
actress meryl streep on a tour of capitol hill offices to drum up 
support for the measure 
leahy echoed a concern of many environmentalists that epa has 
dragged its feet because it was unwilling to spend the money for 
intensified safety efforts shifting the burden in large part to 
the industry should alleviate some of that fear he said

called meeting on the countrys political future expected to 
discuss lifting party control on daytoday management of the 
economy and allowing multiplecandidate elections 
the plenary session of the 300member central committee will 
discuss changes key to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs goal of 
promoting efficiency in government by making the 20 millionmember 
communist party focus on ideology and policy goals 
the central committee session announced wednesday had been 
planned for a long time but the specific date had not been set 
the plenary will be devoted to reorganization of the party 
apparatus including the central committee itself foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov told reporters at the united 
nations in new york where foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
was attending the general assembly session 
when the announcement was made shevardnadze and other soviet 
officials rushed back home from trips abroad 
there will be changes in the working of our political 
structure gerasimov said 
one of the key political reforms involves the strengthening of 
the office of president of the soviet union a government post 
gorbachev has said the largely figurehead position should be 
expanded to include primary responsibility for defense and foreign 
affairs 
on wednesday gorbachev said nothing short of a wholesale 
overhaul of the political system will do 
any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity 
of radical change it is needed in the party in the state in 
agriculture in industry in personnel policy and most of all in 
peoples mentality in their attitudes to work to one another and 
to themselves gorbachev said at a kremlin dinner honoring 
visiting east german leader erich honecker 
tass the official soviet news agency carried the only soviet 
media report about the central committee plenum it quoted 
gerasimovs announcement at the united nations 
two soviet sources in moscow dismissed speculation of an 
emergency or that the meeting concerned the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan they spoke to reporters at a reception at the us 
ambassadors residence

overhauling the soviet political system the first deadline set was 
october by which time the central committee said a draft law on 
amendments to the soviet constitution and on multicandidate 
elections of legislators was to be completed 
the central committee is empowered to make personnel changes in 
the politburo at the 19th party conference one delegate suggested 
that holdovers from the 18year tenure of soviet president leonid 
i brezhnev be eased out of the leadership the delegate 
specifically named president andrei a gromyko 79 and fellow 
politburo member mikhail s solomentsev 76 as leaders who should 
retire 
since the conference gromyko has continued meeting visiting 
foreign statemen and is scheduled to visit north korea during the 
first 10 days of october 
the brezhnev era is now widely condemned for allowing rampant 
corruption and decay of the soviet economy and making mistakes in

the conviction of three mexican nationals in 
a us drug agents murder in mexico is being hailed by federal law 
enforcement officials as only the beginning toward bringing all 
the killers to justice 
our goal is to see that everyone who participated in the 
torture and kidnapping and murder of agent enrique camarena is 
brought to justice us attorney robert bonner told reporters 
after wednesdays verdict against the third of three codefendants 
in washington john c lawn chief of the drug enforcement 
administration said he will press the crusade for justice in 
camarenas killing which authorities allege was masterminded by 
reputed mexican drug baron rafael caro quintero 
the eightweek trial included evidence that mexican police took 
bribes to protect drug smugglers and the case strained 
usmexican relations 
a us district court jury that deliberated six days returned 
its last verdict wednesday finding convicted drug trafficker jesus 
felix gutierrez 38 guilty of aiding and abetting the 1985 
torturemurders of camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
jurors concluded felix helped caro escape to costa rica after 
the murders authorities allege that caro wanted revenge for dea 
raids on his marijuana plantations 
earlier the same jury convicted a homicide investigator in 
guadalajara mexico raul lopez alvarez 28 and a drug trafficker 
rene verdugo urquidez 36 of participating in the kidnapmurders 
this is only the beginning said dea spokesman john zienter 
we are well aware that there are other people involved in the 
murder of special agent enrique camarena 
bonner said he hoped other defendants in custody in mexico 
including caro would be convicted should they be acquitted he 
said the united states might move to extradite them 
caro 37 has been convicted on weapons and narcotics charges 
but the camarena murder charge is pending 
camarena was kidnapped from outside the us consulate in 
guadalajara on feb 7 1985 the battered bodies of camarena and 
his pilot were found at a remote ranch on march 5 1985 
jurors heard a dramatic audio tape of camarenas last hours in 
which he begged his captors to stop the torture 
dont hit me anymore he pleaded 
felixs attorney told reporters he will appeal his clients 
conviction 
i asked a question before the trial could a mexican drug 
dealer receive a fair trial in this kind of case with these kind of 
brutal facts in the united states i think the answer is its 
impossible said attorney barry tarlow 
jurors were hurriedly escorted out of the courthouse by us 
marshals 
the three men tried here had never met before they were brought 
to court lopez who was born in mexico but grew up in los angeles 
returned to his native guadalaljara where he became a member of the 
homicide squad with the jalisco state police jurors saw a secretly 
recorded videotape of lopez discussing details of camarenas murder 
verdugo described as caros chief lieutenant was linked to the 
murder scene by a strand of hair two government informants said 
they heard him discuss the crime 
felix who operated a seafood company in los angeles was 
implicated by government informants who said he spoke of arranging 
caros escape to costa rica 
judge edward rafeedie said he would sentence felix and verdugo 
on oct 26 and lopez on oct 24 
bonner said he would seek the maximum sentences life 
imprisonment for lopez and verdugo 10 years for felix 
nine men were indicted in los angeles in the murders but only 
three were tried here one was subsequently killed in a shootout 
four including caro were tried in mexico 
caro and ernesto fonseca carillo 63 were sentenced on weapons 
and narcotics convictions last week caro was sentenced to 34 years 
and fonseca 11 years bonner said verdicts on the murder charges in 
mexico are not expected until january

the trip was announced wednesday at united nations headquarters 
in new york following a meeting between qian and his soviet 
counterpart eduard a shevardnadze 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said qian 
agreed to come to moscow at the end of this year where the 
negotiations will be continued on the kampuchean cambodian 
question and bilateral questions 
he said qian will meet soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
that shevardnadze would visit beijing at a later date 
chinese radio and the official press today mentioned qians 
proposed visit to moscow in reports on his meeting with 
shevardnadze but did not give prominent play to the announcement 
chinas leading daily the peoples daily noted plans for the 
trip in the second paragraph of a story carried on page six its 
international news page 
china and the soviet union split over ideological and strategic 
differences around 1960 with hostilities increasing until the two 
sides fought a brief border war in 1969 
political normalization talks accompanied by increased trade 
and other unofficial contacts began in 1982 but china has refused 
to fully restore normal relations until three obstacles are 
removed 
two of those obstacles have been lowered with the soviet union 
beginning its withdrawal of troops from afghanistan and the 
reduction of tensions on the sinosoviet border but soviet support 
for vietnams military occupation of cambodia remains a key point 
of dispute 
last month soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev flew to 
beijing for the first sinosoviet talks on how to solve the 
cambodian question 
soviet officials in beijing said the talks produced broad points 
of agreement on cambodia with the timetable for vietnams 
withdrawal being the major stumbling block vietnam says its 
pullout will be complete by early 1990 
the officials said they expected that further progress could be 
made at the qianshevardnadze talks in new york paving the way for 
improved ties 
soviet spokesman gerasimov asked if qians visit could lead to 
a sinosoviet summit replied we hope so we are ready for it 
we hope we emphasize that everything in sovietchinese relations 
must be normalized we are on the way 
chinas premier li peng in an interview with the associated 
press earlier this month stressed that improved relations with the 
soviet union were in the interests of china and of world peace 
he also said that china will never return to the relationship of 
the 1950s when moscow played big brother to the fledgling 
communist government in beijing and that better sinosoviet ties 
will not affect chinas good relations with the united states 
chinese and soviet vice foreign ministers have exchanged visits 
repeatedly in the last few years for talks on chinesesoviet border 
issues qian went to moscow several times in that capacity he 
became foreign minister in april 
the forthcoming visit of the 60yearold qian a russian speaker 
who has been posted in moscow marks the first working visit of a 
chinese foreign minister in at least 20 years 
former chinese foreign minister huang hua went to moscow in 1982 
to attend the funeral of soviet leader leonid brezhnev but it was 
not a working visit 
the last soviet foreign minister to visit china was andrei 
gromyko now soviet president who went there in 1959 in that 
year thensoviet leader nikita khruschev came to the united 
nations and denounced china

eighty lucky ninthgraders in florida got frontrow seats for 
todays launch of discovery but some pupils werent allowed to 
watch the live television coverage to spare them possible trauma in 
the event something went wrong 
in concord nh the home of challenger teacherastronaut 
christa mcauliffe nothing special was planned and plans for a 
nationwide educational project built around americas return to 
manned spaceflight fell through 
millions of schoolchildren were watching when the last shuttle 
lifted off on jan 28 1986 because of mcauliffe who was to give 
lessons from space 
when challenger blew up 73 seconds after launch killing the 
seven astronauts aboard students gathered in a festive assembly at 
mcauliffes concord high school were watching on live television 
this time no organized school events were scheduled in concord 
perhaps our relationship to christa will mean more classrooms 
will watch it but i dont think its going to be a big deal 
schools superintendent mark beauvais said wednesday we certainly 
arent going to push it to make it one 
concord high banned reporters from the schools buildings and 
grounds 
at kimball elementary school where mcauliffes son scott is 
in the sixth grade and daughter caroline is in the third 
principal clint cogswell said he expected some classes would watch 
the launch but not scotts or carolines 
the discovery mission excited teachers and students in willmar 
minn where crew member george pinky nelson grew up 
its kind of a local hero thing said jim christenson 
director of elementary education in the city of 16000 with the 
launch all the tv coverage and the balloons and some kids are 
making colored prints of the launch site which will be on exhibit 
they are getting excited 
tumbleweed elementary school in palmdale calif planned to 
celebrate the launch by firing model rockets into space science 
teacher gary whiddison said the students some with parents who 
worked on the shuttle have been studying rocket designs 
the desert community of palmdale is south of edwards air force 
base where the shuttle is to land 
geraldine haracz a fourthgrade teacher at edwards elementary 
school in chicago wore a space suit and explained mission control 
to students watching the challenger launch she planned the same 
for today 
i think we have helped them understand that this was one 
moment of tragedy that will help us go on and learn more about 
space said miss haracz 
in greenwich conn julian curtiss school principal linda 
hartzer said she planned to videotape the launch and show it to her 
elementary school pupils if it succeeds 
obviously if it was a deadly experience we would handle it a 
different way she said hartzer said a school team of 
psychologists educators counselors and social workers would 
decide what to do in that case 
the challenger center which was formed by the challenger 
astronauts families to promote space education had hoped to 
distribute free countdown 54321 kits to the nations 65000 
elementary schools before discoverys launch said spokesman 
richard hutto but the kits wont be ready to be mailed until late 
next week said liz thomas an administrative assistant for the 
challenger centers education department in washington 
however all is not lost hutto said there were some specific 
things about this launch but the kits are designed to be 
generic he said its written in such a way it could be used 
on future flights 
for todays flight 80 students from lincoln park academy in 
fort pierce fla had a clear view of the launch from the parking 
lot of a mcdonalds restaurant in titusville three miles from the 
pad 
restaurant manager mike reed said the students got exclusive 
rights to the parking lot beating out news organizations because

the united states is disturbed by israels use 
of plastic bullets against palestinian demonstrators contending 
the policy is leading to rising casualties in the occupied 
territories 
according to published reports at least three palestinians have 
been killed and 70 wounded since the israeli army began using 
plastic bullets a month ago the bullets have been described by 
their defenders as nonlethal 
we believe that measures must be taken to reduce rather than 
to increase casualties among palestinian demonstrators state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said on wednesday 
thus we are disturbed by the rising casualties of palestinians 
in recent clashes with the israeli military we can see no 
justification for a policy admittedly designed to cause an increase 
in casualties

they would repay firemans fund insurance cos for damages caused

firemans fund which insured the building told the deans they 
could pay 50 a month for the next 32 years to repay the 19616 it 
paid for repairs to the familys apartment

janitorial job we cant pay them said mrs dean 35 right 
now wed be taking food out of our mouths

a coalition of groups opposed to 
rightwing president augusto pinochet has accused the military of 
sowing a climate of fear as an excuse to call off or annul a 
referendum on his rule 
the government did not immediately issue a statement reacting to 
the charge about the balloting scheduled for next wednesday 
chileans will vote either yes or no on whether to give 
pinochet a new eightyear term as president 
a 16party antigovernment coalition said wednesday it was 
concerned with government advertisements predicting political 
violence and social chaos if the no vote wins 
coalition leader patricio aylwin said the coalition is worried 
the government or ultrarightist groups will try to alter the 
course of the campaign carrying out lastminute acts of violence 
to create a pretext for avoiding the plebiscite 
in the southern city of concepcion meanwhile street protests 
broke out when the president campaigned there no injuries or 
arrested were reported 
the opposition also said it was confident that should the vote 
take place the people would reject pinochet 
gen pinochet and other top officials repeatedly have said they 
plan to abide by the 1980 consitution which calls for the 
referendum as part of a phased transition to elected rule 
pinochet 72 the army commander seized power in a 1973 
military coup that toppled elected president salvador allende a 
marxist 
if a majority votes yes in the referendum pinochet will 
assume a new eightyear term next march if pinochet loses an open 
election is to be held next year and pinochet would hand power over 
to the winner in 1990 
most polls give the opposition a substantial lead over pinochet 
in the referendum 
but in an apparent lastminute effort to sway voters new 
government television commercials include images of burned 
children bodies in the street and hordes of people attacking 
innocent women and children 
the governments message is that social chaos will occur if the 
opposition wins 
we call attention to the possibility that the day of the 
plebiscite and facing the imminence of its defeat the government 
will try to create a situation that makes the vote invalid said 
the statement read by aylwin president of the centrist christian 
democratic party at a news conference 
on tuesday the navy commander adm jose merino warned chilean 
leftists that they are going to hurt a lot if they take to the 
streets the night of the referendum which he described as a battle 
between god and satan 
the government maintains that an opposition victory in the 
referendum would mean communist rule despite the fact that many 
moderate groups oppose pinochet

etiquetteconscious japanese are unnerved over what 
to say how to act and even what to drink in the face of their 
emperors illness 
their unease has produced everything from a forgivable slip of 
the tongue in a prime minister to a jawlowering newspaper 
editorial expressing grief over emperor hirohitos death 
with the many social changes in the 62 years of hirohitos 
reign the japanese just dont seem to know how to deal properly 
with his illness much less his eventual death 
the asahi shimbun japans secondlargest newspaper said nissan 
motor corp had canceled a television commercial with the catch 
phrase is everybody in good spirits while a tokyo car 
dealership had taken down posters extolling the joy of living 
for highranking politicians overseas sojourns have been 
canceled or postponed and even trips away from tokyo have been 
avoided 
television stations have toned down boisterous programming 
marriage ceremonies have been put off and sales put on hold at 
department stores 
however cabinet secretary keizo obuchi told reporters today 
that the emperor would be disappointed at a rash of cancellations 
of sports events and autumn festivals 
i think the peoples consideration for the emperors early 
recovery is so precious obuchi said but its not favorable if 
it has a negative effect on social and economic activities it 
would disappoint the emperor who always considers the people 
the 87yearold emperor took to bed sept 19 after he vomited 
blood from intestinal hemorrhaging 
at first domestic news media confined themselves mainly to 
reporting the details of his medical condition however reports 
have now begun to percolate through the taut silence that the 
emperor the longestreigning monarch alive may have cancer 
itself a taboo subject in japan 
news organizations have tried to walk a tightrope demonstrating 
proper deference to the ailing monarch but saying enough to show 
their concern 
even leaders schooled in public life have faltered in the 
confusion 
during a meeting with reporters following his first trip to the 
imperial palace since the emperor fell ill prime minister noboru 
takeshita was clearly unnerved one news report said 
in response to a reporters question takeshita committed the 
social gaffe of using honorifics in reference to himself the 
weekly shukan asahi magazine reported 
honorifics part of the japanese vocabulary used when speaking 
or referring to people of higher status have been prominent in 
newspaper headlines describing the emperors condition 
though forgivable the breach of etiquette underscored 
takeshitas and the nations discomfort over the emperors 
condition 
on monday the englishlanguage mainichi daily news accidentally 
published an editorial expressing grief over the emperors death 
the scandalous mistake ended in dismissal of the papers general 
manager and demotion of the editor in chief of the whole mainichi 
group of publications 
some embarrassments have been avoided in keeping with the 
restrained national mood no alcohol was served at a fundraising 
party wednesday night for a junior member of parliament the 
masscirculation yomiuri shimbun newspaper reported today 
the japanese have also toiled and puzzled over contingency 
plans for the emperors death a news report even quoted a manager 
of one restaurant franchise as saying tiny japanese flags used as 
decorations for childrens lunches would be removed 
they would be removed because they are flags that cant be 
flown at halfstaff the manager reportedly said 
a nationwide association of outdoor advertisers including 
businesses which produce or regulate the use of neon signs 
recently held an emergency meeting to set guidelines according to 
the weekly magazine aera 
they decided that when the emperor dies all large neon signs 
should be turned off until the fourth night afterward 
it would be terrible if only your shop would stand out said 
one industry source quoted by the nationally circulated 
newsmagazine 
not everyone however has fretted over doing the wrong thing 
the akahata newspaper of the japan communist party criticized 
the subdued national mood by publishing comments from readers 
angered by changes in television schedules 
i was really mad a 27yearold housewife was quoted as 
telling the newspaper my 6 and 7yearold children started 
crying in front of the tv set after waiting for a cartoon show to 
begin

the 100 million satellite to be 
deployed today from shuttle discovery will nearly double the time 
ground controllers can talk to astronauts as they orbit earth 
aside from proving shuttles can fly again deploying the 
tracking and data relay satellite is discoverys main mission one 
is already in orbit but a nearly identical one was destroyed in 
the challenger explosion jan 28 1986 
the satellite once it reaches it final orbit of 22300 miles 
will help ground controllers monitor shuttles and unmanned 
spacecraft coverage provided by the satellite is more continuous 
than the space agencys worldwide network of groundbased 
communications tracking systems 
deploying the satellite is important to nasa because the one in 
orbit has had minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent 
capacity said jim elliott a spokesman at the agencys goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md that satellite can monitor 
shuttles about 45 percent of each orbit 
a satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft or 
another satellite and a ground terminal at white sands missile 
range nm which then routes it to the appropriate nasa facility 
the deployment is scheduled to begin about six hours after 
liftoff although there were five later times it could be done if 
needed 
a springloaded ejection device first pushes the satellite and 
an inertial upper stage booster rocket from discoverys cargo bay 
and the satellite waltzes away at 27 mph 
about an hour later the rockets first stage fires the second 
stage ignites 12 hours after launch and puts the satellite in its 
final orbit 
the satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about 
45000 pounds making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard 
a shuttle national aeronautics and space administration officials 
said the satellite itself weighs about 5000 pounds and it has two 
50pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas 
the satellite will be placed in orbit over the pacific ocean 
near the gilbert islands its orbit keeps it always hovering over 
the same part of the earth 
on tuesday nasa had a brief scare when a booster rocket being 
readied for a shuttle flight next february was found to have a 
damaged seal 
there was concern that the booster rocket aboard discovery might 
have the same flaw but engineers worked overnight and determined 
from tests that even with such a defect the seal would perform 
properly

republican dan quayle was turning to debate 
preparations today after a campaign swing intended to end doubts 
about how much support he had from george bush 
from the moment bush gave quayle words of praise and a 
reassuring fatherly pat at a jackson tenn rally on monday the 
process of establishing quayles campaign credentials was under way 
the 41yearold indiana senator debates his democratic 
counterpart and senate colleague lloyd bentsen wednesday in 
omaha neb 
top bush strategists stalked reporters on quayles campaign 
plane as the indiana senator made his first foray into texas the 
state where bentsen was born and bush had made his home 
their message quayle has bushs confidence despite 
controversies over his past military service academic record and 
personal life not to mention polls showing many voters have doubts 
about his qualifications they claimed quayle is doing all a vice 
presidential candidate could to help out the ticket 
rich bond bushs deputy campaign manager and political 
director said that with the completion wednesday of quayles texas 
swing quayle has campaigned in 35 states nine of them targeted by 
the campaign as important swing states 
quayles role has been to campaign in safe republican areas 
hold the partys base for november and get good local media 
coverage 
remember the perspective of what a vice presidential nominee 
traditionally does hold your base and help out target states 
bond said 
in the texas cities quayle visited this week he got frontpage 
headlines and often color photographs 
although there have been reports that bush has tried to distance 
himself from quayle because of the negative publicity surrounding 
him aides said that was not a factor in mondays joint appearance 
being the tickets first since aug 20 
presidential and vice presidential candidates dont spend a 
lot of time together on the road bond said that is no 
reflection on dan quayles standing with us 
quayles mission in texas with its 29 electoral votes was to 
raise money and go after dukakis bentsen was largely ignored in 
fact quayle never mentioned him publicly by name 
quayle continued the gop strategy of portraying dukakis as an 
unrepentant liberal out of touch with mainstream views 
on tuesday he called on dukakis to resign his membership in the 
american civil liberties union on wednesday he blasted dukakis 
for being on the advisory board of a group which advocated deep 
defense cuts and which has among its supporters the extreme left 
wing of the democratic party the highly partisan crowds jeered

saying i am not a liar and i am not 
crazy a black teenager who claims she was abducted and raped by 
whites rejected the reported conclusion of a grand jury that she 
fabricated her harrowing tale 
i have not deceived my advisers my family and most of all my 
people tawana brawley said at a news conference wednesday in her 
first public comment on the case which sparked allegations of a 
racially motivated coverup 
after she read her statement miss brawley 16 declined to 
answer questions about novembers incident 
i am not a liar and i am not crazy i just want justice and i 
then want to be left alone said miss brawley who recently moved 
with her mother and her mothers boyfriend from wappingers falls 
ny to virginia beach va 
poised as she gave the fiveminute statement her voice only 
began to quaver toward the end 
i will give full testimony to an impartial grand jury an 
impartial grand jury or a congressional committee said miss 
brawley who so far has refused to testify 
i wish to thank god for saving my life she said of the 
incident he holds my hand and he let me live to stop the 
coverup once and for all 
earlier wednesday her advisers the rev al sharpton and 
lawyers alton maddox and c vernon mason asserted that new york 
state attorney general robert abrams and new york gov mario cuomo 
had illegally leaked the grand jury findings to the new york times 
which published the panels conclusions tuesday 
during an interview on wlib a blackoriented radio station in 
new york city sharpton said the three black activists would lead a 
protest in brooklyn this afternoon to make the whole city stand 
still 
at the news conference sharpton challenged the grand jury and 
the times to give us one name of one witness that can establish 
that this was a hoax 
mason challenged abrams and us attorney rudolph giuliani of 
new york to debate the racist system 
in a statement giuliani said these people have proven by 
their irresponsible words and actions that they cannot be taken 
seriously it would be inappropriate to dignify anything they say 
with a response 
timothy gilles a spokesman for the attorney general said 
abrams did not leak the grand jury materials to the times and he 
has asked the states special corruption prosecutor joe hynes to 
investigate who did 
gilles said he could not comment on when the panels report 
would be released 
miss brawleys mother glenda and boyfriend ralph king were at 
the news conference but did not speak 
had she returned to new york mrs brawley faced 30 days in jail 
for defying a subpoena to testify in the grand jury investigation 
of her daughters claims 
according to the times the grand jury speculated that miss 
brawley fabricated the tale because she feared king would punish 
her for staying out late and that drugs and her relationships with 
shady characters may have played a role 
the grand jury which has been directed by abrams the special 
prosecutor in the case will issue no indictments the times 
reported the panel is not permitted to criticize ordinary citizens 
it does not indict 
miss brawley was found nov 28 inside a garbage bag near an 
apartment her family once occupied in wappingers falls she was 
smeared with dog feces seemingly dazed and with racial slurs 
scrawled on her body 
evidence led the grand jury to conclude she was not abducted 
nov 24 as she claimed but stayed at least part of the time in the 
vacant apartment

the story of paul robeson may be too large too 
full of life to fit comfortably on stage but playwright phillip 
hayes dean shoehorns most of the biographical facts into his drama 
about the famous black athlete actor singer and political 
activist 
dean supplies the facts and actor avery brooks best known as 
hawk on tvs spenser for hire supplies the spirit for paul 
robeson which opened wednesday at broadways golden theater 
brooks is an impressive performer a fine singer as well as a 
compelling actor he needs both skills for this marathon portrait 
that has him on stage for more than 2 hours 
robesons life is told simply and straightforwardly by the actor 
himself dean sets out the story as if he were presenting a resume 
fortunately there are enough interesting events even in robesons 
early life to make it palatable 
the play details the college career at rutgers university where 
in addition to being named phi beta kappa robeson was a member of 
the glee club debating team and an extraordinary football player 
he ended up being named an allamerican in 1917 and 1918 
it follows robeson to columbia university where he got a law 
degree and to wall street where at the urging of his wife 
eslanda he had a brief unhappy career as a lawyer it traces his 
theatrical career from a ymca amateur outing where eugene oneill 
happened to be in the audience to his london triumph singing ol 
man river in show boat 
the play is at its best when it has robeson explaining how he 
had to fight the system to survive whether trying to join the glee 
club or playing football or struggling with a racist judicial 
system robeson exuded a confidence and exuberance that radiates 
across the footlights 
brooks captures that exuberance in such a way that these 
personal struggles become moving minidramas sprinkled throughout 
the evening the portrait blurs as robeson becomes more political 
trying to explain his backing for various causes from the loyalist 
soldiers during the spanish civil war to the communist workers in 
the soviet union the earnestness of the message clouds some of the 
drama 
its tempting to call paul robeson a oneman show but it 
isnt brooks gets more than able assistance from ernie scott who 
plays the piano and provides musical interludes that spell the lead 
actor from time to time scott also plays several characters in the 
show including an inquisitor from the house committee on 
unamerican activities 
but the play rests on brooks and the actor has enough stamina 
and style to carry off the evening he manages to be convincing 
making you believe in the man behind the mountain of facts and 
swirl of events that dean has put up on stage 
in another review 
jerry tallmer of the new york post said you would hardly know 
that this avery brooks this fellow who uses every conceivable stop 
and soft and strong pedal on his own personal organ to put himself 
under robesons skin is the taciturn hawk of tvs spenser for 
hire he is perhaps less grave of less inner stature than i 
think robeson was with more of a sense of humor but the final 
words of the evening othellos words and robesons go for 
brooks too i have done the state some service and they knowt

a moderately strong earthquake hit the tokyo region 
today but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries 
the quake struck at 517 pm registering 51 on the openended 
richter scale the central meteorological agency said 
the temblor occurred about 6 miles below southern saitama the 
agency said 
a national police agency official said no damage or casualties 
had been reported 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its 
epicenter according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area and 5 considerable damage a 7 reading is

highspeed magneticlevitation transportation 
systems whose cars would appear to float on air could be installed 
along interstate highway routes cutting pollution and saving 
millions of barrels of oil a year scientists say 
much of the system is very straight and contains adequate 
space for both the existing highways and for vehicle guideways 
suitably isolated for mutual safety gordon danby a senior 
physicist at brookhaven national laboratory told a congressional 
panel wednesday this interstate approach overcomes the greatest 
cost and availability impediment obtaining guideway real estate 
guideways are the magnetic tracks along which 
magneticlevitation cars run the system works on the simple 
principle that like magnetic poles repel each other cars glide 
along propelled by a traveling magnetic field 
danby and james r powell a nuclear engineer at brookhaven 
have agreed to head an advisory group that will study the 
application of magneticlevitation transportation to the interstate 
highway system 
sen daniel p moynihan dny chairman of the environment 
subcommittee on water resources transportation and infrastructure 
said the advisory panel is slated to complete its work by february 
1989 and that he will present its findings to the next president 
powell testified that if a maglev train running along the 
long island expressway carried 150000 passengers a day it could 
save 8 million barrels of oil a year while cutting air pollution 
and saving wear on family cars 
if maglev were to be applied on a nationwide basis its total 
benefits would be hundreds of times greater than sketched for the 
long island application he said 
danby also predicted that while maglev transport will not 
replace the automobile or truck it has a definite edge over 
conventional trains 
the maglev system is much faster and more energyefficient 
providing potential for mobility much greater than previously 
known he said long trips in short time can become routine 
but danby warned against buying existing maglev systems from 
the japanese and germans who quickly took to the americaninvented 
concept and made it reality 
the existing maglev systems are first embodiments he said 
in the future these will appear as dated as early automobiles or 
airplanes 
he said the advisory panel will consider ways in which a us 
system could be financed 
options involving partnerships between public and private 
sectors appear particularly interesting he said

using a technique to make millions of copies of 
a tiny bit of genetic material scientists have performed genetic 
analysis on individual sperm and single body cells says a report 
published today 
sperm analysis should help the search for diseasecausing genes 
while singlecell studies might allow diagnosis of genetic diseases 
in an embryo soon after testtube fertilization researchers said 
the early diagnosis would allow a decision on whether to implant 
the embryo in the mother researcher norman arnheim of the 
university of southern california in los angeles said wednesday in 
a telephone interview 
sperm analysis should also help police implicate or exclude rape 
suspects he said 
arnheim and graduate student honghua li report the work with 
other scientists at the university and cetus corp in emeryville 
calif in todays issue of the british journal nature 
they used a technique called polymerase chain reaction that 
creates millions of copies of a minute amount of genetic material 
accumulating enough for genetic analysis 
in one series of experiments they were able to detect which of 
two variants of a gene was present in 43 of 80 sperm analyzed in 
another series they were able to identify variants in two genes 
simultaneously in 70 of 114 sperm analyzed 
such analysis should help scientists find diseasecausing genes 
arnheim said 
genes lie along stringlike structures called chromosomes to 
find particular genes scientists use markers which are bits of 
genetic material at known locations along the same chromosome as 
the gene they are seeking they close in on the gene by discovering 
closer and closer markers 
when scientists have to determine the order in which markers lie 
along a chromosome they must study chromosomes from many members 
of a family but sperm from an individual can provide a far larger 
number of appropriate chromosomes for analysis letting scientists 
find the order of very closely spaced markers arnheim said

a former aide to sen howard metzenbaum has 
been indicted on charges of accepting bribes from two polish 
immigrants but the senator who faces reelection in november 
questioned the indictments timing 
us attorney patrick mclaughlin said wednesday that ladd 
anthony of cleveland was indicted by a special federal grand jury 
for agreeing to accept 2000 from waclaw pietrzykowsky for helping 
him get a friend admitted to the ohio state university college of 
veterinary medicine 
the indictment also alleges anthony accepted 300 to assist 
irena boc obtain us citizenship 
why did the justice department wait until six weeks before the 
election to indict asked peter harris an administrative aide 
to the ohio democrat 
metzenbaum whose reelection is being challenged by clevelands 
republican mayor george voinovich said he told the justice 
department of the allegations against his aide almost two years ago 
i asked the justice department to investiate mr anthony 22 
months ago in november of 1986 immediately after learning from a 
constituent that anthony might have acted improperly metzenbaum 
said 
the fbi informed me that they completed their investigation of 
mr anthony in november of 1987 why has it taken the justice 
department almost a year to seek the indictment is a question that 
remains to be answered 
marshall l sullivan a spokesman for the cleveland fbi office 
said the timing of the prosecution was up to the criminal division 
of the justice department 
the fbi expeditiously went about their investigation 
sullivan said the us attorneys office and the criminal 
division of the justice department its their responsibility to 
proceed when they decide 
a justice department spokesman could not be reached for comment 
wednesday night 
harris said he completed interviews with constituents on nov 
20 1986 that indicated anthony may have accepted payments 
a woman from cleveland came in and told one of our case 
workers that anthony was one of a group of people who asked for 
money we found that two other people had similar stories harris 
said 
on july 19 1987 the justice department reported the evidence 
was credible enough to go to a grand jury and anthony was fired 
harris said 
elmer giuliani anthonys attorney said wednesday he had not 
received a copy of the indictment i have to assume my client is 
innocent giuliani said 
anthony is living in a cleveland suburb but giuliani declined to 
give his address the cleveland telephone directory does not 
contain a listing for him and he could not be reached for comment

protesters yelling antiolympic 
slogans hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police today as 
radical students vowed to disrupt the summer games if a student 
leader is not released 
about 1000 students clashed with police around korea university 
in the worst street clash in seoul since the games began sept 17 
the protest marked the second straight day of demonstrations 
calling for the release of student leader oh youngshik arrested 
by police last week 
waves of students pelted police with rocks and firebombs 
setting some troopers ablaze police tried to fend off the missiles 
with shields during the hourlong clash 
down with the dictators olympics and yankee go home 
radicals yelled as they charged lines of riot police blocking the 
streets with shields 
police martial arts squads with long batons charged the 
students beating and kicking some protesters but police were 
pushed back several times by counterattacking students 
some police and students were injured by firebombs and rocks 
but police had no casualty figures there were no reports of 
arrests 
the fighting was confined to the streets in front of the school 
in northeastern seoul about 15 miles from where the games are 
being held students from other seoul colleges took part 
firemen called in by police tried to douse exploding firebombs 
with hoses but students drove them off with more missiles 
police were hampered in the fighting because of a government ban 
on using tear gas during the olympics to try and preserve peace 
the police hurled stones and rocks but had no effective way of 
fighting back without tear gas 
police tried to avoid a clash staying in backstreets while the 
students blocked the main road and tore down part of the schools 
walls students attacked with firebombs as soon as police moved in 
radicals said they would disrupt the olympics including the 
mens marathon on sunday if police do not release oh the student 
leader was charged tuesday with violating national security laws 
for organizing antigovernment demonstrations 
authorities have beefed up security for olympic events in case 
of student demonstrations and say the radicals wont be able to 
disrupt any events 
radical leaders released a statement charging the government of 
popularly elected president roh taewoo is using the olympics to 
cement dictatorship 
students protesting against the government have staged 
antiolympic protests to demand the games be shared with communist 
north korea and to denounce the roh administration 
but just a handful of students have turned out for the mostly 
peaceful protests most south koreans want the games to be a major 
success and are critical of the radicals 
north korea is boycotting the olympics because its demand to 
cohost the games was rejected by the international olympic 
committee the committee said the games are awarded to a single 
city and could not be shared

court papers seeking to dismiss a drug indictment 
against panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega did not include 
references to vice president george bush or his presidential 
campaign as prosecutors had feared 
the 65page motion which characterizes the case against the 
panamanian general as a political ploy was unsealed wednesday 
after the us attorneys office found it contained none of the 
possible blackmail they believed noriega might use to bargain with 
the reagan administration 
my concern was that they would use it as some sort of 
political leverage but they didnt said richard gregorie chief 
deputy assistant us attorney i dont think there is anything 
in there that is shocking 
noriega had previously claimed he had information that could 
hurt the bush campaign 
instead the motion argues that the us government has no right 
to prosecute noriega as a de facto head of state with diplomatic 
immunity it also says he has been targeted for political reasons 
and that pretrial publicity will make it impossible to find an 
objective jury 
whatever information damaging to george bush that may exist 
that information was not going to be raised in our motion unless it 
was relevant to the case said noriegas attorney neal sonnett 
the 12count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in 
miami in february accused noriega of accepting 46 million in 
bribes from colombias violent medellin drug cartel a grand jury 
in tampa indicted noriega on three marijuana importation counts the 
next day 
the motion filed in miami and sealed on sept 14 claims the 
indictment was based upon impermissible considerations including 
political and foreign policy considerations 
sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by 
conservatives in the reagan administration to renegotiate the 
panama canal treaty which was signed by president carter and hands 
full control of the waterway to panama at the end of this century 
there were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty sonnett 
said we argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to 
a decision to attempt to get noriega out of power 
the document contains quotes from the news media made by reagan 
administration officials such as undersecretary of state elliot 
abrams that the defense says demonstrate the political nature of 
the case 
abrams for example is quoted as saying in may that the 
indictment drove noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining 
tool 
the defense calling the case against noriega indictment 
diplomacy notes that in march the reagan administration offered 
to guarantee it would not seek his extradition if he fled to spain 
and in may offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left 
panama 
there can be no doubt that general noriega has been 
singled out for prosecution for political reasons the attorneys 
said 
the defense motion also argues that noriega is the first head of 
state ever indicted in the united states for action taken within 
his own country 
although turks and caicos islands prime minister norman saunders 
was convicted in miami in 1985 on drug trafficking charges the 
defense notes that his activities took place here and the 
attorneys say the group of islands he led is not a sovereign nation 
but a british colony making saunders only a local elected official 
saunders served two years of an eightyear prison term

a quarrel over batteries for a portable 
radio led to the outback shooting deaths of a famed aboriginal bark 
painter and five members of his family police said today 
police said their prime suspect was the artists soninlaw 
whose wife was among the victims and that an extensive search by 
air and with aboriginal trackers was under way for him in remote 
arnhem land of the northern territory 
detective superintendent terry obrien of darwin police said 
several members of painter dick ngielus family survived the 
massacre and found help on tuesday 
they told police that ngielus soninlaw was angry because 
there were no batteries for the family radio he also had a fight 
with his wife cecelia over the sale of some bark pictures for 
160 arguing she should have given the money to her father and not 
spent it obrien said 
he said the sonlaw was aged 22 but did not identify him 
the family according to eyewitnesses was shot to death at 
close range with a 12gauge shotgun 
also killed was ngielus wife dolly and cecelias two sons 
aged two and four another man believed to be ngielus brother 
was also slain 
the australian national gallery in canberra owns two of ngielus 
bark paintings and said it would seek permission from his tribe to 
exhibit them it is taboo under aboriginal tribal law to mention 
the named of a deceased until 12 months after his death 
arts curator wally caruana said the gallery was seeking 
permission to display the two bark works one depicts two women and 
a man and the other two men on a python 
obrien said the family members trekked about 30 miles before 
they were found by geologists who had just arrived on a field trip

mouse cells given a gene that stymies a herpes 
virus resisted the spread of a herpes infection suggesting that 
gene transplants in people might help treat aids infections 
scientists said today 
the idea gained support from a nobel prizewinning researcher 
but a gene transplant expert says the strategy has failed to show 
promise so far in other experiments 
the new work done in test tubes was reported in todays issue 
of the british journal nature by scientists at the carnegie 
institution of washington 
although researchers would face major hurdles in developing the 
technique to fight aids its a very good thing for them to think 
about said study coauthor steven mcknight 
his experiments dealt with the herpes simplex virus type 1 
which causes cold sores and fever blisters in people researchers 
focused on a virus protein called vp16 which the virus needs to 
activate some of its genes and complete its reproductive cycle 
the virus makes the protein under instructions from a gene 
researchers isolated that gene and altered it so that it would give 
instructions for a defective form of the protein 
then they planted the gene into mouse cells in such a way that 
the cells and their progeny produced a defective form of vp16 the 
idea was that after the virus entered a cell and tried to 
reproduce the defective vp16 would elbow out the viruss own 
version that would block reproduction preventing any progeny from 
infecting more cells 
results showed that 24 hours after infection with the herpes 
virus a group of cells with the implanted gene had 40 times less 
virus than a group of normal infected cells did 
a similar approach might fight infection by the virus that 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome researchers wrote 
the procedure would involve removing bone marrow inserting the 
gene in the stem cells that produce the bodys blood cells and 
putting the altered cells back in the person mcknight said the 
gene may then be passed on to blood cells which are targets for 
the aids virus 
it is too early to know if such an approach would work mcknight 
said in a telephone interview among the questions it raises are 
how to design and insert the protective gene and whether the gene 
would make the blood cells perform abnormally 
in a nature editorial nobel laureate david baltimore said he 
believes the strategy has as good a chance as any other procedure 
of becoming a real aids therapy for infected people despite 
formidable obstacles in developing it 
with the new results it is realistic to try animal experiments 
and work with the aids virus wrote baltimore director of the 
whitehead institute for medical research in cambridge mass 
but in an interview gene transplant researcher w french 
anderson of the national institutes of health said other scientists 
are investigating gene transplants for aids and there isnt 
anything yet that could even be called promising 
anderson said scientists have not yet found a way to make 
transplanted genes perform well in animals in general nor have 
they learned to insert genes into brain cells which the aids virus 
also infects he said 
no gene transplant research involving aids has shown enough 
promise to try animal experiments anderson said

a federal jury convicted four people of smuggling 
exotic birds worth an estimated 250000 into the united states 
from cuba as some of the key evidence squawked for water in spanish 
agua a scarlet macaw cried as the jury deliberated 
wednesday 
a fifth defendant was acquitted on all charges but remains in 
custody in a separate cocaine case all those convicted face up to 
10 years in prison 
this isnt just a wildlife case this is a money case 
assistant us attorney daniel gelber said in closing arguments 
according to the information we have recieved the parrot carries 
a price tag of 3000 the macaw 2500 they were going to 
make a lot of money 
three defendants were convicted of two counts each of violating 
the lacey act which regulates the movement of endangered species 
and one count each of conspiring the fourth was convicted only on 
the violations 
the five were arrested on a boat off the florida keys in april 
six of the 243 confiscated birds including the macaw a cuban 
amazon parrot a pair of melodious finches and a mustached 
parakeet were brought into court as evidence 
although the birds were taken to the metro zoo in miami only 42 
of the 193 melodious finches survived two of the 48 parrots later 
died of a parasite infection 
the defendants claimed they were transporting the animals from 
miami to the keys when they had engine trouble and radioed the 
coast guard for help 
it is not my responsibility to prove where the birds came 
from said defense attorney ellis rubin its the governments 
responsibility and they have not done so 
rubin said he would appeal 
on tuesday two defendants who were free on bond in the bird 
case were arrested as they left the courtroom 
carlos fernandez 27 was indicted for unlawful possession of a 
machine gun and rigoberto cherta garcia 42 was accused of 
marijuana conspiracy both were convicted in the bird case 
wednesday 
the other convicted defendants were nancy lopez 50 and jose 
flores 24 
felix valdes 39 was acquitted

a clerical error marred a key calculation in a 
study suggesting that unseen cometlike objects are traveling near 
earths orbit says a scientist who admits i blew it 
but the objects may still exist said thomas donahue of the 
university of michigan at ann arbor 
donahue was one of three authors who published the study last 
december in the british journal nature 
they suggested the small objects called cometesimals may 
strike earth every 80 years and may be responsible for many 
craters on the moon 
the cometesimals ranging in diameter from a few yards to a few 
tens of yards may also be building blocks of ordinary comets the 
researchers wrote but the objects may not throw off much dust 
making them hard to spot from earth they said 
the work was based on what appeared to be a higher amount of 
hydrogen atoms between the orbital paths of earth and mars than 
could be attributed to known causes cometesimals were proposed as 
a possible source 
in todays issue of nature however university of arizona 
researchers said their reanalysis of the same data from the 
voyager 2 spacecraft showed no inexplicable excess of hydrogen 
atoms 
in a telephone interview donahue said the mistake in the 
original paper occurred because a student misread a number from a 
table of data that caused a crucial calculation to underestimate 
the amount of hydrogen that a theory predicts would be found in 
outer space 
the underestimate created the gap that was explained by the 
cometesimal proposal 
i dont even want to blame the student i should have 
checked donahue said i blew it thats all 
he said estimates of the expected concentration of hydrogen in 
outer space are not firm and that revised figures still leave some 
room for the existence of cometesimals observations by the galileo 
spacecraft which is scheduled to be launched next year should 
reveal whether they exist he said

an abortion pill able to safely end early 
pregnancies much like a pill recently approved for use in france 
and china has been successfully tested by dutch scientists 
the latest medicine called epostane worked in 84 percent of 
women who used it in the fifth through eighth weeks of pregnancy 
researchers reported today 
dr marinus j crooij and colleagues from elisabeth gasthuis in 
haarlem netherlands gave the drug to 50 women who were planning 
to have abortions they reported their results in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
we conclude that epostane taken orally is an effective and 
safe method for the noninvasive termination of undesired early 
pregnancy they wrote 
the researchers speculated that using epostane with ru 486 might 
be more effective than either alone 
tests showed ru 486 or mifepristone which was approved earlier 
this month for use in france and china was 95 percent effective 
neither drug is available in the united states where antiabortion 
activists have threatened to boycott products of any drug company 
that produces such a pill 
both drugs work by interferring with progesterone a hormone 
essential during the first weeks of pregnancy for the implantation 
of a fertilized egg on the uterine wall 
proponents of such pills consider them a simpler safer 
alternative to traditional abortions opponents including the 
roman catholic church say they are just another way to kill the 
unborn 
with the new pills there is no surgical act no anesthesia is 
needed and there is no risk of infection sterility or of 
perforating the uterus but ru 486 research has turned up 
hemorrhaging in a small percentage of users

reports that michael dukakis has scaled back 
expectations in the south and west have prompted his rivals 
campaign to claim the regions for george bush a dukakis aide 
dismissed this as a republican fantasy and said democrats have 
actually bolstered their staffing in the south 
top campaign aides to bush said the vice president has a lock on 
the south and the rocky mountain region leaving him free to 
compete with the democratic presidential nominee in a handful of 
key states 
bush campaign manager lee atwater and political director rich 
bond in a telephone news conference wednesday with boston 
reporters said they are delighted with comments by anonymous 
dukakis campaign officials who say they have scaled back 
expectations in those two regions 
but dukakis campaign spokesman mark gearan said it was a 
republican fantasy that we would pull out of the south 
lee has been saying this for some time hoping it would come 
true he said it will not we have more people working in the 
south today than this time last week 
gearan said recent polls have shown dukakis competitive with 
bush across the south 
dukakis aides have said privately in recent days they intend to 
compete vigorously in several key states while scaling back the 
campaign elsewhere 
its interesting to see a dukakis 50state strategy come to an 
abrupt halt atwater said 
the two bush strategists said the vice president is banking on a 
solid block of support across the south and rocky mountain states 
and will focus his campaign on nine key states new jersey 
pennsylvania michigan ohio illinois missouri texas washington 
and california 
bond said the states bush counts as solidly behind his campaign 
account for 200 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win on nov 8 
dukakis according to bond can count on only 170 electoral votes 
we need to win only two or three of those nine states while 
dukakis would have to win five to seven depending on whether 
california was among that group bond said so we can 
concentrate on fewer states bond said 
were going to be concentrating on california ohio michigan 
and states like that and we can feel that the southern and rocky 
mountain states are intact bond said 
conservative to centrist voters in the key states would disagree 
with dukakis opposition to the death penalty his past policy of 
furloughs for firstdegree murderers his membership in the 
american civil liberties union and his veto of a bill that would 
have required teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of 
allegiance atwater said 
a survey of campaign trips over the past two months published 
wednesday by the patriot ledger of quincy mass indicates that if 
appearances by the candidate are any indication neither bush nor 
dukakis is running a 50state campaign 
the survey listed 20 states that dukakis has not yet visited and 
26 states where bush has yet to make an appearance 
california and texas topped the travel lists of both candidates 
for obvious reasons california carries the most electoral votes 
with 47 while texas carries 29 dukakis has spent all or part of 
eight days in california since accepting the democratic nomination 
july 21 while bush has spent six days there those numbers were 
reversed in texas

the sounds of chain saws and combines 
are part of the country music as thousands of farmers journey to a 
1400acre stretch of northern illinois for an agricultural 
exposition billed as the worlds largest 
my fear was that they would be in a real down mood because of 
the drought and poor yields but they seem to be optimistic said 
don nichols one of the 340 commercial exhibitors at the event 
which wraps up tonight 
for nichols and other exhibitors the idea is to attract the 
attention of an estimated 200000 farmers from as near as indiana 
and iowa and as far as new york 
they do it with displays like balloons wagons stacked five 
high sculptors carving with chain saws and antique tractors 
were here to show them our products and hopefully write 
orders said nichols a salesman for j m schultz seed co 
as farmers stroll away from the 60acre midway they are 
surrounded by test plots with 400 varieties of corn and 260 
varieties of soybeans as well as information on herbicides new 
machinery and farming tips 
i come here to get ideas said lowell mccollough of bourbon 
ind who farms 276 acres and carried a plastic bag full of product 
brochures and microwave popcorn samples 
one insurance company offers a bingo game to entertain visitors 
while a university offers advice and testing on the impact of 
agricultural noise on farmers hearing 
some show visitors gathered to welcome vice president george 
bush when he visited the area wednesday while barkers from the 
food tents strolled the exhibit area soliciting customers 
if you eat at tent 5 itll keep you alive said alberta 
strasser of nearby creston wearing a redandwhite clown suit and 
a black hat with a yellow flower 
there is a lot of competition there are five food tents 
but business is tremendous she said 
at one of the exhibits frank bretthauer put on his goggles and 
guided his chain saw into the wood turning a rough log into a 
carved bear as a crowd gathered to watch 
the idea is to stop them as they walk by and the carving is 
the big crowdpleaser said bretthauer a chain saw salesman from 
tonganoxie kan its well worth being at this shows our sales 
in the state always go up 15 percent 
carving the wood is not as easy as some people think and 
cutting even a simple square can be tricky 
you start off to make a bear bretthauer said you cut the 
nose too short so you do a coyote my first carvings became 
firewood 
manager tom budd said the farm show began as a oneday event in 
1953 and expanded to a threeday show in 1960 it moves from 
illinois to indiana to iowa sponsored by prairie farmer magazine 
we wanted to bring advertisers and farmers together to see the 
latest advances in science and technology and see machinery 
operate under normal field conditions budd said the idea 
clicked 
the show is held on the land of five families who farm around 
this lee county community about 75 miles southwest of chicago 
at first we didnt know if we wanted to get involved said 
duane ackland one of the host farmers but it benefits the 
community and it makes you feel good to do something for the 
future

the countrys highest court 
today upheld the death sentence of a white man convicted of killing 
a black policeman and trying to make the slaying look like the work 
of black radicals 
henry burt 35 faces hanging unless president pw botha 
commutes the sentence no execution date was announced 
burt was convicted last year of beating sgt johannes ndimande 
into unconsciousness in june 1986 placing a gasolinesoaked tire 
around his neck and setting it on fire no clear motive was 
established in the trial 
that method of killing is called necklacing the government 
says scores of blacks were necklaced from 1984 through 1987 by 
black radicals who suspected them of collaborating with white 
authorities 
burt a former soldier who worked for the staterun nuclear 
development corp pleaded innocent at his trial though he said he 
gave the policeman a lift that night 
part of burts defense was that he attended a meeting before the 
killing at which white residents complained about rising black 
crime but the appeal court rejected that defense in todays ruling

president roh taewoo said today that 
the news media of south korea and the united states should show 
restraint and avoid reports that may provoke the sentiments of 
their people 
roh made the remarks after receiving a briefing on growing 
antius sentiment in south korea during the olympics now under 
way in seoul 
the news media of the two countries now should report in a way 
not to provoke the sentiments of each others people roh said 
during a visit to the main olympic press center 
the president commented on a raging controversy involving the 
nbc saying the american television networks reports of south 
korea were mostly affirmative 
even if the reports of nbc included something that hurt our 
selfesteem we should put up with it since most of the networks 
reorts were affimative he said 
nbc has been a target of south korean criticism because of its 
extensive coverage of south korean boxing officials assault on a 
new zealand referee after one of their olympic boxers lost a close 
decision last week 
the allegedly biased coverage of nbc and incidents involving 
american athletes including the arrests of two us gold medalist 
swimmers after a mask was taken from a hotel touched off a new 
wave of antiamerican sentiments 
prime minister lee hyunjae also took up the issue today and 
said we should not let onetime feelings damage the 
traditionally friendly relations between the united states and our 
nation 
governing and opposition politicians also expressed concern 
about rising antius and prosoviet sentiment in south korea and 
warned that the trend could hurt south koreas national interest 
south koreans enthusiastically backed the soviet union in its 
victorious semifinal basketball match with the united states on 
wednesday 
governing party officials said the soviet union which has no 
diplomtic relations with seoul appeared to have won the favor of 
the south korean people with extensive cultural programs even 
before the olympic games opened sept 17 
in an elaborate approach to south korea the soviet union sent 
to seoul the a bolshoi ballet contingent a philharmonic orchestra 
and two choir groups plus a sports photo exhibition

intervention

foreign exchange dealers said that despite the central bank 
intervention market sentiment still favored a higher dollar 
the deutsche bundesbank the west german central bank was 
rumored to have asked for dollar rates in the foreign exchange 
market early in the day but dealers said they dont expect an 
intervention as long as trading is calm 
a dealer at a us bank in frankfurt said the dollar was being 
supported by concern over the political trend in the soviet union 
where party leader mikhail gorbachev is facing a key test in a 
party meeting this week 
there is nothing coming out of the joint annual meeting of 
the international monetary fund and world bank in berlin so 
people are focusing a bit on these political events he said

the military government claims more than 
half the personnel at five ministries in rangoon have quit a 
prodemocracy general strike but a western diplomat said today 
that the workers only planned to pick up their paychecks 
a general strike that began aug 8 has become the most effective 
form of protest since gen saw maung staged a coup sept 18 and 
brutally suprressed the daily antigovernment street demonstrations 
the state apparatus was crippled because most civil servants 
left their posts and saw maung has ordered the employees back to 
work by monday 
but the national league for democracy the main opposition 
alliance seeking an end to 26 years of rule by a military 
autocracy has urged workers to remain on strike until democracy is 
won 
state radio said wednesday that attendance at the ministry of 
planning and finance was up to 74 percent 
other departments with more than half the workforce showing up 
were the ministries of health home and religious affairs culture 
and trade the broadcast said 
a lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up 
their paycheck said a western diplomat in bangkok thailand who 
noted that pay day comes at the end of the month in burma weve 
had reports of people sitting around drinking tea 
the diplomat added if the civil servants do not get paid that 
would be a very inflammatory thing 
prices for several basic commodities including rice and 
gasoline have skyrocketed during the recent antigovernment 
protest making it increasingly difficult for families to get by 
troops today drove away sidewalk hawkers in downtown rangoon who 
have been a major form of commerce since large markets closed after 
the coup no reason was given for the move and similar streetside 
shops still were seen in other areas of the capital 
residents meanwhile say about fifty truckloads of troops left 
rangoon on monday possibly to frontier areas where rebel groups 
reportedly are mounting offensives the government has reported 
fierce fighting with communist rebels in northeastern outposts 
soldiers had been brought to the capital from outlying regions 
to put down the antigovernment demonstrations 
diplomats say many unarmed civilians were shot to death sept 19 
by troops breaking up street protests the official death toll 
since the coup is about 350 although the national league for 
democracy says nearly 1000 were killed 
the league led by retired brigadier general aung gyi 
officially registered as a political party wednesday but did not 
say if it would participate in elections promised by saw maung 
no date has been set for the vote 
a second prodemocracy group made up of followers of onetime 
prime minister u nu also registered while a third opposition 
political party announced its formation 
the ruling burma socialist program party which had been the 
sole political party since 1962 earlier renamed itself the new 
unity party western analysts say saw maung is behind the group 
which has a wellestablished amply funded nationwide network

mayor tom bradleys plan to ease some of the 
nations worst traffic congestion and air pollution by putting the 
brakes on rushhour truck traffic triggered quick opposition from a 
state truckers organization 
the plan announced wednesday is intended to keep out up to 70 
percent of the heavyduty trucks that normally operate on city 
streets during peak travel hours 
no one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy 
bradley said the old saying if you got it a truck brought 
it still largely applies but there is no reason so many truck 
deliveries must be made during these peak rushhour travel times 
karen rasmussen spokeswoman for the california trucking 
association called bradleys plan unfortunate and suggested it 
would not have a significant impact on traffic 
a recent state department of transportation study found that 
large trucks make up only 44 percent of peakhour traffic in the 
morning and 28 percent in the evening said ms rasmussen whose 
group represents more than 2500 companies 
bradley who detailed the plan at a smoggy press conference 
surrounded by big rigs on the downtown sports arena parking lot 
said it has the support of major trucking companies the south 
coast air quality management district state department of 
transportation and the highway patrol 
under the proposal which must still be approved by the city 
council only 30 percent of large truck fleets could operate on 
city roadways from 6 am to 9 am and from 4 pm to 7 pm the 
ban does not apply to freeways although officials expect it to 
cause an indirect reduction there 
the 30 percent of the trucks weighing 29000 pounds or more that 
fleet owners decide to operate would have to pay up to 60 for a 
certificate stiff fines would be levied if a trucker operated 
without the certificate 
the fees would help fund a multiagency rapid deployment 
force that bradley said would be used to clear snarled roadways 
of brokendown vehicles 
the plan allows for casebycase exemptions which will likely 
cause the actual reduction to be about 50 percent analysts with 
the mayors office said 
no one is sure how many trucks operate in the los angeles area 
said bill bicker the mayors transportation policy adviser he 
estimated the number of heavy rigs at 300000 and said about 
100000 of those could receive peakhour exemptions under the plan 
the program is unique because there is no direct effort to 
restrict truck travel on freeways and highways bicker said such 
attempts in other cities have been blocked by federal judges who 
said they violate interstate commerce regulations 
dennis woerner manager of pathfinder trucking in los angeles 
which has a fleet of more than 20 large rigs predicted truckers 
will be able to adapt more readily than shippers and receivers 
trucking is a 24hour business the shippers and receivers 
will have to change their hours and youre looking at a lot of 
additional cost there he said

two suspected mafiosi were shot to death 
on the main street of a palermo suburb raising to 16 the number of 
people killed in gangland warfare in sicily this week police 
reported today 
the victims identified as giuseppe leone 63 and giuseppe 
agrusa 58 were killed in an ambush wednesday night in cinisi a 
town 12 miles outside this sicilian capital 
police said they were believed to be lowranking gang members 
others killed this week include an antimafia judge and his son 
and a mafia boss and his wife 
officials have said there appears to be a major war between 
rival mafia factions under way on the island and have described it 
as one the bloodiest gangland battles in recent years 
parliament is studying new measures to beef up the war on the 
mafia and the vatican called on the government to bring a halt to 
the killings 
evidently theres a war going on said states attorney 
domenico signorino who helped prosecute bontade in the mass trial 
of more than 400 mafia suspects that ended last december 
the wave of gangland killings comes at a time when officials in 
sicily have complained the government was easing up on its 
antimafia campaign 
an assassination monday of judge antonio saetta who presided 
over two major organized crime trials was seen as an effort to 
intimidate officials at future trials saetta sentenced two 
powerful crime bosses brothers michele and salvatore greco to 
life in prison

a 7yearold aids victim who is incontinent 
and mentally disabled will continue her schooling at home while an 
appellate panel decides whether to accept a plan allowing her to 
attend school in a glass booth 
an attorney for eliana martinez asked a threejudge panel 
wednesday to overturn a ruling by us district judge elizabeth 
kovachevich permitting eliana to attend a school for trainable 
mentally disabled children under those conditions 
hillsborough county school officials placed the girl in 
homebound instruction for fear she would transmit acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome to other children but rosa martinez won a 
twoyear legal battle in august to get her adoptive daughter into 
the classroom 
refusing to send her daughter to sit in a cage mrs 
martinez and her attorney steve hanlon turned to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals for an expedited hearing 
mrs martinez attended the session and later was joined by 
eliana on the courthouse steps 
eliana will not go into that glass enclosure mrs martinez 
vowed she would not be happy there i want her in a regular 
classroom with trainable mentally handicapped children just like 
her 
the judges gave no indication when they would rule 
hanlon told the appellate panel he wasnt opposed to classroom 
restrictions but he suggested instead a kidneyshaped table as a 
precaution to put distance between eliana and other children 
its a tough tough case said tom gonzalez an attorney for 
the school board adding there are no previous cases dealing with a 
retarded incontinent child with aids 
citing medical testimony from the trial hanlon said the risk of 
the girl transmitting the disease to classmates was a remote 
theoretical potential 
but the appeals judges said that testimony referred only to 
tears saliva and urine not to a condition of mouth sores and 
cracked lips called oral thrush that eliana has experienced the 
condition can result from aids 
judge robert s vance said children touch each others tongues 
and disabled children are known to bite each other open sores in 
the mouth could allow the transmission of blood he said to put a 
child in such a situation may be sentencing those children to 
death 
hanlon said elianas doctors found no evidence of blood in the 
mouth but eliana would be kept out of class if that occurred 
doctors believe eliana became infected from blood transfusions 
after her premature birth in puerto rico 
meanwhile in arcadia desoto county school board officials said 
the family of three aidsexposed brothers once barred from the 
classroom will receive less than 1 million to settle the familys 
lawsuit against the board 
the settlement with the family of ricky robert and randy ray 
does not require school officials to admit any negligence in the 
way the boys or their family were treated james westberry the 
school board chairman said wednesday westberry would not be more 
specific about the amount of the settlement 
details of the outofcourt settlement were expected to be 
released today after attorneys for both sides met with kovachevich 
in tampa 
clifford and louise rays suit sought unspecified damages it 
alleged that their sons civil rights were violated 
ricky 11 robert 10 and randy 8 have hemophilia doctors 
say the boys probably came in contact with the aids virus from 
infected bloodbased hemophilia medication

but when her career abruptly ended the child actress who played 
kitten became a drug addict unwed mother and prison inmate 
during her traumatic turbulent adolescence ms chapin became a 
hasbeen at 14 married at 16 and a heroin addict by her early 20s 
she spent three years in prison and bore two children out of 
wedlock 
but today she has found solace as a bornagain christian and a 
high school science teacher in the small central texas town of 
killeen 
in killeen of all places chapin laughs its neat im 
not their token actress my friends here love me for who i am now 
for what i do now not who i was 
kathy anderson or kitten to her tv father played by robert 
young in the 1950s comedy is now 43 
her oncebrown hair is strawberry blond her face angular and 
unfreckled her childhood chubbiness gone but when she breaks into 
her cheeksplitting grin and pealing laughter the young kathy 
anderson comes through loud and clear 
i tried a lot of philosophies before i found the peace id 
been looking for she said but when i did my life changed 
there was a boldness that i had not had before 
the third showbiz child of nonshowbiz parents she won her 
first part before her seventh birthday defeating 250 other girls 
to play the youngest offspring in father knows best 
ms chapin says the tv show cast almost was a family and when 
the series ended suddenly she was not prepared 
they never even said goodbye we left one friday night and got 
a letter that we were not to return to work it was total 
abandonment she said 
as a shortstatured babyfaced 14yearold type cast to 
millions as the allamerican little sister she found herself icily 
rejected by the tv and movie industry she said 
she attempted to return to school but it was a discipline for 
which she was unprepared she said 
i never went to school longer than a month and it was hard to 
acclimate to talk their lingo and try to fit in especially when 
youre a movie star and the kids think youre conceited ms 
chapin told the dallas times herald 
ms chapins mother was a creative classically trained pianist 
supportive of her daughters ambitions but at the same time ms 
chapin said her mother was a harddrinking housewife who subjected 
her children to debilitating verbal abuse she said her 
relationship with her father was even more turbulent 
to escape she said at the age of 16 she married a classmate 
she had known only 30 days during their marriage of only three 
years ms chapin said she suffered seven miscarriages and became 
addicted to heroin 
after seven years of heavy heroin abuse ms chapin was 
sentenced to prison for attempted forgery 
i floated in the real seedy side of life from 14 up to 26 
caught up in the freesex freedrugs freelove society 
after three years in the california institute for women ms 
chapin entered a drug treatment program 
during treatment chapin became engaged to another patient when 
she became pregnant with her son matt now 15 she decided to keep 
her child but end the relationship 
five years later ms chapin had a second child her daughter 
summer out of wedlock she said she did not believe a marriage to 
the childs father would last at that time ms chapin had a 
steady job with a brokerage firm was sober and drug free 
friends introduced her to christianity something she always had 
rejected she said because she believed christians were squares 
but she said the religious experience transformed her 
i had lived in fear in low selfesteem but as i allowed 
christ in all those things that had made me afraid and ashamed 
were softened and released and healed 
she has shared that message through numerous speaking and 
television appearances she also is working on an autobiography 
due out next spring titled father does know best 
in december ms chapin will marry killeen firefighter robert 
kelley 
a lot of people say that father knows best was too perfect 
that life isnt like that but it should be like that and it can 
be like that

by any standard except nasas you 
couldnt find a more beautiful day for going flying at the kennedy 
space center today the clouds were fleecy the temperature mild 
and visibility was forever the winds were benign 
and that was the problem too benign the computers aboard space 
shuttle discovery were configured with autumn conditions expecting 
winds aloft at about 40 knots 46 miles an hour at 20000 feet 
instead the readings were a springlike 1020 knots 
if the winds did not pick up at least a little nasa said it 
would scrub the launch attempt and try again another day 
if we were to fly through those the computers that steer the 
ship would overcompensate and cause a wobble said astronaut jon 
mcbride who piloted a mission four years ago this is a first 
he added ive never heard of a scrub because of mild winds 
in the prechallenger days officials might have given the 
goahead but this is a new more cautious regime 
the bottom line is that its a lot more safe than it was before 
the challenger nasa administrator james c fletcher said on

the world bank will increase its yearly loans 
nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the third world 
the organizations president said today 
barber b conable spoke in west berlin during the annual meeting 
of the bank and its sister organization the international monetary 
fund participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring 
ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations the meeting ends 
today 
leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the 
international banks which make development loans for insisting on 
repayment by third world nations 
about 1000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby wednesday 
and chanted imf murder meeting thousands of riot police held 
them back with plastic shields 
third world countries owe about 12 trillion to international 
and private lenders as well as governments 
conable predicted that the world bank will be lending 25 
billion dollars a year by 1992 to third world nations it now lends 
about 17 billion a year and the monetary fund provides about 8 
million more 
speaking at a news conference he said 5 billion will go to the 
poorest countries which are mainly in africa 
conable said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more 
financing with other donors he said japanese officials have told 
him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program 
contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments 
conable also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt 
problem faced by poor countries he said they cause losses twice as 
great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations 
speakers from the third world have protested repeatedly at the 
meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their 
exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money 
in an interview before his news conference conable said he 
believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases 
the financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that 
higher interest rates used by the united states and other 
industrial countries to cool inflation threaten the third world 
it would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for 
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises 
said giuliano amato italys treasury minister 
at wednesdays sessions participants seeking new ways to ease 
the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to 
third world countries 
every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors 6 
billion more a year said stanley fischer vice president and chief 
economist of the world bank 
the united states and other industrial countries view higher 
interest as a way of controlling price increases in the united 
states higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to 
meet the federal budget deficit 
third world countries pay more than 50 billion a year on loans 
subject to variable interest rates 
they complain that too much of their earnings go to pay 
interest leaving little to improve living standards in many of 
them especially in subsaharan africa peoples incomes have been 
declining for 20 years

a ussoviet clash over afghanistan 
remains unresolved but us officials do not expect it to slow the 
red armys withdrawal from the embattled country 
charging pakistan and indirectly the united states with 
violating the geneva accords aimed at ending the afghan war the 
soviet union on wednesday hinted it might suspend its pullout 
unless us aid to afghan guerrillas ends 
a senior soviet official said today neither the soviet union nor 
the afghan government would be at fault if the geneva agreement was 
reduced to a useless piece of paper ambassadoratlarge 
nicolai kozyrev made his comment to reporters in new dehli 
but a government spokesman in islamabad said pakistan is not 
worried as long as moscow meets its feb 15 deadline for a complete 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
it does not alarm us we expect that the soviet union will 
abide by its obligations said humayun khan secretary of state 
for foreign affairs 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze registered the soviet 
complaint at a meeting of the five permanant members of the 
security council chaired by secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
secretary of state george p shultz leveled a counterclaim that 
soviet and afghan bombing raids have violated pakistani airspace 
shultz urged that the dispute be explored by united nations 
observers who so far have not documented violations on either 
side said state department spokesman charles e redman 
shultz then escorted shevardnadze from the secretariat building 
and the soviet news agency tass said the soviet foreign minister 
later flew home for a highlevel communist party meeting 
the two appeared grim and did not respond to reporters 
questions 
but later redman said the soviets left the impression they 
would maintain their troop withdrawal schedule under a 
unmediated accord signed in geneva in april the soviets agreed 
to pull out all of their troops by february 
moscow sent more than 100000 troops into afghanistan since 
december 1979 to help prop up a marxist government that is fighting 
moslem guerrillas backed by the united states pakistan iran 
china and other countries 
a communique was released after the meeting of shultz 
shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of china britain and france 
that stressed the urgency for continuous talks to end the war 
between iran and iraq in the persian gulf 
while state department officials in washington said they 
expected the troop withdrawal to be completed by feb 15 as 
specified in the geneva accords a soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman hinted at a slowdown 
we want to be as good as our word is concerning the geneva 
accords said the spokesman gennady gerasimov but we expect 
the other side also to be as good as its word 
the soviet official accused pakistan of violations in supplying 
socalled freedom fighters with weapons and gerasimov 
broadened the complaint to include the united states 
i guess they come from the american militaryindustrial 
complex mainly he said the geneva accords say that pakistan 
must not try to overthrow the government of kabul if you encourage 
the socalled freedom fighters to use the missiles to kill innocent 
people in the afghan cities i think it is a violation in our 
eyes 
gerasimov said the security council was a good place to 
discuss fulfillment of the geneva accords the session attended 
also by sir geoffrey howe the british foreign secretary and 
foreign ministers roland dumas of france and qian qichen of china 
was arranged before shevardnadzes departure for moscow 
the soviet spokesman acknowledged a soviet pilot crossed the 
pakistan border several weeks ago but gerasimov stressed 
pakistans support for the rebels at war with the afghan government 
it is a grave situation and we must do something about it 
he said

hundreds of people today stoned the 
town hall blocked roads and clashed with riot police to protest 
the governments decision to allow a ship loaded with toxic waste 
to dock in this southern port 
most shops public offices and schools were closed following a 
general strike called by local trade unions 
it looks like a serious revolt said one police officer who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he said there were reports of 
injuries among police and demonstrators 
the incidents broke out shortly after the federal government 
ruled that the deep sea carrier should be allowed to dock at 
manfredonia along the adriatic coast the ship is carrying 2500 
tons of toxic waste and is expected to arrive at manfredonia in a 
few days 
the waste originally shipped by italian industrial companies to 
nigeria for disposal has been ordered returned to italy by 
nigerian authorities 
demonstrators shouting antigovernment slogans hurled stones at 
the town hall smashing windows and damaging parked cars 
protesters overturned police cars during scattered clashes with 
officers according to city officials 
demonstrators who are urging local authorities to defy the 
government decision and turn back the deep sea carrier also 
blocked several main roads touching off major traffic jams 
no italian port wants to accept the chemical wastes two 
freighters the karinb and khiam fea also are carrying waste and 
have been accompanying the deep sea carrier 
karinb has been moored off the tyrrhenian port of leghorn for 
10 days local authorities and residents dont want to unload it 
until the national government announces a plan for disposal of the 
waste elsewhere 
khiam fea is sailing toward the adriatic port of ravenna where 
protests have also taken place 
according to italian companies that shipped the waste through an 
agent nigeria had originally authorized dumping of it in koko but 
later reneged on the agreement

the states highest court has censured a judge for 
rudeness to a woman who sought court protection from her violent 
husband but allowed him to continue on the bench a decision 
criticized by the womans family 
somerville district judge paul a heffernan did grant a 
protection order but the woman pamela nigro dunn was later 
murdered by her husband 
the supreme judicial court on wednesday expressed its 
disapproval of heffernans discourtesy rudeness and sarcasm 
toward mrs dunn at a 1986 hearing the decision involves no fine 
or reduction in heffernans powers and essentially follows the 
recommendation more than a year ago of heffernans attorney 
the five justices dismissed allegations of a pattern of 
discourteousness by heffernan toward women they noted heffernan 
granted mrs dunn the protection she sought from her husband paul 
who had beaten her 
they also said heffernans rude behavior toward mrs dunn had 
nothing to do with her murder in august 1986 
carole nigro mrs dunns mother said the high court should 
have specifically barred heffernan from hearing domestic cases 
im not saying he was the cause of her murder but just the 
way he handles women in court is wrong she said 
the nigros initiated the case two years ago by charging that 
heffernan humiliated and belittled mrs dunn 
the high court recommended private censure of heffernan 
meaning in most cases that its ruling would never be made public 
but the court decided to publicize its decision because of the 
publicity the case has received 
heffernan 55 of boston did not return phone calls seeking 
comment his attorney thomas dwyer jr said the judge accepts the 
ruling 
in its decision the court proposed creation of a process by 
which a judges performance can be evaluated and improved 
confidentially 
dwyer said heffernan considered the matter closed he said 
heffernan had voluntarily withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and 
had no immediate plans to resume hearing them

there was more at stake than pride and adventure the 32month 
grounding of the shuttle fleet has set back the nations 
satellitedelivery system discoverys first order of business in 
space was release of a 100 million communications satellite 
the tracking and data relay satellite to be released six hours 
after liftoff is a twin of a craft lost with challenger 
this has been a long 2 years shuttle chief truly said of 
the months of remorse restructuring and rebuilding that followed 
the explosion that shook americas confidence in its space effort 
excitement built at the kennedy space center area as launch 
neared campers and recreation vehicles found viewing places along 
the indian river souvenir sellers set up shop police handled a 
series of predawn traffic jams and guesstimated the crowd at a 
rather modest quarterofamillion 
not since the first shuttle flight in 1981 has there been such 
interest in an american launch during the past 32 months 16 
soviet cosmonauts have traveled to space leaving the united states 
far behind in whatever remains of the space race 
hauck said in a prelaunch interview that he recognized the great 
significance of his mission 
we clearly cannot afford to lose another vehicle much less 
another crew he said i dont think the manned space program 
could withstand another challenger 
flying into space never will be risk free hauck said 
its a matter of reducing the risks to a minimum and balancing 
the risks that are involved with what we are trying to accomplish 
during the fourday orbital journey the astronauts planned to 
conduct 11 science and technology experiments and to test design 
changes to the shuttle 
hauck said they planned a special memorial in space for 
challengers five man two woman crew the nature of the memorial 
would be revealed during a news conference the astronauts were to 
hold in orbit on the missions third day he said 
if we ever forget what happened to challenger its going to 
be a sad day because we might become complacent once again 
hilmers said 
covey reported the flight will be less complicated than most 
previous missions because nasa has elected to take a conservative 
approach 
in all 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been 
made to the shuttle the program to redesign all three remaining 
shuttles cost 24 billion 
the effort focused on the two solid fuel booster rockets that 
help thrust the shuttle into space flame escaped through a faulty 
joint in challengers right booster and touched off the explosion 
a cold temperature of 38 degrees at launch time contributed to 
the accident by stiffening oring seals preventing them from 
sealing the joint some engineers had argued with lowerlevel 
managers against launching in the cold but their concerns were not 
relayed to those making the launch decision 
that prompted significant changes in the way nasa and contractor 
managers communicate with their workers and led to creation of the 
countdown oversight team headed by robert crippen 
under the new system crippen said the lines of 
communications are open to anyone anywhere in the system 
among the changes to the orbiter was the addition of an 
emergency escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a 
12foot aluminum and steel telescoping pole in case of a problem 
during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in stable gliding 
flight the astronauts could slide down the pole clearing the 
wings and parachute to safety the system would not be of use in a 
challengertype accident 
because of the escape system the astronauts were to wear the 
cumbersome pressure suits on liftoff and landing instead of the 
comfortable cotton flight suits worn on recent missions

workers held hostage by two gunmen at a 
newspaper eight months ago say they suffered no physical damage 
but their sense of security is gone forever 
i find myself constantly looking over my shoulder 
accounting clerk deborah adams testified wednesday i dont feel 
safe anywhere now 
she was one of 20 people held hostage at the robesonian in 
lumberton for up to 10 hours feb 1 by two indian activists 
demanding an investigation of drug trafficking racial 
discrimination and corruption in robeson county 
ive had nightmares said rita parker the newspapers 
classified ad manager who escaped from the newspaper building just 
as the incident was getting under way i found myself at work 
even months after that watching the front door every time it 
opened 
defendants eddie hatcher 31 and timothy jacobs 20 are 
charged with conspiracy hostage taking and weapons violations 
they have never denied taking over the newspaper but say they had 
no other choice because their lives were in danger they claim law 
enforcement officers were planning to kill them because of their 
charges 
but the presiding judge in the case wednesday disallowed 
testimony that the takeover was in effect an act of selfdefense 
the necessity defense is not available to private citizens 
who take vigilante action us district judge terrence boyle 
said the perpetrator of the harm has to be the object of the 
action you cannot randomly choose innocent persons to take 
action against 
in a telephone call to the associated press late wednesday 
night hatcher said boyle should be impeached calling his decision 
outright wicked behavior 
hatcher has not participated in the trial claiming his 
constitutional rights are being violated because his attorney of 
choice william kunstler is not present kunstler the prominent 
radical lawyer is involved in a new york case but boyle denied a 
request for another delay in the trial here until that trial winds 
up 
the workers who testified wednesday said they thought they would 
be killed when two men drew sawedoff shotguns from under their 
long coats and chained the doors 
i really thought wed had it said jo ann manns the 
receptionist who first saw the gunmen i thought they were going 
to get rough i didnt know if we were going to get out alive or 
not 
ms adams said hatcher angry and nervous almost to the point 
of being hysterical told his hostages that his life was in 
jeopardy 
he said he could not get anyone to listen to him he said 
sheriff hubert stone had a contract out on him and he needed to 
talk to the governor she said 
bob warren an attorney for jacobs told the jurors the defense 
would show how cocaine had corrupted law enforcement in the 
county how poor people without jobs were offered quick money to 
sell cocaine under the protection of law enforcement

a decision by the citys human rights commission 
to force a dental clinic to pay 47000 to two men it refused to 
treat was a victory for those battling aids discrimination 
officials say 
it is difficult to measure the kind of misery and suffering 
that others inflict on people with aids mayor edward i koch 
said there is no way to adequately describe the pain and 
humiliation which discrimination adds to the disease 
commission chairman john e brandon said the commission found 
wednesday that northern dispensary a greenwich village clinic 
violated the citys human rights law when it refused treatment to 
two longtime patients one has aids and the other has tested 
positive for the aids antibody 
this case is an important step forward in preserving the 
rights and dignity of all people he said 
the commission also ordered the health facility to post a notice 
that it does not discriminate against disabled persons including 
those with aids or hiv the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
a message for comment left at the clinic was not returned 
one of the patients george whitmore a freelance writer said 
he had told a dentist at the dispensary in 1986 to be careful not 
to cut his gums while cleaning his teeth because when the immune 
system is low it takes a long time to heal 
he said it was then that he told the dentist he had aids 
he continued to clean my teeth then stopped talked to 
another dentist and the administrator came over and said it was not 
their policy to treat people with aids he said 
i was very angry he said i was really outraged 
brandon said with infection control techniques already in place 
at the dispensary the men posed no threat of contagion to dentists 
he said northern dispensary claimed it was justified in refusing 
to treat the patients for legitimate medical and financial reasons 
and thereby did not engage in discriminatory conduct 
aids is spread through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring

bentsen told the students that democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis was committed to the shuttle program and to a 
permanently manned us space station dukakis has promised to 
revive a cabinetlevel space council and put bentsen in charge of 
it 
when mike dukakis and i are elected president and vice 
president of the united states we will make sure that americas 
space program is first rate we will work to regain leadership in 
the race to new frontiers we will commit america to a program of 
exploration and adventure second to none bentsen said 
that program he said would depend on a new generation of 
scientists and explorers and he challenged the students to 
dedicate themselves to studying math and science 
machines can go into space but only men and women explore 
space probing for its secrets and reaching for the stars 
bentsen said 
from tennessee bentsen was heading home to texas where he was 
to join dukakis for a democratic party fundraiser 
at appearances wednesday night in nashville bentsen said that 
if the republicans win the election a george bush administration 
would endanger social security and provide inadequate ethical 
safeguards 
bentsen promised that he and dukakis would never no never 
turn our backs on kickbacks to defense contractors and 
consultants a reference to the pentagon procurement scandal now 
unraveling in the nations capital 
also as dukakis has recently bentsen said bush might tap the 
social security trust fund to help balance the federal budget 
deficit and recalled bushs 1985 vote against costofliving 
adjustments to social security recipients 
in social security in whom do you want to put your trust 
bentsen said at the second nashville fundraiser then turning a 
favorite bush line bentsen said my friends dont just read 
their lips watch what they do 
bentsen said dukakis had a proven record as a fiscal manager and 
challenged republicans on their use of the nickname 
taxachusetts to describe the massachusetts governors home 
state 
when they talk about taxachusetts ask them the date they 
called it taxachusetts bentsen said the nickname was pinned 
on the state in the 1970s when its tax burden was among the 
nations highest the tax burden now ranks 34th among the 50 states 
its the difference between an eightyear photo opportunity 
and a country on the move again bentsen said of the stakes of 
the november election 
dukakis campaign aides in tennessee said they have not done any 
recent polls but that they believe they are trailing bush by a few 
points 
former presidential candidate albert gore jr worked the 
fundraising crowd in an effort to whip up support for dukakis and 
bentsen urging his former supporters to work for the democratic 
ticket 
the tennessee senator said bentsen was prepared to step in as 
president while republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
was not americas values and americas future might well be at 
stake gore said 
that line of attack was similar to one used by bentsen earlier 
wednesday in missouri where he visited the birthplace of harry 
truman to promise an active vice presidency and question both 
quayles qualifications and bushs judgment in selecting the 
41yearold indiana senator 
if they were elected id pray for the good health of george 
bush every night bentsen said painting quayle as a member of 
the farright out of the mainstream of where the american people 
find their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations

democrat michael dukakis with actor 
and environmentalist robert redford at his side took aim today at 
the reagan administrations environmental record and promised a 
toxic waste site cleanup within eight years 
as for his republican opponent in the presidential race dukakis 
said calling george bush an environmentalist is like calling dan 
quayle a statesman 
in a speech prepared for delivery at rutgers university dukakis 
cited bushs role as chairman of the regulatory relief task force 
and blamed the vice president for blocking regulations to reduce 
lead in the air as well as a plan to control toxic wastes 
an active environmentalist and dukakis supporter redford joined 
the democratic nominee on the platform at rutgers 
dukakis received the endorsement of the league of conservation 
voters environmental action friends of the earth and clean water 
action 
mr bushs administration has had eight years to clean up 
toxic wastes said dukakis theyve started the cleanup on only 
137 sites on the national priorities list out of a total of 1200 
he said that in his administration cleanup will be completed 
or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1200 superfund 
sites on the national priorities list by december 1996 
companies responsible for pollution that want to help in the 
cleanup would get government assistance he said adding for the 
footdraggers and the chronic polluters i have just one message 
you better vote for mr bush because if im elected the game is 
over 
he also vowed to collect every dime we can of the more than 
700 million in cleanup costs that havent been paid by the 
polluters 
while blasting the republican administrations record on the 
environment dukakis remained defensive about the pollution in his 
own back yard 
let me say a word about my favorite harbor said dukakis he 
called boston harbor the oldest in america and said people 
started throwing things into it more than a century before the 
boston tea party and mr bush doesnt know what hes talking about 
because were cleaning up boston harbor and weve had to fight mr 
bush and the administration he belongs to every inch of the way 
on wednesday dukakis met with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze who denied he or his government tilted toward the 
republicans in the presidential race its up to the american 
people to elect a president he said thats the main thing 
after meeting with shevardnadze dukakis met with west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher they posed for pictures 
but did not discuss their conversation 
all the foreign officials were in new york for the opening of 
the current session of the united nations general assembly 
shevardnadze met friday with bush and the vice president was 
quick to point out it is a pleasure for me to see mr 
shevardnadze again we have met several times 
for his part the soviet official acted pleased to confirm 
bushs claim and then some 
this is not our first meeting he said he bush has been 
involved in all highlevel discussions here in washington and in 
our talks with the president 
for bush it was a nice political boost confirmation from the 
soviet officials that the vice president had been more than just an 
onlooker in administration discussions with the other superpower 
dukakis could make no comparable claim 
but shevardnadze did his best to give dukakis a measure of 
equality he described his discussion with the massachusetts 
governor as very interesting constructive and profound 
he had called his talk with bush a very interesting a very 
substantive and a very profound discussion 
the recent signing of an arms control treaty and the general 
signs of improvement in ussoviet relations left dukakis with 
little choice but to tip his hat to reagan 
i made it clear to the foreign minister that i was not here to 
negotiate or discuss specific proposals said the democratic 
presidential nominee we have one president and i support 
president reagans effort to move forward on these issues right up 
to the end of his term in office i intend to build on the work 
that president reagan has begun 
shevardnadze welcomed dukakis reference to continuity 
he spoke in support of continuity and consistency having in 
mind support for the recent positive trends in sovietamerican 
relations this is very important said the soviet foreign 
minister 
while dukakis was willing to give reagan credit for the warming 
in superpower relations he hammered away at the administration on 
ethics and the economy 
in a dukakis administration were not going to turn the white 
house into a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents he told 
a rally in greensburg pa 
dukakis said that on his first day as president he would sign an 
executive order barring top administration officials who leave his 
administration from lobbying government agencies for the duration 
of his administration current law prohibits them from lobbying 
their former agencies for one year after leaving officce 
dukakis also ridiculed bushs proposal for establishment of 
individual savings accounts a plan dukakis said would save middle 
class taxpayers 20 bucks a year 
at the same he said bushs plan to cut capital gains taxes 
would give the wealthiest americans a 30000 annual tax break 
george bush plays santa claus to the wealthy and ebenezer 
scrooge to the rest of us said dukakis

baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke taking his 
case for legalizing drug possession to congress said today that 
making illicit drugs available legally would help not hurt the 
united states 
schmoke told a house committee that the united states has tried 
vigorously for 75 years to rid itself of the what he described as 
the reality that drug prohibition increases crime without doing 
away with addiction 
nevertheless that reality remains as true today as ever he 
told the house select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
we have spent nearly 75 years and untold billions of dollars 
trying to square the circle and inevitably we have failed 
instead of a drug policy based primarily on law enforcement 
schmoke proposed a measured and carefully implemented program of 
drug decriminalization similar to the repeal of the 1920s 
prohibition on alcohol 
he conceded that there were risks in what he was suggesting 
providing legal access to currently illicit substances carries 
with it the chance although by no means the certainty that the 
number of people using and abusing drugs will increase 
but addiction for all of its attendant medical social and 
moral problems is but one evil associated with drugs moreover 
the criminalization of narcotics cocaine and marijuana has not 
solved the problem of their use 
opening the hearing the committee chairman rep charles b 
rangel dny who has opposed schmokes proposal said the united 
states now spends 140 billion a year on illicit drugs and absorbs 
another 100 billion a year in lost productivity and drugrelated 
crime 
i am not ready to spend more of the american peoples money on 
drugs and crime and property loss which is what would happen under 
legalization he said 
i am concerned about the impact of drugs on the future of this 
country rangel said but unlike some of those who have grown 
weary of this crisis i am in no way ready to give up and say that 
we have fought the fight and have lost the war on drugs 
the chance of congressional approval of drug legalization is nil 
mayors ed koch of new york city marion barry of the district of 
columbia dennis callahan of annapolis md and carrie saxon perry 
of hartford conn were among 32 other witnesses scheduled to 
testify at the hearing 
others on the agenda include john lawn administrator of the 
drug enforcement administration arthur c eads board chairman of 
the national district attorneys association and jerald vaughn 
executive director of the international association of chiefs of 
police 
rangel said he called the hearing to seek answers to such 
questions as 
what would the united states do about international treaties it 
has signed to stop the flow of drugs 
who is responsible if a doctor or pharmacist provides drugs 
which lead to an overdose 
how could legalization be squared with the nations antidrug 
education programs 
what would happen to health insurance rates 
what would be the impact on minority communities already 
ravaged by drug abuse

the soviet union called extraordinary meetings of 
its legislature and of the policymaking central committee and a 
source said today that a shakeup in the party hierarchy is likely 
in line with mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
the convening of the 300member central committee on friday and 
of the 1500member supreme soviet on saturday brought officials 
rushing back to the capital 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze arrived in moscow this 
afternoon after cutting short his visit to the united nations the 
official tass news agency announced defense minister dmitri t 
yazov ended a visit to india a day ahead of schedule 
the supreme soviet the nominal parliament usually convenes 
twice a year after meetings of the central committee it last 
convened may 2426 soviet media reported sunday that a regular 
session of the supreme soviet would begin oct 27 and the 
announcement of a special sitting at such short notice indicated 
urgent government business 
the central committee had been expected to meet by the end of 
october but the source said reform plans were proceeding faster 
than was expected 
the source who is a member of the central committee staff said 
the committee will approve reforms in the party and government 
structure outlined at a communist party conference in june the 
reforms are intended to enhance the partys status as the leading 
force in soviet society 
he added that its logical that personnel changes will 
follow any alterations in the organizations format 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
echoing an announcement by soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov in new york on wednesday the source said the 
meeting would take new steps in implementing political reform 
based on the decisions of the party conference 
meetings of the 300member central committee although rarely 
announced in advance are generally scheduled well ahead of time 
and do not require top officials to curtail other commitments 
at its last meeting on july 29 the central committee adopted a 
timetable for overhauling the soviet political system which also 
was discussed at the party conference 
the first deadline set was october by which time the central 
committee said a draft law on amendments to the soviet constitution 
and on multicandidate elections of legislators was to be complete 
in a speech friday gorbachev the soviet leader said the 
politburo soon would convene to review the draft law 
but comments by gerasimov and the central committee source put 
the focus on changes in the communist party structure gorbachev 
could be seeking to strengthen his hand in the central committee to 
push through the political reforms 
soviet sources said today there was no crisis in the 
leadership a wellplaced soviet journalist said he expected no 
sensation from the plenum 
soviet sources also reported speculation among highplaced 
officials about whether there would be changes on the politburo 
itself indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda 
the central committee is empowered to make personnel changes in 
the politburo 
the last full politburo member removed was geidar a aliev on 
oct 21 1987 aliev was a close protege of former president leonid 
i brezhnev who now is harshly criticized for permitting 
corruption and stagnation 
official soviet newspapers today carried nothing about the 
meeting but the tass news agency and englishlanguage broadcasts 
of official radio moscow reported that shevardnadze was curtailing 
his visit and returning home for the central committee meeting 
the conference of 5000 communist party officials held in moscow 
at the end of june and beginning of july approved plans to limit 
terms of communist party officials and a review of the entire 
20million party membership 
there also has been speculation that gorbachevs backers want to 
remove 60 60 to 70 dead souls from the central committee they 
are party leaders elected to the committee shortly after gorbachev 
took power in march 1985 but since then have lost the party or 
government jobs that entitled them to committee membership 
gorbachev has criticized the party apparatus for being too 
involved in the daytoday operation of the government and the 
economy and has argued that reforms must focus party work on 
establishing broad policies and theories 
personnel changes could give gorbachev and his backers a chance 
to move out conservative party bureaucrats that they see blocking 
the soviet leaders reforms 
in a speech in moscow on wednesday gorbachev once more called 
for radical changes in soviet society 
any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity 
of radical change it is needed in the party in the state in 
agriculture in industry in personnel policy and most of all in 
peoples mentality in their attitudes to work to one another and 
to themselves gorbachev said at a kremlin dinner honoring 
visiting east german leader erich honecker

a lawyer will ask a judge to decide how a 
blood sample will be taken from a 9yearold girl to help determine 
if she was switched with another as an infant in a hospital nursery 
marvin ellin a lawyer representing a pennsylvania couple who 
think the sarasota girl may be theirs said he wanted the 
sophisticated blood testing done by johns hopkins university 
technicians and the results made public two conditions rejected by 
the girls attorney 
he said he would file a court petition monday 
dale swope who represents the girls father said wednesday his 
client will seek genetic tests on his own under a cloak of 
secrecy 
in a statement he said if it produces unsettling results 
they will be kept confidential until our client has had a chance to 
explain this tragedy to his child then in time after she has 
adjusted to it we will disclose it to other interested parties 
the tests of blood samples identify genetic links between parent 
and child 
neither side has released the names of the father or girl 
involved 
regina and ernest twigg of langhorne pa have claimed in a 
100 million lawsuit that three doctors and a nurse at tiny hardee 
memorial hospital in wauchula switched their healthy baby girl with 
an infant that was suffering from a congenital heart defect 
the couple nursed the sick girl arlena twigg until she died 
recently tests taken before a heart operation at a new jersey 
hospital indicated arlenas blood type was different from theirs 
further sophisticated tests ruled out any biological relationship 
birth records on file with the state show only one white girl 
the sarasota child shared the nursery with the twigg baby

a man was charged in the killing of an 
upandcoming drug gang leader a slaying that sparked a rampage by 
up to 200 youths who flipped and burned cars and torched and looted 
a store authorities said 
several of the youths fired shots into the air but no one was 
injured or arrested in tuesday nights rampage police said 
the mayhem came in retaliation for late mondays killing of luis 
antonio ortiz 20 whom police commissioner willie williams 
described wednesday as an emerging drug gang leader authorities 
said the death came after a member of a rival gang was fatally 
injured on a motorcycle he had bought from ortiz 
wednesday morning andres albaladejo 33 surrendered and was 
charged with murder and weapons offenses in connection with ortizs 
death police said 
ortizs pickup truck was adorned wednesday with funeral wreaths 
and candles 
i was very upset that we still live in an era when the death 
of a drug dealer who peddles death a man who is accused of a 
homicide himself but not convicted was being made a hero in a 
neighborhood where drugs are taking more lives than perhaps 
anything else williams said at a news conference 
it indicates that we and the community have a lot of work to 
do to correct this 
williams said police would increase patrols in the poor hunting 
park neighborhood through the weekend 
wednesday night and this morning an uneasy calm rested over 
the neighborhood bennie swans the citys crisis intervention 
network director said today 
swans met with representatives of the two groups wednesday night 
ortizs ok corral gang and the rival gray tape gang he said he 
is confident that the community is continuing to place enough 
pressure on the two groups to cool out 
swans said a gray tape gang member richie colon 18 died 
monday from injuries suffered saturday when he crashed a motorcycle 
he had bought from ortiz swans wouldnt comment on published 
reports quoting unidentified neighborhood residents as saying the 
motorcycle had bad brakes 
the first signs of trouble came hours after ortizs death when 
youths looted and burned a grocery store owned by a brother of 
albaladejo williams said the department was investigating reports 
that police stayed away from the store even though they knew of the 
looting 
the trouble brewed through the early morning hours tuesday and 
firefighters were called to the store a second time when another 
fire was set williams said 
the melee broke out in full tuesday evening when about 20 or 30 
men flipped and set afire two cars that police have been told were 
owned by relatives of albaladejo 
about an hour later when an officer responded to an unfounded 
call about a burglary an empty beer bottle was thrown through the 
rear window of his cruiser williams said 
for five hours up to 200 people milled around the neighborhood 
some drinking some firing shots into the air williams said 
during the riot uniformed police pulled out and plainclothes 
negotiators went in to talk with community leaders and restored 
calm 
in january 1987 ortiz posted 100000 bail after being charged 
with murder williams said in march he was arrested for 
possession with intent to deliver drugs and freed on 3500 bail 
more than 60 people were killed in drugrelated violence this 
summer in philadelphia including a 5yearold boy whose death 
triggered a wave of antidrug protests

the last time lloyd bentsen and dan quayle 
debated on television it wasnt exactly a national media event 
but now the two are rival vice presidential candidates and their 
performances next week could influence this years presidential 
election 
even as argument continues over who won the debate between 
george bush and michael dukakis the two campaigns are priming 
their running mates for next wednesdays scrap in omaha neb 
theyre also trying to move public opinion to receive their 
candidates favorably 
quayle returned to washington on wednesday night to begin 
cramming for the 90minute battle bentsen planned to finish his 
latest campaign trip on friday in washington and then go to back 
to his native texas on sunday for final preparations 
theyre both reading briefing books reviewing video tapes 
huddling with top staff and getting tips on talking to the cameras 
although the two men disagree over many policies the main issue 
at stake in the debate is quayle who the democrats contend is not 
qualified to be next in line to the oval office 
dukakis has said the notion of president quayle is a very 
very troubling notion 
ill tell you if they were elected id pray for the good 
health of george bush every night bentsen said wednesday trying 
to persuade voters who are leaning toward bush that they cant risk 
quayle 
bush defends his choice saying in sundays debate i see a 
man who is young and im putting my confidence in a whole 
generation of people that are in their thirties and their forties 
republicans are more than happy to downplay quayles chances of 
surviving a debate with bentsen 
i dont think theres a lot of pressure on sen quayle because 
frankly a lot of people have gotten out there and gotten his 
expectations so low that i dont think they could be much lower 
said james baker bushs campaign chief 
well be ready for the debate quayle told reporters 
rich bond bushs deputy campaign manager and political 
director said he expects the candidates will not concentrate 
their fire at each other but at the top of the ticket 
quayle will probably ask bentsen to join him in debating 
dukakis because they have so much in common he said 
bentsen cant really debate quayle on the issues he has to 
defend quayles position because most of them are his own i think 
he will squirm said sheila tate bushs spokeswoman 
joseph oneill bentsens campaign director said quayles 
record will matter as the democrats try to show that our team is 
better than their team the dukakis campaign contends that 
bentsens differences with dukakis show that dukakis didnt want a 
clone for a running mate 
the low expectations for quayle have worried the dukakis 
campaign because if theyre too low quayle could win simply by 
surviving the debate without any major gaffes so alongside a 
continual knocking of quayle the democrats are trying to portray 
him as an able debater with years of practice in the senate 
privately bentsens aides say theyre worried bentsen 67 will 
look and sound old compared with the 41yearold quayle the 
republicans at least imply the same thing 
the contrast between quayle and bentsen is going to be 
great said tate quayle represents the new generation of 
leadership hes bright and engaging 
the bentsen campaign trying to refute the expectations 
imbalance points to the april 22 broadcast of public televisions 
macneillehrer newshour during which bentsen and quayle debated 
the issue of giving workers 60 days notice before a plant could be 
closed quayle eventually lost the battle on the senate floor but 
on television he presented his case attractively 
the bush campaign reviewed that videotape before picking quayle 
as bentsens adversary roger ailes the bush campaigns top media 
adviser watched that tape and will be coaching quayle 
bentsen traveled this week with his briefing books and with 
extra staff from the dukakis campaign carving out time from his 
schedule to watch tapes of quayle including his 1980 debates with 
sen birch bayh whom he defeated to first win election to the 
senate 
that work will be expanded on the weekend in washington and then 
in austin texas where bentsen will travel sunday and work until 
tuesday when he goes to omaha democratic rep dennis eckart of 
ohio plans to play quayle for bentsens preparation 
quayle is receiving issues briefings from republican staff of 
the senate and from gop experts such as labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin and former secretary of state henry kissinger 
in mock debates quayle is using sen bob packwood rore a 
longtime colleague of bentsens on the senate finance committee

united nations that allows it to play a growing role in global 
affairs and for reducing warfare 
there is great joy said timor goksel spokesman for the 
un interim force in lebanon the international community has 
finally given appropriate recognition to all the sacrifices our 
people have made he told the associated press in jerusalem in a 
telephone interview from naqoura lebanon

undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world 
committee chairman egil aarvik said president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev had been seriously considered for 
the prize 
he did not explain the committees decision but indicated the 
presidential election may have been a factor everything was 
taken into consideration he said 
nearly 10000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve 
under the un flag from the middle east to the indian 
subcontinent peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to iran 
and iraq under a ceasefire negotiated in the countries 
8yearlong war 
the decision was widely regarded as an indirect award to perez 
de cuellar who scored diplomatic breakthroughs this year in 
mediating the iraniraq ceasefire a soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan and progress in talks on southwest africa 
perez de cuellar was ineligible for this years prize because he 
was nominated after the feb 1 deadline 
aarvik told reporters he hoped the award would give the un 
and the forces increased prestige 
the image of the united nations has recently been enhanced by 
its role in the recent ceasefires and peace talks although it 
suffers financial problems however the united states has said it 
will pay 188 million of the money it owes the world body 
un peacekeepers radioed word of their shared victory to 
battalions in battlescarred lebanon and cracked open bottles of 
champagne in jerusalem to celebrate

afghanistan syria cyprus the subcontinent and iran and iraq for 
subduing tensions where armistices have substituted for peace 
the citation said the peacekeepers have played a significant 
role in reducing the level of conflict even though the fundamental 
causes of the struggles frequently remain 
un peacekeeping officials in finland which contributes more 
troops than any other country said they hoped the nobel peace 
prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially 
ailing forces 
the united nations is in arrears in payments to countries which 
provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces it owes finland 225 
million 
it was the fifth time that a unrelated body won the coveted 
prize since it was first awarded in 1901 from the estate of alfred 
nobel the inventor of dynamite 
it was the 16th time that an organization rather than a person 
was named the peace prize laureate 
aarvik said he expected perez de cuellar to come to oslo to 
accept the award at the annual ceremony on dec 10 the anniversary 
of nobels death in 1896 nobel built a fortune from his invention 
and marketing of explosives 
the first un troops were sent to monitor the armistice between 
israel and the arab states in 1948 today most un forces are 
stationed in the middle east 
the committee singled out the un interim forces in lebanon 
which has suffered more than 200 casualties since it was sent to

president reagan is pleased with the latest 
version of a pentagon budget bill similar to one he vetoed last 
month and plans to sign it quickly a white house spokesman said 
today 
marlin fitzwater told reporters the 300 billion defense 
authorization bill passed by congress restores the defense 
spending priorities requested by reagan in a message accompanying 
the presidents veto of an earlier version on aug 3 
defense secretary frank c carlucci earlier had given 
congressional figures assurances that reagan would sign the 
revamped authorization bill and sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee told his colleagues this 
bill will be signed 
the assurances were conveyed by carlucci during a week of 
closeddoor talks with nunn and other legislators according to 
nunn 
the president will approve this bill that was made very clear 
and definite said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee 
fitzwater said the bill eliminates the major objections to the 
original bill we consider this bill a significant victory for the 
presidents commitment to a strong defense 
the house voted 36948 approval of the revised measure wednesday 
afternoon three hours later the senate passed it 914 
overall the measure authorizes the pentagon to spend 300 
billion in the fiscal year beginning saturday the same total as 
was contained in the bill reagan vetoed aug 3 that represents a 
slight cut from this years 301 billion defense budget 
while the new measure contains the same reductions in reagans 
proposed star wars budget as the original legislation the earlier 
bills congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending 
in the star wars program were removed 
the strategic defense initiative as the star wars antimissile 
research program is formally known would receive 41 billion in 
the bill compared to the 48 billion sought by reagan and the 
39 billion authorized for this year 
the pentagon wanted to spend up to 330 million of the sdi money 
on a spacebased interceptor weapon the first stage of an early 
deployment sdi program the previous pentagon bill would have 
restricted that to only 85 million but the new measure removes 
that limit 
the new bill also removes a restriction on flight testing of 
depressed trajectory missiles which fly relatively low instead 
of into space as do other longrange atomic weapons the united 
states has none of the weapons under development and no plans for 
testing but the soviets are believed to be developing the weapons 
money to pay for the programs authorized in the bill is part of 
a separate pentagon appropriation bill 
the measures are the major unfinished items on the congressional 
agenda as legislators try to wind up their work and quit for the 
year 
the new pentagon bill also rewrote the complicated spending plan 
for the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles two weapons at the heart 
of a dispute over the future of americas landbased nuclear 
missile force 
the original bill proposed spending 250 million each for study 
of midgetman and a railroadbased version of the mx and provided 
another 250 million to be used for either program next year by the 
incoming president 
the new bill provides 250 million for midgetman and 600 
million for the mxonrails program but says no more than 250 
million of the mx money can be spent before feb 15 the remaining 
350 million could be reallocated by whomever wins the presidency 
nov 8 
the bill also includes a 41 percent pay raise for the nations 
21 million uniformed military personnel

not long after william schroeder died two 
years ago after spending 21 months with an artificial heart his 
wife wondered if a little plaque could be erected somewhere in the 
couples hometown 
the plaque could say something about the spirit of a man with an 
extraordinary will to live and a willingness to help others do the 
same 
later this fall margaret schroeder will get her wish and more 
on nov 13 she will help dedicate a 135foot high 4000pound 
stainlesssteel sculpture titled gateway to the heart 
i thought maybe someday thered be something but nothing like 
this its really overwhelming mrs schroeder said recently 
the memorial which almost has been completed by jasper sculptor 
bernard hagedorn will be unveiled at the new bill schroeder sports 
complex south of the jasper high school football stadium the 
complex includes softball and soccer fields 
hagedorm says his work is somewhat controversial but so was 
schroeders medical experiment 
it wouldnt be fitting to just have a bronze statue of bill 
schroeder hagedorn said 
what he found more fitting is a sculpture with an arch that 
represents not only the gateway to the sports complex but also the 
gateway to jasper hagedorn said the arch signifies schroeders 
triumph when he returned to his hometown for its annual 
strassenfest in august 1985 a year before his death 
this symbolizes what he did and what he accomplished rather 
than him as an individual said bob hedinger a former classmate 
of schroeders at jasper high but it all blends together 
schroeders classmates jasper highs class of 1950 reunited to 
visit schroeder while he was ill in a louisville ky hospital 
and to raise money to defray his medical costs 
they also have raised about 15000 for the memorial but more 
is needed for landscaping and other details 
schroeder who was 54 when he died lived longer than any other 
patient with an artifical heart 620 days 
his death on aug 6 1986 at humana hospitalaudubon in 
louisville was caused by a massive stroke one of many he suffered 
after receiving the jarvik7 heart on nov 23 1984 
theres a really wonderful love in this town mrs schroeder 
said 
wherever he is she said of her husband hes happy

republican george bush observed the 
successful launch of the space shuttle discovery today and told a 
campaign rally america is back in space 
the vice president had just completed a campaign speech when the 
shuttle was launched he returned to the platform to tell cheering 
supporters in a town square rally what a good day were back in 
space 
earlier bush sharpened his criticism of democrat michael 
dukakis tax enforcement proposals claiming a democratic victory 
in the fall would mean a government hand in every pocket and a 
tax agent in every home 
bush accused his rival of wanting to double the number of 
internal revenue service agents and told his audience im not 
for a program that would give the irs more power than it already 
has 
during a bus tour wednesday of rural illinois the vice 
president repeatedly accused dukakis of seeking to give the irs new 
and unwarranted powers 
no matter that the irs is part of the executive branch of 
government that bush has served for most of the past two decades 
the vice president on wednesday made the irs a prime new campaign 
target anyway 
the irs has many fine and dedicated individuals bush told a 
rally in ottawa ill even so it can be highhanded 
sometimes it seems to treat innocent people as if they were 
presumed guilty 
specifically bush criticized dukakiss proposals to beef up 
enforcement of tax collections and for a college loan program that 
would be paid back through income tax withholding 
in a day of relatively light campaigning bush was to attend 
rallies here and in two michigan cities today mount clemens and 
grand rapids 
bush accused dukakis in his enforcement plan of wanting to 
give the irs even more power than it already has to go after the 
people of america 
said bush he wants to squeeze another 35 billion bucks out 
of the taxpayers pocket and even if it were possible that would 
mean the irs would have to double the number of their employees to 
a total of over 200000 and that is the equivalent of 20 army 
divisions 
i do not want to create an auditor army of irs agents bush 
told the ottawa rally 
faced with that kind of threat the american people will need 
a conventional defense initiative to defend themselves against all 
these irs auditors 
the dukakis campaign countered that bush was overstating the 
number of irs agents under the democrats plan a statement said 
the plan calls for an average 6 percent annual growth in irs 
personnel not a 100 percent increase 
bush vowed that if elected he would resurrect a socalled 
taxpayer bill of rights previously advocated without success 
in congress by president reagan 
the proposed bill of rights would require the irs to inform 
taxpayers of what rights they have during audits among other 
features 
earlier in a speech to students at illinois state university at 
normal ill bush criticized a dukakis student loan plan that 
would call for repayment of the loan depending on an individuals 
later earning powers loan installments would be automatically 
added to tax withholding under the dukakis plan 
we do not need to put the irs on your tail for the rest of 
your life he said 
bushs bus tour in the company of country music singers loretta 
lynn and crystal gayle took him through northern and central 
illinois 
while on the bus bush and ms lynn compared notes of the 
hazards of appearing in public bush asked her if she had trouble 
with hecklers and drunks 
are you kidding ive had guns thrown up on the stage ms 
lynn said 
was that a sign of respect the vice president joked

du pont co said today it will begin 
commercial production in 1990 at corpus christi texas of a 
substitute refrigeration chemical for one of the major 
ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbon compounds 
the new compound is hcfc134a long has been considered by 
industry as a potential substitute for cfc12 used in auto air 
conditioners home and commercial refrigerators and freezers and 
chillers for large building air conditioners 
though several other cfc substitutes have been announced by 
chemical companies this is the first for a market that du pont 
says represents about 40 percent of the 330000 tons of cfcs 
consumed annually in the united states 
major nations agreed last year to cut production of important 
ozonedestroying cfc compounds by 50 percent in 1998 and the 
environmental protection agency on monday said it now believes 
their use should be ended completely 
chlorine liberated from these compounds has been blamed by 
scientists for depleting the ozone high in the atmosphere that 
shields the earth from the suns ultraviolet rays 
since hcfc134a contains no chlorine it cannot destroy ozone in 
the stratosphere when it breaks up as cfc12 does 
dupont which has three small plants producing hcfc134a for 
research said it would spend more than 25 million on the corpus 
christi installation to make unspecified millions of pounds of 
hcfc134a annually

the jury in the handgun trial of syndicated 
columnist carl t rowan indicated today it is so far deadlocked on 
a verdict 
the 12member panel which has now reviewed the matter for more 
than five hours over two days sent district of columbia superior 
court judge arthur l burnett sr a note saying a unanimous verdict 
has not yet been reached burnett directed the jury to resume 
deliberations 
rowan a longtime advocate of strict handgun control was 
charged with using an unregistered pistol and ammunition to wound 
18yearold benjamin smith of suburban chevy chase md who had 
taken an unauthorized swim in rowans pool 
if convicted of both misdemeanor charges the 63yearold rowan 
could face up to two years in jail and a 2000 fine 
rowans attorneys built their case on a littleused legal 
principle called entrapment by estoppel the principle holds 
that a person cannot be convicted if he is prosecuted for following 
advice given him by a government official 
rowan has maintained that his son carl jr was rebuffed by 
police officials when he attempted to register the weapon that was 
used in the june 14 shooting 
rowans son a former fbi agent testified that city police told 
him he was exempt from the registration requirements because he was 
a law enforcement officer and that others in his family could have 
access to the gun as well 
he carl jr was depending upon the competence and 
intelligence of those people that the district of columbia put 
there to advise citizens on gun registration argued raoul 
carroll rowans attorney he was entirely at the mercy of the 
district of columbia 
during his twoday trial rowan took the stand to say he 
obtained the weapon in 1982 after receiving a series of death 
threats from people purporting to be members of the ku klux klan 
mindful of the charges of hypocrisy leveled at him because of 
his strong antigun position the columnist also said his son had 
to persuade him to arm himself 
i had never had a gun in this house rowan told the jury 
we rowan and his son got into a little hassle about how 
sometimes you can let your idealism go so far that you get killed 
rowan said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by 
area teens who held latenight pool parties usually with alcohol 
and drugs in his yard 
police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a 
door at the rear of rowans home showed signs that someone had 
tried to break in one officer also testified that the police 
investigation revealed smith had been shot at close range just 
outside rowans home 
rowan maintained that he shot smith because he was afraid the 
intruder was trying to enter the house smith said he was trying to 
flee when rowan shot him

the soviet unions military chief 
thursday proposed major troop reductions in europe and challenged 
the united states to discuss cutting naval and air forces 
the transition from unpredictable zigzags in relations between 
the united states and the soviet union to more normal and stable 
relations is now under way marshal sergei f akhromeyev said in 
a prepared speech 
it appears that a bridge has been erected into the future to 
the next us administration he said 
akhromeyev made a groundbreaking visit this summer to the 
united states where he toured an american warship and sat in the 
cockpit of a b1 bomber defense secretary frank carlucci later 
toured soviet installations 
akhromeyev spoke to scholars and reporters at an annual lecture 
sponsored by the stockholm international peace research institute 
in honor of the late prime minister olof palme the institute is 
funded mostly by the swedish parliament 
he said the reagan presidency was not easy for us but he 
praised progress on missile reductions and said the soviets had now 
destroyed 200 of their medium and shortrange rockets under an 
agreement signed in december by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the united states has destroyed 29 of its missiles so far 
what causes concern are the oceans and seas akhromeyev said 
the united states and some if its allies do not want to extend 
verification of the confidencebuilding measures to the navies and 
air forces where they have a superiority over the ussr 
he cited heavy warships aircraft carriers seabased aircraft 
and tactical strike aviation as areas of soviet disadvantage 
warsaw pact navies also possess substantial strike 
capabilities he acknowledged without going into detail 
akhromeyev laid out similar arguments in an article in the 
soviet communist party newspaper pravda this month and his speech 
here seemed intended to step up pressure on the united states for 
naval reduction talks 
akhromeyev promised soviet openness in counting troops at new 
talks in vienna on reducing regular forces in europe 
the vienna talks on mutual and balanced force reductions in 
europe have dragged on with little progress for 15 years mainly 
because the opposing alliances do not trust each others estimates 
of how many soldiers they have 
when a planned new format for the talks is set we propose not 
merely a data exchange but also thorough verification including 
onsite inspections at any time convenient for the parties after 
the beginning of the talks akhromeyev said 
both alliances should reduce troops by 25 percent or a total of 
500000 men as a further step he said other reductions should 
follow to make the character of the armed forces of the alliances 
generally defensive he said 
according to western estimates the warsaw pact holds a 3to1 
advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2to1 edge in combat 
aircraft and troops including reserves in the soviet union 
western officials have expressed doubts about the soviet 
emphasis in public statements on defensive strategy 
carlucci in moscow in august said he had difficulty in 
reconciling kremlin claims of a defensive strategy with its high 
military spending and offensive weapons stocks

emperor hirohito received blood transfusions for 
the seventh straight day thursday and a citizens group marched to 
protest media portrayals that the entire nation sympathizes with 
the ailing monarch 
the 87yearold hirohito was given two transfusions thursday a 
palace spokesman said bringing to 77 pints the amount he has 
received since internal hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood 
sept 19 
fortunately his majesty has been in stable condition though 
i as chief court physician am always attentive kenji maeda was 
quoted by kyodo news service as saying 
maeda said blood in the bedridden monarchs bowel discharge 
thursday morning prompted the first transfusion 
i understand the symptom of continuing jaundice is still 
present maeda said 
hirohitos temperature rose from from 987 degrees wednesday 
evening to 998 degrees thursday night maeda said his temperature 
flared to 1026 degrees saturday but doctors brought it down with 
antibiotics 
about 150 people belonging to a group called the japan citizens 
league held a march in tokyo and criticized japanese media coverage 
that it said implies the whole nation is watching hirohitos 
illness with grave concern 
we were motivated to hold this rally because we didnt want 
foreign people to think the whole nation of japan is 
sympathizing with the emperor and worried about his illness said 
ryuzo harada secretarygeneral of the organization 
he said the emperors limited role should be further restricted 
by interpreting the constitution more accurately the postwar 
constitution limits him to a largely powerless symbol of state 
satsuki kase of the womens democratic league decried 
extensive news coverage of the cancellation of sports events and 
autumn festivals in view of hirohitos serious condition 
we knew the media were going to give biased coverage on the 
emperor as xday approaches ms kase said but theyre 
making it seem as though if your neighbor cancels plans you have 
to as well 
a palace official said he did not know if hirohito was aware of 
the cancellations or whether the monarch was watching television 
news or reading newspapers 
hirohito the worlds longest reigning living monarch has not 
taken any solid food for 10 days his eldest son crown prince 
akihito 54 has taken over all imperial official duties 
palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports 
that hirohito has cancer and have urged the media to refrain from 
such speculation 
nearly 25 million people have signed registries at the palace 
and elsewhwere throughout japan wishing hirohito a speedy recovery

committee democrats who hold an 116 majority on the panel 
majority members argued that they were under no obligation to 
provide classified information relevant to wrights disclosure in 
part because the house ethics committee which investigates 
breaches of confidentiality had not formally asked for the 
material said sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
chairman louis stokes dohio pointedly reminded committee 
members as the meeting broke up that the rules prohibit members 
from discussing anything done in secret session the reminder 
angered some republican members who complained that they 
apparently were being put under stricter rules than the speaker and 
vowed not to let the matter drop 
its extremely ironic that were so concerned about the 
committee procedures when theres something before congress on 
keeping the secrets of the nation said rep dan lungren rcalif 
wright dtexas told reporters last week that he had clear 
testimony from the cia that us agents had sought to provoke 
demonstrations and civil unrest that would lead to harsh crackdowns 
by the leftist sandinista government the aim wright contended 
was to sabotage faltering peace talks between the government and 
the contra rebels 
in a subsequent interview wright said the information had been 
given by the cia under congressional questioning but he later 
denied violating house rules contending the information he had 
relayed already was publicly known 
the disclosure prompted house minority leader robert michel 
rill and intelligence committee member rep dick cheney rwyo 
to formally ask for ethics and intelligence investigations into 
whether wright had violated house rules against divulging 
classified information 
today wright called the request for an investigation 
politically motivated 
it is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics 
committee or any other committee of the house as a cats paw to 
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another 
member he said 
he said he had personally dissuaded democrats who had come 
to him trying to use the ethics committee to cast aspersions 
against at least five republican members three of them in the 
leadership wright did not name the targets i talked them out 
of it and they havent done it he said 
asked whether wednesdays action by the intelligence panel 
effectively closed the matter a grimfaced cheney responded not 
as far as im concerned 
it appeared that democrats in seeking to head off the 
investigation had traded wrights potential rules and ethics 
problems in the incident for political trouble 
republicans indicated they would seek first to have the ethics 
committee formally called the committee on standards of official 
conduct make a direct request for the information that committee 
is made up of six democrats and six republicans 
if that effort fails there could be an attempt to raise the 
matter on the house floor and further embarrass wright gop 
lawmakers confirmed 
the speaker already is under investigation by the ethics 
committee on a variety of allegations that he improperly profited 
from his official position and that he improperly intervened with 
federal regulators on behalf of constituents the house on 
wednesday approved a 550000 boost in the panels budget to pay 
for the mounting costs of that investigation 
the controversy over wrights disclosure appeared also to have 
doomed the prospects for legislation to tighten congress control 
over administration covert actions 
the bill an outgrowth of last years irancontra hearings 
would require the administration to let congress know within 48 
hours of any covert action it undertakes but the measure which 
already has been passed by the senate appeared to have slipped off 
the house schedule 
we might have to address that next year wright said when 
asked about the legislation wednesday 
rep henry hyde rill the senior republican on the 
intelligence panel said he was frustrated by the rules and 
admonition that kept members from talking about wednesdays action 
but he implied the committees majority had set out to block any 
investigation of wright 
whats at stake is not simply the persona of the speaker but 
whether we should even have an intelligence committee hyde said 
the issue is there something has happened that calls for a 
reaction by the congress 
wright had been predicting that the request for intelligence and 
ethics probes of him on the issue would be dropped by the panels 
saying the issue was without merit

the panchen lama the no 2 spiritual leader of 
tibet has urged his superior the dalai lama to return to china 
according to a newspaper report thursday 
but the dalai lama in helsinki finland denied thursday that 
he was in contact with the panchen lama 
i have not spoken to the panchem lama for at least a year 
the dalai lama told the associated press he appeared bewildered by 
the panchen lamas statement that they were in direct telephone 
contact 
in an interview with the official china daily the panchen lama 
also said a new commission on tibetan buddhism will be set up this 
year 
the body purportedly will give tibetan buddhists who have long 
chafed under chinese sectarian rule more autonomy in religious 
affairs 
the interview came on the eve of the first anniversary of 
violent antichinese protests in the tibetan capital of lhasa and 
underscored chinese attempts to head off further trouble by 
adopting a conciliatory stance toward tibet 
last week china invited the dalai lama to hold a direct 
dialogue with beijing at a place of his choice 
on wednesday the dalai lama said he expected talks with the 
chinese government over tibet in the near future 
the dalai lama in finland on a threeday private visit told a 
news conference the time was ripe to find a middle way in talks 
with the chinese earlier this year he proposed a plan to give 
tibet domestic autonomy while china would control the regions 
foreign and military affairs 
buddhist monks who led protests on oct 1 last year and again on 
march 5 that claimed an estimated 38 lives have demanded an 
independent tibet under the dalai lama

china said thursday it hopes the first working 
visit to moscow by a chinese foreign minister in 32 years will lead 
to a summit and normal ties 
during his visit this year foreign minister qian qichen will 
continue talks with the soviets on the main obstacle to normalizing 
relations vietnams occupation of cambodia said ministry 
spokesman jin guihua 
we hope that the soviet union will make concrete efforts for 
an early settlement of the kampuchea cambodia question jin 
told a news conference the soviet union is the main ally of 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 and ousted the 
chinesesupported khmer rouge 
the soviets said their foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
will visit beijing but gave no date 
the soviet and chinese communist regimes split in the early 
1960s over ideological differences and rivalry for leadership of 
the world communist movement 
although they retained formal diplomatic relations their 
leaders have not met since nikita khruschev visited mao tsetung in 
1959 that also was the last time a soviet foreign minister came to 
beijing 
foreign minister huang hua attended soviet leader leonid 
brezhnevs funeral in 1982 but the last working visit to moscow by 
a chinese foreign minister was in 1956 
the announcement wednesday at the united nations that qian would 
go to moscow this year was seen as a clear signal that both 
countries expect to normalize relations soon a specific date for 
qians visit was not set 
there is a lot of arduous work to do between qians visit 
and a meeting of the top leaders of china and the soviet union 
jin said 
but he added of course it can be said that the exchange of 
visits between the chinese and soviet foreign ministers constitutes 
a step forward towards the meeting between the leaders of the two 
countries it is our hope that the two sides will work towards this 
direction 
the official world economic herald in shanghai meanwhile 
quoted unidentified diplomats in beijing as saying a chinesesoviet 
summit could be held this year or early next year it did not say 
if the diplomats were from one of the two countries or give other 
details 
qian 60 spent 10 years in the soviet union as a student and 
diplomat he headed chinas negotiations with the soviets over 
their disputed border from 1982 until becoming foreign minister in 
april 
his appointment as foreign minister was seen as an indication of 
the importance china placed on its gradually warming relations with 
the soviet union 
china long has maintained that three obstacles exist to normal 
relations with moscow the soviet presence in afghanistan the 
heavy soviet troop presence in mongolia on chinas border and the 
vietnamese occupation of cambodia 
the soviet union began pulling out of afghanistan this year and 
reduced its troops in mongolia in 1987 in recent months china has 
indicated that only vietnam remains a problem 
the soviet union must urge vietnam to withdraw all its troops 
from kampuchea cambodia at an early date jin said the 
soviet union is the sole foreign partner of the vietnamese the 
vietnamese cannot fight the war a single day with soviet help 
vietnam has an estimated 120000 troops in cambodia supporting 
the regime it set up under heng samrin and battling cambodian 
guerrillas aided by china 
china and the soviet union held their first talks devoted to 
resolving the cambodia issue in august in beijing both sides said 
afterward they found common ground but that differences remained 
premier li peng said this month that a summit can be put on the 
agenda once the two sides come closer on cambodia he also said 
normalization would not mean a restoration of the chinesesoviet 
alliance of the 1950s

a massachusetts antiabortion group opposing gov 
michael dukakis presidential candidacy has mailed copies of his 
record on abortion to roman catholic parishes in 18 states 
if elected president he would strongly support and no doubt 
accelerate the tax funding of abortion throughout america 
according to the literature distributed by the group known as 
campaign life america 
paul dipersio the groups leader who runs a heating and 
ventilation business near boston said he has spent 30000 to 
publicize the dukakis record 
as governor of massachusetts michael dukakis has annually 
provided the taxpayers money in his budgets for the brutal 
destruction of 8000 unborn children by abortionondemand the 
groups literature said 
campaign life america also wrote each year 1100 minor girls 
are taken out of state for the purpose of abortion without the 
knowledge and consent of their parents 
andrew dreyfus spokesman for the state office of human 
services said massachusetts law allows girls under age 18 to 
petition courts for permission to have abortions if a judge finds 
that they are mature they do not have to have parental 
permission 
dreyfus said girls who receive court permission are free to seek 
an abortion wherever they want and he said he did not understand 
the reference to their being taken out of state 
steven crawford a member of the governors statehouse press 
staff said dukakis believes someones right of choice should not 
be a function of their economic status 
in his debate with republican george bush on sunday dukakis 
said he personally opposed abortion but believed the decision lies 
with the pregnant woman in the exercise of her own conscience 
and religious beliefs 
at a sparsely attended news conference wednesday on boston 
common dipersio said the group was sending an information 
sheet to the respect life committees of 28 catholic dioceses 
in 18 states the group is asking the committees to bring dukakis 
record to the attention of news media in their areas

michael dukakis and george bush took a few moments out to agree 
on one thing today praising the successful launch of the space 
shuttle then went back to hammering each other over such 
downtoearth issues as toxic waste and tax enforcement 
democrat dukakis accused the reagan administration of 
footdragging in cleaning up toxic waste and said chronic polluters 
better vote for mr bush in the november election republican 
bush renewed his criticism of dukakis taxenforcement plan 
on wednesday during a campaign tour through illinois by bus 
bush took aim at dukakis plan to step up enforcement efforts 
against tax cheats and today he told a rally in saint charles 
mo that a democratic victory in the fall would mean a 
government hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home 
after the launch of the space shuttle discovery bush told the 
cheering crowd the shuttle is launched successfully and america 
is back in space 
dukakis told college students at a rally in new jersey that the 
launch made it a very special morning were very proud of 
the astronauts 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen watched the 
launch at the nashville tenn airport then said it was a 
spectacular takeoff ok russians were back 
dukakis in remarks prepared for delivery today at rutgers 
university in new brunswick nj said bush is to blame for 
blocking regulations to reduce lead in the air as well as a plan to 
control toxic wastes 
mr bushs administration has had eight years to clean up 
toxic wastes said dukakis theyve started the cleanup on only 
137 sites on the national priorities list out of a total of 
1200 dukakis promised that if he is elected cleanup will be 
completed or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1200 
superfund sites on the national priorities list by december 1996 
for the footdraggers and the chronic polluters i have just 
one message you better vote for mr bush because if im elected 
the game is over dukakis said 
let me say a word about my favorite harbor dukakis added 
noting that bush has criticized cleanup efforts in boston harbor 
the massachusetts governor called it the oldest harbor in america 
and said people starting throwing things into it more than a 
century before the boston tea party and mr bush doesnt know what 
hes talking about because were cleaning up boston harbor and 
weve had to fight mr bush and the administration he belongs to 
every inch of the way 
dukakis rejoined the campaign trail after raising his foreign 
policy profile by meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and other foreign officials 
bush who used several appearances in illinois to decry the 
auditor army that dukakis would create was continuing a 
midwestern circuit with rallies in saint charles mo and mount 
clemens and grand rapids mich 
bentsen spoke to schoolchildren in nashville as they awaited the 
scheduled launch of the space shuttle he urged them to consider 
becoming part of this new generation of space pioneers 
bentsens republican counterpart and senate colleague dan 
quayle was returning to washington to prepare for next weeks vice 
presidential debate after a several days in texas 
bush raised the specter of a much larger internal revenue 
service during a bus tour of illinois on wednesday in the populist 
ploy bush accused dukakis of wanting to give the irs even more 
power than it already has to go after the people of america 
he wants to squeeze another 35 billion bucks out of the 
taxpayers pocket bush said in ottawa ill claiming the irs 
would have to double its work force to 200000 people under dukakis 
in order to carry out his proposal to collect billions of dollars 
in delinquent and evaded taxes 
i have confidence in the honesty of the american people 
bush said 
at a rally in normal ill bush attacked dukakis collegeloan 
proposal under which funds borrowed for school would be repaid 
over a long period by deductions from paychecks 
we do not need to put the irs on your tail for the rest of 
your life as the reward for a college education bush said 
dukakis as he had done before in discussing ussoviet 
relationships had kind words after the shevardnadze meeting about 
the reagan achievements in relations between the superpowers 
i made it clear to the foreign minister that i was not here to 
negotiate or discuss specific proposals said dukakis we have 
one president and i support president reagans effort to move 
forward on these issues right up to the end of his term in office 
dukakis had harsher words for the ethics record of the reagan 
administration saying that on his first day as president he would 
bar top officials who left his administration from lobbying their 
former agencies as long as he is in office people are currently 
forbidden from lobbying their former agencies for one year after 
leaving office 
as dukakis has recently bentsen said bush might tap the social 
security trust fund to help balance the federal budget deficit and 
recalled bushs 1985 vote against costofliving adjustments to 
social security recipients 
after urging dukakis on tuesday to renounce his membership in 
the american civil liberties union quayle said dukakis also 
belonged to bostonbased group that calls for steep cuts in defense 
spending 
as bentsen and quayle made their debate preparations an abc 
newswashington post poll showed the bush and dukakis were in the 
same place they were before sundays presidential debate 
the postdebate survey of 674 likely voters showed bush with 50 
percent and dukakis with 46 percent a 5point margin of error made 
the difference statistically meaningless

a smallerthanexpected crowd estimated 
at 250000 cheered from riverbanks and roadsides today as discovery 
lifted off on americas first manned space mission in 32 months 
the crowds lining us 1 across the indian river from kennedy 
space center counted down the final few seconds with a nasa 
announcer piped in by loudspeaker and broke into shouts of 
encouragement as discovery lifted off 
they quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer 
of clouds but the yells began again when it reappeared and became 
louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes 4 
seconds after launch that the boosters had separated challenger 
blew up 73 seconds into flight because of a flaw in its right 
booster 
oh my gosh it was great said 11yearold tommy mathis of 
detroit it was neat watching it just looked like a ball of 
fire at first going up and it went into a cloud halfway up 
as soon as it went out it was beautiful he said 
tens of thousands of people had pitched their tents parked 
their campers and pulled out their lawn chairs starting wednesday 
to grab the best viewing spots 
but nasa estimates of up to 1 million spectators proved to be 
vastly overblown joan heller a spokeswoman for the brevard county 
sheriffs office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a 
quartermillion people were on hand although no formal count is 
attempted 
its about the same size or smaller than the first launch 
larger than the most recent launches but not nearly as big as 
anticipated she said 
no arrests or major traffic problems were reported at launch 
time but at dawn traffic was backed up considerably on roads 
leading to the space center 
at dawn highway embankments were teeming with spectators 
searching for breakfast and setting up binoculars and camera 
stands some even parked illegally outside one of the center gates 
risking having their cars towed 
its going to work this time doug miller 22 of wilton 
conn said wednesday outside a tent he and a friend set up in a 
field across the indian river from the kennedy space center we 
want to see it 
its almost like its starting all over again said dean 
lax 21 a senior at emory riddle aeronautical university in 
daytona beach 
lax and fellow student joseph reilley 27 saw the challenger 
explosion from their campus a 50minute drive north of the space 
center they pitched a tent in a field wednesday morning to be on 
hand for discovery 
in addition to the public about 3000 vips including movie 
stars and members of congress planned to watch from a site on the 
space center grounds a record 5000 journalists sought 
accreditation to cover the launch but only 1800 were being 
allowed at the main press site the rest were moved further away 
from the launchpad because of safety concerns 
campers lined many stretches of road shoulder along us 1 in 
titusville and souvenir stands and portable toilets were put up on 
all major highways 
health officials set up nine first aid tents along the highways 
expected to be most crowded said buddy render a battalion chief 
with brevard county fire and rescue render said minor injuries 
cuts bruises dehydration would probably be all health workers 
would have to deal with but were prepared for any kind of mass 
casualty incident 
two hospitals were on emergency standby with extra personnel 
scheduled 
arnold richman the space centers chief of visitor services 
had estimated wednesday that up to 1 million people would show up 
he said hat figure was based on attendance at previous launches 
the midmorning scheduling of the launch and increased interest in 
the shuttle because of challenger and the long grounding of the 
space program 
weve been getting calls from all over the country he said 
barney barnes a 68yearold retired air force pilot from 
paradise calif said watching the shuttle would be like watching 
the flag waving his wife nita 67 agreed 
it just gives you goosebumps she said wednesday as the 
couple sat outside their camper in a titusville field with a clear 
view of the distant launch pad 
harry and norma perkins came from the chicago suburb of homewood 
to watch discoverys launch the couple who have seen three or 
four other shuttle launches said the experience was very very 
special 
brings the tears to your eyes said mrs perkins 63 it 
really does you know your heart just kind of stops

an unemployed houston man whose lack of health 
insurance was cited by democrat michael dukakis in the presidential 
debate with republican george bush is returning a 400 check bushs 
nephew sent him to buy insurance 
charles strickland 42 who lost his job two years ago when his 
houston energy company moved said he was upset with the check 
because he found it degrading 
when i first opened it up i felt kind of proud strickland 
said wednesday at a news conferenee organized by dukakis staffers 
but the more i read the letter the more i believed that man 
had no concern for me my son or my family his main purpose was a 
political ploy as an individual im tired of being used as a 
political football on this issue 
the check was sent by james r pierce jr a houston insurance 
broker who is a nephew of barbara bush the vice presidents wife 
pierce on wednesday denied the check was politically motivated 
he said he was responding only to stricklands needs 
im a little upset about it all pierce said my 
intentions were personally motivated and emotionally driven im 
sorry that he thought they were politically motivated because they 
werent 
strickland told dukakis a week ago during a campaign stop at a 
houston hospital that he could not allow his 11yearold son to 
play sports in school because he did not have health insurance and 
could not afford to buy any 
dukakis on sunday said stricklands son could not play little 
league because of a lack of insurance 
little league officials in houston complained that dukakis was 
wrong and that insurance was available if parents could not afford 
it for their child 
pierce said he mailed the check after reading about strickland 
in the newspaper and had not consulted the bush campaign 
its unfortunate you try to do something good and it gets 
twisted by the many cynics in the world pierce said 
in his letter to strickland pierce said the dukakis platform 
will only drag all american wage earners back into the malaise

kuwait has reopened its embassy in tehran and 
stationed two diplomats there in a major step toward improving 
relations with iran a senior iranian diplomat said thursday 
iran and cyprus said they will establish full diplomatic 
relations iran will open an embassy in nicosia to be headed by a 
charge daffairs and a cypriot ambassador will be accredited to 
tehran the two countries announced 
mohammad faroughy irans charge daffaires in kuwait told the 
associated press that relations between the persian gulf neighbors 
were warming following the aug 20 ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
iran repeatedly had accused kuwait of directly aiding iraq in 
the 8yearlong conflict 
kuwait expelled five iranian diplomats last september reducing 
irans embassy staff to faroughy and an aide after mobs stormed 
the kuwaiti embassy in tehran following riots in the holy city of 
mecca in saudi arabia 
but kuwait stopped short of actually severing ties with tehran 
as saudi arabia did later citing iranian subversion and terrorism 
well informed sources said the kuwaiti diplomats in tehran are a 
charge daffaires and a counselor putting kuwaiti representation 
on a par with irans 
the improvement in relations is part of a trend set in motion by 
irans july 18 unconditional acceptance of the unsponsored 
ceasefire and peace talks to end the war 
france and canada have restored ties with the islamic republic 
and britain is moving in that direction the united states still 
has no relations with iran which held 52 americans hostage in the 
us embassy in tehran from november 1979 to january 1981 
relations between kuwait and iran hit their lowest point in 
august 1987 after more than 400 moslem pilgrims 275 of them 
iranians were killed in what the saudis said was iranianinspired 
rioting in mecca iranian mobs stormed the saudi and kuwaiti 
missions in tehran

a rescue convoy stood by 
at the shuttles mojave desert landing site in case of an emergency 
today but once discovery reached orbit the ground crew settled 
down to prepare for the scheduled touchdown in four days 
the shuttle is to complete its mission with a landing here 
monday morning on the hard claylike surface of rogers dry 
lakebed but were ready to support a landing anytime during the 
mission nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato said wednesday 
the lakebed is the prime site for an earlier emergency landing 
including what the national aeronautics and space administration 
calls an abortoncearound a landing after one low orbit spurred 
by a premature shutdown of the main shuttle engines following 
launch 
the only reason they wouldnt come here for an 
abortoncearound would be weather if there were flooding of 
the lakebed or severe winds said nasa spokesman franklin 
odonnell 
but the air force forecast sunny skies temperatures climbing to 
near 90 degrees and winds up to 17 mph for today acceptable 
conditions for an emergency landing here 
bad weather here during an abortoncearound would force the 
shuttle to land at white sands nm or back at the kennedy space 
center launch site in florida 
loss of two main engines soon after launch would dictate a 
transatlantic abort landing at ben guerir morocco moron spain 
or banjul gambia a shutdown of the engines even earlier might 
require a returntolaunchsite landing in florida 
a 110person recovery convoy of nasa and air force rescuers was 
ready to wait out the launch in nasas shuttle operations area 
here then drive numerous rescue and service vehicles onto the 
lakebed if an emergency landing was needed lovato said 
after any landing technicians check for hazardous vapors around 
the shuttle orbiter then connect various cooling and gaspurging 
lines to the spacecraft plans call for the shuttle crew to emerge 
from the orbiter 30 to 40 minutes after landing

the crew of the delta air lines plane that 
crashed last month at the dallasfort worth international airport 
gave no indication of trouble in the moments before the crash 
according to a tape released today of crew conversations with air 
traffic controllers 
fourteen people were killed in the crash 
a transcript of the air traffic control tower tapes released by 
the federal aviation administration showed the delta jetliner took 
about 22 minutes to taxi from its gate to the point at which it 
began rolling down the runway on aug 31 
there was no word from the aircraft flight 1141 with 107 people 
on board between the time the copilot acknowledged receiving 
takeoff clearance and the crash 
fire at the end of the runway an unknown voice was heard to 
say on the tape in the first indication that something unusual had 
occurred according to the transcript 
four seconds before the remark and presumably after the boeing 
727 already had crashed someone on the plane attempted to 
communicate with the tower but managed only to give the flight 
number 
the two pilots and flight engineer were among those who survived 
the crash although all three were injured 
at one point someone could be heard saying flames out of the 
left side of the engine but faa officials said that appeared to 
be a remark picked up by the controllers microphone from someone 
in the tower 
the remark was not included in the official transcript 
federal investigators have ruled out engine failure as a cause 
of the crash after it was determined that none of the planes 
engines had experienced a mechanical failure 
after the crash controllers began rerouting incoming aircraft 
and ordering jets awaiting takeoff to halt in their tracks 
emergency equipment rolling an unknown voice asked 55 
seconds after the planes flames were noticed 
affirmative replied the controller

the federal government trying to 
settle a 17yearold dispute over a sewer grant has tied up the 
citys bank accounts 
the federal court action wednesday came just as the city was 
about to obey another court order and write a check for 82397 to 
pay firefighters clothing allowances owed for years 
it was the third time this year a court has frozen the citys 
accounts 
in a separate matter a judge today dropped civil and contempt 
charges against mayor carl officer stemming from an extra 80000 
the mayor received from the cashstrapped city 
st clair county circuit judge robert craig dismissed the 
charges at the request of county prosecutor john baricevic who 
would not say why he made the request 
baricevic knows he didnt have a case against him said 
officers lawyer eric vickers 
at a hearing aug 29 craig had held officer and east st louis 
in contempt of court after they failed to provide him with records 
explaining the 80000 transfer to officer 
baricevic said officer got the money between 1984 and last year 
in addition to his annual salary of 30000 but two of the mayors 
top aides told the judge that many of the citys financial records 
couldnt be found 
an arson fire at the old city hall annex may have been to blame 
for the problem said assistant city attorney kenwyn redding he 
also blamed past city hall workers whom he did not identify 
on wednesday city treasurer charlotte moore said she expected 
to have enough money on hand after paying off the firefighters to 
write paychecks for city workers for the first time since aug 30 
but that was before she learned the federal environmental 
protection agency had obtained another freeze on the bank accounts 
officer told a city council meeting that the city is going to 
have to chop the payroll 
were going to have to cut and cut deep he said 
he said the amount sought by the epa will bring the projected 
city deficit for the rest of the year to 700000 
us attorney frederick hess said the latest freeze arose out of 
the misuse of the epa sewer grant the federal government which is 
seeking 221175 contends the city of 55000 did not act on the 
project in a timely manner

william p rogers the head of the 
commission that investigated the tragic challenger explosion said 
todays successful launch of the shuttle discovery was a 
wonderful day for the space program 
rogers and about 2000 vips watching the launch from a special 
site about 6 miles away from the pad hooted and cheered as the 
shuttle soared through blue sky until it could no longer be seen 
in my days the sky was the limit its not the limit any 
more rogers said after the launch 
two relatives of challenger astronauts also watched the liftoff 
at kennedy space center from a different location than most of the 
other vips said nasa spokesman arnold richman though he was not 
sure where 
scott smith son of pilot michael smith and claude onizuka 
brother of mission specialist ellison onizuka were on hand to 
watch the first shuttle mission since their relatives were killed 
along with five other challenger astronauts on jan 28 1986 
at the vip site at least one celebrity joined former astronauts 
and members of congress watching the launch from bleachers 
actor john travolta told reporters before the launch he was a 
guest of former astronaut buzz aldrin whom he had met in a movie 
asked if he would like to go into space someday travolta a jet 
pilot for eight years said id love to 
nasa set up one vip viewing area 6 miles from the launch pad to 
accommodate about 2000 invitees and one nearby to seat about 2000 
more 
special guests of nasa had watched the challenger liftoff from 
the same seaside pad from only three miles away but for safety 
reasons the space agency limited the number of people allowed that 
close for todays launch 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
said about 3000 special guests sought invitations to the launch 
and by wednesday afternoon about twothirds had said they would be 
there nasa spokesman eugene marianetti said the agency does not 
solicit vips to watch the launches 
they come to us he said we get a lot of criticism when 
celebrities do come but the fact is that most of the people 
watching from vip areas will be average american people 
sen john glenn the first american to orbit earth and sen 
jake garn rutah who flew aboard discovery in april 1985 watched 
the launch from the main media site about 4 miles from the pad 
rep bill nelson dfla the only other member of congress who 
has flown in space also was at the space center for the liftoff 
and was flying back to washington shortly after 
several other former astronauts were on the guest list 
including saudi arabian sultan al saud who was a payload 
specialist on one of the shuttle missions 
others who had been expected to attend including entertainer 
john denver never arrived 
denver who wants to ride aboard the soviet mir space station 
recently spent three days at the johnson space center undergoing a 
medical evaluation given to all astronaut applicants he was one of 
several americans asked by the soviets to fly in their space 
program according to a spokeswoman for denver 
other vips watching included lt gen james abrahamson whose 
resignation as director of the strategic defense initiative 
president reagans spacebased missile defense program known as 
star wars was announced tuesday abrahamson is a former associate 
administrator of nasas office of space flight 
william p rogers who headed the presidential commission that 
investigated the challenger explosion and other members of that 
panel were expected so were members of the national research 
council an arm of the american academy of sciences that nasa 
appointed to oversee the shuttle redesign as a result of the rogers 
commission recommendations

the navys top admiral has decided americas 
next class of warship is going to rely on electricity for 
propulsion 
adm carlisle ah trost in a speech delivered at a classified 
symposium announced to industry officials the navy no longer would 
just dabble in researching integrated electric drive propulsion 
but instead would embrace it as the power plant of the future to 
replace diesel gas turbine or nuclear propulsion 
in view of its many wellknown advantages i am declaring that 
integrated electric drive with its associated cluster of 
technologies will be the method of propulsion for the next class 
of surface battle force combatants said trost the chief of 
naval operations 
and i am directing all the major navy organizations involved 
in these efforts to concentrate their energies toward that 
objective its something that has stayed in the laboratory too 
long and we need to tear down those barriers that have prevented 
its development 
with electric drive a warship would use a conventional engine 
to power a generator which in turn would produce electricity for a 
motor that would turn the propeller shaft that in turn would 
eliminate the need for reduction gears and other mechanical engine 
machinery trost said 
electric drive is an old idea with a remarkable new 
potential the fourstar admiral asserted the advantages we 
can already see are enormous and thats just the basic 
technology itself 
among other benefits the advent of electricdrive systems would 
put sufficient electricalgenerating capacity on navy warships to 
power exotic weapons of the future like lasers and directed 
energy weapons the admiral added 
trost served as the keynote speaker monday at a twoday 
symposium sponsored by the us naval league and held behind closed 
doors at the naval surface warfare center at white oak md 
outside washington 
the symposium was designed to assess the navys view of what its 
combat fleet might look like in the 21st century and while closed 
to the public the pentagon release an unclassified version of 
trosts speech on wednesday 
according to lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman the 
service has studied electric propulsion for surface warships off 
and on for years always devoting relatively small amounts of money 
to the work indeed navy ships have been built in the past with 
electric drive units but they always left something to be desired 
in performance the spokesman noted 
the march of technology however already has improved 
performance and more gains can be made trost told his audience a 
modern efficient electric propulsion system offers huge savings in 
weight and manpower along with new flexibility in designing a 
ships hull and more room for weapons to be packed aboard the 
admiral added 
quigley and other navy officials said they were unaware of any 
specific new breakthrough or study that might have prompted trosts 
decision 
the admiral himself in his speech cited recent advances in the 
field of superconductivity but suggested he mainly was trying to 
break down institutional barriers to change 
in other words we need a firm goal trost declared this 
is a case where the benefits of a specific application of 
technology are so obvious that we need to invert the normal scheme 
of things 
the navy is just now beginning to build a new type of surface 
warship the socalled arleigh burke class of destroyers and 
thus probably wont begin designing another until well into the 
1990s

researchers have isolated and purified a 
mystery substance they suspect is linked to high blood pressure an 
affliction that leaves nearly 60 million americans at dramatically 
higher risk of stroke and heart disease it was announced thursday 
people with high blood pressure are believed to have increased 
levels of the substance which researchers have yet to identify in 
their blood 
isolation of the compound which appears only in trace amounts 
should speed up identification and manufacture of a synthetic 
version of the substance to be used in future studies said john 
hamlyn an assistant professor of physiology at the university of 
maryland at baltimore 
what we think is that having more of it in the circulation may 
be effectively raising blood pressure said hamlyn who has been 
working to isolate and purify the substance from blood plasma for 
six years 
once the substance is identified synthesized and available for 
wide study hamlyn predicted it will still be at least eight to 10 
years before new relief for sufferers of high blood pressure is 
available 
hamlyn presented his research results at a conference of the 
american heart associations council on high blood pressure 
research the study was conducted with scientists from the upjohn 
co which also provided funds for the project 
harvey gonick an adjunct professor of medicine at the 
university of california at los angeles who is working in the same 
field called hamlyns development a major move in the right 
direction 
identification and synthesis of the substance will have 
extraordinary implications for treatment of disease he said 
theres been a worldwide race toward trying to isolate 
identify and purify this hormone and that race is yet to be won 
said gonick but hes made a step in the right direction 
the substance which has no name appears to increase the amount 
of sodium and calcium in cells hamlyn said sodium and calcium 
work together to regulate the contraction of muscle cells in blood 
vessels when cells are unable to pump out enough sodium calcium 
levels go up and tension in the artery wall increases causing 
blood pressure to rise 
but the association between the mystery substance and blood 
pressure levels has been difficult to investigate because the 
material appears in trace amounts said hamlyn one metric ton 
about 2200 pounds of blood plasma typically yields an amount 
barely visible in the bottom of a test tube he said 
no one has been able to measure it very well said hamlyn 
who hopes researchers will be able to identify the material within 
a year everything depends on finding out what the substance is 
possible strategies for counteracting the substance once it is 
identified include inhibiting its production designing a compound 
to block its effect or accelerating its breakdown in the body said 
hamlyn

about 10000 un soldiers in blue helmets 
and berets are deployed from the persian gulf to the snows of 
kashmir in peacekeeping operations 
the seven un peacekeeping and observer operations are based on 
the principle of minimal use of force the peacekeepers who won 
the 1988 nobel peace prize on thursday operate only with the 
consent of the parties concerned and they are permitted to fire 
their light arms only in selfdefense 
the un soldier is protected not by his weapons but by nearly 
universal regard for the impartiality and fairness symbolized by 
the blue and white un logo of the world wreathed by an olive 
branch 
he is not a combatant and he supports neither side in classic 
nowin situations he is at home counting withdrawing troops or 
persuading shepherds to graze their flocks away from sensitive 
unmarked borders 
but that didnt protect us lt col william higgins a us 
marine observer in southern lebanon he was kidnapped in february 
by moslem fundamentalists and was wearing a un blue beret when he 
was abducted 
the official un definition of peacekeeping is an operation 
involving military personnel but without enforcement powers 
established by the security council to help maintain or restore 
peace in areas of conflict 
they aim to control conflicts prevent escalation patrol buffer 
zones and create breathing time and space to allow tensions to cool 
and political peacemaking to operate 
if you dont use peacekeepers then other countries see the 
threat or the use of force as practical options to fill a vacuum 
un undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding said thursday he is 
in charge of peacekeeping operations 
peacekeeping is a revolutionary idea a major un innovation 
pioneered in the middle east in 1948 and still evolving said 
former un undersecretarygeneral brian urquardt in charge of 
peacekeeping for years 
un peacekeeping costs about 230 million a year and un 
officials say that likely additional operations in southern africa 
western sahara and cambodia will raise the total to 15 to 2 
billion annually 
over the years about 500000 un personnel have been involved 
in un peacekeeping and observer operations drawing forces from 
58 nations the united nations says 733 peacekeepers have lost 
their lives since 1948 
the latest un peacekeeping operation was deployed aug 20 to 
supervise a ceasefire in the eightyear iraniraq war it involves 
about 1500 lightly armed soldiers in blue helmets and support 
personnel in blue berets 
another team of 50 unarmed observers is deployed in afghanistan 
and pakistan to monitor a unmediated afghanistan agreement 
calling for pullout of soviet troops 
un peacekeeping forces and observers are expected to be 
deployed in southern africa this fall in western sahara to 
supervise elections and in cambodia to monitor a vietnamese troop 
withdrawal 
other un peacekeeping and observer forces operate in the 
middle east in in cyprus and along the disputed indiapakistan 
border of kashmir 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar writes in a book on 
peacekeeping in a time of nuclear armament it is more than ever 
important that regional conflicts in sensitive areas should be kept 
out of the sphere of possible greatpower nuclear confrontation 
i believe that this novel but still fragile creation is an 
important addition to the armory of peace in the nuclear age 
it is an indispensable and potentally highly effective weapon in 
the struggle for world peace

constructive work 
the military government has ordered all civil servants workers 
back to work monday to end a prodemocracy strike that has crippled

won 
but one diplomat based in bangkok thailand speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the authorities have won for now 
there is not much the opposition can really do right now 
state radio said wednesday that 74 percent of the ministry of 
planning and finance employees were at work it said more than half 
of the employees showed up at the ministries of health home and 
religious affairs and culture and trade 
a lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up 
their paychecks said the western diplomat in bangkok who noted 
that pay comes at the end of the month in burma weve had 
reports of people sitting around drinking tea

the house approved a 18 billion 1989 
appropriations bill for congress own expenses thursday an 
electionyear measure devoid of a pay raise that many lawmakers had 
talked about giving themselves 
the measure was approved on a 253133 vote and sent to the 
senate for final congressional approval 
the appropriations bill was one of five remaining that 
legislators are racing to complete by saturdays start of federal 
fiscal year 1989 if all 13 are enacted by saturday it would be 
the first time since 1948 that all of the spending measures that 
finance government agencies were in place in time for the new year 
members of congress have received base annual salaries of 
89500 since february 1987 but lawmakers have been coming under 
increasing public criticism for the large sums of money most of 
them receive for giving speeches to industry labor and other 
groups 
the amount of the payments called honoraria legislators can 
keep each year can total up to 30 percent of each representatives 
salary and up to 40 percent of each senators pay 
lawmakers have discussed lowering or eliminating the amount of 
honoraria permitted in exchange for increasing the base pay after 
housesenate negotiators working on the bill discussed the 
proposals briefly on wednesday they agreed not to address the 
issue in the spending measure 
president reagan is scheduled to propose salary adjustments for 
congress and top federal officials in january his proposal will be 
based on the recommendations that a special federal salary 
commission are scheduled to make in december 
the money in the bill represents a 3 percent or 59 million 
increase over 1988 legislative spending of the total package 506 
million is for the house and 341 million for the senate the rest 
is for joint items such as the capitol police and for congressional 
agencies such as the library of congress

a tearful mayor peter knudson spoke 
for many of morton thiokols 8000 utah employees when he called 
todays successful launch of the shuttle discovery one of the 
greatest moments of my life 
employees at the rocketmakers wasatch operations 25 miles west 
of here erupted in cheers as they watched the launch on television 
monitors americas return to space followed to 32 months of 
corporate agony 
were all delighted with the launch there are lot of very 
happy people here at morton thiokol said mike ayers acting 
director of finance and administration for space operations 
todays successful launch was in sharp contrast to the jan 28 
1986 challenger disaster which killed seven astronauts the 
tragedy was caused by a faulty joint seal on one of morton 
thiokols 126footlong boosters which allowed a plume of fiery 
gas to escape triggering the explosion that doomed challenger 
a pair of the companys redesigned boosters hurtled discovery 
spaceward today 
the mayor a dentist was unable to watch the launch because he 
was with a patient but when informed by a reporter it was a 
success he struggled to speak through his emotion 
this is one of the greatest moments of my life he said 
were not talking jobs here were talking emotions peoples 
sense of worth 
he said about twothirds of morton thiokols 8000 utah 
employees reside in the city and its environs 
hundreds of morton thiokol officials and engineers were at cape 
canaveral for the launch reporters were barred from company 
premises in utah in part so employees could watch the launch in 
private said spokesman rocky raab

one of the most prominent members of the 
un peacekeeping forces us marine lt col william r higgins 
was in captivity thursday and was unable to celebrate the nobel 
peace prize with his comrades 
higgins 43 of danville kentucky headed a 76member observer 
group attached to the un interim force in lebanon before he was 
kidnapped feb 17 1988 near this southern coastal city 
an underground group calling itself the organization of the 
oppressed on earth has claimed responsibility for his abduction 
charging he used his un uniform to spy for the united states 
american and un officials denied the charge 
the kidnappers believed to be shiite moslem zealots loyal to 
iran have issued four communiques and a videotape since his 
abduction demanding israels withdrawal from an occupied enclave 
in south lebanon 
they also demanded the release of all lebanese and palestinian 
guerrillas held by israel none of their demands have been met 
the kidnappers have made no statements about higgins since april 
21 when they issued their fourth and last communique it said he 
would be put on trial on espionage charges 
but on july 8 palestine liberation organization spokesman 
bassam abu sharif said in a published interview that higgins was 
abducted to thwart a plan hatched to rescue eight other americans 
held hostage in lebanon 
abu sharif was quoted by the beirut daily addiyar which is 
based in christian east beirut as saying that the plo obtained a 
transcript of the interrogation with higgins he did not say how 
the plo had obtained it 
according to the alleged transcript higgins had headed the 
operations department of the antiterrorist us delta force 
widely referred to as the rapid deployment force

six high school dropouts were notified 
thursday that they will lose their drivers licenses unless they 
reenroll in school the first teenagers affected by new education 
legislation 
ron bolen director of the state department of motor vehicles 
safety and enforcement division said letters went thursday to four 
boys and two girls 
the legislature earlier this year passed a 300page bill 
rewriting much of the states education law one provision calls 
for the suspension or revocation of drivers license privileges for 
dropouts under 18 years old 
as far as i know its the first in the nation state 
schools superintendent tom mcneel said thursday our bill was the 
first in the country where a drivers license would be revoked if a 
person is not in school 
bolen said the notification carries a 30day waiting period 
before the revocation takes effect those notified will lose their 
licenses oct 30 unless they enroll in a general education course 
to earn a high school diploma bolen said 
west virginias dropout rate was 174 percent last year down 
considerably from 27 percent a decade ago mcneel said but he said 
the rate remains too high west virginias dropout rate ranked 28th 
nationally in 1986 the most recent rankings available state 
officials said 
mcneel said educators are split over the legislation but he 
endorses it 
being a parent of teenagers i believe it has some merit 
maybe considerable merit he said it is something the 
teenagers value and perhaps many individuals will be convinced to 
stay in school because of that it is one of the tools we should 
use 
state delegate robert harman a republican who also is a mineral 
county school administrator objected to the drivers license 
provision in the education bill saying some students may need to 
drop out of school to help their parents earn a living 
in addition department of motor vehicles lawyer wyatt hanna 
said his agencys appeals process for license revocations could 
take years meaning a student likely would be 18 and exempt from 
the law once the final appeal is heard 
bolen said the six students notified live in rural pocahontas 
and braxton counties in the central and centraleast parts of the 
state carolyn spangler spokesman for the education department 
said braxtons dropout rate was 229 percent and pocahontas 
dropout rate was 157 percent 
school officials notified the dmv that the students either 
voluntarily or involuntarily have withdrawn from secondary schools 
and are under 18 years or age bolen said the ages range from a 
little over 16 to nearly 18 
bolen declined to identify the students saying he believes they 
have confidentiality rights and i dont believe it is proper for 
them to read in the newspapers without getting the notification 
first from us 
if the students decline to reenroll and show proof of that to 
the dmv they have the right to an administrative appeal and then 
can resort to the regular court system bolen said well notifiy 
them of that he said 
bolen said he expects county schools systems to begin notifying 
his office on a regular basis about dropouts now that the program 
has started 
he said he has received 34 names from four counties but just 
eight of those students had licenses two notifications were 
shelved because the students will be 18 by the time the dmv could 
contact them he said 
mcneel said several states either are considering similar 
legislation

a lawyer representing a 9yearold girl 
wants genetic tests done to settle the question of her biological 
parents but he wants them done in florida and he wants the results 
kept secret at least for now 
but marvin ellin a lawyer representing a pennsylvania couple 
who think the sarasota girl may be their biological daughter said 
he will seek a courtorder monday to have the sophisticated blood 
tests conducted by johns hopkins university in baltimore 
secrecy for the tests is unacceptable said ellin they 
wouldnt be able to disclose the fact that she is their daughter 
they wouldnt be able to file evidence of it 
negotiations between ellin and tampa lawyer dale swope collapsed 
wednesday in a dispute over who will do the testing and the 
confidentiality of the results 
ernest and regina twigg of langhorne pa claim in a 100 
million lawsuit that their healthy baby girl was switched at tiny 
hardee memorial hospital in wauchula in central florida with a 
fatally ill newborn in 1978 
birth records show that only one white girl the sarasota child 
shared the nursery with the twigg baby so the case has focused on 
her 
swope who represents the girls father said the tests must be 
kept secret 
if it produces unsettling results they will be kept 
confidential until our client has had a chance to explain this 
tragedy to his child then in time after she has adjusted to it 
we will disclose it to other interested parties 
the baby the twiggs took home from the wauchula hospital 
suffered from a congenital heart defect the couple nursed the sick 
girl arlena twigg through a painful life until she died aug 23 
following surgery 
tests taken before a heart operation at a new jersey hospital 
indicated arlenas blood type was different from theirs further 
sophisticated proteinmatchting tests ruled out any biological 
relationship with the twiggs

the house on thursday approved a 466 billion 
money bill for the nations farm programs including for the first 
time a ceiling on a major export program that has boosted overseas 
sales of agricultural products 
we have held the line we have preserved and restored basic 
domestic programs which is the most important thing house 
appropriations committee chairman jamie l whitten dmiss said 
as the house approved the bill 35335 
the measure produced this week by a housesenate conference 
committee is awaiting action in the senate 
the bill would furnish 466 billion in new budget authority 
compared with last years level of 562 billion however actual 
outlays in the fiscal year starting saturday would be only 269 
billion 
the bill would provide 88 billion for the governmentowned 
commodity credit corp which operates the nations major crop 
subsidy programs 
other bigticket items include 136 billion for food stamps 
1929 billion for the nutrition program for women infants and 
children 148 billion for humanitarian food exports to the third 
world and 1864 billion for the conservation reserve program 
the conservation reserve program pays farmers to take highly 
erodible land out of production for a decade 
one reason for the large difference between budget authority and 
actual outlays is that the amount earmarked for the ccc is in 
effect a reimbursement to a revolving fund and not counted as an 
outlay in other cases outlays are not expected to go up to the 
full authority 
in a major development house and senate negotiators decided to 
cap expenditures under the export enhancement program a major 
export subsidy at 770 million in the upcoming fiscal year 
the program established under wideranging 1985 farm 
legislation pays inkind bonuses of surplus crops to spur 
exporters to send american wheat feed grains and other commodities 
overseas 
in establishing the program lawmakers aimed at drastically 
reducing the huge surplus of crops that at the time was piled up in 
warehouses at taxpayer expense and give a shot in the arm to 
overseas sales of american farm goods 
since the launch of the program it has provided more than 2 
billion in these bonuses to the worlds largest grain companies and 
other exporters 
in its quest for savings in farm programs the house had sought 
to cap fiscal 1989 expenditures at 900 million but the conferees 
opted for the senate level of 770 million 
the panel also held to 200 million another export subsidy 
established under the 1985 law the targeted export assistance 
program under which the government pays for advertising and other 
promotional expenses of american products overseas 
the authorized level for the program is 325 million but it has 
come under fire from lawmakers who question the use of taxpayer 
funds to boost sales of brandname products 
commercial honey producers who long have benefited from 
openended payment programs suffered a setback under the bill it 
would bar them from collecting more than 250000 a year as a 
result of pricesupport loan forfeitures 
under normal farmprogram procedures farmers may obtain 
pricesupport loans from the governmentowned commodity credit 
corp using their crops as collateral and then deliberately 
forfeit the collateral and keep the loan if that would yield them 
greater earnings 
lawmakers thought they had capped potential benefits under the 
program at 250000 several years ago but a handful of largescale 
honey producers found a legal way to circumvent that ceiling the 
bill aims to close that loophole 
we hope this ends the funny business in the honey business 
said rep silvio conte rmass who has been engaged in a 
longrunning fiscal duel with the nations commercial beekeepers

departments in the united states if not the world groebson

to be made not necessarily in the people who are there but in 
their policies and practices

fellow officers refused to come to his assistance in potentially 
lifethreatening situations

michael dukakis and george bush are ardently 
courting that segment of the electorate known as reagan democrats 
moderates who left their party twice to vote for ronald reagan 
estimated at roughly 10 percent of the electorate these voters 
have different backgrounds and interests experts say 
in the north they tend to be ethnic catholic and often blue 
collar says dukakis pollster irwin tubby harrison in the 
south they tend to be protestant not ethnic and as likely to be 
in whitecollar as bluecollar jobs 
what they share are moderate or conservative leanings and views 
that reagan touched when he was campaigning for president in 1980 
and to an even greater extent in 1984 
they are by definition among the larger group of swing voters 
that will decide this election 
its fair to say reagan democrats are an important target for 
both campaigns said mark mellman a consultant to democratic 
campaigns those are the kind of people among whom there is 
movement 
for the democratic nominee the struggle is to offer these voters 
a reason to return to their party and what were once traditional 
voting patterns for bush the republican the task is to present 
himself as representing a continuation of reagans policies 
in both cases the candidates are using the economy to reach 
those voters bush citing sustained economic growth dukakis 
playing on unease about the future and the unevenness of the 
prosperity 
in their hearts they know that four more years of reaganomics 
would be bad for the country and that four more years of 
reaganomics without reagan would be a disaster dukakis said in a 
direct appeal to those voters recently in arkansas 
bush strategists acknowledge he has had some difficulty reaching 
these voters bush was booed earlier this month by union members in 
a portland ore shipyard 
bush chief of staff craig fuller said the campaign wants to win 
back these reagan democrats and is trying to schedule appearances 
aimed at them and emphasize issues with appeal to them 
bush has been sounding themes that worked so well for reagan 
strong defense patriotism anticrime and attempting to portray 
his democratic rival as a liberal a cardcarrying member of 
the american civil liberties union 
virtually every piece of the dukakis campaign strategy is 
devoted to returning these voters to the democratic fold his 
reference to the middle class squeeze his latest campaign 
theme focuses on these voters as slighted by the reagan prosperity 
and now needing two incomes to pay for what one income once did 
his calls for new ways to make college education affordable and 
to extend health insurance to all americans are similarly aimed at 
these voters a week spent trying to strengthen his image on 
defense was aimed in part at these voters particularly in the 
south 
the socalled reagan democrats dont make up the entire group of 
swing voters there are also independents voters with no party 
identification and whose votes are up for grabs each election 
but polltakers distinguish those independents from those who 
retain party identification even if it is only in their own minds 
so far there is no clear signal which side will win them 
an abc newswashington post poll taken sept 2127 found the 
reagan democrats evenly divided 48 percent preferring bush and 43 
percent dukakis 
a cbs newsnew york times poll taken sept 811 found 9 percent 
of its sample of probable voters were the reagan democrats of 
this sliver of the electorate dukakis had 44 percent of them bush 
had 34 percent and 19 percent were undecided 
if bush succeeds in winning these voters it may further shake 
their identification as democrats experts say that for these 
voters to cast a third presidential vote for a republican would 
represent a major step toward a more permanent political alignment 
and even so bush does not need to win all of these voters to be 
successful 
the constitution doesnt require that you win with 60 percent 
of the vote as ronald reagan did in 1984 mellman said you 
dont have to get all reagan democrats in order to win to look at 
those numbers and say gee he bush is only getting 50 percent 
of them is a little bit foolish

thursday because of a heart ailment that hospitalized him twice in 
one week this month 
i cant ignore this message from my heart michael gelpi 
said at a farewell breakfast meeting its with sincere regret 
that i am resigning from this campaign 
the 47yearold columbus businessman said he has notified the 
franklin county board of elections that he is withdrawing from the 
12th district race gelpi who was running as an independent won 
the endorsement of the democratic party after it was learned that 
michael p brown who ran unopposed in the democratic primary is a 
supporter of extremist lyndon larouche 
brown will face republican us rep john r kasich of 
westerville in the nov 8 election 
shortly after a campaign appearance sept 14 gelpi said he went 
to the hospital after feeling severe chest pains he underwent 
angioplasty a procedure that uses a balloon to open clogged 
arteries near the heart one week later he was again hospitalized 
and again underwent angioplasty 
he said he feels healthy now and will campaign on behalf of the 
democratic presidential ticket and us sen howard metzenbuam a 
democrat who is seeking reelection against republican challenger 
george voinovich mayor of cleveland 
gelpi said he took his doctors advice to withdraw from the 
race but he said his political future looks healthy 
we have a whole bunch of posters bumper stickers and badges 
left none of which say 1988 on them he said smiling were 
going to put them in storage 
he said he has few regrets about his campaign including his 
acknowledgement of his sexual orientation gelpi said at the time 
he wanted to make the issue public to avoid making it a major issue 
in the campaign and to allow him to concentrate on other subjects 
such as health care and housing 
you know people really didnt care they wanted to know where 
i stood on the issues he said im prochoice im 
proteacher they could have found 14 other reasons not to vote for 
me other than im gay

a second victim of a gunmans rampage at 
an elementary school died today a few hours after students and 
teachers returned to class for the first time since the shooting 
spree that also left nine people wounded 
the man accused in mondays shootings at oakland elementary 
school said in an interview published today that he was copying a 
similar rampage by a woman in winnetka ill and also thought of 
the taunting he suffered as a child 
james william wilson 19 said that as he pulled the trigger on 
his grandfathers 22caliber pistol he was remembering being 
picked on by classmates at other schools for being overweight and 
dressing funny the state newspaper of columbia reported today 
eightyearold tequila thomas a thirdgrader hospitalized in 
critical condition since she was wounded died shortly after noon 
today at self memorial hospital said dan branyon a hospital 
spokesman 
another 8yearold girl shequila bradley died at the school 
all of us here at self memorial as well as the community of 
greenwood the state of south carolina and im certain the rest 
of the country join in expressing our deepest sympathy to the 
family of this little girl who put up such a valiant battle for 
life branyon said 
tequila never regained consciousness from the time of her 
arrival at the hospital branyon said 
children in this city 75 miles northwest of columbia returned to 
classes at the 600pupil school a bit nervously this morning 
leah holmes 8 her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound she 
suffered monday shook her head emphatically and said nope 
when asked whether she was scared to return to school but other 
children and parents arriving at the school said they were jumpy 
there was a police officer on every corner of the school grounds 
and at least three officers were stationed at the front of the 
building as parents and children arrived 
were a little nervous but its just been a shock 
primarily said alan maxwell as he walked his daughter katy to 
school 
wilson who is charged with murder was interviewed wednesday by 
the newspaper by telephone at the state hospital in columbia where 
he is undergoing psychological testing relatives have described 
him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out of a hospital 
psychiatric unit during the past eight months 
witnesses said wilson shot pupils who screamed during mondays 
incident 
i thought some of the students in the school were after me 
wilson said in the interview i was trying to make them be quiet 
i feel real bad about what happened 
on may 20 laurie dann killed an 8yearold boy and wounded six 
people in and around a school in the affluent chicago suburb of 
winnetka before killing herself 
i could understand where she was coming from wilson said 
i think i may have copied her in a way 
he said he was thinking about an article about dann that he had 
torn from a june issue of people magazine i read it every day 
he said 
wilson also said he was up all night before the shootings 
reading a book about john wayne gacy who was convicted in 1980 of 
killing 33 men and boys most of whom were buried under his 
suburban chicago house gacy is on death row in an illinois prison 
asked if the book was a factor in the shootings wilson said 
its possible 
he said he had contemplated the shootings a couple of times but 
there wss nothing in particular that triggered the act 
wilson said he remembered little of the shootings it was like 
a fog or a dream he said recalling pupils fleeing through 
windows and blood on a hallway floor where a teacher was shot 
i remember being at the back of the school with my hands up 
and the police arresting me he said i dont remember feeling 
anything 
two teachers who were wounded remained hospitalized today and 
one of six students treated and released was admitted today in fair 
condition complaining of discomfort from her wounds 
physical education teacher kat finkbeiner who was shot in the 
hand and mouth while trying to subdue the attacker and teacher 
eleanor hodge were in good condition branyon said 
oakland elementary principal eleanor rice and other school 
officials talked with about 500 students and parents wednesday 
night to help ease the return to school which has kindergarten 
through fourth grade 
ms rice praised school staff members for trying to protect the 
children 
but it wasnt enough she said each child in oakland is 
loved and loved dearly we do everything in our power to make 
school a healthyplace and a happy place but at this time we feel 
helpless

mayor kurt l schmoke of baltimore advocated 
the legalization of illicit drugs to a house committee thursday but 
received no support from lawmakers 
fellow mayors who appeared as witnesses with him declined to 
endorse his recommendation for legalization but said the idea 
should be researched discussed and debated 
schmoke told the select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
that for the past 75 years the united states has considered illicit 
drugs a law enforcement problem a policy that has not reduced 
addiction or crime 
it has been demonstrated that the criminal law enforcement 
systems ability to do anything about the medical problem of 
addiction is very limited he said and he said law enforcement 
has not only failed to solve the problem of drugrelated crime but 
has worsened it 
let us begin a phasedin process of fighting drug addiction as 
a public health problem not as a crime problem said schmoke 
first he said would be the elimination of criminal penalties 
for marijuana possession and the reallocation of money and manpower 
from interdiction efforts to drug abuse programs 
schmoke said his second recommendation would permit health 
professionals to distribute methadone heroin and cocaine to 
addicts as part of supervised maintenance or treatment programs 
thirdly he would establish an independent commission to study 
substances of abuse including tobacco and alcohol and make 
recommendations on how they should be regulated based upon their 
potential for harm 
if we are going to have a new war on drugs i would rather 
have it led by the surgeon general and not the attorney general 
said schmoke a former prosecutor 
the heavily attended hearing was prompted by a speech and 
subsequent television apprearances schmoke made last spring in 
arguing for legalization and decriminalization of illicit drugs 
mayors edward koch of new york donald c master of charles 
town w va and dennis callahan of annapolis md opposed 
legalization mayor marion barry of washington dc said he 
didnt have an opinion on legalization but thought it should be 
discussed and debated 
committee chairman charles b rangel dny and members 
benjamin a gilman rny and fortney h stark dcalif also 
opposed legalization rep james h scheuer dny said the issue 
should be researched 
koch said the suggestion that drugs should be legalized is 
shocking in part because of the frustration some have had with 
the difficult task of addressing the drug problem the idea of 
legalization has been elevated undeservedly to a place within the 
realm of debatable if not potential policy alternatives he 
said 
when people say that we should legalize drugs because law 
enforcement efforts have failed they ignore the fact that a truly 
effective war has yet to be launched against drugs said koch 
what we really need to do is more not less 
rangel who has long opposed legalization said he was concerned 
about the impact of drugs on the future of the united states 
but unlike some of those have grown weary of this crisis i am 
in no way ready to give up and say that we have fought the fight 
and have lost the war on drugs he said i am not ready to give 
up when we have yet to begin the fight we have not even fired the 
first shot

a 26yearold man has been charged with 
robbing two taverns and shooting to death the man who tried to stop 
him both times police said today 
joseph william riegler a 67yearold widower known as old joe 
was slain tuesday night after intervening in the robberies just 
hours apart at his two favorite taverns 
investigators first believed the robberies were unrelated but 
now have charged patrick obrien kelly with both as well as 
pistolwhipping riegler at the first tavern and shooting him to 
death at the second police spokesman dave simpson said 
riegler was shot to death outside the table tavern in northeast 
portland by a man who walked into the bar with a knife cut the 
cord on the cash register and walked out with the machine 
its the ultimate hardluck story police detective steve 
baumgarte said hes at the first tavern when some guy comes in 
and robs the place he tries to stop him and gets pistolwhipped 
he goes to the hospital is treated and released he ends up 
at a second tavern and that place is robbed baumgarte said 
against the warnings of the other patrons he gets involved 
he follows the robber outside and is shot in the head 
simpson said investigators believe it was a coincidence that 
both kelly and riegler headed for the same tavern after the first 
robbery the man who robbed the table wore a ski mask while the 
robber of the cracker box tavern did not however 
kelly also was charged with trying to kill a police officer by 
ramming his car when officers tried to arrest him simpson said 
detectives began watching kelly after receiving information that 
implicated him in both robberies and arrested him wednesday night 
he said 
he was held without bail pending arraignment this afternoon 
friends said riegler a regular at both taverns took the 
robberies personally 
he felt someone was breaking into his home said george 
dixon owner of the cracker box he liked coming in here he was 
content to have a beer or two and just visit with friends 
in the wake of the killing dixon said he was considering 
closing his tavern 
my feelings are right now that im going to lock this place up 
and close the sucker down for good but when his funeral is over 
he said im going to open it up one more time 
im going to invite all his friends in and well drink a 
toast to him

santa ana winds fanned an arson 
fire and another blaze burning nearly 6000 acres of brush and 
three structures forcing residents to flee and threatening homes 
and other buildings 
up to 150 homes were ordered evacuated just before 5 am today 
and classes at three schools were canceled as flames from one of 
the intense blazes continued to burn out of control and winds 
surged up to 60 mph officials said by late morning it appeared 
the danger had passed as the fire skirted around the development 
it looks like they made it said mary steward spokeswoman 
for the california department of forestry 
the larger fire dubbed the texas blaze had blackened more than 
5200 acres and was just 20 percent contained early today after 
having been about halfway contained the previous day she said 
emergency workers canvassed several blocks of rancho cucamonga 
before dawn urging residents to move to safety at a shelter set up 
in a community center said paula pachon spokeswoman for the 
towns emergency services office 
the texas fire erupted wednesday morning at the mouth of duncan 
canyon 50 miles east of los angeles forestry cmdr john timmer 
said the fire was set but provided no details 
two miles away wind fanned to life the embers of a controlled 
burn near glen helen that was thought to have been doused tuesday 
authorities said more than 1000 firefighters battled the two 
fires 
the verdemont boys ranch a juvenile detention center some 
homes and a high school in the northern rialto area were evacuated 
as a precaution because of the glen helen blaze which covered 
about 675 acres and had been surrounded or contained late 
wednesday before showing signs of flaring up ms steward said 
the texas fire destroyed two outbuildings and a ranch house as 
it weaved among about 60 structures half of them ranch homes 
property losses were estimated at more than 374000 ms steward 
said 
one civilian was treated for smoke inhalation authorities said 
the wind and the low humidity are the primary causes for the 
fire to be spreading so quickly timmer said 
the other blaze erupted in an area where authorities 
intentionally burned overgrown brush the day before said forestry 
spokeswoman lovae praymartines 
fred curtis 73 said a firebreak he cut last spring was all 
that saved his house from flames that leapt about as he rushed to 
put out hotspots 
a quartermile away a chimney and smoldering posts were all 
that remained of another ranch house a gutted pickup truck stood 
in the driveway nearby was a portable swimming pool filled with 
ashes 3 feet deep 
flames licked within a few feet of dave landmessers chicken 
ranch but a sprinkler system for keeping the birds cool stopped 
the flames 
it works good for cooling chickens and it worked good for 
putting out a fire he said after finding only five of his 
175000 birds killed by smoke inhalation 
marcia nave who lives in the hillsabove fontana said she 
loaded her van with jewelry photographs and heirloom guns but 
waited until the last minute to leave 
we had to drive through flames i was afraid of catching the 
van on fire ms nave said as tears formed in her eyes i dont 
know what has happened to my house 
interstate 15 the main link between los angeles and las vegas 
was closed temporarily when flames leaped across it wednesday 
the national weather service predicted northeast winds through 
today because of the santa ana a condition in which air flows from 
high pressure over the great basin of nevada toward low pressure 
off the california coast 
elsewhere in the west more than 1800 firefighters at 
yellowstone national park concentrated their efforts on hot spots 
though warmer weather was forecast recent snow and rain should 
keep the flames down officials said 
to prevent erosion rehabilitation crews began filling in the 
fire lines dug this summer as flames scorched half of the 
22millionacre park

du pont co plans to begin commercial 
production in 1990 of a substitute for one of the most important 
ozonedestroying chemicals the one used in auto air conditioners 
the company announced thursday 
the company said it will spend more than 25 million to install 
a unit at its corpus christi texas plant to make hfc134a a 
shortlived fluorocarbon containing no chlorine that the company 
intends to sell for the refrigeration uses of cfc12 one of the 
chlorofluorocarbon or cfc compounds 
the company said millions of tons of the chemical would be 
produced commercially each year compared with tens of thousands of 
tons available for research from three small pilot plants 
since it contains no chlorine the new compound has no effect on 
the ozone layer when it breaks up in the atmosphere 
joseph p glas director of du ponts freon products division 
said the company had told its foamblowing customers for cfc12 
that it would stop offering the compound for that use when a 
subsititute becomes available next year and it will withdraw 
cfc12 from refrigeration markets as the new compound becomes 
available 
also he said the company would support recycling initiatives 
at auto repair shops to recover cfc12 and process it for reuse in 
cars that need it 
liz cook ozone specialist for the environmental group friends 
of the earth praised du ponts announcement saying du pont is 
clearly trying for the gold medal in the substitute race 
there have been estimates that as much as 75 percent of cfc12 
sold for auto air conditioners is wasted in the replacement 
markets simply thrown away by mechanics and motorists as leftovers 
du pont is taking a significant risk but a risk our board of 
directors insists we take in deciding on production before the 
completion of toxicity testing glas said 
though the industry testing consortium will not begin until next 
year the twoyear laboratory animal studies necessary to establish 
or rule out a chemical as a cause of cancer glas said we have 
very high confidence the acute toxicity is low and testers have 
finished initial screens on mutagenic properties and that looks 
pretty good 
one reason the cfc compounds are so widely used is they are 
normally nonreactive nonflammable and nontoxic it takes the 
powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun normally shielded by ozone 
high in the stratosphere to break up cfc molecules which 
liberates their chlorine to attack the ozone that keeps those 
cancercausing rays from reaching the surface of the earth 
major producing nations agreed last year to cut cfc production 
by 50 percent in 1998 but the environmental protection agency said 
monday its latest analyses show the compounds should be dropped 
around the world dupont the worlds largest producer said in 
march it would end production by the end of the century 
du pont and other companies have announced several cfc 
substitutes but thursdays announcement was the first for the 
important refrigeration market for cfc12 some 90 million vehicles 
use it in air conditioners 75 percent of the nations food is 
chilled or frozen with it and it is in every home refrigerator 
dupont estimates the market at 40 percent of some 330000 tons of 
cfcs used in the united states each year

un peacekeeping troops from the 
iraniraq border to this wardivided island celebrated their nobel 
peace prize on thursday with champagne and a renewed spirit that 
their missions are important 
we are here to keep the peace but winning the nobel prize 
makes you feel good said canadian trooper tony mayfield 22 
he and grant townsend 22 also of canada guarded a crossing 
point linking the greek and turkish cypriot sectors of nicosia 
the 2000strong peace force in cyprus has been maintaining the 
peace since clashes between the greek and turkish cypriot 
communities first broke out in 1964 
the nobel is a feather in the united nations cap it gives us 
an incentive to continue mayfield said 
peacekeepers in jerusalem popped open bottles of champagne as 
the word was passed by radio from outpost to outpost 
five of the seven un peacekeeping forces worldwide are 
stationed in the middle east cyprus southern lebanon israels 
northern and southern borders syrias golan heights and the 
iraniraq border 
the others are along the indiapakistan border and in 
afghanistan 
spokesmen said the prize was a tribute to the thousands who 
serve in difficult conditions nearly 10000 peacekeepers wear the 
blue beret that has come to symbolize the uns role in monitoring 
truces and trying to prevent bloodshhed 
the nobel committee recognizes that the quest for peace is a 
universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the 
world said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
pvt mike mahony 26 of cork ireland said he hoped the award 
would make unifils job easier in lebanon i feel proud i 
suppose well get more respect now mahony said in a telephone 
interview 
it is a very happy occasion that our work is appreciated it 
is always good news when people say you are doing good work said 
major jh buhl of the 340member danish contingent on cyprus 
a duty officer from bangladesh at the headquarters of the nearly 
2monthold un iraniraq military observer group heard the news 
from a reporter 
it is exciting said the officer who refused to give his 
name he said the men at the front will know that their job is 
worth doing 
timor goksel unifil spokesman in lebanon said the 
international community has finally given appropriate recognition 
to all the sacrifices our people have made 
lt gen martin vadset chief of staff of the un truce 
supervision organization in jerusalem said the award recognized 
the un peacekeepers success in preventing conflicts from 
escalating 
we have lived through all the wars you can think of and one 
might say that we have been unsuccessful in preventing them said 
vadset a norwegian but we have been successful in being 
available to minimize disaster when it first broke out 
i think the committee chose exactly the right time to give 
the prize to the peacekeepers said brian urquhart the british 
un undersecretary who set up the peace forces until he retired in 
1985 
un peacekeeping officials in finland which contributes more 
troops than any other country said they hoped the nobel peace 
prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially 
ailing forces 
the united nations is in arrears in payments to countries which 
provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces it owes finland 225 
million

here is the announcement by the nobel 
committee on thursday that the un peacekeeping troops won the 
1988 nobel peace prize this is the committees official 
englishlanguage version 
the norwegian nobel committee has decided that the 1988 nobel 
peace prize is to be awarded to the united nations peacekeeping 
forces 
the peacekeeping forces of the united nations have under 
extremely difficult conditions contributed to reducing tensions 
where an armistice has been negotiatied but a peace treaty has yet 
to be established 
in situations of this kind the un forces represent the 
manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through 
negotiations and the forces have by their presence made a decisive 
contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations 
it is the considered opinion of the committee that the 
peacekeeping forces through their efforts have made important 
contributions towards the realization of one of the fundamental 
tenets of the united nations 
thus the world organization has come to play a more central part 
in world affairs and has been invested with increasing trust 
the peacekeeping forces are recruited from among the young 
people of many nations who in keeping with their ideals 
voluntarily take on a demanding and hazardous service in the cause 
of peace 
in the opinion of the committee their efforts contribute in a 
particularly appropriate way towards the realization of the goals 
of the united nations

thirtytwo months of anxiety and 
frustration burst into exuberance and relief as the space 
shuttle discovery roared away thursday and broke through a cloud of 
doubt over space workers across the country 
this is a very very special mission to us all said john 
kaltenbach an 18year nasa employee who watched at johnson space 
center in houston as a senior advance system specialist for 
lockheed corp there was probably more apprehension and 
excitement in this one this one had to fly 
relief absolute relief it feels so good kaltenbach 
exulted 
john hotz who covered the early days of the us space program 
for aviation week amp space technology magazine and later served on 
the presidential commission that investigated the challenger 
disaster said this is about as emotional a flight as i ever 
witnessed 
i didnt cheer i yelled im still trying to get everything 
under control hotz said 
jr thompson director of the marshall space center broke out 
a footlong royal jamaica cigar to celebrate inside the kennedy 
space center control room he said there was a progression of 
smiles thumbsup signs cheers and finally a roar as the 
discovery passed each of its initial postlaunch tests 
outside the neighboring vehicle assembly building here hundreds 
of workers left their stations inside to whoop and cheer along with 
the launch that allowed them to again look ahead to a morestable 
space program than the revisions layoffs firings and uncertainty 
that followed the jan 28 1986 challenger explosion 
unique super great all those good words forrest 
mccartney kennedy space center director said as he slapped backs 
and grabbed hands to shake 
its an indescribable boost to morale mccartney said the 
sole job of these people is to do what they did today its been a 
very long time for them this was their living their masterpiece 
today 
everybodys going out to buy a house now said a security 
guard as the workers shook hands and began laughing on their way 
back to work 
at the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala space 
workers wearing the green ribbons and clothes symbolizing go 
for discovery prayed clapped then cheered as at other space 
centers many sported the back to the future buttons with the 
unofficial theme for the discovery mission 
my feeling came at 8 minutes when the engines went off 
said jerry cox a senior engineer who worked on the shuttles main 
engine ive been involved with that for 2 years and it was a 
tremendous relief when that point came 
in brigham city utah a tearful mayor peter knudson called the 
launch one of the greatest moments of my life 
utah is home to some 8000 employees of morton thiokol 
designers of the 126foot solid rocket boosters a faulty joint 
seal on a challenger booster was blamed for the explosion 
unlike for the first manned spaceflights and the apollo 
moonflights he observed as a reporter hotz was here watching to 
see how nasa had reacted to the sharp criticism of the rogers 
commission he belonged to the latemorning delay while some 
unusual wind conditions were studied were part of the new caution 
of a morehumble nasa he said 
im very pleased with nasa they really took the lesson of 
challenger to heart hotz said 
some former nasa employees said the launch was long overdue 
i think it was real important to get back in space again 
said sam beddingfield a retired nasa manager who now has a private 
space consulting firm im disappointed that it took so long now 
they can get going again 
at the kennedy space center larry kuznetz remained cynical 
about the space programs future because of political vagaries 
the problem is we dont have a commitment to space said 
kuznetz involved in thermal tile development spacesuit testing 
and other aspects of the shuttle mission before he left nasa in 
1984 now a teacher for the bostonbased international space 
university which seeks international cooperation in space research 
and study kuznetz said the class he taught at university of 
californiaberkeley built a fullscale replica of the challenger in 
the two years after the tragedy 
i was drawn back here like a magnet he said 
after the panic the witchhunt the fingerpointing i think 
this will be very good kuznetz said adding quietly this kind 
of closes a loop

the house adopted and sent to the senate 
thursday a compromise 143 billion foreign aid bill that shifts 
emphasis to grants rather than loans for us military assistance 
to friendly countries the vote was 32792 
house and senate negotiators in an allnight session last week 
set up a program for overseas arms sales that will provide 38 
billion in outright grants and 410 million in loans made on 
favorable terms during the fiscal year that begins saturday 
the agreement also retained the current military assistance 
program with grants in fiscal 1989 totaling 467 million 
as ususal the largest recipients of military and economic aid 
are israel and egypt which receive hefty support because of their 
1979 peace treaty israel would get 12 billion in economic and 
18 billion in military assistance while egypt would get 815 
million in economic aid and 12 billion in military aid all of 
the military aid for both would be in the form of grants 
the foreign aid bill has been remarkably without controversy 
this year in part because of last years agreement between the 
reagan administration and congress that smoothed the way for the 
years money bills 
if given final senate approval and sent to president reagan it 
would be the first time in seven years that a separate foreign aid 
bill has been approved usually the measure has been rolled into 
catchall spending bills in congress rush to adjourn the reagan 
administration has indicated its support for this years compromise 
measure 
in one provision that briefly threatened to undo the compromise 
the bill would provide 50 million as the first of six yearly 
installments toward recapitalizing the world bank which makes 
loans to developing countries 
house members had objected to the provision on wednesday 
delaying the measure by a day opponents argue that increasing 
loans to thirdworld countries without first demanding economic 
reforms is counterproductive and some conservatives oppose the 
bank because they say it makes loans to communist countries but 
the money ultimately was left in the bill as part of the overall 
compromise on a vote of 30390 
among other provisions in the bill 
2 million for internal opposition parties in nicaragua to be 
provided through the national endowment for democracy the money 
cannot go to any group that supports the contra rebels or other 
armed opponents of the leftist sandinistat regime the amount is an 
increase from this years 800000 and is to go for union 
organizing buying supplies for opposition media and political 
training 
101 million for international narcotics control programs run 
by the state department a 2 million increase from the current 
fiscal year the increase is to fund drug eradication and 
interdiction efforts particularly aerial herbicide spraying of 
coca plants 
35 million for jamaica for use in recovery from damage 
caused by hurricane gilbert earlier this month 
other major aid allocations include the philippines which would 
get 125 million in military aid 124 million in economic aid and

would get 500 million 500 million in military aid and 60 
million in economic aid for turkey and 350 million in military

the soviet union released the first photos of its 
secret space shuttle thursday in a move that appeared timed to 
steal some of the thunder from the launch of discovery 
photos of the soviet craft which looks just like the american 
shuttle moved on the wires of the official tass news agency at 
about the time the discovery was scheduled to blast off from cape 
canaveral 
along with the photos of the soviet craft the agency 
transmitted a brief dispatch on the american launch 
the soviet shuttle previously was not shown to the soviet or 
foreign public although some western reconnaissance photographs of 
the craft or mockup versions have been taken 
the tass photos showed the soviet spacecraft against a twilight 
sky with its blacktipped white wings and fuselage the letters 
cccp russian for ussr were written in red on one wing 
staterun soviet television did not broadcast the discovery 
launch live but showed only a film clip of the american craft 
sitting on the launch pad in darkness an announcer read a report 
on the blastoff during a regularly scheduled newscast a few minutes 
later 
the evening television news program vremya which is watched by 
millions of soviets showed still pictures of the soviet shuttle as 
its third item and said that ground tests of its equipment were 
continuing it showed film of the discovery launch about 20 minutes 
later 
radio moscows international newscast also juxtaposed reports 
about the us takeoff with updates on the soviet space station mir 
meaning both earth and peace with three cosmonauts aboard 
despite repeated comments by soviet officials that their shuttle 
has a distinct design and capabilities the tass photographs 
indicated it was quite similar to the american version the soviet 
shuttle under development since at least 1982 has deltashaped 
wings like its american counterpart and is mated to its booster 
rocket the energia in a similar way as the american craft 
mir was pictured in front of the huge energia booster which can 
carry payloads of up to 100 tons much more than the american 
shuttle 
in the photos the booster and shuttle stood upright on tarmac 
apparently at the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia but 
it was not clear if it was stationed at a launchpad 
soviet officials have said their shuttle will be launched by the 
end of 1988 but have not given an exact date they have 
acknowledged technical problems are causing delays 
they also point to the jan 28 1986 explosion of the us 
shuttle challenger which caused a 2year suspension in the us 
manned space program as an example of the hazards they are trying 
to prevent the soviet shuttles first flight is to be unmanned 
the energia booster has been tested once on may 15 1987 when 
it successfully carried aloft a dummy spacecraft 
soviet program also has had difficulties this month soviet 
officials said they have lost radio contact with one of two mars 
probes launched in july in addition the reentry to earth of a 
soviet and an afghan cosmonaut aboard a space capsule that docked 
with mir nearly failed because of equipment problems and human 
error 
the soviets main goal has been to maintain a continuous manned 
presence in space cosmonaut crews have been aboard the orbiting 
space station mir without a break since february 1987 
yuri romanenko set a space endurance record last year by staying 
in space 326 days and officials have said they expect the two 
cosmonauts currently aboard the craft to break romanenkos record

as dan quayle and lloyd bentsen turn their 
attention to debate briefing books experts predict their showdown 
next week could be the most important ever between two men vying 
for the vice presidency 
the pressure is on both candidates next wednesday night in 
omaha largely because of the controversy surrounding quayles 
national guard stint at the height of the vietnam war and his 
admission to law school 
this debate could be decisive in the election and never 
before could you say that about a vice presidential debate said 
joel l swerdlow who edited a volume on presidential debates and 
has written extensively on the subject 
this is the first time in modern history that a vice 
presidential candidate may fail to pass the threshold of 
acceptability said kathleen jamieson of the university of texas 
an expert on politics and the media 
quayle spent thursday in briefings here and looked ahead to a 
weekend of tutelage from roger ailes the bush campaigns media 
guru bentsen snatched time to study during a light campaign 
schedule before returning here late friday for two days with top 
democratic advisers 
the nation has seen only two vice presidential debates 
republican bob dole vs democrat walter mondale in 1976 and 
republican george bush vs democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 
although mondale and bush were considered victors in those 
contests dole passed the threshold of acceptability and for most 
people so did ferraro said jamieson quayle however is a 
question mark to a large number of voters she said 
the stakes are very high for quayle she said 
both jamieson and swerdlow said quayles performance is 
particularly important because his choice has been linked so 
closely to bushs judgment 
he could cost bush a close election jamieson said 
much has been said and written about the low expectations for 
quayle and how that might be an advantage for him in the debate 
if he can appear the equal of lloyd bentsen hell score an 
overwhelming victory said jamieson 
but low expectations can also hurt 
people will be disposed to hear errors as errors unlike 
minor flubs forgiven in last sundays debate between bush and 
michael dukakis jamieson said debates tend to reinforce views of 
a candidate that people already have and in quayles case a 
stumbling performance will not be forgiven she said 
bentsen on the other hand has the burden of showing himself of 
presidential timber while not talking down to quayle and at the 
same time trying to score hits against bush 
you cant make fun of someone and the standard bentsen 
oneliners from the campaign trail wont work in a debate said 
swerdlow 
with an eye toward the debate the bush campaign tried this week 
to display confidence in quayle including a joint appearance by 
the two republicans 
hes been accused of lacking in every skill social and 
otherwise but hes a good campaigner and we expect him to do well 
in the debate said sheila tate bushs spokeswoman bentsen 
has to defend quayles position because most of them are his own 
i think he will squirm she said a reference to bentsens many 
differences with dukakis on the issues 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said quayle will pursue the 
republican argument that bentsen is more attuned to gop attitudes 
than those of dukakis 
quayle is going to go after the top of the ticket the fact 
that bentsen is more closely aligned with our ticket doesnt 
hurt he said 
the texas senator this week unleashed his harshest attacks yet 
on his junior colleague from indiana ill tell you if they were 
elected id pray for the good health of george bush every night 
bentsen said wednesday 
bentsens chief of staff joseph oneill said bentsen will try 
to tie quayle closely to bush to show that our team is better 
than their team 
privately bentsens aides say theyre worried bentsen 67 will 
look and sound old when put next to quayle who is 26 years younger 
both sides have viewed tapes of an april 22 broadcast of public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour on which bentsen and quayle 
debated the issue of giving workers 60 days notice before a plant 
could be closed 
quayle eventually lost the battle on the senate floor but on 
television he presented his case attractively while bentsen looked 
gray 
while quayle plans to work this weekend with ailes bentsen has 
been working with michael sheehan a consultant who specializes in 
making candidates look good on television 
bentsen returns to washington friday for two days of meetings 
and briefings he travels sunday back to texas for final 
preparations including mock debates with democratic rep dennis 
eckart of ohio playing quayle 
top republicans including labor secretary ann mclaughlin and 
former secretary of state henry kissinger have already briefed 
quayle who will remain in washington until debate day except for a 
friday fundraiser in pennsylvania 
in mock debates quayle is using sen bob packwood of oregon a 
longtime colleague of bentsens on the senate finance committee

flags waved cameras clicked and tears 
flowed as a smallerthanexpected crowd of about 250000 people 
along floridas space coast cheered the shuttle discovery liftoff 
late thursday morning 
oh my gosh it was great said 11yearold tommy mathis of 
detroit it was neat watching it just looked like a ball of 
fire at first going up and it went into a cloud halfway up 
as soon as it went out it was beautiful he said 
patricia mathis 33 his mother said tears just streamed down 
her face 
i thought the most intense part was when they realized they 
were past that challenger stage challenger blew up 73 seconds 
after launch on jan 28 1986 killing its seven astronauts 
the crowds turned out to be far smaller than the 1 million 
authorities had been advised to prepare for mitch varnes a 
spokesman for kennedy space center said reports of the large 
crowds may have kept some away 
but those who risked traffic jams and launch delays seemed more 
than satisfied they came 
theres an awful lot of people that this means a whole bunch 
to that it didnt mean a thing two years ago said robert 
zsolczai a butcher from miami who has seen 16 shuttle launches he 
arrived wednesday night but said he had a hard time settling to 
sleep in his van which was decorated with signs wishing nasa and 
the discovery crew good luck 
every 20 minutes youve got to look at it the shuttle make 
sure its there and all that he said before launch and im 
not the only one theres a lot of them that do that with 
binoculars they sit here all night they know its there but 
youve got to keep reassuring yourself 
many people were sleeping in cars parked along side us 1 as 
the sun rose thursday lines grew long at restrooms at gas stations 
and restaurants after they woke up 
by midmorning traffic in titusville had slowed to a trickle as 
attention turned eastward toward the shuttle which could be seen 
across indian river 
mettemari wolden 23 of larvik norway prolonged her stay in 
the united states to see discoverys launch it will probably be 
something ill have a memory of for the rest of my life she said 
woody poynter 32 of sacramento calif flew into orlando 
wednesday where he was unable to find a car to rent the cab 
driver who picked him up at the airport however offered to drive 
him to titusville when he came with his family 
the crowds along the indian river overlooking the space center 
counted down the final few seconds with a nasa announcer heard on 
radios and broke into shouts of encouragement as discovery lifted 
off 
they quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer 
of clouds but the yells began again when it reappeared and became 
louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes 4 
seconds after launch that the boosters had separated a booster 
flaw was blamed for the challenger accident 
moments later the crowds began heading for their cars and home 
joan heller a spokeswoman for the brevard county sheriffs 
office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a 
quartermillion people were on hand although no formal count is 
attempted 
its about the same size or smaller than the first launch 
larger than the most recent launches but not nearly as big as 
anticipated she said 
no arrests major traffic problems or health problems were 
reported 
three us senators and about 20 congressmen traveled from 
washington to watch the launch among them were the three lawmakers 
who have flown in space sen john glenn dohio the first 
american to orbit the earth and sen jake garn rutah and rep 
bill nelson dfla both of whom have flown on shuttle flights 
some 2000 government officials dignitaries and other nasa 
guests watched the launch at a vip viewing site about 6 miles away 
from the launchpad actor john travola who said hed love to go 
into space was among them 
its a frontier that has hope and future and thats important 
to all of us as a group said travolta who said he is an avid 
jet pilot

only half the elementary and secondary school 
students in this country take world history courses according a 
panel of scholars that said thursday an educational crisis is 
creating a nation of historical illiterates 
and the little history that is taught often is seriously 
inadequate according to the bradley commission on history in 
schools 
history should not just be a mad dash through the centuries 
with teachers trying desperately to get to the 1980s before school 
lets out in june said kenneth t jackson mellon professor of 
history and social sciences at columbia university and chairman of 
the commission 
if history is to be properly taught and understood teachers 
must have enough time to provide context for facts and training in 
critical judgment based upon evidence he said 
the 17member panel of university historians and public school 
teachers released a report building a history curriculum 
guidelines for teaching history in schools in which it urged 
that history be required of all students whether or not they are 
preparing for college 
history is in crisis when half of our students do not study 
any european history or world history and one child in seven 
doesnt study american history is it any wonder they dont know 
what side germany was on in world war ii or know what we mean by 
the holocaust jackson told a news conference thursday 
the commission was created in 1987 in response to widespread 
concern over the inadequacy both in quantity and quality of the 
history taught in american elementary and secondary schools 
the report said the number of required courses in history had 
declined while other social disciplines and new fields sex and 
health education driver education and computer education 
expanded their roles in the basic public school curriculum 
it noted that four states require world history for high school 
graduation 12 states have an optional or combination world history 
requirement while 34 have no world history requirement and four 
more have no us history requirement although these courses may 
be offered or required by local school districts there are no 
acrosstheboard state requirements 
when we look at the level of debate in this presidential 
campaign we can see one of the consequences of having a 
historically illiterate public said diane ravitch of columbia 
university its pointless to talk about a new deal democrat 
when the public doesnt know what the new deal was 
one of the major candidates is not quite sure when pearl 
harbor was at least he knows what pearl harbor was she said 
ravitch outlined the commissions recommendation that social 
studies in grades kindergarten through 6 be historycentered and 
that local and state school districts require the study of history 
during four of the six years in grades 7 through 12 
other recommendations included 
the inclusion of the historical experiences of women racial 
and ethnic minorities in africa the americas asia and europe in 
all curricula 
elementary and secondary social studies curricula that provide 
a core of history and geography 
social studies teachers in middle and high schools must have 
completed a substantial history program at the college or 
university level 
university history departments should offer survey courses 
featuring world history western civilizaton and american history 
local school boards and supervisors should give teachers 
authority to design their own courses and methods and teach from 
their own individual strengths 
textbook publishers should stop overloading their schoolbooks 
with facts and go back to telling a good story built around 
questions that are meaningful to students

when chief buffalo called chippewa 
leaders to madeline island to sign a treaty 134 years ago friday 
he wanted to make sure the tribe could stay near the island it 
considered sacred his great great granddaughter said 
buffalo would not have signed a treaty if he had believed his 
children and grandchildren could not enjoy the fruits of the 
earth said victoria gokee a member of the red cliff chippewa 
band and a local indian historian 
but chief buffalos wishes remain in dispute today 
indians claim in the treaty of 1854 which ceded lands to the 
federal government they retained the rights to hunt spear fish 
and gather wild grain in northern wisconsin 
federal courts agree but how those rights are exercised is 
undecided a hearing on that issue is scheduled next month in us 
district court in madison 
some opponents of treaty rights have called for congress to 
abrogate the agreements arguing the treaties are outdated and 
unfair 
each spring tensions over the treaty rise as chippewas spear 
walleyes prized by sportsmen 
in an interview on the mainland with madeline island in the 
background gokee 57 retold the story passed down from her 
ancestors describing the gold and promises at the treaty of 1854 
signing the treaty was the last in a series of agreements that the 
lake superior band of chippewa made with the federal government 
more than 100 indians rowed or took canoes or other boats to the 
lake superior island where federal government agents met them with 
barrels of whiskey and gold gokee said each indian was supposed 
to receive a cup of gold she said 
she said according to her grandfather the indians never 
received the gold 
in gokees view the anniversary of the signing is not much to 
celebrate 
we never were the ones who wanted a treaty and with every 
treaty we lost something she said 
fear of losing their proximity to madeline island was the reason 
why buffalo signed the 1854 treaty that promised reservations for 
what are now 14 bands of the tribe that live in wisconsin 
minnesota and michigan she said 
thenpresident zachary taylor had issued an order for the 
chippewas to leave the land despite earlier treaties that allowed 
the indians to remain on the land unless they misbehaved 
buffalo couldnt bear to leave the burial grounds on the 
island gokee said 
the island was also considered sacred by the tribe because of 
chippewa legends and the medewin religion she said 
according to legend a woman on the island had placed her baby 
in a cradleboard on a tree and the child disappeared 
they say he returned to the island as an old man years and 
years later gokee said 
the legend says the spirits taught the child the code of the 
medewin religion which he then taught to the indian people gokee 
said 
in another legend the chippewa tribe was supposed to be where a 
shellshaped light shone in the sky she said the light had been 
with the tribe many many years ago farther east but it 
disappeared and hardships followed according to the legend 
tribal elders sent scouts to find it and the lights final 
resting place was over madeline island gokee said 
some nonindians living on the island still speak of the light 
today said gokee she said she has never seen it

relieved members of congress hailed the 
successful launch of the space shuttle discovery on thursday as a 
rebirth of the nations exploration of space 
several senators watched the launch on television sets in the 
republican and democratic cloakrooms then walked to the floor to 
applaud the achievement 
after nearly three years of down time after thousands of 
design changes the us space shuttle discovery has just blasted 
off from cape canaveral returning america to space sen howell 
heflin dala said to a gallery filled with visitors

ur minds and weighs heavily on our hearts heflin said in 
referecne to the explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger 
and killed its seven crew members 
but he said the nation was right in refusing to be discouraged 
by the accident which had grounded the us manned spaceflight 
program 
not exploring the limitless bounds of space would constitute a 
tragedy greater than the one we experienced in 1986 heflin said 
space is the greatest adventure of our times and any nation that 
sees itself as a great leader cannot and must not ignore it 
were back in space said sen ernest f hollings dsc 
chairman of the senate space committee that oversees the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
and more than anything else this reaffirms our commitment 
he said the commitment has been questioned for the last two 
years but now were back and with that commitment well attract 
the best and the brightest to the program 
sen thad cochran dmiss said this is a day when we can all 
take pride in our country 
it is a great day for the exploration of the universe 
heflin added 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas strode from the gop 
cloakroom minutes after the launch to report to sen richard 
shelby dala who was presiding 
straight up about 100 miles up dole said with a grin 
how long is the mission shelby asked 
four days one hour dole replied 
and then referring to congress struggle to adjourn for the 
year he added they are going to stay up there until we leave

more than 1000 journalists at a 
remote press site cheered discoverys majestic liftoff thursday 
but also expressed disappointment that new safety rules prevented 
them from a closer view 
tremendous its more than i thought said an excited james 
miller with a public television station in houston seconds after 
viewing his first launch 
prompted by air force concerns that the complex 39 press site 
could be bombarded by falling debris if the solid rocket boosters 
malfunctioned only 1800 reporters were allowed to work from the 
main press site 
the new rules forced miller and other reporters to view the 
liftoff at the alternate press site more than six miles away from 
the from discoverys launchpad 
despite the spectacular liftoff reporters at the remote site 
were envious of their colleagues who viewed the launch from only

the market stabilization price of raw cane 
sugar in the 1989 fiscal year that begins oct 1 will be up 
slightly to 218 cents per pound the agriculture department said 
thursday 
acting underscretary richard w goldberg said the new rate 
compares with 2176 cents per pound in the current year 
the msp as it is called is a market price objective a 
computed level at or above which producers would be more likely to 
repay price support loans and sell their sugar in the marketplace 
if market prices are below the msp producers are inclined to 
forfeit their sugar to the government instead of paying off their 
price support loans 
included in the computation for the msp is the governments 
price support loan rate of 18 cents per pound plus allowances for 
transportation costs and interests on loans to make the total of

soldiers on the front lines of the united 
nations 40 year quest for peace won the 1988 nobel peace prize on 
thursday for steadfast duty in the cross fire of the worlds 
conflicts 
the nobel committee said the un peacekeeping troops built 
greater faith in the united nations which has come to play a 
more central part in world affairs 
un leaders praised the award but appealed again for the 
release of a us marine kidnapped while serving with un 
peacekeepers in lebanon 
the award could bolster new un peacemaking efforts to oversee 
shaky truce agreements in the persian gulf and afghanistan 
in jerusalem peacekeepers broke open bottles of champagne to 
celebrate the prestigious award as the word was passed by radio 
from outpost to outpost five of the seven peacekeeping forces are 
in the middle east 
we are here to keep the peace but winning the nobel prize 
makes you feel good said canadian trooper tony mayfield 22 who 
guards a crossing point between greek and turkish sectors of 
nicosia the capital of cyprus 
nearly 10000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve 
under the un flag peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to 
iran and iraq under a ceasefire negotiated in the countries 
8yearlong war 
there is great joy said timor goskel spokesman for the 
un interim force in lebanon he spoke from unifil headquarters in 
naqoura lebanon 
the citation from the nobel committee made up of five 
norwegians said the troops showed the worlds determination to 
settle disputes peacefully it said they made a decisive 
contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations 
some peacekeepers carry light arms but they can fire only in 
selfdefense the united nations says 733 peacekeepers have lost 
their lives since 1948 
lt col william r higgins who headed the 76member un 
supervision group in south lebanon is among nine american hostages 
in lebanon higgins 43 was seized feb 17 
for us it is a no 1 priority that this officer who was 
serving the united nations who was wearing the blue beret when he 
was kidnapped should be released without delay said un 
undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding 
the prize was an indirect tribute to secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar who was not eligible because he was nominated 
after the feb 1 deadline 
perez de cuellar speaking to applause at the un general 
assembly in new york said the nobel committee showed that the 
quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the 
nations and peoples of the world 
the un chief said he would accept the prize in oslo on dec 
10 the anniversary of benefactor alfred nobels death in 1896 
nobel was the inventor of dynamite 
the prize carries a cash award of 25 million swedish kronor 
worth 390000 today 
un officials did not say how the money would be used the 
peacekeeping operations cost about 230 million a year and 
officials say that likely additional operations in southern africa 
western sahara and cambodia will raise the total to 15 billion to 
2 billion annually 
committee chairman egil aarvik confirmed that president reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev were among the 97 candidates 
and were seriously considered for the prize 
he did not explain the committees decision but he said when 
asked if the presidential election was a factor yes we take 
everything into consideration also that 
reagan congratulated the peacekeeping forces 
no i didnt deserve it as much as they did reagan told 
reporters at the white house it was an admirable decision 
reagan and gorbachev were nominated for signing a treaty to 
dismantle landbased intermediaterange missiles the first accord 
to reduce the superpowers nuclear arsenals 
aarvik told reporters he hoped the prize would give the un 
and the forces increased prestige 
the award reflected a trend adopted by the committee of trying 
to use the coveted prize to influence events 
last year the panel made no secret that it wanted to encourage 
the central american peace process by giving the prize to costa 
rican president oscar arias 
the award comes at a time of growing respectibility but mounting 
financial difficulty for the united nations despite reagans 
decision to lift a suspension of more than 500 million the united 
states owed in dues 
in scandinavia alone the un forces are in arrears to norway 
for 36 million and to finland for 225 million sweden pulled out 
of the cyprus peace force last year to protest the uns failure 
to pay for the troops but stayed in other forces 
it was the fifth time that a unrelated body won the peace 
prize since it was first awarded in 1901 it also was the 16th time 
that an organization rather than a person has won the prize 
previous winners included the un high commissioner for refugees 
amnesty international and the red cross 
the nobel prizes for medicine economics physics and chemistry 
are to be announced next month in stockholm sweden

theres no place like home said 
dorothy in the wizard of oz but wheres home 
not kansas says a chesterton town board which believes dorothy 
would rather have been a hoosier 
the town board has launched a tongueincheek custody battle 
with kansas over dorothy 
the board passed a resolution declaring chesterton home of one 
of the nations largest wizard of oz festivals as the hometown of 
oz heroine dorothy gale 
jean nelson founder of the chesterton oz festival gathered 336 
signatures on a petition in favor of the resolution approved 
monday 
ms nelson who owns the yellow brick road shop said she 
decided to push for custody of dorothy after some kansas officials 
said they were shunning oz publicity because the movie does not 
promote kansas in a favorable light 
sonya woertz a spokeswoman for the kansas department of 
commerce said the objections arise from scenes in the mgm movie 
that portray dorothy as bored with life in dreary flat kansas 
we decided since dorothy has been trying to go home for the 
last 49 years and since kansas doesnt want her we decided to 
make her a hoosier ms nelson said thursday 
a copy of the resolution will be forwarded to kansas gov mike

soviet officials have informed the united 
states they plan to ease restrictions that prevent many soviet 
citizens from emigrating the state department said thursday 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the soviets spelled out their 
position last week in two days of talks during the visit here of 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
we welcome the reform process under way in the soviet union 
mrs oakley said noting that the soviets promised to allow free 
emigration in a 1975 agreement 
she added however with even with these changes not all 
individuals will be able to exercise their right to leave the 
soviet union 
she said the united states will continue to urge the soviets to 
uphold their commitments 
according to us estimates soviet jews have been emigrating at 
the rate of 2000 per month this year and the total for 1988 could 
be the highest since 51000 emigrated in 1979 
american officials insisting on anonymity said the soviets 
plan to repeal a requirement that soviet citizens receive an 
invitation to leave from close family members living abroad as a 
condition for their departure 
another proposal would waive the current requirement that a 
child receive parental approval to leave the country the officials 
said

federal health officials said thursday that 
hospitalization rates have fallen in the 1980s for four major types 
of cancer even though the number of people suffering from the 
diseases has not fallen in all cases 
the national centers for disease control reported that 
hospitalization rates for breast cancer lung cancer colon and 
rectal cancer and cervical cancer all have declined during the 
decade the rates are calculated by looking at records of hospital 
discharges 
hospitalization rates do not necessarily reflect trends in the 
numbers of people with various cancers said dr james mendlein a 
cdc researcher some cancers may require more followup hospital 
stays than others and the effort to cut the cost of health care 
also can influence the number of times a patient is hospitalized 
he noted 
this gives you just one measure of the health care impact of 
various cancers mendlein said 
the drop in hospitalization rates parallels the drop in the rate 
of occurrence of cervical cancer colorectal cancer and male lung 
cancer mendlein said on the other hand while hospitalizations 
for breast cancer and female lung cancer are declining somewhat 
the incidence of those two diseases continues to increase he said 
for 1986 the latest year for which figures are available the 
cdc estimates hospital discharge rates as 
breast cancer 172 per 100000 people down from a peak of 199 
in 1983 
lung cancer male 142 per 100000 down from a peak of 182 in 
1984 
lung cancer female 83 per 100000 down from a peak of 100 in 
1983 
colorectal cancer 86 per 100000 down from a peak of 92 in 
1981 
cervical cancer 46 per 100000 down from a peak of 89 in 1976 
a national cancer institute report earlier this year put breast 
cancer at its highest rate in history and it is still the leading 
cause of cancer death among women lung cancer the leading cause 
of cancer deaths overall is increasing among women and decreasing 
among men 
when studying hospital discharge rates incidence or 
occurrence is just one of the forces mendlein said there are 
other economic forces as well 
he noted that such factors as shifts in medicare policy and 
trends in outpatient treatment could change the rates of hospital 
visits for various diseases

nasa launch supervisors met thursday 
morning to consider the effect of lighterthannormal winds and 
chose to waive agency guidelines that would have prohibited the 
space shuttles latemorning liftoff 
the winds did not violate our safety factor said thomas 
utsman deputy director of the kennedy space center nonetheless 
he confirmed it did require a waiver of launch rules 
it wasnt taken lightly he said it was not a result of a 
judgment but a refined engineering analysis 
robert crippen the veteran astronaut who heads a new launch 
oversight team convened his unit to consider the waiver officials 
said waivers are controversial because investigations of the 
challenger disaster indicated that officials had granted waivers 
that allowed the flawed booster rockets to continue flying without 
redesign 
thursdays dilemma arose because weather officers expected a 
shuttle to hit autumn headwinds of nearly 100 miles an hour between 
20000 and 50000 feet as it climbed to orbit 
spacecraft computers were programmed to permit the shuttle to 
operate in this environment responding to the winds with 
spacecraft changes designed to keep the ship safe and on course 
but weather balloons launched wednesday indicated y were coming from 
combined with 
the computer program could cause damage to tiles on the leading 
edge of discoverys wings 
a computer program devised for springseason flights would have 
provided data to compensate for the light winds officials said 
it was too late to change the computer program for a launch on 
thursday so engineers worked through the night to reconsider the 
wind rules they had set for discoverys launch its something 
engineers call a model 
our model was very conservative said utsman we were able 
to refine our model and found we have 4 to 5 percent more 
structural margin 
that he said would provide enough of a safety margin for 
discoverys computer if the winds would just shift to a more 
westerly direction 
but a balloon dispatched early today indicated the wind was 
still from the northeast unacceptable for launch another balloon 
two hours later showed a gradual shift to the northwest and a 
slight decrease in velocity moves that continued through 
subsequent balloon flights 
utsman said the combination of reduced winds and their shift in 
direction enabled engineers to feel comfortable they could launch 
under terms of the new model launch was delayed 98 minutes but 
took place at 1137 am edt

un leaders praised the organizations 
peacekeeping forces after they won the nobel peace prize on 
thursday but they pleaded for a us marine kidnapped while 
serving with a un group in lebanon 
for us it is a no 1 priority that this officer who was 
serving the united nations who was wearing the blue beret when he 
was kidnapped should be released without delay said marrack 
goulding who leads the peacekeepers as un undersecretary for 
political affairs 
lt col william r higgins commanded a 76man group attached to 
the un interim force in lebanon when he was abducted feb 17 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth claimed 
responsibility and said higgins would be put on trial for spying 
us and un sources deny higgins was a spy 
he was one of those unarmed observers attached to unifil in 
southern lebanon i would like to take this opportunity to repeat 
an appeal which has been made so often in the past to those who 
are holding him to release him without delay said goulding 
gouldings call for higgins release was the only somber note at 
the united nations 
everybody from the 38th floor to the basement is delighted 
that the nobel committee awarded the peace prize to un 
peacekeepers worldwide said un spokesman francois giuliani 
goulding had no comment on how the 390000 prize will be used 
if the prize money is donated to un peacekeeping budgets it 
wont make much of a dent in the peacekeeping deficits 
on aug 31 un documents show that members owed 325 million 
to the un interim force in lebanon and owed the un 
disengagement observer force on the golan heights and the un 
emergency force between egypt and israel 45 million 
members also owed the un force in cyprus 1581 million by the 
end of july said goulding 
he estimated 400000 to 500000 people have worn the blue helmet 
or beret of the un peacekeeping force and said 9991 soldiers 
now are in the force supported by about 2000 civilian personnel 
all were honored by the award 
in awarding the peace prize to the peacekeeping forces of the 
united nations today the nobel committee recognizes that the quest 
for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and 
peoples of the world perez de cuellar said in a statement to the 
general assembly 
brian urquhart the former undersecretarygeneral in charge of 
un peacekeeping who retired in 1986 said the award honors the 
733 soldiers who died on observer missions 
but it is also a recognition of this important pioneering 
concept which uses military personnel in a nonviolent role to 
promote peace an idea whose time has come and will go far he 
said 
perez de cuellar has invited urquhart and goulding to accompany 
him to oslo norway to accept the prize dec 10 on behalf of the 
peacekeepers said giuliani 
goulding said perez de cuellar is making continuous and 
vigorous efforts with all those who may have influence with those 
who are holding col higgins to get him released he added 
in a separate interview the chief us representative to the 
world body vernon a walters also recalled higgins 
let us never forget that among those peacekeeping forces that 
received the nobel peace prize is lt col higgins and he is 
hostage today and whose liberation we expect walters said

spanish authorities are preventing a police 
detective from testifying about three ira guerrillas he trailed 
through spain before they came to gibraltar where british 
commandos killed them a witness said wednesday 
gibraltar police inspector manolo correa told an inquest that 
the unidentified spanish officer had sent him a statement 
expressing a desire to testify about the march 6 slayings but 
correa said the officer told him several days ago his superiors 
would not let him testify 
spain maintains a long dispute with britain for the return of 
sovereignty over gibraltar a british colony at the southern tip of 
spain it was ceded to britain in 1713 
news reports in spain and britain have indicated the spanish 
police kept the three ira members under surveillance until they 
crossed into the colony hours before being shot 
correas testimony came on the 17th day of an inquest by 
gibraltar coroner felix pizzarello and an 11man jury into the 
shooting deaths of mairead farrell 31 daniel mccann 30 and sean 
savage 24 
pizarello after hearing correas testimony ordered that a new 
effort be made to seek the spanish lawmans testimony 
the ira has acknowledged the three victims were on active 
service meaning they were on a mission to strike at british 
targets at the time of their deaths 
british commandos have claimed that they killed the three 
unarmed guerrillas because they feared the guerrillas were about to 
detonate a radiocontrolled bomb in a car parked about a mile away 
the inquest has no power of prosecution but is to determine 
whether the shootings were lawful 
if the jury decides upon a verdict of unlawful killing the 
gibraltar attorney general is expected to hand down criminal 
indictments gibraltar sources said 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
have singled out the gibraltar ira shootings as evidence of an 
unofficial government shoottokill policy against the outlawed 
irish republican army 
the predominately roman catholic ira has carried out a violent 
campaign to force the end of british rule in mainly protestant 
northern ireland it sharply increased its attacks on british 
soldiers after the gibraltar slayings

the illinois supreme court on thursday 
upheld john wayne gacys 1980 convictions and death sentence in the 
sexrelated killings of 33 young men and boys but prosecutors said 
years of appeals remain likely 
gacy is not at the head of the line for execution i wish he 
was said kevin sweeney chief of deathpenalty litigation for 
the cook county states attorneys office who called gacy the 
best illustration of why we have the death penalty in illinois 
thursdays ruling issued without written dissent marked the 
second time the states highest court has turned down an appeal by 
gacy convicted of more murders than anyone else in us history 
unless the state justices agree to reconsider their ruling a 
request that is rarely granted the 46yearold gacy has exhausted 
his appeals in illinois courts however he still can pursue a 
lengthy appeals process in the federal courts 
the latest court decision comes nearly a decade after the 
gruesome discovery of 27 bodies of young men and boys in a crawl 
space of gacys suburban chicago home two more bodies were found 
elsewhere on the property and four were recovered from nearby 
rivers 
the former contractor and amateur clown told police that he had 
strangled all but one of his victims by wrapping rope around their 
necks and twisting it with a stick and that he had had sex with 
some of his victims before killing them 
gacy was sentenced to death for 12 killings and to life in 
prison for the remaining 21 he also was convicted of deviate 
sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child but was 
not sentenced on those charges 
the convictions and death sentence were first affirmed by the 
illinois supreme court in june 1984 and the us supreme court 
refused to hear his appeal in march 1985 a cook county circuit 
judge refused to grant gacy a new posttrial hearing in september 
1986 
in thursdays ruling the state supreme court rejected arguments 
that defense testimony at gacys trial was improperly restricted 
and that his trial attorney failed to present evidence at a death 
penalty hearing that might have spared gacy from a death sentence 
the court noted that while psychiatrists testifying for the 
defense were not allowed to quote from statements by gacy they 
were allowed to paraphrase statements on which they based their 
conclusions 
the justices also noted that mitigating evidence such as gacys 
warm relationship with his family and friends and his good behavior 
in prison had been presented at trial to the same jury that 
imposed the death penalty 
we believe that defense counsel could reasonably have 
believed that jurors would not have been impressed and might 
actually have been irritated by a pointless rehash of the lengthy 
testimony they had already heard at trial justice william clark 
wrote in the courts opinion 
the court set a jan 11 1989 execution date which would be 
extended by appeals gacy is one of more than 100 men on death row 
in illinois which has not conducted an execution since 1962

house speaker jim wright accused republicans 
on thursday of carrying out a political vendetta against him but 
the minority countered that wright was simply trying to duck 
charges that he improperly disclosed classified information 
the comments came as angry personal charges flew back and forth 
between leadership figures of both sides of the political aisle 
ive never seen this thing get out of control like it is 
now said rep tony coelho the democrats no 3 leadership 
official in the chamber coelho accused gop leaders of trying to 
tear down the institution and of caving in to rightwing 
elements of their party who seek to embarrass wright 
the relationship between the parties is very strained 
agreed rep dick cheney of wyoming the chambers thirdranking 
republican he said exchanges were far more acerbic than normal 
wright dtexas told reporters that gop efforts to have the 
ethics committee investigate whether he violated house rules by 
talking publicly last week about a cia covert action in nicaragua 
are groundless and motivated by politics 
it is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics 
committee or any other committee of the house as a cats paw to 
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another 
member he said 
i can take it wright said as speaker im in the 
kitchen and im not offering to get out 
but republicans called democratic counteroffensive a dodge and 
said wright simply was seeking to escape the consequences of his 
mistake by stirring up a partisan smokescreen 
the speakers most recent transgressions have energized a lot 
of us on our side cheney said i dont think the house can 
duck this they democrats know theyve got a problem 
some moderate democrats were saying privately that while they 
were proud of the legislative record of the 100th congress under 
wrights leadership they were uncomfortable with his highly 
visible role in us diplomacy toward central america 
that role assumed center stage again last week when wright in 
response to a reporters question said he had clear testimony 
from the central intelligence agency that us agents had sought to 
prompt civil unrest in nicaragua to provoke a crackdown by the 
leftist sandinista government and scuttle peace talks 
cheney and house minority leader robert michel rill quickly 
asked for intelligence and ethics investigations of wright to 
determine whether he had violated house rules against disclosure of 
classified material 
members in both parties saw the participation of michel who 
for years has taken a less confrontational tack in dealing with the 
majority as a turning point in democratrepublican relations in 
the chamber 
the tensions surfaced on the house floor thursday after one 
democratic lawmaker rep pat williams of montana denounced gop 
vice presidential nominee dan quayle for hypocrisy in voting 
against the job corps then telling job corps recruits at a texas 
campaign appearance that we believe in you 
republican members bristled and demanded that williams be ruled 
out of order williams then asked that his remarks be stricken from 
the record but in so doing repeated the hypocrisy charge at least 
three times 
seeking to deal with the wright controversy the intelligence 
committee met wednesday and declined on a partyline vote to turn 
over to the ethics committee relevant classified information 
democrats reasoned that there was no obligation to do so because 
the material had not yet been requested officially 
in a statement issued thursday michel said the lack of action 
compelled him to ask republican members of the intelligence 
committee to prepare a confidential report to him outlining their 
recommendations on what to do about the allegations concerning 
wright he said that could lead to a request for unspecified action 
by the full house to guarantee the integrity of house rules and 
procedures 
coelho dcalif said the intelligence meeting was forced by 
republicans who knew the panel would have to decline to release 
the information 
what you have now is an effort thats very political very 
aggressive and loaded with grenades he said attributing the 
whole controversy to republican frustration over being the minority 
party in the house since 1956 
the republicans problem in the house is that we dont take 
them seriously republicans in the senate dont take them seriously 
and the white house doesnt take them seriously coelho added 
i wonder what tonys smoking cheney said when apprised of 
the comments the real problem is the speaker and the way he 
operates hes trashed the cia damaged us foreign policy in 
nicaragua all of tony coelhos blue smoke and mirrors wont 
change that

negotiations friday but the producers contend their terms are 
final and that there is no room for more bargaining 
key issues include overtime rules salary rates and guidelines 
for the making of nonunion films bush has called the producers 
offer the worst contract offer ever made to a union 
if the teamsters walk out monday it will mark the second 
entertainment industry strike this year the writers guild of 
america struck from march until august and hollywood production is 
only now returning to full speed 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg said the strike by the 
2200member teamsters union local would not cripple the film and 
television industry 
we have trained drivers and were ready to continue production

space shuttle discovery carried the 
american flag back into space thursday after a 32month absence 
its five astronauts riding a 700foot tail of flame from rockets 
meticulously redesigned after the challenger disaster 
everyone certainly stood tall today said kennedy space 
center director forrest s mccartney as discovery settled into 
orbit 184 miles above earth mission control said the ship was 
performing nominally 
it was the first launch since the challenger explosion with its 
toll of seven lives on a cold winter day shocked the nation and 
stopped the manned space program in its tracks 
we sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we 
should be discoverys commander navy capt frederick hauck 
told mission control were looking forward to the next four days 
we have a lot to do and were going to have alot of fun doing 
it 
liftoff was the first and most important milestone but more was 
at stake than simply getting into space the 2year grounding of 
the shuttle fleet set back the nations satellite delivery 
capability and release of a communications satellite was the main 
order of business in orbit six hours after launch 
the giant tracking and data relay satellite is a 100million 
twin of the craft that was destroyed aboard challenger 
in washington president reagan praised the launch saying the 
shuttle was headed into orbit and america is back in space he 
saluted the bravery of the crew and added we ask god to bless 
this important voyage 
launch at 1137 am edt came only after nasa waived weather 
guidelines to allow for flight through some lighterthanusual 
florida winds the 98minute delay simply heightened the tension as 
nasa unveiled a spaceship that underwent more than 400 
modifications since the challenger flight 
just how well the discoverys booster rockets performed in their 
new design awaited detailed analysis but jr thompson who 
directed the work from the marshall space flight center in alabama 
said from everything i see everything looks great 
haucks veteran flight crew consisted of air force col richard 
covey marine lt col david c hilmers john m lounge and george 
d pinky nelson landing was scheduled for monday at edwards 
air force base in california 
the astronauts had said all along they were treating the mission 
as a test mission a shakedown flight in the words of covey 
and they quickly ran into firstflight problems a water evaporator 
that provides cooling to the ship during the climb to space and 
return to earth was partly clogged with ice and a device that 
provides electrial power to move an orbital steering engine was not 
working 
neither problem was critical flight director gary coen said 
engineers were devising ways of thawing the evaporator before it is 
needed again and that backup power was available to turn the 
steering engine 
to the delight of a quartermillion people gathered on river 
banks and highways and an ecstatic nasa team in launch control 
discovery lifted off its seaside pad and streaked into cloudy 
skies it remained in view less than a half minute but the tension 
was considerable and the sight was unforgettable 
anxiety was highest as the ship went through a 30second period 
of severe aerodynamic stress it was during this stage of the 
flight that one of challengers booster rockets failed and 
triggered the jan 28 1986 catastrophe 73 seconds after liftoff 
some television viewers reported what they thought was an errant 
flame shooting from the left booster rocket about 90 seconds after 
liftoff officials said an analysis revealed a harmless phenomena 
that causes flame from the exhaust to climb up the side of the 
rocket 
it was not particularily unusual said nasas steve nesbitt 
cheers rang through launch control as the ship lifted and 
director robert sieck kidded his team later i knew you couldnt 
hold it after a few long years youve got to let it out another 
nasa official said the firingroom emotion dwarfs sts1 the 
first shuttle flight and all the others 
discovery an american flag on its left wing was making its 
seventh spaceflight

the boston globe did not libel thengov edward j 
king when it said in a 1981 column that he tried to influence a 
judges sentence in a gang rape case a jury decided thursday 
after little more than two hours of deliberations the suffolk 
superior court jury decided that the globe was wrong when it 
published a nov 8 1981 column by david farrell saying king had 
called a judge and demanded harsher sentences in the case 
but when asked if king had convinced them that the column 
discredited him in the minds of any considerable and respectable 
class of the community the jury answered no 
sixteen jurors began deliberating in the 6yearold case after 
judge james p lynch jr instructed the panel on libel law 
the jurors were working on a special verdict slip that posed a 
series of questions beginning with whether the column was true 
king needed to prevail on each question or else lose his lawsuit 
after the verdict a composed king left the courtroom with his 
wife jody and his attorney robert goldman and declined to say 
how the verdict might affect his political plans king had said he 
would consider running for governor again if he won 
we did the best we could king said adding he did not 
consider the lawsuit a waste of time because now we know that 
something the globe never retracted was a false statement 
king who joined the republican party after losing the september 
1982 democratic primary to gov michael s dukakis filed suit in 
january 1982 against the globe and several editorial employees 
asking for 36 million 
king said he and his lawyer would decide on an appeal within 30 
days 
its terrific to have been vindicated this is a victory for 
freedom of the press said boston globe attorney joseph kociubes 
i always felt i did a good job writing the column said 
farrell who now works as a freelance public relations agent 
the jury heard closing arguments wednesday after six days of 
testimony 
king testified the column amounted to a charge of obstruction of 
justice that struck him like an ice pick in the ribs and caused 
him to lose sleep on more than 1000 nights since publication 
on crossexamination king acknowledged that he never publicly 
denied making the call and kociubes argued that king who was 
thinking of suing the globe before the column made no showing of 
financial social or political harm 
farrell testified he was told about kings purported call to 
judge herbert abrams by state treasurer robert q crane an old 
friend and a reliable source about massachusetts politics 
crane testified he was the source but could not recall who told 
him about the call 
under libel law a public figure such as king has the burden 
of showing not only that a publication was false but also that it 
defamed him further the governor must show that the column was 
published with actual malice that is with knowing falsity or 
with reckless disregard for the truth 
lynch instructed the jury that reckless disregard means that 
farrell and the globe entertained serious doubts about the truth 
of the statement 
the judge said such doubt could concern the source but he said 
that mere failure to investigate cranes tip by itself did not 
constitute libel

some television viewers were alarmed 
thursday to see what looked like flame spewing from the side of a 
booster rocket after discovery blasted off but experts attributed 
it to a phenomenon of physics and said the shuttle was never in 
danger 
at goddard flight space center in maryland there were reportedly 
gasps and moans at what seemed to be flames licking up the 
shuttles solid rocket boosters less than a minute before 
separation from the ship it looked to some like a ghastly replay 
of the challenger disaster in which a flame from a joint in a 
booster rocket blew up the shuttle 73 seconds into flight 
as reporters and people at home including former space 
employees watched televised reruns calls began pouring into 
newsrooms while space officials studied tapes to be sure there was 
no problem 
a former nasa employee who didnt want to be identified called 
the beloit kan daily call and said nasa apparently was lucky 
said publisher gary hilt 
in terms of flames that somebody might report i dont have 
any information said steve nesbitt the voice of kennedy space 
center mission control where officials who reacted jubilantly to 
the launch quickly asked booster experts to analyze tapes of the 
launch as the concerned queries began 
but officials of the marshall space flight center in alabama 
who are responsible for the operation of the boosters said the 
flash was no cause for alarm 
its predictable repeatable said royce mitchell solid 
rocket manager from marshall who was at kennedy space center for 
the launch 
he recalled a similar flickering after the discoverys first 
liftoff in 1984 
its just a basic law of physics mitchell said terming it 
reverse flow separation 
mitchell said that as shuttle begins to roll the booster plumes 
the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in normal 
operation sometimes converge and the hot particles recirculate 
he compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding 
motorcycle instead of his jacket flapping out behind it is 
plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle 
marshall center director jr thompson celebrated with a 
jamaican cigar and officials said they were confident about the 
boosters performance 
everything looks normal everything looks good mitchell 
said 
divers had reached the reusable boosters and their first quick 
look indicated no problems he said 
mitchell said as soon as the recovery ships towed the boosters 
to port friday night well look at them almost immediately 
everybody wants to look at this first joint and youre 
looking at the guy who wants to look at it first

the family of three aidsexposed hemophiliac 
brothers who were once barred from school settled a civil rights 
suit against the school district for more than 11 million 
thursday 
under a settlement between louise and clifford ray and the 
desoto county school district the couples three sons each will 
get 820 a month for the next 10 years for a total of nearly 
100000 apiece 
the parents will each get 50000 now and about 300 monthly for 
30 years the total to each parent including a builtin 3 percent 
inflation rate amounts to more than 220000 
judy kavanaugh the rays attorney said that as far as she knew 
it was the first time that damages were won by an aids victim for 
violation of civil rights 
the settlement to be paid by the school districts insurance 
company includes an additional 387500 for attorney fees plus 
50000 for court costs 
the brothers ricky 11 robert 10 and randy 8 probably 
were exposed to the viris that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome through plasmabased medication to clot their blood all 
three have hemophilia an inherited disease that keeps blood from 
clotting 
none of the boys has developed aids but the oldest ricky has 
developed aidsrelated complex which can be a precursor to the 
deadly disease he is being treated with the antiaids drug azt 
the two sides outlined details of the agreement in an appearance 
before us district judge elizabeth kovachevich she praised both 
sides for settling the dispute without a trial 
the trial had been set to begin monday in fort myers 
the settlement marks the end of the rays complaint that school 
officials violated their sons civil rights by refusing to allow 
them to attend memorial elementary school in arcadia in 1986 and 
1987 for fear of spreading the deadly disease experts say the 
disease cannot be spread by casual contact 
the boys finally were admitted under federal court order in 
august 1987 over objections of angry parents who staged a 
weeklong boycott that cut school attendance in half 
at the end of that week the rays home was burned by an unknown 
arsonist the family then moved to sarasota where the boys now 
attend school 
the settlement did not require school officials to admit any 
negligence in the way the boys or their family were treated 
according to james westberry school board chairman 
the lawsuit had accused school officials of abusing their power 
depriving the boys of their rights because they were handicapped 
and helping create an atmosphere of hatred against the boys in 
arcadia 
it was better this way thinking about the length of time 
involved said mrs ray after the settlement was approved 
she said she hopes the school board members have learned as 
much from this situation as we have you shouldnt be afraid of 
someone who has aids because you cant catch it and if you have a 
disease you shouldnt have to be ashamed of it 
patrick e geraghty attorney for the insurer national union 
fire insurance co said he would have preferred to go to trial but 
agreed to settle in an effort to have the matter resolved and put 
behind everyone 
at the time the boys were excluded school officials contended 
that not enough was known about aids for them to be completely 
certain there was no risk to other pupils

the onetime deductible that medicare 
beneficaries will have to pay out of their own pockets if 
hospitalized next year will be 560 the department of health and 
human services announced thursday 
that is an increase of 20 from this year and goes along with a 
310permonth rise in the optional part b premium that helps pay 
doctor bills 
because of new provisions in the catastrophic health insurance 
law that will take effect jan 1 there will be only a onetime 
hospital deductible for medicare beneficiaries next year no matter 
how many times they might be hospitalized 
under existing law the deductible 540 in 1988 could be 
charged for each hospitalization 
the 560 deductible for 1989 made official with publication in 
the federal register is the same amount that had been projected in 
debate leading up to passage of the catastrophic coverage act 
by law the deductible is pegged to increases in hospital costs 
and hhs officials had a pretty good idea of how much those costs 
were rising even before the final formal tabulations were done 
technically the deductible would go down if average hospital costs 
ever fell 
the regular part b premium charged beneficiaries to help cover 
the cost of doctor bills paid by medicare will increase from the 
present 2480 a month to 2790 that too is in line with 
earlier projections hhs officials told congress several months ago 
they estimated the 1989 part b premium would be about 28 a month 
in addition to the regular part b increase that is pegged to 
program costs already incurred a flat premium of 4 per month to 
help pay for new benefits under the catastrophic coverage will 
begin in january making the premium 3190 per month per person 
the 4 linked to the increased catastrophic benefits is 
mandatory while the 2790 is voluntary 
as a practical matter however almost all of the 31 million 
medicare enrollees about 98 percent voluntary take the part b 
doctor bill coverage because it buys protection they could not 
purchase on the private insurance market at anywhere near the same 
price 
current law requires that part b premiums paid by beneficaries 
must equal 25 percent of the total costs of the physician 
remimbursement program the rest is paid by tax revenue 
like the hospital deductible the part b premium is adjusted 
each year according to a formula pegged to actual costs the 
preceeding year 
part b outlays a direct reflection of the amount the nations 
doctors charge the federal government for medicare patients are 
the fastest rising segment of the federal budget

the senate gave a near unanimous stamp of 
approval thursday to the first major welfare overhaul in over half 
a century seeking to turn the system into a gate of opportunity 
rather than a longterm trap 
for the first time in its halfcentury existence the us 
senate has moved to an entire redefinition and overhaul of what 
weve come to know as our welfare system said sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny the leader of the effort 
the vote on the final version of the family welfare reform act 
was 961 with sen jesse helms rnc the lone opponent the 
bill was headed for house approval friday and from there to the 
white house where president reagan has expressed satisfaction with 
it 
the hardwon bipartisan compromise the result of a summer of 
seesaw negotiations centers on a largescale work education and 
training program to be aimed primarily at welfare mothers support 
services such as child care would be available to program 
participants and those moving into lowwage jobs 
in early 1987 we had a process that many of us never really 
thought would be complete said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan lo and behold here we are today with a bill we can 
support 
moynihan said that under the revamped system welfare will no 
longer be a permanent or extended condition instead he said 
the new system will stress work child support and lastresort cash 
supplements while encouraging the needy to get the education and 
training needed to avert longterm dependence 
sen bob packwood rore a key supporter of the drive said 
theres no guarantee the bill will work but if it does only half 
of what we hope its an immense step forward he said what we 
have had does not work that we can say with certainty 
the fiveyear 33 billion compromise plan is modeled largely 
on moynihans senate bill which passed 933 in june its job 
opportunities and basic skills program starts out at 600 million 
in 1989 rising to 13 billion by 1995 when states would have to 
be serving 20 percent of eligible recipients 
the bill also requires that starting in 1991 all states provide 
benefits to twoparent unemployed households only 27 now do so 
the other 23 could limit benefits to six months in a 12month 
period 
the final compromise contains some provisions that house 
liberals found hard to swallow among them a 16houraweek 
workfare requirement for one adult in twoparent families receiving 
welfare the requirement effective in 1994 would kick in for that 
relatively small group only if an intensive twomonth job search 
failed 
conservatives called it the first step toward a wider work 
requirement while liberals complained bitterly about slavery and 
punishment some discontented house members were expected to vote 
against the bill but they are a minority 
the least controversial aspect of the welfare overhaul is its 
opening section designed to step up child support payments from 
noncustodial parents the section requires automatic 
wagewithholding when a court awards support and a higher rate of 
paternity establishment by states 
it makes a statement about what our society believes the role 
of parents should be said sen thad cochran rmiss an 
original sponsor of the moynihan bill parents should provide for 
their children 
the current welfare system aid to families with dependent 
children serves 37 million families including 7 million 
children afdc costs the federal government about 85 billion a 
year in cash benefits

prices farmers got for raw products in 
september rose 07 percent from august including the highest wheat 
prices in almost seven years the agriculture department said 
thursday 
but the rise from august to september was the smallest monthly 
increase since the drought began cutting 1988 harvest prospects and 
triggered rising prices last spring 
after holding steady during most of the winter the usda index 
rose 31 percent from april to may followed by 22 percent in 
june 29 percent in july and 21 percent in august 
mostly as a result of the drought and searing heat during the 
spring and summer us grain production is expected to be down 31 
percent from last years harvest 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for grapefruit milk and 
wheat contributed most to the september increase lower prices for 
hogs oranges and broiler chickens partly offset the rise in other 
commodities 
the september prices averaged 12 percent higher than a year 
earlier prices of some major commodities are based on midmonth 
averages and then are revised the following month when additional 
information is available 
the midseptember prices for corn soybeans and wheat were 
higher than the respective averages for the month of august the 
report said the allwheat price was at the highest level since 
november of 1981 
but the report added that hog prices dropped off sharply 
from august and continued well below the high prices sustained 
during the last half of 1986 and in most of 1987 
prices of meat animals as a group dropped l8 percent from 
august and averaged 35 percent below the level of september 1987 
dairy products climbed 33 percent from the august price 
average overall but still lagged a year earlier by 38 percent 
the report said milk prices paid to farmers were up 40 cents per 
100 pounds from august but were 50 cents below the yearago level 
the departments allcrops price index for september was up 3 
percent from august and averaged 32 percent more than a year ago 
soybeans at 842 per bushel were up 9 cents from august and 
wheat averaged 382 per bushel up 21 cents 
prices of fruit as an overall average were up 39 percent from 
august and 22 percent from a year ago the report said commercial 
vegetables were up 41 percent from august averaging 20 percent 
more than in september 1987 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 55 
billion to 60 billion this year compared with the record level of 
571 billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
department officials have predicted that the drought may add two 
percentage points to food prices in 1989 above the expected 
increase in inflation currently forecast at around 4 percent that 
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 
7 percent 
the report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay 
to meet expenses those are reported quarterly and the most recent 
figures released in july showed farm production costs were up 24 
percent from april averaging 49 percent more than in july 1987 
the report said 
cattle averaged 66 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 6590 in august and 6370 reported for september 1987 
those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4030 per 100 pounds compared with 4470 in 
august and 5430 a year earlier 
corn at 271 a bushel was up from 265 in august and the 
average of 149 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 382 per bushel compared with 361 in august and 254 
a year earlier 
rice averaged 730 per 100 pounds compared with 742 in 
august and 432 a year earlier 
soybeans were 842 per bushel compared with 833 in august 
and 502 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 52 cents per pound compared with 
526 in august and 649 cents in september 1987 
eggs were 638 cents per dozen compared with 581 cents in 
august and 582 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1220 per 100 pounds compared with 1180 in august 
and 1270 a year earlier 
broilers were 392 cents per pound live weight compared with 
419 cents in august and 313 cents a year ago

sarah brady whose husband was shot along with 
president reagan in 1981 said thursday the majority of house 
members defeated a handgun waiting period because they didnt 
have the guts to stand up to the national rifle association 
she said the house caved in to the nras lobbying against 
the legislation in an election year and added that some lawmakers 
turned tail after promising handgun control inc they would 
back the waiting period 
mrs brady is vice chair of the gun control organization which 
lobbied along with law enforcement organizations for a sevenday 
waiting period with an optional police background check 
mrs brady contended that the nra leadership which once 
supported waiting periods has become more extreme and no longer 
represents its membership 
nra president joe foss who was in the audience for mrs bradys 
talk said afterwards im no extremist he said the 
organizations leadership does represent its members adding i 
am out there with them i have a pretty good pulse 
whenever you lose people always say it wasnt a fair fight 
foss a former world war ii flying ace and a onetime south 
dakota governor was elected to a twoyear term as nra president in 
april 
mrs brady the wife of presidential press secretary james 
brady spoke at the national press club her husband was seriously 
wounded when shot in the head by john w hinckley jr in his march 
30 1981 assassination attempt on the president 
the house voted 228182 on sept 16 to delete the proposed 
sevenday waiting period from an antidrug bill despite the 
wellcoordinated policegun control group lobbying effort 
the vote which followed a strong nra campaign against the 
language substituted a plan designed to allow gun dealers to 
quickly identify convicted felons seeking to buy pistols the house 
bill ordered the justice department to devise an identification 
system in six months and present it to congress 
the brady forces argued that criminals could easily buy guns in 
the 28 states without a waiting period while the nra said a 
waiting period would only hurt lawabiding citizens 
while the house passed the overall drug bill the senate has yet 
to consider its own antidrug legislation 
although both sides concede the chance for a waiting period is 
dead for the year senators could decide to approve an 
identification system 
mrs brady said in her speech im disappointed at the caliber 
of members of congress who didnt have the guts to speak up to one 
of the most powerful lobbies in washington i have experienced the 
power of the nra 
predicting that lawmakers would have less fear of supporting 
gun control in a nonelection year mrs brady vowed to try again 
for the waiting period in 1989 
until congress comes to terms with its own conscience more 
blood is going to be spilled she said referring to killings 
with handguns 
the law enforcement community is mad theyre ready to do some 
heavy lobbying after the vote on the brady bill they were irate 
purchasing guns she said shouldnt be as easy as buying 
bubble gum

a second little girl died thursday of 
wounds received in a gunmans rampage at an elementary school and 
her classmates returned to school to find police guarding the 
grounds and teachers ready to help them through the tragedy 
tequila thomas 8 a thirdgrader at oakland elementary school 
died about 1230 pm never having regained consciousness since 
she arrived at self memorial hospital after the shooting three days 
earlier said hospital spokesman dan branyon 
oakland principal eleanor rice said the parents of the schools 
600 students seem to have had most of their fears calmed since 
james william wilson opened fire monday reportedly focusing on 
children who cried 
in a newspaper interview published thursday wilson said he was 
sorry about what happened and said he was patterning his actions in 
part on a chicagoarea womans rampage in may 
pupils many accompanied by their parents returned to school 
thursday to find the grounds edged with police officers at least 
one child still wore a sling on her arm from the wound she received 
monday 
mrs rice said staff members met with counselors wednesday to 
learn how to help their pupils deal with the shootings 
weve not had any calls suggesting students didnt want to 
come the principal said some of our students have some fears 
and were going to work through that 
certainly anything of this magnitude its going to take some 
time to recover 
leah holmes 8 her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound shook 
her head emphatically and said nope when asked thursday 
morning if she was scared to go back to school but other children 
and parents arriving at the school were less sure 
were a little nervous but its just been a shock 
primarily said alan maxwell as he walked his daughter katy to 
school katy said she didnt hear the gunshots but remembers a 
teacher coming into her classroom and telling everyone to duck 
under their desks 
teachers took the children on tours of the building thursday 
including the cafeteria where much of the shooting took place to 
satisfy the childrens curiosity schools superintendent robert 
watson said at a news conference 
there were a variety of different activities in the classroom 
where they allowed the children to act out some of their 
feelings watson said 
several teachers felt they saw a lot of anger a lot of 
getting feelings out about the killer he said 
our absentee rate today was a little bit above normal he 
said fortythree children were out including those who were sick 
he said 
wilson 19 of greenwood is being held on two murder charges and 
undergoing psychological testing at the state hospital in columbia 
police and witnesses said he walked calmly through the school 
monday morning shooting two teachers and nine pupils before 
surrendering 
relatives have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has 
been in and out of a psychiatric ward during the past eight months 
self memorial hospital spokesman branyon said tequila had been 
wounded in the neck and chest and her condition had continued to 
deteriorate she died thursday with her family at her side the 
other victim shequila bradley 8 died at the school monday 
two teachers remained hospitalized in good condition thursday 
and one of the students treated and released monday was readmitted 
to the hospital listed in fair condition lashonda burt 8 was 
hospitalized again because she was complaining of discomfort from 
her wounds branyon said 
the state newspaper reported thursday that wilson said that 
during the shooting he was thinking about other crimes he had read 
about and the teasing he received while in school for being 
overweight and dressing funny 
i thought some of the students in the school were after me i 
was trying to make them be quiet i feel real bad about what 
happened wilson told the newspaper 
he said he had stayed up all night before the shootings reading 
a book about john wayne gacy who is on illinois death row for 
killing 33 men and boys wilson said its possible the book was 
a factor in the shootings 
the newspaper said he also mentioned a magazine article about 
laurie dann the 30yearold baby sitter who shot six children in a 
chicagoarea elementary school in may before killing herself an 
8yearold boy died 
i could understand where she was coming from i think i may 
have copied her in a way wilson told the newspaper

after 32 months and long agonizing 
minutes thursday the sight of the shuttle discovery reaching for 
space didnt bring a cheer from flight controllers at mission 
control 
they stared at their screens intently and held back no applause 
when discovery passed 73 seconds into flight none until they were 
sure it was going to be ok 
two minutes and 4 seconds into flight when discovery separated 
from the solid rocket boosters those at the controls here broke 
into applause 
it was the boosters that caused the challenger explosion 73 
seconds into flight 
throughout the countdown and launch mission control was calm 
yet tense red and white carnations adorned the desk of the flight 
director gary coen a goodluck gift from the security division of 
the johnson space center 
at 1010 am cdt coen polled the room to see if conditions 
were set to go the decision to go brought a thumbsup sign of 
encouragement from two nasa veterans tommy holloway manager of 
mission operations and eugene kranz director of mission 
operations and the team director during the apollo 13 crisis 
i felt like that as the spacecraft was going into orbit the 
mood was staying down to business i dont think there were too 
many people that were reflecting or being moody for that first 8 
minutes and 40 seconds coen said later during a press briefing 
thursday afternoon 
im sure that there were a lot of people me included that 
were very happy postmeco after the engines shut down that we 
were back in the space business coen added 
visitors in a viewing room were seen biting nails and clenching 
fists as liftoff neared 
jay green chief of nasas safety program and flight director 
for challenger stood in the back of the room hands on a 
bannister staring down 
the room was quiet when discovery lifted off except for cheers 
from the spectators after the controllers applause for the solid 
rocket booster separation mission control fell quiet again until 
the main engines cut off then more cheers 
were going into space said public information officer jeff

the chairman of a senate panel that oversees 
the internal revenue service accused the reagan administrations 
irs on thursday of failing to pursue bigtime operators who deal in 
cash and dont file tax returns 
sen david pryor dark cited a june 1986 irs internal audit 
which concluded that the agency needs to do a better job of 
enforcing a law requiring the reporting of cash transactions over 
10000 the audit found that in many cases banks file the cash 
reports as required only to have the irs ignore them 
this is an outrage pryor said in a senate speech these 
people are walking into our financial institutions with 
wheelbarrows and suitcases full of cash money and the banks are 
telling the irs who and where they are the irs has their 
addresses and yet no one from this administration so much as 
knocked on their door 
pryor was responding to speech wednesday in which vice president 
george bush accused democratic rival michael dukakis of advocating 
the unleashing of an army of new irs agents to collect enough money 
to balance the budget 
dukakis is calling for more irs personnel to reduce the 
estimated 85 billion annual gap between taxes owed and paid 
instead of criticizing dukakis proposals pryor said bush 
should be explaining why the administration has failed to pursue 
the big spenders identified by the reports 
pryor who chairs the finance subcommittee on the irs released 
portions of an irs analysis of a sampling of cashtransaction 
reports filed with the agency current systems do not assure that 
taxpayers with significant currency transactions are considered for 
examination audit or that currency activity is evaluated during 
examinations the irs document read 
of 924 individuals identified as having made large cash 
transactions only 680 filed tax returns the irs concluded 
only 211 of the 680 tax returns were examined or classified 
the average currency activity by the 211 taxpayers was 228000 we 
reviewed 67 of the 211 cases in 61 instances ctr currency 
transaction report information was not considered in determining 
the correct tax liability the irs found 
of the 244 cases in which tax returns wer not filed 
investigations of a tax delinquency were begun in only 47 
no action was taken for the remaining 197 individuals the 
report stated these 197 individuals had currency activity for 
1982 averaging 183000 each 
we spend millions of dollars each year to collect this 
information yet this administration has failed to use it pryor 
said 
the report is two years old based on data from 1982 irs 
spokesman wilson fadely said the irs has taken a number of 
actions since then 
for example fadely said data on cashtransaction reports are 
now provided to district offices for use by collection personnel 
auditors soon will be implementing a system that gives auditors in 
district offices computer access to information on cash reports 
while an examination is under way

a father and son accused of trying to smuggle 
spare missile parts to their native iran blamed each other in 
opening arguments in their federal trial here thursday 
us customs agents arrested ahmad and majid modarressi in 
january at a suburban boston railyard where they allegedly had come 
to buy 280000 worth of electronic tubes for hawk antiaircraft 
missiles 
an attorney for the father ahmad modarressi 64 of tehran 
iran and istanbul turkey told the jury that majid 30 arranged 
the deal and never told his father it was illegal 
but an attorney for the son who lives in cincinnati with his 
american wife maintained that he acted only as a translator for 
his father and was a very naive person who did not understand 
what the elder modarressi was trying to buy and ship to iran 
defense attorneys said after the court session that they hoped 
the jury would clear both men 
i guess the best possible outcome would be if they found majid 
was just an airhead and the elder modarressi didnt know it was 
illegal said hugh scott attorney for the father 
the defense attorneys had asked for separate trials but the 
motion was denied by us district judge mark wolf 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney richard sterns said the 
modarressis were arrested after a fourmonth investigation in which 
a customs agent had posed as an official of the raytheon corp of 
lexington maker of the hawk missile parts 
the agent steve crogan recorded more than a dozen 
conversations with the modarressis in which they talked about 
buying up to 60 million of us weapons but eventually settled on 
the four electronic tubes worth 280000 sterns said 
the modarressis entered the courtroom together left together 
and sat together during the opening arguments if convicted of 
conspiring to violate the arms export control act each could face 
up to 15 years in prison a 125 million fine and deportation 
sterns said the electronic klystron and twystron tubes each of 
which is about 4 feet long and 6 inches in diameter are used in a 
mobile radar that is integral to the hawk system a missile the 
iranians could use to shoot down aircraft 
owen walker the federal public defender representing majid 
modarressi said these kind of tubes are used in practically 
every radar system every tv station every radio station theres 
nothing uniquely or inherently military about them 
walker said the younger modarressi came to the united states in 
1976 to study architectural drafting married his wife alicia in 
1982 and settled in ohio where he works as an architectural 
consultant 
the elder modarressi was described by defense attorneys as an 
international merchant who has dealt in shoes and pistachios and 
had briefly discussed becoming raytheons middle east sales 
representative in 1984

the shuttles booster rockets 
redesigned and tested again and again after challenger passed the 
test that counted thursday when they powered discovery successfully 
toward orbit 
from everything i see everything looks great said jr 
thompson who directed the booster overhaul project from the 
marshall space flight center in alabama he awaited along with 
other nasa officials data that would provide a detailed analysis 
of the booster performance 
some people watching the launch on television were alarmed to 
see what looked like flame spewing from the side of one rocket 
after liftoff as if in awful imitation of the challenger disaster 
but experts attributed it to a trick of physics that had been 
observed during other normal launches 
the 149footlong reusable rockets peeled off from the shuttle 
right on schedule after their fuel was burned out at 2 minutes 4 
seconds into flight 
the spent casings dropped into the atlantic ocean their fall 
slowed by parachutes and were quickly recovered by the ships 
liberty star and freedom star 150 miles off the florida coast 
stuart shadbolt a spokesman for lockheed space operations co 
which is in charge of the recovery said the boosters were expected 
to reach port canaveral fla under tow by friday night 
nasa said crews who inspected the boosters in the water reported 
they appeared to be in good shape kennedy space center spokesman 
dick young said early data showed no anomalies 
the rockets will get a far more intense scrutiny once they are 
towed to shore and before they are refitted by manufacturer morton 
thiokol inc for use on a future flight 
it was a failure of the booster rockets that caused the 
explosion of challenger and the death of its seven crew members 73 
seconds after launch on jan 28 1986 
the rogers commission which investigated the destruction of 
challenger blamed that disaster on an oring that failed to seal 
in coldweather conditions allowing flame to escape and ignite a 
fuel tank 
rather than delay resumption of shuttle flights until it could 
develop an entirely new booster nasa spent 800 million to make 
145 changes in the design and then conducted a series of demanding 
tests 
experts said the results of all the changes are rockets just 
short of the best design possible 
if you started with a clean sheet of paper there are things 
you could do to improve the rockets said russ bardos nasas 
director of shuttle propulsion 
when fully loaded with 11 million pounds of propellant each 
booster weighs 13 million pounds and produces 33 million pounds 
of thrust two are used for each shuttle launch providing 80 
percent of the power needed to lift the winged spacecraft from the 
pad toward orbit 
because the rockets are so massive they are manufactured in 
four segments each segment is joined at a seam called a field 
joint the parts are assembled at the kennedy space center 
the joints used for 25 shuttle flights had a metal rim called a 
tang that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis on one 
side of the clevis were two oring seals made of a rubberized 
material the clevis and tang were held together by bolts 
experience showed that when the rocket booster fired generating 
about 900 pounds of internal pressure the thick steel booster 
casing ballooned slightly an action called rotation this 
caused the clevis and tang to separate slightly preventing the 
orings from sealing 
the orings also are less likely to seal if the rubberized 
material is made hard by cold temperatures challenger was launched 
after soaking in freezing temperatures overnight 
the rotation problem was corrected by a new joint that added a 
metal lip called a capture feature to the tang this joint 
resembles a handshake with the new thumb on the tang giving 
extra strength 
the redesign team also added a third oring and installed 
heaters to keep the joint a constant 75 degrees inside the rocket 
insulation was redesigned to include a jshaped slit under 
pressure the slit causes insulation to shift forming still 
another seal 
engineers also realized that a nozzletocase joint on the 
booster was even more flawed than the case joint to correct this 
problem the redesign team added 100 bolts for added strength an 
additional oring seal and put a slitseal in the insulation 
as to the appearance of flame from the side of the rocket during 
thursdays launch royce mitchell solid rocket manager at 
marshall said it was due to the physical law of reverse flow 
separation 
mitchell said that as the shuttle begins to roll the booster 
plumes the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in 
normal operation sometimes converge and the hot particles 
recirculate 
he compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding 
motorcycle instead of his jacket flapping out behind it is 
plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle

the aegis electronic system was adequately 
tested before the navy began buying the sophisticated ship defense 
the pentagon chief weapons tester told congress on thursday 
the report by john e krings disputed a study by the general 
accounting office which had raised questions about the adequacy of 
tests of the aegis system 
the operational testing of aegis has been adequate to support 
the acquisition decisions that have been made and more testing will 
be conducted to support future decisions krings director of the 
pentagons new operational test and evaluation program told a 
house subcommittee 
it was an aegisclass cruiser the vincennes which shot down an 
iranian commercial airliner in the persian gulf on july 3 in the 
mistaken belief that the plane was an iranian military jet all 290 
persons aboard the jetliner were killed 
questions were raised in the wake of the incident about aegis 
which the navy has touted as the worlds most sophisticated air 
defense system 
but a navy investigation into the shootdown exonerated the aegis 
system concluding that it worked as designed the probe concluded 
that human error led to the mistakes and said navy officers on the 
vincennes misread data 
krings office was created by congress five years ago in the 
wake of reports that weapons had performed poorly because they 
hadnt been realistically tested before they were purchased by the 
pentagon 
the navy is relying heavily on the aegis system to protect its 
surface fleet putting it aboard a new class of destroyers along 
with the aegisclass cruisers 
the gao criticized the aegis tests but that criticism was 
contained as part of a larger gao study which pointed out what the 
congressional watchdog agency said were shortcomings in the 
operation of krings office 
the gao said atmospheric ducting occurred in april 1984 during 
aegis testing ducting could have unfairly biased the reports of 
some of the tests according to gao 
krings disputed the gaos complaints about the testing of the 
aegis system 
ducting is a natural phenomenom prevalent in many areas of the 
world including the mediterranean sea and the persian gulf he 
told the armed services seapower subcommittee 
the operational tester has no control over whether or not 
ducting will be present during a test he said to run 
operational tests with a stipulation that they not be run when 
ducting occurs would be as unrealistic as a stipulation that tests 
only be run when ducting is present

whitney north seymour jr the independent 
counsel who obtained former presidential aide michael k deavers 
perjury conviction is offering himself as a paid campus speaker on 
government ethics 
a letter that seymour circulated to colleges and universities in 
july before deavers sentencing this month was released by a 
former justice department official who argued the independent 
counsel was being hypocritical about government ethics 
if hes so concerned about ethics let him take his expenses 
and speak for free said gary l mcdowell a research fellow at 
the national legal center for the public interest 
mcdowell who had written speeches for thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii said he received the letter from a friend whom he 
would identify only as a college professor who had received the 
solicitation before deavers sentencing 
in the letter seymour wrote that following last decembers 
guilty verdict in the michael deaver case i was asked to speak to 
college and law school audiences about washington ethics 
i hope to schedule more campus visits this coming year and i 
am writing to enlist your help 
as a result of my indoctrination in the ways of washington as 
independent counsel in the deaver case i have developed quite 
strong views on how to achieve a higher standards of ethics in 
government seymour wrote under the letterhead of his new york 
law office 
seymour refused to comment about the letter to the associated 
press 
but in an interview published in thursdays editions of the new 
york times seymour defended the speaking engagements saying his 
fee of 2500 to 5000 per appearance was way below market 
look at it this way seymour told the times this is a way 
to try to get a message out to the future leaders of this country 
that they ought to be doing something about improving the level of 
ethics in the nations capital 
the ideal arrangement for visiting a campus is to be invited 
to appear as a paid speaker at a scheduled student evening 
program wrote seymour who told the times he had sent the letter 
to several dozen colleges in july 
seymours solicitation also was criticized as maladroit but 
not unethical by geoffrey hazard a yale university professor who 
specializes in legal ethics 
its just kind of tacky to solicit speaking engagements 
hazard said if its fitting that he give speeches at colleges 
he ought to let them think of the idea 
stephen gillers a legal ethics expert who teaches at new york 
university law school said he would not have solicited the 
speaking engagements before deavers sentencing to avoid any 
misperception of impropriety 
i have no problem with his decision to try to become a 
spokesman on government ethics and to charge for it gillers said 
the only issue is whether to wait until after deaver is 
sentenced to avoid any appearance of trying to cash in on the case 
gillers said 
in my view it was a question of judgment seymour could 
reasonably have concluded that a july announcement would not 
reasonably create an appearance of impropriety 
seymour drew criticism last year when he delivered an emotional 
attack on what he termed the low state of government ethics in 
washington 
the speech was delivered on the steps of the us courthouse a 
day after deaver was convicted of three counts of lying to a grand 
jury and a house subcommittee that investigated his lobbying 
activities 
deaver former deputy white house chief of staff and a longtime 
friend of president reagan last week received a suspended 
threeyear sentence and a 100000 fine he also was ordered to 
perform 1500 hours of community service during the three years he 
was placed on probation 
seymour had sough imprisonment for deaver saying such a 
sentence would have a deterrent effect on the ethics and conduct 
of political insiders 
in pronouncing sentence us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson rejected this argument saying deaver was not found guilty 
of illegal lobbying 
but the judge barred deaver from lobbying the federal government 
for profit for three years

an additional 200000 metric tons of us corn 
has been sold to the soviet union for delivery during the coming 
year the agriculture department said thursday 
the sale brought total corn sold to the soviets in the last 
month for delivery in the 198889 year that began on sept 1 to 
more than 398 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 200000 tons of 
corn would be about 788 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 21 million 
a fiveyear longterm grain agreement with the soviet union 
expires on sept 30 but that will not prevent further sales to the 
soviet union negotiations have been going on for months in an 
effort to work out a new pact 
according to the old agreement the annual purchases were 
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to sales announced since sept 1 the soviet union had 
purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million tons of corn 
for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the agreement 
plus 830000 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

us black organizations announced thursday a 
buy american drive for the christmas shopping season in a 
campaign against what they called japanese insensitivity to black 
americans 
the japanese have been reacting to us black appeals against 
such insensitivity in typical asian fashion they have been very 
polite but nothing has happened rep mervyn dymally dcalif 
chairman of the congressional black caucus told reporters 
the campaign was formulated at a meeting of leading us black 
political business and civil rights organizations earlier this 
month 
part of the japanese insensitivity is racial dymally said 
recalling critical remarks about us blacks by former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone and former finance minister michio 
watanabe for which they later apologized watanabe who told a 
party meeting last july that american blacks seem unconcerned about 
declaring bankruptcy may be japans next prime minister the 
congressman said 
with dymally at a news conference were representatives of the 
national urban league the national association for advancement of 
colored people and the black business council three of more than 
two dozen supporting organizations 
black business council representative kent amos said the buy 
american effort called for the heaviest shopping season of the 
year is not a boycott but an effort to divert part of american 
blacks 300 billion annual purchasing power to companies in 
america responsive to our needs 
we as a black community have been through the process of 
sensitizing insensitive communities before amos said in the 
1960s and 1970s it was corporate america we are much further 
along in our understanding of our economic role now and we wont 
be as patient we are willing to assist anyone willing to listen 
but not enough people are willing and until that happens we 
will continue to have confrontation 
the campaign will include pressure to persuade japaneseowned 
businesses and factories now proliferating in the united states to 
hire more blacks at all levels dymally said 
american vice presidents of such firms are failing to convince 
their japanese bosses that this is america and we have 
affirmative action goals he said japanese auto firms with the 
exception of toyota have no blackowned dealerships and japanese 
investors are giving no business to black real estate firms or 
banks he asserted 
for new factories every japanese automobile manufacturer 
seeks rural south america or suburban north america as far as they 
can get from urban centers where there is a surplus of labor and 
where minorities live dymally charged 
we want to be conciliatory dymally said adding that the 
first objective of the campaign is a dialogue between japanese 
government and corporate officials and the us black community 
but dymally said it has been difficult to engage the japanese side 
in dialogue 
racial insensitivity in japan is being fought by some 
enlightened people in the government and some corporations are 
taking the right steps amos said 
if all would follow the lead of sony electronics and toyota 
we would be much further along he said but did not clarify how 
those firms could be spared potential loss caused by a buy 
american campaign 
the black business council seeks japanese investment targeted at 
revival of decaying us inner cities and its president al nellum 
will be pursuing this in tokyo next week amos said

on the day un peacekeepers won the nobel 
peace prize a soviet official on thursday said failure to take 
seriously pakistans alleged violations of the afghan pact could 
mean difficulties for future peacekeeping 
gennady gerasimov the spokesman of the soviet foreign ministry 
said un peacekeeping forces in afghanistan are not doing their 
job properly and should be investigated by the secretarygeneral 
if future peacekeeping forces are to be approved 
the soviet union one of the five permanent members of the un 
security council has the power to veto new un peacekeeping 
proposals the other permanent members are united states britain 
france and china 
the foreign ministers of the permanent members met wednesday 
evening at the request of soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze to discuss soviet claims that the united states and 
pakistan are violating the unmediated afghan accords signed in 
geneva on april 14 
those accords call for the soviets to withdraw more than 100000 
red army troops from afghanistan and for afghanistan and pakistan 
to respect each others territorial integrity 
if we do not succeed in creating an efficient control 
mechanism here in afghanistan which is kind of a testing ground 
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism 
in other conflicts said gerasimov 
the mechanism he referred to is the un military observer 
group monitoring the soviet withdrawal and alleged violations of 
the accords 
on tuesday shevardnaze said the soviets had finished the first 
part of their troop withdrawal but had not yet begun the second 
phase and said it depended on whether the violations of the accord 
cease 
when asked thursday if the soviets were slowing their retreat 
gerasimov said we dont want to be too specific but we are 
worried these violations must be stopped 
un observers determined that half the soviet troops had 
withdrawn by aug 15 so shevardnadzes statement meant the red 
army retreat has stopped for the last six weeks 
the withdrawal began may 15 and is to be complete by next feb 
15 
gerasimov said pakistan armed the afghan guerrillas and was 
allowing at least two training camps to operate on its territory 
for about 3400 fighters 
he said 2500 afghan fighters were in training near islamabad 
the pakistani capital and 900 others at a base near the afghan 
border with the assistance of chinese american and pakistani 
advisers 
the soviet spokesman also accused pakistani authorities of 
patroling refugee camps to stop afghans from returning to their 
homeland 
the spokesman called for a detailed report from the united 
nations which has stationed observers in afghanistan 
at the un session wednesday night shultz said soviet and 
afghan pilots violated pakistani territory with bombing raids 
gerasimov acknowledged that a soviet pilot was downed in 
pakistan a few weeks ago he thanked the pakistani government for 
returning him 
otherwise the soviet official said there is no intrusion 
and we are saying it all the time it is really not true 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to back a 
marxist government they stayed on to help the government fight a 
moslem insurgency

president reagan saying secrecy is essential 
for the nations security signed legislation thursday designed to 
help modernize americas outmoded spy satellite network 
in a statement announcing he had signed the bill reagan 
predicted the measure will strengthen united states intelligence 
capabilities 
the spy satellite modernization program was initiated by the 
senate intelligence committee after it concluded that us photo 
and eavesdropping satellites were becoming outdated the nations 
spy network in outer space had not been substantially updated in a 
decade 
the precise provisions and funding levels of the bill are 
classified but reagan said the legislation authorizes the 
appropriations at approximately the level i requested total 
spending on us intelligence programs reportedly amounts to about 
25 billion nearly all of the money is hidden away in the 
pentagons budget 
as the congress has recognized secrecy is essential to 
success in the intelligence activities upon which the nations 
security depends the presidents statement said 
the senate panel called for the modernization of the spy network 
after reviewing verification capabilities for the new arms control 
treaty with the soviet union on mediumrange nuclear weapons the 
lawmakers found that us monitoring technology would be inadequate 
if the superpowers later reached agreement on deep cuts in 
longrange nuclear weapons 
even though reagan signed the bill into law he cited 
constitutional concerns about two separate sections of the 
legislation 
one provision of the bill included language that prohibits the 
government from aiding nicaraguas contra rebels unless 
specifically authorized by congress the issue arose during the 
irancontra arms and money scandal when the administration insisted 
that prohibitions on intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did 
not extend to the presidents national security council staff 
the new legislation bars any entity of the government from 
unauthorized aid to the contra rebels which would include the nsc 
reagan said he signed the measure with the understanding that 
the extension of the restriction is not intended to and does 
not apply in a manner and to an extent that would conflict with my 
constitutional authority and duty to conduct the foreign relations 
of the united states 
reagan also said he was concerned about another requirement he 
contended would conflict with the constitutional protection 
afforded the integrity and confidentiality of internal 
deliberations of the executive branch 
the provision requires that the cia report to congress about the 
activities of the agencys internal inspector general who 
investigates allegations of wrongdoing 
the provision would require the cia director to tell 
congressional overseers any time he bars the inspector general from 
undertaking a specific investigation

protesters used tear gas and stench bombs at movie 
theaters in paris and several provincial cities wednesday to 
disrupt the french debut of the last temptation of christ 
about 600 protesters at a demonstration called by followers of 
excommunicated archbishop marcel lefebvre a traditionalist roman 
catholic clashed with police in front of a left bank movie house 
on the boulevard st germain in paris one police officer was 
reported injured 
in marseille police said demonstrators were led by two 
traditionalist priests carrying banners protesting the showing of 
film director martin scorseses adaptation of the novel by nikos 
kazantzakis 
showings were disrupted in three cinemas in marseille one in 
angers and one in paris by tear gas and stench bombs set off by 
the protesters customers were reimbursed for the price of the 
tickets 
many other movie houses showed the film without incident but in 
avignon four people rose shouting from their seats an hour into the 
film barged into the projection room and ripped up the theaters 
copy of the film 
in rennes poitier and laval roman catholic groups protested 
peacefully 
two other demonstrations against the film took place wednesday 
on the right bank of the seine in paris 
cardinal jeanmarie lustiger the roman catholic archbishop of 
paris issued a protest against the movie but said he did not 
support banning its showing and would not request or participate in 
any public demonstrations 
the court of appeals in paris refused on tuesday to order a 
nationwide ban on showings of the film which includes scenes in 
which jesus imagines being intimate with mary magdalene 
the appeals court also overturned a lower court order last week 
saying a disclaimer must be projected on the screen and read aloud 
at every showing 
however the court did order that all advertising for the film 
specify that it is not an adaptation of the biblical account but 
of the kazantzakis novel 
in aixenprovence municipal officials banned showing the film

the vatican said thursday that some of the 37 
roman catholic seminaries in america are starved of students 
because they are not getting adequate support from the catholic 
community 
a vatican commission after a sevenyear investigation and 
visits to the collegelevel seminaries praised the quality of 
education offered to prospective priests but said the institutions 
are not receiving the support which they both need and deserve 
from the catholic population at large and from americas bishops 
several american catholic seminaries have closed in recent years 
the commission especially deplored the tendency of dioceses to 
send priesthood candidates to small local schools known as houses 
of formation which do not have as high academic standards as 
traditional seminaries students at the houses of formation receive 
theological training but must attend secular colleges for their 
academic work 
the practice submits students to a philosophical formation 
which is inadequate to the needs of the priesthood cardinal 
william baum reported in a letter read and approved by pope john 
paul ii and sent to every catholic bishop in the united states 
baum heads the vatican congregation for catholic education 
which was directed in 1981 to investigate the quality of education 
offered candidates for the priesthood in america 
we would urge all bishops who maintain houses of formation of 
this kind to transfer their students to proper college seminaries 
and to commit their resources especially personnel to these 
seminaries the cardinal said 
such slogans as smallisbeautiful localisbest are 
disguising a situation in which college level candidates for the 
priesthood are being deprived of the quality of priestly formation 
which they merit and which the church needs he added 
the college seminaries survive because of the heroic sacrifice 
and commitment of the bishops and religious orders who own and 
operate them but many dioceses do not send their priesthood 
candidates to proper college seminaries with the result that good 
as their formation programs may be many college seminaries are 
being starved of students baum wrote 
the commission also said that because of the dropoff in the 
number of students some seminaries are tempt to lower their 
standards and admit students about whom they harbor reservations 
generally graduates of the seminaries attend theologates for a 
final level of training before becoming priests 
on another matter baum said seminaries must do job of teaching 
future priests the theological rationale of celibacy based on 
the example of our lord himself he said there was too much 
emphasis currently on the mere discipline of celibacy without 
attention to its theological basis 
baums letter took note of the dropoff in the number of 
priesthood candidate and listed reasons for it pressures on the 
family the attraction of material prosperity and social comfort 
the sexual revolution and the growth of insecurity as well as a 
delay in the age of personal career decisionsmaking

the united states and 11 allied countries 
signed an agreement thursday to build a 23 billion permanently 
manned space station designed to serve as a steppingstone for 
human exploration of the solar system 
the facility known as space station freedom will be designed 
developed operated and used by all of the partners which include 
nine european allies japan and canada in addition to the united 
states 
the united states is providing 16 billion to the program and 
the other partners are contributing more than 7 billion the 
agreement was formalized at a state department signing ceremony at 
which secretary of state george p shultz presided officials said 
it was a coincidence that the agreement was signed on the same day 
that the discovery space shuttle was launched at cape canaveral 
fla 
richard smith a state department scientist told reporters the 
project is clearly the worlds largest ever international venture 
and certainly one of the most complex 
margaret finarelli an official of the national aeronautics and 
space administration said the europeans countries all members of 
the european space agency will contribute 42 billion to the 
project japan 2 billion and canada 1 billion 
at the signing ceremony shultz said the station will be used 
to test equipment and techniques for long space voyages and the 
development of new materials of great benefit to mankind 
for the united states space station freedom will be the 
centerpience of our civil space program for the 1990s it is an 
essential next step if the united states is to stay on the cutting 
edge of space exploration and research shultz said 
earlier heinz riesenhuber the west german chairman of the 
european space agency emphasized that the project will be used 
only for peaceful purposes 
together we can reach for goals that are beyond the reach of 
each one of us if he tries to go it alone riesenhuber said 
twentytwo shuttle flights over a period of three years will be 
required to place in earth orbit all the hardware for the station 
construction will be completed in the first quarter of 1998 
although the facility will be permanently inhabited from late 1996 
on according to current plans 
a state department summary of the program said a manned space 
station is needed to lay the groundwork for a colony on the moon or 
a manned mission to mars 
it will provide a focal point for free world space operations 
well into the next century and will serve as a steppingstone for 
human exploration of the solar system the summary said 
the station will be used to study the effects of prolonged 
weightlessness on humans and to create a life support system for 
long space voyages 
because it is being designed to evolve and grow this station 
can become the facility which will serve as a point of assembly 
test and departure for future manned missions to the moon or to 
mars the statement said 
the project will comprise a combination of permanentlty manned 
mantended and unmanned elements according to the current 
schedule the facility will be ready for permanent habitation in 
late 1996 
the basic structure of the manned base including the power 
system and the habitation module will be provided by the united 
states canada will provide the hardware for use in station 
assembly maintenance and servicing 
the united states japan and the european countries will 
construct pressurized laboratories allowing astronauts to do 
research in a shirt sleeves environment 
in addition to the united states canada and japan the other 
participants are belgium denmark france west germany italy the 
netherlands norway spain and britain

americas reentry to space on thursday 
prompted more sighs of relief than cheers in christa mcauliffes 
hometown where residents hope discovery will help heal horrible 
memories of the challenger explosion 
this puts the bad memories of christa mcauliffe behind us 
said craig sargent 20 a former student of the concord high school 
teacher whose death on challenger 32 months ago plunged the city 
into grief that still lingers i think shed have wanted it this 
way 
sargent watched the launch at sears on main street where about 
15 people gathered in front of a wall of television sets 
i was standing here in the same spot when it blew up he 
said its about time they improved it it looks like theyre 
doing things right this time 
sargent said that as a student he sat next to mcauliffe at 
concord high school the day before she left for cape canaveral 
fred mclaughlin who listened to a radio broadcast of the 
discovery launch at haggetts bike shop said it brought a lump 
to my throat especially when they talked about just getting past 
the point of the explosion of the last one 
mclaughlin who outfitted mcauliffes family with bicycles said 
the discovery blastoff brought back some sad memories 
i dont think that being in concord new hampshire well ever 
forget about the shuttle every time theres news about the 
shuttle there will be apprehension 
but he added that each successful launch will make the pain a 
little less 
betsey rogers who watched the challenger explosion from the 
grandstand at cape canaveral said tears came to her eyes as she 
watched discovery on television at home 
i didnt realize how emotional this would be she said 
its really very exciting to see a success and such a big 
relief 
rogers was in florida in 1986 as a chaperone for a thirdgrade 
class from concord which included mcauliffes son scott 
she and others hope the successful discovery launch will help 
erase challenger memories 
the biggest thing that is going to help is that that 
challenger is in the past and now everyone is going to move into 
the future said clint cogswell principal of the kimball school 
which the two mcauliffe children attend well just be left 
alone which is just the way it should be were no longer a 
story 
cogswell said no classes at his school watched the launch and 
that he and his staff still feel a duty to shield the mcauliffe 
youngsters from shuttle exposure 
he said both children were in school thursday and school 
officials kept reporters and photographers away 
police officers kept the media away from concord high there 
were no assemblies though two or three classes watched the launch 
on television 
a handmade sign in a secondfloor window proclaimed godspeed 
discovery crew

winddriven flames crackled 
through 6700 acres of brush thursday and roared past homes 
abandoned by residents facing southern californias first major 
blaze of the dreaded fall fire season 
desertdry santa ana winds blasted through canyons of the san 
gabriel mountains at up to 60 mph pushing flames toward an 
1800home section in the etiwanda district and by midmorning the 
fire reached a schoolyard 
about 150 people fled with belongings they could carry but by 
noon the winds had dropped to less than 5 mph and 10 aircraft were 
able to bombard trouble spots 
no structures are now threatened said capt erny okeefe of 
the california department of forestry none of the 150000 homes 
was damaged when the fire swept by just a few dilapidated 
chicken coops she said 
the evacuation recommendation was withdrawn by midday 
at dawn hosetoting homeowners squirted water on rooftops while 
others corraled their children pets and personal possessions and 
headed for evacuation centers but many refused to leave 
they want to be sure it is really coming rancho cucamonga 
city manager lauren wasserman said 
the fire moved within 100 yards of summit elementary school 
closed earlier because of the danger forcing officials to relocate 
a firefighter staging area set up there wasserman said flames 
later roared past and spared the school 
while air tankers and helicopters were grounded by the swirling 
winds 1200 firefighters on the ground made desperate 
oftenfutile stands on ridge crests they had cleared of brush 
it gets to the top of a ridge and the winds carry it so fast 
we lose containment right there said mary grisamore a 
spokeswoman for the department of forestry

down a 445000 ranch house and two outbuildings in the area 60 
miles east of los angeles 
officials said it was 30 percent contained but there was no 
estimate on how long it would take to put it out 
temperatures soaring into the 100s accompanied the santa anas 
the devil winds spawned by high pressure over nevada that sends 
compressionheated wind whistling through the mountain canyons to 
sea they are often at their worst just as fall brings cool weather 
and rain to much of the country

portauprince haiti ap about 10000 mostly young haitians 
danced and chanted through the streets of the capital on thursday 
in support of the sept 17 military coup that ousted the government 
of lt gen henri namphy 
it was one of the biggest outpourings seen in portauprince 
since dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to france during a popular 
uprising in february 1986 
most of the demonstrators appeared to be in their 20s they 
waved banners and placards bearing such slogans as 
peasantsworkersarmy for change the constitution is our 
weapon and oust macoutes from the church 
the tonton macoutes are former members of duvaliers private 
police force 
the demonstration called off twice last week was organized by 
six civic action groups one of them the confederation of 
democratic unity a coalition advocating democratic reform backed 
out of thursdays events because of fears of a reprisal attack by 
tonton macoutes who are being purged from the army 
authorities arrested two men wednesday and found submachine guns 
and grenades in their luxury hotel room local news reports said 
dr louis roy who helped write the suspended 1987 constitution 
said the demonstration went ahead despite rumors of a possible 
attack because the popular pressure was so great the people 
are no longer afraid 
he said haiti was ripe for democracy 
rankandfile soldiers who overthrew namphy and installed lt 
gen prosper avril as president under a new military government 
said they wanted to end random statesponsored violence and 
institute democratic reforms including restoring the constitution 
and elections for a civilian government 
avril has named a predominantly civilian cabinet and has pledged 
to restore the constitution on wednesday he met with haitis main 
opposition leaders he has said his military government is 
provisional but has not set a date for elections he says they 
probably will not be held for another two to 2 years 
thursdays demonstration began outside the charred ruins of the 
roman catholic st jean bosco church where thugs wielding 
machetes guns clubs and spikes killed 13 people and wounded more 
than 70 during a mass on sept 11 soldiers who overthrew namphy 
cited the massacre as a factor in triggering their revolt 
in the dominican republic where namphy and his wife and 
daughter live in exile archbishop nicolas de jesus lopez rodriguez 
of santo domingo said thursday he opposed granting namphy political 
asylum or letting him stay there 
he told reporters after celebrating mass i think that the 
presence of this gentleman is harmful to grant him asylum just to 
get it over with would not be convenient either for the dominican 
republic or haiti a people who want to get on the road to peace 
the dominican republic shares the island of hispaniola with 
haiti 
speculation rose that namphy would be flying out of the country 
soon but a foreign ministry spokesman said the government still 
has not made a decision about namphys situation

within hours after discovery 
rocketed into orbit thursday the astronauts flung open its cargo 
bay doors and deployed a 100 million communications satellite that 
ground controllers will use to talk to crews on future missions 
the tracking and data relay satellite attached to a twostage 
solid booster rocket was pushed from a tilttable that was raised 
out of the shuttle bay the cargo waltzed away at about 27 mph 
about six hours after discoverys successful liftoff from cape 
canaveral fla at 1137 am edt 
about an hour later the satellite was sent on its way toward 
its final orbit with the firing of the rockets first stage 
but first as a safety precaution the astronauts maneuvered 
discovery 10 miles away and turned its belly toward the tdrs that 
was done to protect the shuttles windows from particles flying 
from the burning rocket propellant 
deploying the satellite was the main mission of the first 
postchallenger flight another tdrs is in orbit but a nearly 
identical one was destroyed in the challenger explosion jan 28 
1986 
nasa needs to get the tdrs in orbit because it will nearly 
double the time ground controllers can monitor future shuttle 
flights the satellite now in orbit allows controllers to keep 
track of shuttle about 45 percent of each orbit but it has had 
some minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent 
capacity space agency officials said 
the tdrs provides more continuous coverage of manned and 
unmanned spacecraft orbiting the earth than nasas worldwide 
network of groundbased communications tracking systems the 
satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft and a ground 
terminal at white sands missile range nm which then routes it 
to the appropriate nasa facility 
the satellite is thrust into its final orbit 22300 miles above 
earth by an inertial upper stage rocket 
a springloaded ejection device pushed the tdrs and the booster 
from the cargo bay the first stage of the rocket fired about an 
hour after it the satellite was released from the shuttle 
the second stage ignites about 5 hours later and the satellite 
reaches its final orbit about a halfhour after that it then 
undergoes several weeks of checks before it is considered 
operational 
the satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about 
45000 pounds making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard 
a shuttle johnson space center officials said the satellite 
itself weighs about 5000 pounds and it has two 50pound antennas 
that look like giant umbrellas 
the tdrs final stationary orbit will be over the pacific ocean 
near the gilbert islands

one of the many satellites crowding 
the orbital skies above the earth threatened for a time thursday to 
affect the launch of space shuttle discovery 
when liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed engineers in launch 
control at cape canaveral announced that though the shuttle could 
be launched as late 230 pm edt there were two brief periods 
that were restricted because of satellites passing near discoverys 
flight path 
officials at the johnson space center said they received a 
collision avoidance warning from the air force missile command 
which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit 
flight director gary coen said the warning had no effect on the 
discovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 1137 am 
edt almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times 
coen said the satellites that triggered the warnings were not 
identifed by the air force

rutgers university hello everybody im dan quayle 
 
michael dukakis blaming the reaganbush administration for past 
environmental failures for the footdraggers and chronic 
polluters i have just one message you better vote for mr bush 
because if im elected the game is over no more of the sweetheart 
deals and delayed cleanups and halfbaked compromises that weve 
seen over the past seven and a half years

had asked the subcommittee to hold the hearing he said that texaco 
inc of which icahn is the largest shareholder and whose 
management he battled earlier this year in a proxy contest has 
assisted the unions 
texaco spokesman peter maneri speaking from the companys 
offices in white plains ny would say only that the firm takes 
no role in these hearings beyond that of an observer 
shuster said the unions had even sought unsuccessfully to have 
the panel issue a subpoena to icahn to force him to appear as a 
witness icahn did not attend the hearing 
i dont think its proper people should try to use this 
committee as a weapon in this kind of dispute shuster said 
he and other republicans said the hearing should not be 
interpreted as supporting a transportation department investigation 
of twa 
democrats however said the internal changes being made at the 
airline are worth examining 
subcommittee chairman james l oberstar dminn said there are 
serious and legitimate questions surrounding the financial 
maneuverings at twa he said it was appropriate for the panel to 
study the carriers finances and the transportation departments 
procedures for determining whether an airlines management is 
qualified to operate the carrier 
in august the independent federation of flight attendants asked 
the department to block icahns restructuring plan the union 
charged that the corporate raider simply wanted to extract cash 
from twa ignoring needs for new equipment and threatening 
thousands of jobs the department investigation is continuing 
union leaders contended thursday that icahn acted for his own 
benefit in initiating a plan to buy out public shareholders and 
sell off assets leaving the airline with 25 billion worth of 
debt and an aging fleet of planes 
capt thomas ashwood chairman of the branch of the air line 
pilots association that represents twas 3200 pilots said the 
restructuring signals the beginning of a possibly irreversible 
tailspin into bankruptcy 
but mark buckstein a twa senior vice president said that since 
gaining control of the airline in 1986 icahn has turned around an 
ailing company he said icahn has been exploring buying new planes 
setting up a domestic hub and adding new flights 
twa views this as but one step in its evolution as a more 
effective competitive force in the airline industry buckstein 
said

the state department called on the nicaraguan 
government thursday to rescind new restrictions that force us 
diplomats who leave nicaragua to delay their return for three weeks 
sandinista authorities informed the us embassy in managua of 
the change in procedures last week during a period when the two 
countries were embroiled in a dispute over a proposed visit since 
canceled to the united nations by president daniel ortega 
the new regulations require embassy personnel leaving nicaragua 
to seek reentry visas only outside nicaragua in addition a 
waiting period of 15 working days was imposed 
the state department said the shift means that diplomatic 
personnel who must leave nicaragua for any reason including 
official business family emergencies or medical treatment will 
not be able to reenter nicaragua for three weeks 
beforehand reentry visas could be obtained prior to departure 
from nicaragua with five days advance notice 
we believe that the nicaraguan government should rescind this 
latest action a department statement said adding that 
appropriate responses are being considered 
it also noted that the new measures aggravate the existing 
personnel shortage at the embassy last july 11 the sandinistas 
expelled eight us diplomats on grounds they were interfering in 
nicaraguas internal affairs the united states responded by 
expelling eight nicaraguan diplomats from washington 
neither side has allowed the other to send replacement envoys 
last week ortega canceled plans to visit the united nations 
because he said the united states would not allow a full 
delegation to accompany him the state department contended that 
visas applications of most of the official party were turned in too 
late

french president francois mitterrand on 
thursday accepted president reagans suggestion that france host an 
international conference aimed at improving enforcement of a ban on 
the use of chemical weapons a us official said 
rozanne ridgway assistant secretary of state for canadian and 
european affairs said mitterrand had voiced a willingness to have 
the conference in paris although she emphasized that no date has 
been set for such a meeting 
mitterrand met with reagan and then the pair walked around the 
rose garden for about 10 minutes before joining toplevel aides for 
a broad discussion of bilateral issues 
he stopped by the capitol where he urged americans to observe 
the bicentennial of his nations 1789 revolution telling an 
audience that the two nations always go side by side 
mitterrand was joining reagan for a private dinner thursday 
night in the white house residence before the french president was 
to head home 
during a picturetaking session with reagan earlier in the oval 
office mitterrand was asked why france had apparently reversed its 
previous position of wanting to keep a stock of chemical weapons 
we wanted to contribute to general agreement on the true 
cessation of the chemical use the president replied through an 
interpreter there are already conventions agreements but they 
have not been respected therefore a conference is needed to do 
away with that 
reagan in his farewell speech to the un general assembly on 
monday deplored the use of poison gas and chemical warfare saying 
the use of these weapons jeopardizes the moral and legal 
strictures that have held these weapons in check since world war 
i 
reagan said the tragedy of chemical weapon use in the iraniraq 
war should spark reaffirmation of the 1925 geneva protocol 
outlawing the use of chemical weapons and he called upon the 125 
nations who signed the agreement to convene a conference to 
consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious 
erosion of this treaty 
the conference that mitterrand agreed to host in paris would 
deal only with the treaty protocol outlawing the use of chemical 
weapons and would not confront the question of production of these 
weapons this is being dealt with separately at the conference on 
disarmament in geneva 
ridgway said the united states believed france should be the 
host country for a conference on banning the use of chemical 
weapons since the original copies of the 1925 treaty protocol are 
kept by the french government 
she said mitterrand quickly acceded to reagans request but 
that there was no discussion of a date ridgway also said she 
did not know whether the conference likely a oneday affair would 
take place before reagan leaves office next jan 20 
france of course has been a very active participant in the 
negotiations on banning chemical weapons she said without 
getting into the issue of the separate talks in geneva on 
prohibiting the production of these weapons 
ridgway said she did not know whether reagan had talked with 
mitterrand about the americans being held hostage by proiranian 
elements in lebanon 
at the capitol where he witnessed the signing of a joint 
congressional resolution commemorating both the french revolution 
and the proclamation also in 1789 of the declaration of the 
rights of man mitterrand stressed the links between france and the 
united states 
we were at your side at the very beginning of your history 
mitterrand said invoking frances decision to send military aid to 
the united states during the revolutionary war against england 
congress approved the bill of rights in 1789 and the 
congressional resolution signed thursday states that the two acts 
proclaimed the sanctity of human rights on both sides of the 
atlantic ocean guaranteeing them for future generations 
the signing of the resolution by house speaker jim wright of 
texas and senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva took 
place in statuary hall a historic chamber which was the meeting 
place of the house in the early 1800s and which now is ringed by a 
collection of statues of american heroes 
several speakers noted that the marquis de lafayette a 
prominent figure in both the american and french revolutions 
addressed the first joint meeting of congress in the chamber in 
1824 
i know this historic chamber is filled with the statues of 
famous americans mitterrand remarked peering out into the hall 
from a podium draped in red cloth i cant see them because of 
the television lights but i know they are out there 
after the 30minute ceremony the president of france went to 
see for himself 
ignoring attempts to whisk him out a side door he broke away 
from a group of dignitaries and circled the room peering up at the 
statues and shaking the hands of people nearby

taxpayer money will be needed to bail out the savings industry 
congress general accounting office says as much as 50 billion 
will be required to clean up the mess at least some of it from 
taxpayers 
on thursday democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
blamed the crisis on reagan administration policies which permitted 
sampls to move from traditional home mortgage lending to risky new 
areas the campaign of republican george bush responded that the 
democratic congress was to blame for cutting back an administration 
plan to tap the industry not the taxpayer to bolster the 
government fund insuring sampl deposits

his pension fund fraud trial 
the former legislator from jersey city had been charged with

sentence of 20 years in prison 
the plea came during negotiations after thursdays court session 
everybody got a fair shake said peter willis one of 
friedlands attorneys

codefendants two union pension fund trustees and the funds 
lawyer

cash kickbacks from friedland

former millionaire developer john a 
kroh jr was found guilty thursday of defrauding banks in an 
attempt to get loans to keep his failing company afloat 
a jury deliberated just over five hours before returning the 
guilty verdict kroh 47 looked stunned briefly but then remained 
impassive 
kroh was found guilty of 13 counts of conspiracy bank fraud 
wire fraud receiving stolen money and forging his wifes name on 
loan application papers

the brothers company collapsed in bankruptcy in february 1987 
the government had charged that john kroh falsified financial 
statements to banks in order to obtain personal loans and then 
funneled the money into his company

company comptroller jacob mondschein who was granted immunity 
mondschein said john kroh told him to do whatever necessary to 
keep the company afloat kroh knew he was kiting checks between 
at least four banks to cover mounting deficits and overdrafts 
mondschein said 
kroh who testified that he was never aware of the full extent 
of his companys troubles said he didnt know mondschein was 
kiting checks 
george kroh said he was unaware of the companys financial 
problems until it was on the verge of bankruptcy and said his 
brother handled that end of the business 
several bank officials testified they didnt question the 
figures on the companys loan applications because of its solid 
reputation in the area

republican george bush accused 
presidential rival michael dukakis of demagoguery thursday 
saying the democrat had criticized him for taking a social security 
stance dukakis himself had taken 
bush who cast a tiebreaking senate vote in 1985 to approve 
legislation that included a oneyear freeze on social security 
costofliving adjustments said that dukakis in a vote on a 
national governors conference resolution supported exactly the 
same thing he was attacking me on the other night 
dukakis acknowledged thursday night that at a national governors 
association meeting in 1985 he first voted to drop social security 
from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed oneyear freeze 
in costofliving increases dukakis said he lent his support for 
the overall freeze after the attempt to protect social security 
increases was voted down 
the massachusetts governor said in dallas that he cast the vote 
as a general expression of my concern for the deficit but i made 
it very very clear that i was opposed to cutting costofliving 
increases for social security recipients 
there were a great many of us governors who opposed any cut 
in social security but we at least wanted to give the 
administration a message that we were concerned about the 
deficit he said 
bush commented in a news conference his first in two weeks and 
also hit back at dukakis on other recent criticism leveled by the 
democratic candidate 
bush defended running mate dan quayle suggesting it shows a 
certain insecurity a certain weakness for dukakis to attack the 
no 2 man on the presidential ticket 
he also rejected dukakis reference to a hall of shame in 
the reaganbush administration of officials who have been convicted 
of crimes or otherwise left office under a cloud the vice 
president said how indelicate of him to mention such a subject 
i could hardly believe it but this from the same man that 
attacked our president by that vicious horrible analogy of a fish 
rotting from the head down 
dukakis said last summer that president reagan and bush must 
both accept responsibility for the pentagon procurement scandal and 
other administration problems he said theres an old greek 
saying and i suspect the italians have the same one you know the 
fish rots from the head first it starts from the top 
on social security bush denied he would raid the system as 
dukakis has suggested and he said i was a little surprised to 
see this demagoguery from the man who had exactly the same position 
that the president had on that oneyear slipping of the colas 
bush opened his campaign day by seizing the space shuttle launch 
as a symbol for his campaign telling a flagwaving crowd in st 
charles mo that were back america is back 
bush later said he hoped he could attend next weeks shuttle 
landing in california which would be a telegenic event for his 
campaign 
asked if he would invite dukakis to also be at the landing bush 
said that would be making a political event of it the two of 
us there i certainly have no plans to do that gracious though it 
may be 
bush also put some distance between himself and the idea of a 
quick manned mission to mars a mission endorsed in the gop 
platform and a proposal for a mission to planet earth 
orbiting observation platform 
i would stop well short of saying the first thing i will do as 
president is going to mars as a longterm goal and objective it 
is an outstanding goal and objective he said 
dukakis has made bushs running mate quayle a prime target 
questioning his competence and his readiness to step into the 
presidency if necessary 
bush who rarely mentions quayle in the campaign said i 
think its rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to keep 
going after dan quayle it shows a certain insecurity a certain 
weakness on his part 
bush said quayle will do just fine in his debate next 
wednesday with sen lloyd bentsen dukakis running mate 
among the questions bush was asked during his news conference 
was whether homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children 
to which he responded no i dont think they should 
he said a child should have a mother and a father adding that 
there was much more love in a situation like that lasting love 
dukakis has stated similar views and has been criticized by 
homosexualrights groups for a massachusetts state policy favoring 
married couples in granting adoptions 
for the first time bush suggested in a speech that dukakis 
would follow the recommendations of the american civil liberties 
union in picking supreme court judges if he is elected 
asked later to explain why he said that bush said merely i 
think its a good question to ask all he has to do is say no they 
wont have any influence on him 
bush spoke to a crowd of nearly a thousand people in st 
charles which boasts it is the oldest city on the missouri river 
and then flew to michigan for a rally at macomb county community 
college in mount clemens and another one in grand rapids 
bush hammered dukakis with oneliners 
this is the showme state he told the missouri rally my 
opponent acts as if its the snowme state he said that when 
dukakis ended their debate last sunday it was so thick i wanted 
to borrow that 24yearold snowblower that he has in his garage 
he criticized dukakis anew for his plan to cut the budget 
deficit by collecting delinquent and evaded taxes 
bush said dukakis would have to double the number of irs agents 
and set em loose on the american people to collect those 
taxes dukakis has said he would add 6 percent more agents each 
year 
i just dont agree with his vision of america where the 
government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every 
home bush said

mission control turned the heat on 
the discovery astronauts thursday in an attempt to melt ice out of 
a cabin airconditioning system 
the ice formed in ducts that feed an evaporator system used to 
cool the cabin air while the space shuttle is rocketing into orbit 
another cooling system is used by the astronauts while they are 
in orbit but mission control set the cabin thermostat at a high 
point in hopes of melting the ice out of the evaporator system 
the temperatures climbed to 88 degrees and the humidity 
remained at a dry 43 percent the astronauts were told to drink 
water to avoid dehydration but the crew members said the 
sweltering temperatures presented no problems 
were not sure how much of an ice buildup we have said 
lacey veach an astronaut who does the talking to discovery from 
mission control 
we have the heaters on to help out with that problem he 
said were going to stay in that configuration overnight at 
least and look at it again in the morning 
veach asked the astronauts for their comments on the comfort 
level in the cabin right now 
i think were pretty comfortable right now lacey said 
frederick hauck the discovery commander 
he said the crew had found that the twostory cabin of discovery 
had a cold room and a warm room just as do many houses on earth in 
the winter 
if we want to be a little warmer than normal we come topside 
the flight deck and if we want to be a little cooler we go down 
to the middeck so far were in good shape 
if the crew follows the pattern of past shuttle crews hauck and 
pilot richard covey will sleep in their couches in the warm part of 
the cabin and the rest of the crew will sleep in the larger and 
cooler middeck area below 
among the crew equipment are sleeping bags to help keep protect 
the astronauts from cold during their rest periods but if it gets 
too warm the astronauts can change out of their flight coveralls 
and work in shorts and knit shirts

george bush and michael dukakis chorused praise for americas 
triumphant return to space on thursday then resumed their sparring 
in a longdistance campaign fight over social security the 
environment and political etiquette 
bush accused dukakis of demagoguery on social security saying 
his democratic rival supported a move to curtail costofliving 
benefits in 1985 the very step that the vice president has been 
criticized for by the democrats 
dukakis acknowledged thursday night that at a national governors 
association meeting in 1985 he first voted to drop social security 
from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed oneyear freeze 
in costofliving increases dukakis said he lent his support for 
the overall freeze after the attempt to protect social security 
increases was voted down 
the massachusetts governor said in dallas that he cast the vote 
as a general expression of my concern for the deficit but i made 
it very very clear that i was opposed to cutting costofliving 
increases for social security recipients 
there were a great many of us governors who opposed any cut 
in social security but we at least wanted to give the 
administration a message that we were concerned about the 
deficit he said 
dukakis stood with actor and environmentalist robert redford at 
his side as he attacked bush as a man whom polluters should love 
calling george bush an environmentalist is like calling dan 
quayle a statesman the democrat said in a twosided attack 
against both members of the republican ticket 
bush came to the youthful quayles defense and then got off a 
doubleedged attack of his own when he scoffed at dukakis claims 
of being tough on crime if you believe that hes got some 
bottled water from boston harbor hed like to sell you the vice 
president said in a crack about massachusetts own pollution 
problems 
quayle was in washington getting ready for next wednesdays 
nationally televised debate with democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen 
bentsen campaigned in tennessee where he had hoped to watch the 
launch of the space shuttle with a group of schoolchildren the 
texas senator left before the delayed blastoff but said later 
it was a spectacular takeoff ok russians were back 
politicians love to bask in the glow of favorable news and for 
dukakis and bush as for bentsen the successful launch of the 
shuttle discovery more than two and a half years after the 
challenger disaster was irresistible 
bush had concluded his speech to a campaign crowd in st 
charles mo when he learned from aides the shuttle had been 
launched he returned to the platform to tell cheering supporters 
were going to keep the edge in space were back americas 
back 
bush said he hoped to attend the shuttle landing next week in 
california asked at a news conference if he would invite dukakis 
to share the moment with him the vice president said that would 
be making a political event of it the two of us there i 
certainly have no plans to do that gracious though it may be 
dukakis offered similarly upbeat sentiments about the shuttle in 
new jersey opening his speech on the environment by saying it was 
a very successful morning as all of you know the space launch 
was successful were very proud of the astronauts 
so much for the nice talk 
dukakis collected endorsements from several environmental groups 
and had surefire crowd pleaser redford at his side as he 
criticized the environmental record compiled by the reagan 
administration and pledged to step up the pace of toxic waste 
cleanup 
he said that in bushs role as chairman of a task force 
concerned with government regulation the vice president had 
blocked proposals to reduce lead in the air and to clean up toxic 
wastes he said that in eight years the administration has begun 
cleanup efforts at only 137 of 1200 toxic waste sites identified 
as national priorities 
for the footdraggers and chronic polluters i have just one 
message you better vote for mr bush because if im elected the 
game is over no more sweetheart deals and delayed cleanups and 
halfbaked compromises that weve seen over the past seven and a 
half years 
dukakis also tried to blunt the republicans attack on polluted 
boston harbor contending he had fought the reagan administration 
every inch of the way in trying to clean it up 
bush said that dukakis in a vote in the national governors 
conference supported exactly the same thing he was attacking me 
on the other night in their debate so i wanna keep that social 
security trust fund sound and i will do that and i will not permit 
it to be raided for social spending programs 
dukakis said during sunday nights debate that bush would raid 
the social security trust fund to help reduce the deficit 
dukakis own running mate voted twice for democraticsponsored 
budget plans that would have temporarily frozen benefits he 
supported a plan in may 1984 which would have delayed 
costofliving increases for one year a year later in may 1985 
he supported a sixmonth delay in the colas 
bentsen joining dukakis for a fundraiser in dallas said he 
was eager to debate quayle next week and characterized the indiana 
senator as having a farright agenda out of the mainstream of 
american voters 
and believe me if the radical right gets its way well be 
living in the 19th century instead of aiming for the year 2000 
he said 
for his part bush sought to shield his running mate from 
democratic attack saying it was rather demeaning for dukakis 
to criticize the republican vice presidential candidate he said it 
shows a certain insecurity a certain weakness on his rivals 
part 
bush firing a barrage of scathing oneliners as he campaigned 
through midwestern battlegrounds of missouri and michigan again 
criticized dukakis plan to crack down on tax cheats 
i just dont agree with his vision of america where the 
government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every 
home he said 
dukakis campaign officials say the governors plan to collect 
delinquent taxes would require a 6 percent increase of irs agents a 
year far less than the doubling that bush cited

government troops fired artillery and 
rockets at honduran military aircraft that violated nicaraguan 
airspace near the border an official newspaper reported thursday 
honduras denied the report 
barricada the newspaper of the governing sandinista party said 
the honduran aircraft were not hit 
the paper accused honduras of escalating tensions between the 
two countries by flying over nicaraguan territory a nicaraguan 
defense ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the hondurans provoked nicaraguan troops into shooting at 
the aircraft 
the newspaper also said the defense ministry reported two 
shooting incidents tuesday between nicaraguan and honduran troops 
it said honduran troops harassed two nicaraguan border 
observation posts with 50 and 60caliber machine gun fire 
in the honduran capital of tegucigalpa armed forces spokesman 
juan sierra fonseca called the barricada reports absolutely false 
and alarming because they generate tensions in central america 
eugenio castro spokesman with the honduran foreign ministry 
also denied both barricada reports and called them absurd 
barricada said a helicopter gunship and an f5 fighter jet from 
the honduran air force and a twinengine plane without 
identification recently flew over the border towns of santo tomas 
del nance san pedro de potrero grande and somotillo it did not 
say when the incident took place 
the report quoted maj leonel martinez military commander for 
the nicaraguan provinces of chinandega and leon as saying 
sandinista army troops fired on the intruders with artillery and 
rockets but failed to hit them 
barricada said the incident heightened the possibility of a 
military confrontation between honduras and nicaragua 
leftist nicaragua and honduras a us ally have been at odds 
for years over the usbacked nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
the contras have long used honduran territory to launch attacks on 
nicaragua and for training supply and base camps 
since the end of overt us military aid last february and a 
truce that began in march the bulk of the contra force has been 
holed up in camps inside honduras near the border 
but nicaraguan officials have reported a series of border 
incidents including incursions or attempted incursions 
martinez said the navy sank six honduran boats trying to enter 
nicaraguan waters in the gulf of fonseca on aug 20 the gulf 
divides honduras nicaragua and el salvador he said a sandinista 
army officer lt pablo blanco torres died in the incident 
barricada said armed us vessels are common in the gulf 
the newspaper quoted another regional military commander col 
carlos brenes as saying contras have tried to cross into 
nicaraguan near the town of palo grande in chinandega province 
brenes was quoted as saying honduran troops have been harassing 
the border post at palo grande to provide cover for contra rebels 
sneaking into nicaragua from honduras 
brenes said the hondurans have increased their troop strength in 
the area reinforcing the 101st infantry brigade and an armored 
regiment he said the sandinista army has not responded with any 
unusal military mobilization

democrat michael dukakis sternly 
denounced the reagan administrations environmental record thursday 
and said toxic waste polluters better vote for mr bush because 
if im elected the game is over 
the massachusetts governor defended his own record on pollution 
in boston harbor an object of intense attack by republican rival 
george bush and said in his cleanup efforts hed had to fight 
bush and the administration every inch of the way 
dukakis pledged an eightyear cleanup of toxic waste sites as he 
accepted the endorsement of several environmental groups during an 
appearance on the rutgers university campus 
he was accompanied by actor robert redford who drew squeals and 
cheers from the large outdoor crowd 
hello everybody im dan quayle joked redford whom quayle 
has been said to resemble 
redford known for his outspokenness on environmental issues 
said bush was cocaptain of an administration that has 
consistently stalled or blocked efforts to clean up our 
environment 
a crowd of students kept to the side of the rally chanted 
bush and boring as dukakis spoke dukakis paused once and 
said weve got a certain amount of noise pollution over here 
dukakis blamed the administration for environmental failures and 
embarrassments including the medical wastes that washed up on new 
jersey shores this summer as he delivered a stinging assault on 
bush 
for the footdraggers and chronic polluters i have just one 
message dukakis said you better vote for mr bush because if 
im elected the game is over no more of the sweetheart deals and 
delayed cleanups and halfbaked compromises that weve seen over 
the past seven and a half years 
if youre satisfied with oceans you cant swim in air you 
have trouble breathing and toxic waste dumps that threaten your 
health then vote for mr bush he said 
dukakis barbs followed bushs declaration in new jersey several 
weeks ago that i am an environmentalist at the same time 
dukakis ridiculed quayle bushs running mate 
calling george bush an environmentalist is like calling dan 
quayle a statesman because george bush has been part of an 
administration whose environmental policies are hazardous to our 
health dukakis said 
he began the day with a private meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand in new york city 
his trip by motorcade to new brunswick was interrupted when the 
limousine he was traveling in had a flat tire on the new jersey 
turnpike 
after a fiveminute pause dukakis was moved to another vehicle 
and the cadillac limo its right front tire in shreds was left 
behind 
from new jersey dukakis flew to dallas for a fundraiser and 
private meeting with hispanic leaders at a news conference upon 
his arrival dukakis explained his support of a national governors 
association resolution in 1985 that included a oneyearfreeze on 
social security costofliving increases 
the vice president campaigning in michigan accused dukakis of 
demagoguery for criticizing bush for casting a tiebreaking 
vote in 1985 in support of legislation imposing such a freeze 
dukakis said he wanted to protect social security from the 
freeze on a number of programs he said he cast the vote as a 
general expression of my concern for the deficit but i made it 
very very clear that i was opposed to cutting costofliving 
increases for social security recipients 
there were a great many of us governors who opposed any cut 
in social security but we at least wanted to give the 
administration a message that we were concerned about the 
deficit he said 
in his speech thursday dukakis blasted the administration 
saying cleanup efforts had been begun at only 137 toxic waste sites 
of the 1200 sites on the priority list under the superfund law he 
said only 36 had been completed 
he pledged that if he is elected cleanup would be completed or 
well under way at all the sites within eight years he offered 
no estimate of cost but promised to make polluters pay issues 
adviser victoria rideout estimated a 13 billion cost to begin the 
cleanup efforts 
in a separate statement the camapign said bush as head of an 
administration task force on regulatory relief led efforts to 
weaken suspend or kill environmental regulations 
dukakis defended his own actions as governor of massachusetts in 
regard to boston harbor 
today my friends were cleaning it up dukakis said in 
the course of that cleanup weve had to fight mr bush and the 
administration he belongs to every inch of he way 
he said the administration vetoed the clean water act twice 
and cut the funding for our cleanup project and said the 
environmental protection agency took forever to approve our 
cleanup plan 
boston harbor remains badly polluted and continues to have 
barely treated sewage dumped in it with dukakis as governor 
massachusetts officials filed for waivers to the federally mandated 
cleanup of the harbor

a judge on thursday declared a mistrial in the 
weaponspossesion case of syndicated columnist carl t rowan after 
the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked 
earlier in the day judge arthur l burnett of district of 
columbia superior court had reread his instructions to the jury 
after the 12member panel said it was unable to reach a verdict 
rowan has been charged with using an unregistered handgun and 
ammunition to wound a teenaged intruder in the back yard of his 
home last june he faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison 
and a 2000 fine if convicted 
burnett said he was convinced that further deliberations would 
not lead to a verdict the jury had deliberated about nine hours 
over two days 
one juror who declined to be identified told reporters the 
panel had been in favor of acquittal by a 93 margin a unanimous 
verdict was required 
as burnett announced his decision rowan who was seated at the 
defense table smiled at his attorneys and then at his wife vivian 
he had no comment as he left the courtroom 
claude bailey a spokesman for city corporation counsel 
frederick cooke said city officials had not discussed what action 
to take if the trial ended in a hung jury 
rowan 63 shot 18yearold benjamin smith in the wrist after 
smith and friends had taken an uninvited swim in his backyard pool 
in the predawn hours of june 14 
smith interviewed by washington television station wrctv in 
massachusetts where he attends college said thursday my mind 
is pretty clear as to whether or not he had an unregistered weapon 
because he shot me with it and theres not a whole lot of 
confusion about that 
im not gonna go pool hopping again he said when asked what 
lessons he had learned from the incident my feelings toward 
handguns actually have been a lot stronger since this incident 
the defense built its case around a littleused legal principle 
called entrapment by estoppel the principle holds that a 
person cannot be convicted if he is prosecuted for following advice 
given him by a government official 
rowan had testified that his son carl jr a former fbi agent 
was repeatedly rebuffed by police officials when he tried to 
register the 22 caliber revolver used in the shooting 
the citys handgun ordinance allows only security officers to 
register weapons although exemptions commonly are made for law 
enforcement officers 
rowans son also testified that city police told him he was 
exempt from the registration requirements because he was a law 
enforcement officer and that others in his family could have 
access to the gun as well 
he carl jr was depending upon the competence and 
intelligence of those people that the district of columbia put 
there to advise citizens on gun registration raoul carroll 
rowans attorney argued during the trial he was entirely at the 
mercy of the district of columbia 
one juror who declined to reveal his name said that wrong 
information was given to carl rowan jr and carl rowan sr by 
authorities 
rowan who is black testified that he obtained the weapon from 
his son in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from 
people purporting to be members of the ku klux klan 
he said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by 
teenagers who held latenight pool parties usually with alcohol 
and drugs in his yard 
prosecutors contended however that rowan was not authorized to 
handle a weapon not registered to him 
we are here simply because the handgun is not registered 
prosecutor thomas c collier told the court the death threats 
the shooting and the issue of trespassing have nothing to do with 
this case 
police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a 
door at the rear of rowans home showed signs that someone had 
tried to break in one officer also said smith had been shot at 
close range just outside the home 
rowan maintained that he shot smith because he was afraid the 
intruder was trying to enter the house

the legislature and the communist partys 
policymaking body will shake up the kremlin hierarchy in 
extraordinary meetings this week a highlevel source said thursday 
the policysetting central committee meets friday and the 
supreme soviet on saturday the meetings brought officials rushing 
back to moscow and sparked speculation that soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev and his opponents would face off over his ambitious 
economic and social reforms 
soviet sources said there was no crisis in the leadership 
but the abrupt change in plans of several top kremlin figures 
clearly indicated urgent or unexpected business 
tass reported foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze landed in 
moscow thursday afternoon after cutting short a un visit defense 
minister dmitri t yazov ended a visit to india a day ahead of 
schedule 
the 1500member supreme soviet the nations parliament 
usually convenes twice a year after meetings of the 300member 
central committee it last met may 2426 
soviet media reported sunday that a regular session of the 
supreme soviet would begin oct 27 and the announcement thursday 
of a special sitting at such short notice was highly unusual 
the central committee had been expected to meet by the end of 
october but one soviet source said plans for implementing 
gorbachevs political reforms were proceeding faster than was 
expected 
the source a member of the central committee staff said the 
committee will approve changes in the party and the structure of 
government outlined at a party conference in june 
the reforms are intended to enhance the status of the party as 
the leading force in soviet society 
the source called it logical that personnel changes would 
follow any change in the organizations format he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in washington reagan administration officials disclosed that 
diplomats in several foreign countries were told one personnel 
change might be the elevation of marshal sergei f akhromeyev to a 
position of special assistant to gorbachev 
akhromeyev is the chief of the general staff a position equal 
to that of chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff and the no 
2 military officer in the soviet union behind the defense minister 
the officials who demanded anonymity said the administration 
had yet to verify the reports independently 
at its last meeting july 29 the central committee adopted a 
timetable for overhauling the soviet political system which also 
was discussed at the party conference 
that blueprint calls for a new fulltime legislature and a more 
powerful president a post gorbachev could take on 
the first deadline set was october by which time the central 
committee said a draft law on amendments to the soviet constitution 
and on multicandidate elections of legislators was to be complete 
in a sept 23 speech gorbachev said the partys 13member 
politburo would convene soon to review the draft law 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev told a government 
news briefing thursday that the central committee plenum will 
mark another step in realizing the decisions of the last party 
conference the central committee source put the focus on changes 
in the partys structure 
soviet sources also reported speculation among highplaced 
officials about possible changes on the politburo itself 
indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda 
the central committee is empowered to make personnel changes in 
the politburo the partys ruling body 
the last full politburo member removed was geidar a aliev on 
oct 21 1987 aliev was a protege of former president leonid i 
brezhnev who now is harshly criticized for permitting corruption 
and stagnation 
the conference of 5000 communist party officials held in moscow 
three months ago approved plans to limit terms of communist party 
officials and a review of the partys 20 million members 
at that session one delegate criticized by name president 
andrei a gromyko 79 and fellow politburo member mikhail s 
solomentsev 75 linking them to the abuses of the brezhnev era 
some observers speculate that gorbachevs backers want to remove 
60 to 70 central committee members 
gorbachev repeatedly has criticized the party apparatus for 
being too involved in daily government operations and argues that 
the party should focus on broad policies and theories 
personnel changes could give gorbachev and his backers a chance 
to move out conservative party bureaucrats they see blocking the 
soviet leaders reforms 
in a speech wednesday gorbachev again pressed the case for 
sweeping reforms any of the current burning problems underscores 
the necessity of radical change he said

the services top admiral has decided 
adm carlisle ah trost in a speech delivered earlier this 
week at a classified symposium surprised many in the audience by 
announcing the navy would no longer just dabble in research of 
integrated electric drive propulsion but instead would embrace 
it as the power plant of the future 
in view of its many wellknown advantages i am declaring that 
integrated electric drive with its associated cluster of 
technologies will be the method of propulsion for the next class 
of surface battle force combatants trost said 
and i am directing all the major navy organizations involved 
in these efforts to concentrate their energies toward that 
objective its something that has stayed in the laboratory too 
long and we need to tear down those barriers that have prevented 
its development

evan mecham was thrown out of office six months 
ago but the former arizona governor remains a defiant political 
force whose supporters have shown strength at the polls and whose 
thoughts of a possible gubernatorial challenge in 1990 remain alive 
mecham says he is doing fine and feels he is winning his war 
against the political establishment 
it doesnt bother me at all not to be there in the governors 
office he said in an interview besides weighing a run two 
years from now for the governorship he said he is still 
considering a federal court appeal of his impeachment conviction 
the april 4 removal of mecham a republican by the state senate 
put a democrat rose mofford in the governors chair and began a 
period of political turmoil that some politicians say could 
reverberate for years 
in a bitter gop primary sept 13 senate president carl kunasek 
and house speaker joe lane lost their seats to mecham backers 
seven other incumbent lawmakers also were defeated 
the republican party is devastated said senate minority 
leader alan stephens who hopes his democrats can capitalize on the 
troubles to take over the senate in the nov 8 election 
although meacham insists he is not motivated by a thirst for 
revenge against the lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict him 
he has predicted a revolution at the ballot box this fall that 
would turn many incumbents out of office 
the exgovernor formed a group that has provided advice and 
literature to gop candidates who backed him 
but among those who lost their primaries according to house 
minority leader art hamilton a democrat were many republicans who 
tried to accommodate mechams policies early in his governorship 
the fact of the matter is the mecham forces do not accept 95 
percent support 99 percent support hamilton said either you 
live and die with him all the way or they try to see that you die 
it isnt a matter of getting even mecham said but one of 
seeing the legislature controlled by the people instead of the 
power brokers 
whether im in the office or not isnt the most important 
thing in the world he said i have no real regrets 
many of the legislators who removed mecham after 15 months in 
office say they dont have any regrets either 
i would vote the same way even knowing what was coming 
said house judiciary chairman jim skelly a republican who headed 
the impeachment committee 
philosophically i liked what he was trying to do namely stop 
state spending said skelly like mecham a strong conservative 
but he added that the impeachment evidence against mecham was 
absolutely overwhelming 
let us not forget the chaos that existed when he was 
governor stephens added the state was going down the tubes 
quickly if i had it to do over again id convict him again 
mecham was convicted of misusing 80000 from a special 
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and of 
trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat the 
fund was created through private donations to a mecham inaugural 
committee and was subsequently pledged for protocol purposes such 
as buying gifts for visiting dignitaries 
gov mofford and attorney general bob corbin have filed a civil 
suit seeking to force mecham to turn the protocol fund over to the 
state mecham still maintaining it isnt public money tried to 
return it to those who donated it a bank refused to honor the 
checks however till the legal issue was settled 
the impeachment conviction itself was the finale to a 
governorship in which he was accused of appointing incompetent 
cronies to state jobs and of making statements offensive to women 
blacks jews homosexuals and the japanese 
in june however mecham was acquitted in criminal court on six 
felony charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan a verdict 
he considered a major vindication that trial required stronger 
proof than the clear and convincing evidence required for the 
senate conviction 
the conviction propelled mrs mofford the popular longtime 
secretary of state into the governors chair and she has been 
widely credited with returning stability and competence to state 
government 
lane the defeated house speaker said one of the former 
governors main problems was that he refused to work with the 
legislature 
but mecham appointee max hawkins insisted that the governor 
leaned over backwards to work with them hawkins still contends 
there was no valid reason for the impeachment 
there was a faction in the republican party that was 
vehemently opposed to mecham said mechams former press 
secretary ron bellus it was very deep and very mean and very 
angry that group was out to discredit and destroy evan mecham at 
any cost 
the new governor wishes the political turmoil would quiet down 
i have a good feeling out there with the public we cannot wave a 
magic wand here and solve all of the problems but were facing 
them mrs mofford said 
i think too much attention is focused on evan mecham

echoes of one of world war 
iis most famous battles still reverberate through the jungles of 
guadalcanal as australian army demolition experts detonate a huge 
stock of japanese and american ammunition that litters the old 
battlefield 
occasionally the war claims another casualty when solomon 
islands fishermen are killed trying to pry open the rusting 
artillery shells to get the explosives which they use to stun fish 
at st josephs school the students have been warned to stop 
their favorite game of throwing old mortar bombs into a fire then 
running away to hide behind a tree to await the explosion 
the australians are committed to clearing the explosives from 22 
acres of jungle down to a depth of 10 feet at a place called 
hells point about five miles from honiara capital of the solomons 
its a fiveyear program said sgt allan mansell and 
when weve finished theres another area on the sea side of 
henderson field that will take about 10 years 
henderson field now the main airport for honiara was the focal 
point of a us marine corps landing on aug 7 1942 that became 
one of the bloodiest battles of the war 
when the japanese finally withdrew six months later the united 
states had lost 1600 killed and 4200 wounded the japanese losses 
are estimated to have been 15000 killed 
when the americans left at the end of the war they attempted 
to blow up their ammunition dumps said mansell 
what they succeeded in doing was to scatter live ammunition 
all over the area like confetti 
there are probably a million rounds of 105mm howitzer shells 
mortars and grenades we collected 2000 rounds in one day 
the australians assisted by the solomon islands police slash 
the headhigh kunai grass to the ground clear the area of shells 
lying on the surface then use metal detectors to find buried 
ammunition 
they stack the shells in piles attach plastic explosives to 
them and detonate them from a bunker 500 yards away 
they first warn the control tower at henderson field in case a 
plane is overhead the shrapnel slices through the jungle and into 
the sky for more than 1000 feet 
it can be tricky said mansell the whole area is 
surrounded by a minefield and weve got to clear that too 
as well as saving the lives of unsuspecting islanders the 
cleanup will end a profitable sideline for islanders who chisel 
brass rings off the base of the shells to sell for scrap some have 
been killed doing it 
tourists have been stopped boarding planes carrying live world 
war ii ammunition bought as souvenirs 
the principal at st josephs where the building rattles daily 
from the detonations will lose his supply of shrapnel pieces which 
he sells to tourists for 20 cents each to raise funds for the 
school

japanese researchers are unearthing a steady flow 
of evidence of their countrys production of banned chemical 
weapons and macabre germwarfare experiments after it annexed 
manchuria in 1932 and throughout world war ii 
critics here say the government has yet to fully address the 
japanese role in the use of toxic gases up to the end of world war 
ii in 1945 or acknowledge the grisly experiments conducted by the 
japanese armys notorious unit 731 in manchuria 
hisashi yamanaka writer and collector of war documents said he 
has discovered official reports indicating that the japanese 
military planned wide distribution of poisongas weapons in china 
in violation of international treaties japan had signed after world 
war i and in 1925 
yamanaka pointing to pamphlets yellowed with age and stamped 
top secret said these are the most detailed official 
accounts of japanese military deeds uncovered up until now 
the japanese government has never denied the existence of the 
germ warfare unit or use of gas weapons by the japanese imperial 
army but officials maintain there is insufficient evidence to 
determine the extent of japans involvement with gas and germ 
weapons because all documents were destroyed at the end of the war 
yamanaka 57 whose rummaging through oldbook stores paid off 
last year said his find shows not everyone followed military 
orders to burn their records 
riichi naito who served as an assistant to lt gen shiro 
ishii head of unit 731 kept his records after he passed away 
relatives unknowingly sold off his books yamanaka said in an 
interview at his suburban home in fujisawa 
he said the documents state that unit 731 based in harbin 
manchuria had spread out to encompass 26 experimental centers 
around china by 1940 and employed more than 10000 people they 
also state that the unit was experimenting in methods of growing 
diseaseproducing organisms and preparing vaccines and that it 
conducted bacteriological tests on prisoners of war 
yamanaka said that when he found the reports last year he 
thought they dealt with something else and so it was only this 
year that he reexamined them 
nagasaki universitys keiichi tsuneishi a specialist in the 
history of science verified yamanakas documents and made the 
results public at an international conference in san diego calif 
in august 
though news reports from the san diego meeting were widely 
published in japan yamanaka said he doubts that those and other 
revelations would bring a government response to allegations of 
wartime excesses 
it would make japan look evil he said moreover there is 
always the possibility that research is still continuing today and 
they the government want to keep it confidential 
the government however officially opposes chemical weapons 
and it welcomed president reagans speech sept 26 to the united 
nations general assembly calling for a chemicalweapons ban on a 
verifiable and global basis 
tsuneishi said unit 731 researchers injected chinese and soviet 
prisoners with typhus cholera and a variety of other germs 
induced gangrene did live dissections and froze victims to death 
in endurance tests 
after the war ishii the head of unit 731 was questioned by 
us occupation authorities but wasnt prosecuted 
tsuneishi and others maintain that the united states gave 
immunity to such japanese researchers in exchange for their data 
because the united states had only begun gas and germ warfare 
research in 1944 and wanted to gain headway in the field 
on the small island of okuno in japans inland sea hatsuichi 
murakami 62 opened a small museum in july as testimony to the 
japanese workers in the secret chemical weapons factory there 
the residents of okuno decided to open this museum to teach 
others that chemical weapons are an outrage against humanity 
murakami said in a raspy voice he like many of his surviving 
coworkers suffers from respiratory illness a legacy of the five 
years he worked in the chemical factory from 1940 
the military in 1939 deleted okuno from japanese maps to keep 
its chemicalweapons factory a secret the island near hiroshima 
is about 400 miles southwest of tokyo 
the factory produced mustard gas lewisite nausea gas and 
hydrocyanic acid gas for use against china 
we produced some 1200 tons annually during the peak years 
from 194043 murakami said in a telephone interview from ocuna 
there were healthy people when i went in young girls and boys 
but we had to work long hours and the level of gas sometimes 
reached danger levels 
allied forces destroyed the factory in 1945 
in midseptember many newspapers again carried news stories 
reporting research by yuki tanaka a japanese teaching in 
australia on people who worked in the okuno island factory 
a separate document released by yamanaka and reported widely in 
the japanese press in september outlined military plans to 
distribute gas weapons in china during the height of the japanese 
military offensive in 1938 
since 1981 reports have trickled out from us and japanese 
researchers about world war ii germsuch material 
in school textbooks has become a controversial one in japan 
but the education ministry which has final say on content of 
textbooks contends the evidence isnt conclusive

the unique nature of the phoenix family was 
recently related by young actor river phoenix 
i was born in oregon my sister rain was born in texas my 
brother joaquin rafael alias leaf was born in puerto rico my 
other sister liberty is a native of venezuela my other sister 
summer was born in florida my mother in the bronx ny my 
father in fontana calif he said 
river who just turned 18 added since i was 10 we have been 
based in los angeles we moved frequently from home to home in los 
angeles never owned a house sometimes we moved because our 
financial condition was weakening and we needed a more affordable 
place sometimes we moved because we recently got a part which 
allowed us to get above the unpleasant conditions we were in 
arlynn and john phoenix worked odd jobs and lived the 
freespirited lifestyle of the 1960s they were noncomformists and 
loved nature today they write and lecture on environmentalism and 
work as farmers in florida 
besides river leaf 13 is an actor the other children also 
have done a little acting 
the phoenix family offers an uncanny parallel to the pope family 
in the current warner bros release running on empty which 
stars christine lahti judd hirsch and river both families are 
environmental activists and nontraditionalists 
but there is an important difference the popes husband wife 
and two sons are on the lam during the turbulent 1960s the 
parents bombed a napalm laboratory inadvertently blinding a 
janitor the popes have been on the fbis mostwanted list ever 
since 
we were a little different from the motives behind the pope 
family and why they moved phoenix said obviously they were 
moving because they had to for survival 
according to family legend river began his performing career at 
the age of five on the streets of caracas singing with his sister 
rainbow then three when the family made the move to los angeles 
he began getting television work making his film debut in the 1985 
explorers his naturalness and dramatic intensity impressed 
critics and young fans alike in stand by me the mosquito 
coast a night in the life of jimmy reardon and little 
nikita 
sidney lumet who directed him in running on empty said 
phoenix is in the transitional period between child and adult 
actor he has a surprising technique that he has developed on his 
own he has never studied acting 
but hell make the adjustment to adulthood he can play 
a couple more teenagers but then who knows hes a very 
talented musician and writes beautiful songs hes one of those 
people whos so talented i dont know where hes going to go the 
world is open to him 
phoenix views his peripatetic childhood as an asset to him as an 
actor 
i think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new 
situations new atmospheres new people just as you do when you go 
from film to film he said it also gives you an insight on 
different forms of life and different perspectives 
in facing new schools and new neighborhoods he added you 
learn to blend in and to simulate what the others are doing and 
apply that to your reality around them by your doing so they will 
take you in without conforming and without compromising your 
individuality there is a way of being neutral and not running 
things the wrong way 
how does he see his future in films or does he just take one 
year at a time 
even one year at a time is too long a time span for me to 
foresee im very happy with what im doing very aware and open to 
changes will accept them gladly when they come he said by 
all means i am not tied down nor do i feel the need nor is my 
security or my ego riding on this career 
if anything i would rather quit while i was ahead i wouldnt 
try to keep an old car plugging away if its not working anymore 
id just get into another business or use that time to travel 
well see how it all happens i think a lot of it is in how you 
pace yourself not spreading yourself too thin he said 
every bit of it is a learning process if im taking parts 
that teach me to act out these cliche forms of writing and to live 
these little molds because theyre commercially successful it 
strips you of any unique flavor that you might have within 
yourself

wilkesbarre pa ap euterpe dukakis is awake at 230 one 
recent friday morning too excited for sleep at age 85 she is 
ready for another campaign trip on behalf of her son michael who 
is running for president 
her mostly elderly audiences marvel at the energy that propels 
her through the once rich anthracite coal country of eastern 
pennsylvania 
from wilkesbarre to scranton to olyphant to allentown mrs 
dukakis and four campaign workers drive past slack piles and fields 
of morning glories with only three hours sleep she naps when she 
can 
before the day is over she will speak at four events pose for 
souvenir photos with wellwishers and give brief interviews to a 
dozen reporters she will work the crowds clasping hands and often 
speaking in her native tongue to greekamericans 
she talks of her immigration to the united states from larissa 
in northern greece with her parents and three sisters when she was 
9 years old 
we came to my older brother who came first when he was 18 
years old and settled here this is the story of all immigrant 
families then he brought my younger brother and the two together 
were able to bring the whole family she says 
i dont know where she gets the energy at that age to give one 
speech and go on to another says jule dobrowski 70 who was 
among 200 elderly residents who heard mrs dukakis speak at the 
lackawanna county health care center in olyphant 
i come from strong mountain people mrs dukakis said in an 
interview en route from one stop to another maybe thats one 
thing my grandmother died at 95 my greatgrandmother died when 
she was 105 i have a long way to go yet this campaign has 
really gave me a great infusion of energy 
she has traveled to two dozen states some more than once from 
east coast to west coast in the more than a year she has been 
drumming up votes for her son the democratic presidential nominee 
she averages three days a week on the campaign trail 
she looks like the old world mother that she is a plain woman 
short whitegrayish hair glasses simple black skirt peach 
colored blouse red jacket 
as a matter of fact only the sunday before this trip her son 
went to her house not for political advice which she never gives 
him but for breakfast she made blueberry muffins for him which 
he enjoyed then filled a box for him to take home to his wife 
kitty 
shes a regular mother says mary thomas a pennsylvania 
delegate for dukakis at the democratic national convention last 
july shes a person you can relate to shes a real person 
matronly in dress and simple in speech she is spunky in 
defending her son against attacks from the republicans including 
his opponent vice president george bush and president reagan 
theyre not true she said what particulary hurt her was 
reagans reference last august to her son as an invalid in response 
to dukakis denial that he had ever undergone psychiatric 
treatment the president said later he was joking 
michael had lost his brother in a terrible accident and he 
also lost the election and he was depressed mrs dukakis said 
dukakis older brother stelian who was beset by mental 
problems died in 1973 when he was struck by a hitandrun driver 
while riding his bike to this day the driver has not been caught 
dukakis lost in his bid for a second term as governor in the 1978 
primary election but won back the office four years later 
mrs dukakis is no different than most parents when it comes to 
bragging about her son 
michael has been my joy from the time he was born she told 
200 people at the wilkesbarre senior citizens center he was a 
very easy child to bring up he loved life he loved everything 
that he did he loved people and he has continued to and that is 
why he is in politics 
mrs dukakis says she loves campaigning and was disappointed 
when she was grounded for a time in august because of laryngitis 
and a bad cough i love meeting people my son gets it from me i 
guess 
she shows her enthusiasm after a luncheon of chicken and rice in 
scranton with local supporters too bad we couldnt push the 
tables to the wall and start dancing she tells them as she 
hurries to the next stop another time they laugh and applaud 
but it is not all laughter even though mrs dukakis says shes 
never had one unhappy moment on the campaign trail small groups of 
antiabortion demonstrators dog her wherever she goes with signs 
saying things like we welcome you more than your son will 
welcome the unborn aides try to steer her out of sight of them 
michael is prolife she says but hes not the same 
prolife that they are it isnt that hes for abortion but since 
it exists let a woman make her own choice according to her 
religion or her sense of morals 
at the end of this day she has a 7 pm flight to catch at 
allentown airport she wants to get home before 10 i want to see 
kitty on tv with barbara walters this is an important night sir 
but the flight is an hour late late because of thunderstorms 
she sits in the airport lounge watching her son on the television 
news finally she is airborne and arrives back home in brookline 
mass just moments before 10

nearly 50 years after the joad family made that 
memorable trek from dry and dusty oklahoma to the fertile farmlands 
of california the grapes of wrath has made a new journey from 
page to stage 
its not the first theater adaptation of the pulitzer 
prizewinning novel by john steinbeck but the steppenwolf theater 
company production at the royalgeorge theater which closes oct 
30 is certainly the most expensive the 500000 project also has 
the enthusiastic support of elaine steinbeck the authors widow 
the play stars two of the steppenwolf troupes biggest names 
gary sinise and terry kinney as well as guest artist lois smith as 
the indomitable ma joad 
atampt picked up part of the tab for the threehour production 
which has a cast of 41 including four musicians who play an 
original score by michael smith they perform on a spare 
woodenplank setting designed by kevin rigdon who also did the 
costumes and lighting the roughhewn set covers the floor and back 
wall of the large stage 
but the man most responsible for the play as well as its 
direction is frank galati a chicago jack of alltheatrical trades 
who acts writes directs and teaches the 44yearold galati first 
read the grapes of wrath in high school 
it affected me in a number of ways that ive only begun to 
understand in the last couple of years he said it turned me 
in the direction of literature and my whole academic life as a 
student and as a teacher has been involved in the study of 
fiction 
galati began adapting novels for the stage as a teacher at 
northwestern university where he directed a summer program that 
took students through the process 
one novel he wanted to adapt was the grapes of wrath but he 
couldnt get the rights the idea lay dormant until sinise at the 
time steppenwolfs artistic director invited galati to submit 
suggestions for possible productions 
i thought the grapes of wrath would offer wonderful 
opportunities for an ensemble of exceptional actors galati said 
sinise who had had some success with a production of steinbecks 
of mice and men a few years earlier agreed 
the steinbeck estate after extended negotiations granted 
permission by january of this year galati had done two drafts and 
began a third version after randall arney steppenwolfs artistic 
director and stephen eich its managing director decided to open 
the companys fall season with the work 
how does one boil down a sprawling novel of 30 chapters and 
nearly 600 pages galati started with a careful rereading 
i needed to see the flow of the book he said 
particularly those incidents and episodes and characters that 
come to the surface as tent poles a kind of spine on which the 
rest of the action hangs 
the novel galati says is kind of an american ballad and poses 
particular problems for a dramatist 
on stage youre stuck with having to get a truck full of 13 
people from oklahoma to california by moving it a few feet he 
said that compression and telescoping and distortion of time 
and space is a very significant problem 
the book has an ab ab form of alternating chapters that go 
from the general to the specific steinbeck does a kind of 
landscape painting voice by voice you get the sense of the great 
numbers of characters who are part of the epoch he was reflecting 
the migrant workers the land bosses the contractors the labor 
organizers the businessmen you also get a panorama of the dust 
bowl highway 66 from oklahoma to california 
these broad scenes alternate with the stories of the joad 
family their immediate concerns and the characters they meet 
steinbeck had a remarkable way and very experimental for its 
time of letting scenes take their own natural time galati said 
people in the novel dont come to conclusions quickly there are 
some cataclysmic scenes and events of course but very often 
dialogue and rhetoric move at a leisurely pace which i was 
interested in retaining without sacrificing the need for urgency in 
the drama 
galati needed to find a framework to dramatize the more general 
chapters he found his answer in music 
i contacted smith a wonderful chicago composer and folk 
singer and gave him sections of the novel that i had condensed 
into lyrics and asked him to set those lyrics to music which he did 
over the course of the summer galati says 
have their efforts paid off 
the major chicago reviews were divided about the shows merits 
in the chicago suntimes hedy weiss called the production 
breathtaking and emotionally wrenching it would be an 
unpardonable sin if it did not receive an extended life both in 
this country and abroad although the chicago tribunes richard 
christiansen described the play as reverent and ambitious 
he said admiration for its effort must give way to disappointment 
in its results 
galati feels the grapes of wrath both as a novel and a 
stage play holds a particular relevance for people in 1988 
there is this uncanny coincidence of the summer drought 
devastating american agriculture he says and theres the 
theme of literally sacrificing the land abusing and destroying the 
environment for the sake of capital gains and weve still got 
migrant workers as the lowest rung of the social and economic 
ladder those themes remain as resonant today as they were in 
1939

despite grim predictions the city escaped 
economic disaster following the 1987 stock market crash and made a 
relatively soft landing officials and economic experts say 
though the financial sector was hit with layoffs and the city 
responded with budgetary belt tightening in the form of a hiring 
freeze and tax increases worstcase scenarios never materialized 
this was the year that everyone predicted would be a downer 
said samuel ehrenhalt regional commissioner of the federal bureau 
of labor statistics but the citys economy did not go over the 
cliff 
paul dickstein director of the citys office of management and 
budget agrees the crash did not bring on the economic disaster 
predicted by some but he said weve paid for it and will 
continue paying for it 
dickstein cited the 6000 jobs left vacant as a result of the 
threemonth hiring freeze and another 5827 positions eliminated 
under a subsequent reduction program aimed at saving 270 million 
officials were also forced to raise property taxes and to 
eliminate an energy tax break for businesses the object to raise 
115 million to make up part of a projected 300 million in lost 
tax and sales revenues 
though the citys economy remains basically healthy 
dickstein said things are going to be much tighter for the next 
few years than it has been in some time 
we had been experiencing an unprecedented boom for a long 
period of time because of the precrash bull market dickstein 
said we have to recognize that thats over and therefore city 
expenditures have to be moderated 
after all that was the most important industry in this 
town he said every town has one and ours was financial 
services and still is you would expect then if your most 
important industry is in the midst of shrinking jobs and revenue 
that your tax revenues will decline with it 
for city residents evidence of the crash of 87 will be seen in 
the form of dirtier streets due to a smaller sanitation staff 
shorter library hours more potholes a police force whose ranks 
are frozen 
its clear that new york city is in a very different 
economic environment now ehrenhalt said but on the whole 
if you consider the projections that had been made this is a 
relatively soft landing 
ehrenhalt said one analyst predicted 70000 jobs would be lost 
20000 of them on wall street alone 
in reality unemployment in the city for the first half of 1988 
was at a 19year low of 4 percent according to ehrenhalt and 
there was a net decline of 12000 jobs in the financial sector and 
another 3000 in banking 
those losses were offset by a gain of 16000 jobs in the service 
sector which includes the legal profession advertising health 
care and educational services 
normal growth for the city is about 18 percent to 2 percent 
so 1 percent after the crash is very good said rae rosen an 
economist for the federal home loan bank of new york 
predictions that other industries would feel tremors after the 
crash didnt prove true either 
the hotel and restaurant industry emerged virtually unscathed 
thanks largely to the devalued us dollar which has made new york 
a bargain hunters paradise for foreigners ehrenhalt said 
the construction industry has held up well though its not as 
strong as it was last year ehrenhalt said 
and the real estate industry survived predictions that property 
values would plunge as panicked executives unloaded condominiums 
and suburban estates 
i think most people held off looking at properties in the 
first few months to see what would happen said steven spinola 
head of the new york real estate board weve now got a healthier 
residential market than before 
the corcoran group which specializes in luxury residential 
sales reported that the average price of a twobedroom apartment 
in manhattan rose 325 percent in august to 489400 
spinola said office vacancy rates up about 13 percent are 
higher than wed like but even that market remains relatively 
strong 
thomas purcell executive director of the stamford board of 
realtors in connecticut said bigticket estates those in the 
900000 to 2 million range may have stayed on the market longer 
than usual but overall sales are equally as good as theyve been 
in other years 
though some complained the real estate market was soft ms 
rosen said it was only in the sense that people are no longer 
getting 20 percent gains in prices each year the gains are 
closer to 5 percent which is a more normal market 
its been a surprising year said ehrenhalt

ted turner who gave cable tv its first 
superstation launches his latest broadcasting venture monday night 
with the debut of turner network television the new home of 
scarlett ohara and miss piggy 
at first turner will build tnt with films from his 
billiondollar film library led off monday by gone with the 
wind his favorite movie 
on tuesday muppet creator jim hensons popular fraggle rock 
show moves from home box office to tnt the muppet show with 
miss piggy and kermit the frog will follow that afternoon and 
henson has signed on for other projects 
although early on the 24hour network will make liberal use of 
cartoons in the daytime and movies at night turner promises one 
major project a week by 1991 already scheduled are madefortnt 
movies starring martin sheen and son emilio estevez farrah fawcett 
and oscarwinners charlton heston and faye dunaway 
turner owner of cable news network and cnn headline news also 
promises to bid on major award shows sporting events including the 
olympics and major league baseball and other showcase programs 
turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get tnt 
initially 
its far less important what they launch with than how quickly 
they get into 30 million homes said industry analyst larry 
gerbrandt i think they need to reach 30 million within 18 to 
24 months to keep to their business plan and actually theyd like 
to do it sooner than that 
by reaching 30 million turners contract with the national 
basketball association will allow him to move a regular schedule of 
pro basketball games featuring all the nba teams not just 
turners own atlanta hawks from superstation tbs to tnt that 
turner said will free him to show more hawks games on tbs 
tnt spokeswoman allison berry said early projections had tnt in 
30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990 but the increase 
in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989 
gerbrandt and other analysts suggest tnt is the next step in 
cable programming 
tnt creates a basis for cable to compete toe to toe down the 
road with what the networks are going to do said scott sassa 
the networks 29yearold executive vice president 
weve moved from cable providing a strong television signal to 
becoming a provider of alternative programming a variety of 
programs said michael kupinski an industry analyst with ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
and tnt which unlike movie channels allows local cable systems 
to sell four minutes of advertising each hour is great for the 
cable industry itself kupinski said any addition in 
programming is kind of a big benefit for cable especially 
exclusive programming 
the network promises it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for 
the first three years into original programming and turner himself 
told cable company executives in atlanta for a trade show that the 
network would lose 40 million before breaking even 
that 80 percent is crucial gerbrandt said whereas many 
cable networks are conceptdriven allnews allsports this 
is a real programdriven idea where it will succeed program by 
program he said 
sassa estimates it will take two years to lose that 40 million 
but as sassa and turner point out the startup costs for tnt 
would be greatly increased without turners purchase two years ago 
of the film libraries 
if we didnt have the mgm library and the rko and warner 
libraries we never could have started the networks and that was a 
billion and a half dollar investment turner said 
turner acquired more than 3000 films when he purchased mgmua 
entertainment co then sold all but the films to pay for the 
transaction 
the deal left turner saddled with 14 billion of debt and 
raised doubts about whether he could survive that debt has since 
been refinanced and large cable companies have bought interest in 
turner broadcasting system inc gaining seats on the board of 
directors and sayso over large financial decisions 
gerbrandt said financial restrictions imposed on turner by the 
cable operators have contributed to the companys ability to 
recover from the mgm deal 
turner executives also point to that cable participation as a 
key to the companys survival and as a guarantee to the industry 
that tbs will remain a key provider of programming for their 
systems 
were not going to take your money and head for monte carlo 
with it or take it and put it into a project for cbs nbc or abc 
like some of the other interests whose ownership is more committed 
to network television than it is to the cable industry turner 
told the cable operators 
unlike the fox network which broadcasts original programming on 
weekend nights over the airwaves tnt will be a 24hour cable 
operation 
one of the keys to the success of tnt according to gerbrandt 
analyst for kagan and associates in carmel calif is the 
acceptance by cable systems whose limited channel space already is 
overwhelmed 
i think the general sense in the industry is that tnt is an 
idea whose time has come but hes launching it at a time when 
channel capacity is not exactly abundant gerbrandt said in a 
telephone interview 
the real push is going to be in systems launching jan 1 and 
mid89 gerbrandt said because thats typically when cable 
systems change services as they kick in rate increases 
also if youre going to change your lineup you do it at 
that time 
a recent survey indicates the service has broad support among 
some of the major system operators 
beaufort ncbased marquest research said it interviewed key 
executives at 15 companies ranking among the top 25 multiple system 
cable operators including eight of the top 10 
it said twothirds of those surveyed said tnt would be given 
broad carriage across their systems with the remaining third 
saying carriage would be moderate

the supreme court begins its 198889 term 
monday with its newest justice anthony m kennedy holding what 
may be the decisive vote in major controversies over civil rights 
affirmative action capital punishment and drugtesting 
many experts say kennedy beginning his first full term since 
becoming a justice last february could determine whether the 
courts erratic 20year drift toward conservatism will accelerate 
dramatically 
were not sure where he lines up said thomas krattenmaker 
dean of the georgetown university law school it will be 
interesting to see whether kennedy takes the middle road or opts 
for a more ideological route 
over the next nine months the court has agreed to rule on these 
issues 
the death penalty for convicted murderers who committed their 
crimes before reaching the age of 18 
the death penalty for mentally retarded killers 
the power of local governments to require that a certain 
percentage of public works projects be awarded to minorityowned 
construction businesses 
mandatory drug testing for railroad employees involved in 
serious accidents and for people seeking drugenforcement jobs 
within the us customs service 
the continued vitality of a 1976 supreme court decision used to 
fight private or nongovernmental racial discrimination 
the court could be deeply divided on each issue 
an anticipated bellwether for kennedy and the court is a north 
carolina case involving charges of onthejob racial harassment 
the justices with kennedy on the side of the majority voted 54 
last april to use the case to reconsider a 1976 decision called 
runyon vs mccrary 
in the 1976 decision the court said racially segregated private 
schools violate a federal civil rights law when they refuse to 
admit black students the ruling let civil rights groups use that 
law as a weapon in attacking other forms of private bias as well 
justice harry a blackmun recently told a group of law students 
in arkansas i think the outcome of the case will be of some 
significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of 
the 20th century 
marsha levick executive director of the national organization 
for womens legal arm said kennedys votes in the north carolina 
case and other pending civil rights disputes are key 
anthony kennedy is absolutely someone to watch he has not 
been generous in his reading of civil rights laws as a federal 
appeals court judge she said 
blackmun author of the high courts 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion told his arkansas audience that kennedys views on the 
issue as yet unknown could put the landmark roe vs wade ruling 
in jeopardy if a new abortion case wins the courts review 
the next question is will roe vs wade go down the drain i 
think theres a very distinct possibility it will this term 
blackmun said 
four court members chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor 
have criticized the 1973 decision 
in an apparent reference to kennedy blackmun added one never 
knows what a new justices attitude is toward overturning past 
decisions 
krattenmaker warned against judging kennedy by his initial 
votes noting that in his early years on the court blackmun was 
considered a staunch conservative but is now viewed as a leading 
liberal on many issues 
we may not learn anything this term about kennedy that turns 
out to be enduring krattenmaker said 
noting that blackmun soon will be 80 and that the courts two 
leading liberals justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall are in their 80s krattenmaker said we must look for 
signs or signals that one or more of the justices is considering 
retirement 
the courts conservatives are much younger rehnquist is 63 
white 71 scalia 52 oconnor 58 and kennedy 52 
the courts ninth member justice john paul stevens is 68 
here in summary form are some of the cases the supreme court 
is expected to decide this term

should capital punishment be banned for all murderers not yet

cases from georgia and missouri this term

futures market 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for

october heating oil edged down 001 cent to 3950 cents a 
gallon with other contract months declining 
api statistics released after the close of trading tuesday 
showed that although gasoline inventories were up 22 million 
barrels on a weekly basis to 219 million barrels they 10 million 
barrels below the same period a year earlier 
heating oil stocks were up 3 million barrels from a year 
earlier while crude oil was down 4 million barrels to 319 million 
barrels below the 337 million barrels of inventory last year 
according to api 
analysts said the lower crude statistics were considered 
bullish but the decline wasnt enough to offset concerns about the 
oversupply of oil on world markets that has depressed prices 
recently 
wednesdays gains they said stemmed from the combination of 
lower gasoline stocks and api figures showing a drop in refinery

warner communication incs 12 billion 
acquisition of lorimar telepictures corp eventually will be 
completed even though a state court has blocked the planned merger 
analysts predict 
new york supreme court justice walter schackman granted an 
injunction against the deal tuesday ruling it violated a 1984 pact 
between warner and its biggest shareholder chriscraft industries 
inc a broadcasting and manufacturing company 
warner says it will appeal the ruling 
at issue are lorimars televison stations chriscraft claimed 
in a suit filed in july that because lorimar owned six stations 
the merger violated a 4yearold pact prohibiting warner from 
owning any tv station so long as it owned 25 percent or more of 
chriscrafts bhc inc broadcasting subsidiary 
warner acquired a 425 percent stake in bhc in 1984 in exchange 
for chriscraft getting 23 percent of warners voting stock 
in his 13page decision tuesday schackman said warner could not 
acquire any lorimar stock until the tv stations were sold or it 
reduced its stake in bhc 
since the chriscraft suit was filed lorimar completed the sale 
of networkaffiliated television stations in odessa texas 
springfield mo and redding calif to a partnership that 
includes a former lorimar executive it also reached an agreement 
in principle to sell a fourth station in pittsburgh but two 
independent stations in puerto rico remain on the auction block 
some analysts familiar with the case predicted the dispute would 
be settled before the appeal process was concluded because the 
only remaining issue was the sale of the two puerto rico stations 
the stations have been on the market for over a year and a 
half and theyve yet to see a buyer said christopher p dixon 
an analyst with the investment firm kidder peabody amp co i expect 
to find a buyer they lorimar will have to consider bids that 
they were not willing to consider before 
i expect the lorimar deal to close but obviously the time 
frame has become extended 
the warnerlorimar deal was reached last spring warner said it 
would pay 630 million in cash and stock for all the outstanding 
shares of lorimar and assume 550 million in debt giving the deal 
a total value of 118 billion 
lorimar based in culver city calif produces several hit tv 
shows including dallas knots landing and alf it also 
has a strong lineup of syndicated shows sold directly to individual 
television stations 
new yorkbased warners interests include movies cable 
television and magazine publishing

looking for buyers for the puerto rican stations and would not sell

at fire sale prices 
warner contends the proposed merger would not violate the 
agreement with chriscraft because warner planned to set up an 
independent trust pending approval from the federal communications 
commission to run the remaining lorimar tv stations

finance officials from 151 countries wrapping up 
the annual world bankinternational monetary fund meeting today 
heard some grim warnings about the threat of high interest rates on 
the third world which already is reeling under a 12 trillion 
debt 
industrialized nations see higher interest rates as a way to 
curb inflation and in the united states to attract money from 
abroad to finance the federal budget deficit 
but higher rates also mean higher debt payments for third world 
countries 
every rise of one percentage point in interest rates costs the 
debtors another 6 billion a year said stanley fischer vice 
president and chief economist of the world bank 
developing nations already pay more than 50 billion a year on 
loans subject to variable interest rates and complain that too 
large a share of their earnings go to pay interest leaving little 
to improve living standards 
in many of debtors especially in subsaharan africa incomes 
have been declining for 20 years 
it would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for 
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises 
said giuliano amato italys treasury minister 
the world bank is the chief source of aid for third world 
countries lending about 17 billion annually 
the imf which lends about 8 billion a year originally was 
concerned with keeping currency rates stable now both bodies 
devote most of their efforts to helping arrange new loans for third 
world countries in the hope that the money will be more wisely 
invested and help debtors grow out of their troubles 
delegates to the meetings from rich and poor countries have been 
searching for new ways to lighten the debt burden 
attention has concentrated on a proposal from japan outlined 
tuesday by satoshi sumita governor of the bank of japan it would 
turn some of the debt into bonds and sell them to the public 
delaying repayment by many years 
the bonds would be backed by money paid into special accounts 
managed by the imf repayment of the rest of the debt would be 
stretched out 
but many said sumitas speech left many questions about the plan 
unanswered such as the advantages to the debtors or whether the 
plan shift the risk for the original loans from creditor banks to 
the banks governments and their taxpayers 
another issue arising at the meeting was the future of the imfs 
monetary unit the special drawing right or sdr 
the fund first issued sdrs in 1972 with the hope they eventually 
would replace gold the dollar and other currencies as the worlds 
major reserve asset it was thought the international monetary 
system could then be better managed and no longer would depend so 
much on gold mining in south africa and the soviet union and on 
us domestic policy about the dollar 
about 27 billion worth of sdrs have been issued the last batch 
in 1981 and the reagan administration has resisted any further 
issue sdrs now worth about 129 each are traded only among 
governments and some specially authorized banks 
sumita suggested expanding use of the sdr and perhaps extending 
it to private business there should be more reserve currencies 
to complement the dollars key role he said he also said 
japan was removing barriers to the use of the yen as an 
international currency 
nicholas f brady the new us secretary of the treasury did 
not comment publicly any discussion of reducing the international 
role of the dollar could be politically explosive in a us 
election year 
others at the meeting have been skeptical about any bigger role 
for the sdr including west german finance minister gerhard 
stoltenberg and nigel lawson the british chancellor of the 
exchequer 
lawson said nothing had come of the persistent effort to replace 
the dollar with the sdr and he believed it was unlikely anything 
would 
stoltenberg said we shouldnt attach too high expectations to 
this

it may be time for takeover strategist 
carl icahn and others involved in texaco incs landmark bankruptcy 
reorganization to take their marbles and go home according to 
the judge who dismissed icahns challenge to the restructuring 
us district judge gerard goettel ruled wednesday that the 
icahn groups appeal of two key parts of the plan was moot because 
the group did not move fast enough to block confirmation of 
texacos 56 billion reorganization 
icahn who is texacos largest shareholder has sought to gain 
representation on the oil giants board of directors and otherwise 
raise takeover pressure on the company in order to boost its stock 
price 
whatever future designs the icahn group may harbor for texaco 
fallout from the texacogetty merger has been littering the 
economic landscape for the past four years wrote goettel 
the judge advised the parties to take their marbles and go 
home closing out one of the most bizarre chapters of american 
legal and economic history 
neither icahn nor texaco had any immediate comment on the ruling 
texacos 1984 acquisition of getty oil co spawned a lawsuit by 
rival pennzoil co which claimed texaco wrongly interfered with 
its takeover of getty 
in 1985 a texas jury awarded pennzoil 103 billion in damages 
an award upheld throughout the texas state courts 
to avoid having to post a bond equivalent to the award in order 
to appeal the judgment texaco sought protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law in april 1987 
when texaco announced a 3 billion settlement with pennzoil as 
part of the reorganization plan icahn who controls 149 percent 
of texacos outstanding shares announced his opposition to two 
aspects of the plan 
icahn opposed a provision releasing texacos officers from 
pesonal liability resulting from the merger and attendant lawsuit 
icahn also objected to a provision in a financing clause that 
said any change of control in the companys management would 
constitute default on a bank loan 
while objecting to the two provisions icahn nonetheless voted 
for the plan and never sought a stay of the shareholder vote or of 
its implementation 
the plan was approved by texaco shareholders and the comapny 
emerged from chapter 11 in april 
icahn later lost a proxy fight aimed at gaining control of five 
seats on the texaco board 
in addition to the settlement with pennzoil texacos 
reorganization included the sale of 50 percent of its refining and

the first and latest versions of the boeing 747 
will fly sidebyside over seattle on friday to mark the 20th 
birthday of the worlds largest commercial jet 
the boeing 747s each with the trademark hump on top of its 
cockpit and front cabin will fly over elliott bay and mount 
rainier weather permitting to give seattle residents another look 
at the regions most famous product 
of all our planes the 747s the most recognized worldwide 
said david jimenez a boeing spokesman 
since the first flight in 1969 the 12 different versions of 
boeing 747s produced in everett have flown almost 850 million 
passengers and about 12 billion miles worldwide 
boeing has received orders for 875 of the 747s since pan 
american world airways ordered the first 25 in 1966 
industry analysts say the 747 with a price tag of about 125 
million a plane up from about 20 million for the originals 
brings the most cash to boeing 
on the surface the earliest 747 and the brand new 747400 model 
making fridays flyby look much the same but company officials say 
the two planes have more differences than similarities 
the original 747 had a maximum takeoff weight of 710000 pounds 
and could carry 385 passengers about 4000 nautical miles the 
747400 has a maximum takeoff weight of 870000 pounds and can 
carry 412 passengers 7300 nautical miles 
boeing expects the first 747400 to be certified by the federal 
aviation administration by yearend and then sold to northwest 
airlines 
boeing officials say they are confident the 747 will retain a 
strong position worldwide despite competition from mcdonnell 
douglas md11 in 1990 and from airbus industries a340 
theres still a huge potential because of passenger growth and 
for replacing older planes said phil condit executive vice 
president of boeing commercial airplanes 
the 5 percent predicted growth in air traffic is a lot of 
people and as airports get more congested airlines will want the 
large 747s condit said 
the 747400 wont be the end of the line of 747s boeing 
designers are considering shortening the jumbo jet to make it more 
efficient or stretching it to accomodate another 150 passengers 
malcolm stamper the boeing vice chairman who oversaw the 
building of the first 747 said boeings success comes from meeting 
market demand 
for example the boeing 747 design evolved when the company was 
considering enlarging its popular 707 the 747 was conceived in 
1965 because airtraffic growth required a larger allnew plane 
said joe sutter chief designer of the 747 who is now retired but 
works as a consultant for boeing 
at the same time boeing was designing a supersonic transport 
and most industry officials thought the 747 would be used mainly as 
a cargo plane and most passengers would choose the faster sst 
the hump at the front of the 747 originally was intended to 
facilitate loading large cargo containers 
but when government funding for the sst was canceled the 747 
became the dominant longhaul carrier

the world bank will increase its yearly loans 
nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the third world 
the organizations president said today 
barber b conable spoke in west berlin during the annual meeting 
of the bank and its sister organization the international monetary 
fund participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring 
ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations the meeting ends 
today 
leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the 
international banks which make development loans for insisting on 
repayment by third world nations 
about 1000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby wednesday 
and chanted imf murder meeting thousands of riot police held 
them back with plastic shields 
third world countries owe about 12 trillion to international 
and private lenders as well as governments 
conable predicted that the world bank will be lending 25 
billion dollars a year by 1992 to third world nations it now lends 
about 17 billion a year and the monetary fund provides about 8 
million more 
speaking at a news conference he said 5 billion will go to the 
poorest countries which are mainly in africa 
conable said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more 
financing with other donors he said japanese officials have told 
him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program 
contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments 
conable also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt 
problem faced by poor countries he said they cause losses twice as 
great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations 
speakers from the third world have protested repeatedly at the 
meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their 
exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money 
in an interview before his news conference conable said he 
believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases 
the financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that 
higher interest rates used by the united states and other 
industrial countries to cool inflation threaten the third world 
it would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for 
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises 
said giuliano amato italys treasury minister 
at wednesdays sessions participants seeking new ways to ease 
the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to 
third world countries 
every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors 6 
billion more a year said stanley fischer vice president and chief 
economist of the world bank 
the united states and other industrial countries view higher 
interest as a way of controlling price increases in the united 
states higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to 
meet the federal budget deficit 
third world countries pay more than 50 billion a year on loans 
subject to variable interest rates 
they complain that too much of their earnings go to pay 
interest leaving little to improve living standards in many of 
them especially in subsaharan africa peoples incomes have been 
declining for 20 years

an unpopular emergency economic 
program which has triggered a wave of strikes in yugoslavia 
because it allowed price hikes while limiting wages will be 
amended next week newspapers reported thursday 
changes in the program that will include wage increases for 
workers of those companies which are making profits are scheduled 
to be adopted in yugoslavias parliament on oct 3 the borba 
newspaper said 
there have been numerous protest marches in yugoslavia by 
workers publicly airing their grievances after the government 
introduced the austerity program last may allowing substantial 
price hikes and hefty wage cuts 
the program lifted price controls for about 60 percent of goods 
and services which had been under a price freeze since november 
last year 
the unpopular measures contributed to a further decline of 
living standards which have fallen by more than onethird since 
1980 labor unrest also increased 
yugoslav officials have repeatedly claimed that there is no 
alternative to the marketoriented program worked out together 
with the international monetary fund if the country wants to lower 
its 200 percent inflation and repay its 21 billion foreign debt 
borba quoted yugoslav officials as saying that negotiations are 
in progress with the imf in order to get the funds approval for 
changing wage increase restrictions now in the economic program 
the adoption of the program was a precondition set by the imf 
and other creditors for rescheduling of yugoslavias foreign debt 
and obtaining new credits 
during the first nine months of this year salaries in 
yugoslavia have dropped by 10 percent in real terms compared with 
the same period last year and have reached the level of early 
1970s newspapers reported 
meanwhile belgrade shoppers were hit thursday by a fresh wave 
of price hikes ranging from 300 to over 1000 percent the 
politika ekspres daily reported 
of about 600 products including food drinks and cosmetics 
whose prices went up in belgrade shops thursday the highest 
increase was recorded by a brand cheese 1221 percent said the 
newspaper

the european economic community on 
thursday hailed president reagans veto of a bill that would have 
limited textile apparel and shoe imports into the united states 
willy de clercq the eecs external relations commissioner said 
the commission can only be satisfied with the decision by 
president reagan and urged the us congress not to override the 
veto 
this bill is very unsettling for international commerce and 
if it were adopted by congress would provoke grave consequences 
for the trade in textiles he said in a statement 
he said enacting the bill also would endanger the success of 
international trade talks within the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade

about 800 investors angered by plunging 
share prices demonstrated outside the finance ministry thursday to 
demand the government postpone or withdraw its plan to reimpose a 
stock profit tax 
the investors shouting step down finance minister shirley 
kuo were prevented by police from entering the ministry building 
some protesters called for closure of the stock market while the 
government works out a more acceptable tax plan with investors 
earlier thursday stock brokerage firms were flooded with 
selling orders that found few buyers when the market reopened 
after a fourday holiday for the midautumn festival 
the stock index fell 17596 points to close at 861362 points 
on what many traders called black thursday 
of the 151 shares listed on the market 114 posted the maximum 3 
percent daily loss allowed by the government three shares recorded 
gains and there was no transaction on the others 
turnover totaled 280 million taiwan dollars 96 million down 
from saturdays 475 billion taiwan dollars 16 billion 
on saturday the finance ministry said the government next year 
would reimpose a tax on stock profits the plan calls for investors 
who sell stocks worth more than 3 million taiwan dollars 103400 
in one year to include their stock income when filing their annual 
personal income tax 
many protesters said they wanted the government to scrap the 
tax but others demanded lower tax rates or postponing 
implementation of the tax plan by one year 
we were caught up said an investor who identified herself 
only as ms wu the government should not have waited till now to 
announce the severe tax it should have done this half a year ago 
before prices soared up like this 
she said she purchased 10 million taiwan dollars about 
350000 in stocks saturday when the market index hit a record 
high of 878978 points a 275 percent increase from last december 
lee chingtu one of 10 protesters later allowed in the ministry 
to state their cases said the market should be closed temporarily 
to prevent investors from dumping their shares amid 
uncertainties 
the protesters were received by finance ministry official wang 
chengyi who agreed to pass their opinions to the authorities 
market analysts expect stock prices to continue to drop for 
another two weeks before stabilizing the government they said 
imposed the tax to control rampant stock speculation that could 
have resulted in severe losses for investors if the market had 
crashed 
taiwans stock market has been manipulated by major players 
including underground investment firms that attract deposits by 
offering as much as 4 percent monthly interest analysts say a 
market crash could have forced those companies to close and result 
in losses to numerous investors 
john chien president of federated international securities 
consulting company said the tax measure was too drastic and came 
too late 
kuo said tuesday the stock tax would not trigger a market crash 
because taiwan has a robust economy that can sustain a market 
growth 
taiwans economy grew 11 percent last year and is expected to 
grow 73 percent this year 
the stock income tax was lifted in 1976 when taiwans economy 
slowed because of the world oil crisis 
the finance ministry said investors who hold their purchased 
shares for a year or more would have half of their shares waived 
from taxes to encourage longterm investments 
workers who earn more than 35 million taiwan dollars 
121000 a year pay the top personal income tax of 50 percent

apparel industry leaders were undaunted after 
president reagans veto of the textile imports bill predicting 
electionyear politics would help supporters of the measure swing 
enough votes for a congressional override 
politically these are very hot times predicted howard 
cooley president of jockey international and president of the 
american apparel manufacturers association which is holding its 
annual meeting during a trade show in atlanta this week 
there will be an override effort he said we suspect that 
there will be some votes changing he said 
the bill would limit import growth for apparel and textile 
products to 1 percent a year beginning in january freeze imports 
of nonrubber footwear and impose quotas on 180 categories of 
textile products and 30 types of footwear 
the bill passed the senate 5936 four votes short of the needed 
twothirds to override the house approved the bill 248150 17 
votes shy 
the battle to override will be close but its winnable 
said rep ed jenkins dga a supporter of the bill which 
president reagan vetoed wednesday 
the main purpose of the legislation jenkins said is to apply 
pressure on reagan to enforce existing textile import restrictions 
even if we do not override we try to keep the pressure on the 
president to make sure he enforces the existing agreements 
jenkins said 
american textile manufacturers institute president daniel k 
frierson chairman of dixie yarns inc said the veto shows a 
callous disregard for millions of workers who jobs are being wiped 
out by imports 
we believe that the celebration by foreign interests and 
giant moneygrubbing importers will be brief because congress will 
override the veto frierson said in a statement released in 
washington 
cooley said the import bill would have brought order to national 
trade policy which he said penalizes apparel and textile 
manufacturers 
we are the most laborintensive industry and therefore are 
much more subject to competition from the lesser developed 
countries cooley told reporters during a news conference 
also predicting an override was joseph m edalin vice chairman 
of underwear manufacturer fruit of the loom inc 
the bill was supported by both management and labor with 
conservative southern lawmakers who represent textileproducing 
areas working with such labor unions as the international ladies 
garment workers union and the amalgamated clothing and textile 
workers union 
im very disappointed but not totally surprised at reagans 
decision said james k tribble a regional actwu director from 
chicago who was in atlanta for the show 
he predicted an override effort stood a fairtomiddlin 
chance of success 
tribble also blamed imports for contributing to recent shakeups 
in the industry which have seen some of the largest manufacturers 
broken up or taken over in leveraged buyouts 
not all apparel executives support the bill 
one opposed was erle norton vice president of atlantabased 
oxford industries inc one of the nations 10 largest apparel 
manufacturers 
he said the measure would hurt companies such as his which use 
some imported fabrics or are involved in operations whereby cut 
material is sent overseas for sewing and then brought back into 
the united states at reduced tariffs 
sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease said david 
slossberg vice president and general manager of caleb v smith amp 
son inc a galion ohio uniform manufacturer 
if we get into a protectionist profile somewhere else down 
the line somebodys going to get hurt slossberg said

to the delight of two minnesota 
companies exercise enthusiasts around the country are rollicking 
on a new set of wheels that look like ice skates and ride like 
roller skates 
were going after people who want to have some serious fun and 
want to make the investment in the product said john sundet 
president of eden prairiebased rollerblade inc 
sundet would not disclose financial information about the 
privately held company but said rollerblade has 75 percent of the 
10 million to 12 million market for the skates rollerblades top 
competitor is blaine minnbased first team sports which sells 
its version of the inline skate under the brand name of 
ultrawheels 
its a healthy competition said john egart vice president 
of marketing for first team sports he said first team has about 20 
percent to 25 percent of what he estimates is an 8 million to 10 
million market 
its very similar to roller skating but it has the feel of 
ice skates said skater gary baglien who stopped for a breather 
during a recent spin around minneapolis lake calhoun theres 
definitely more speed than the conventional skates 
baglien who skates every other day to stay in shape said using 
the inline skate is a little more tricky than the conventional 
skate particularly when it comes to stopping 
the inline skate looks like a hockey skate mounted on a 
line of three or four wheels a rubber brake pad is located on the 
back of the right skate as opposed to the front bumpers on many 
roller skates 
its popularity began among hockey players and crosscountry 
skiers looking for a way to stay in shape during the offseason 
but has recently spread to others looking for an alternative 
outdoor exercise 
the companys biggest markets used to be in iceskating 
strongholds such as boston and minneapolis but now the hottest 
sales are in southern california where theyre popular in places 
such as venice beach new yorks central park is another popular 
spot for singletrack skaters 
its not a toy not a frivolous type item its to an extent a 
recreational product said sundet fitness is the key 
particularly with all the concern about health lately 
a rollerblade study claims to show that users of the skates 
improved aerobic endurance and reduced body fat sundet said 
skating with inline skates is a great alternative to jogging 
because there is less pounding on the joints 
the skates which sell for between 8995 and 175 are 
assembled at the companys eden prairie headquarters then shipped 
across the country and overseas most of the parts are made 
overseas 
weve barely tapped the market nationally it has an enormous 
potential to become a nationally recognized product said sundet 
who expects strong christmas sales 
egart said first team sports is not particulalry troubled that 
rollerblade has become synonymous with inline skates were 
doing our best to make people aware that there are other 
manufacturers out there other than rollerblade he said 
two years ago rollerblade had two models of inline skates 
this fall they have nine the original model was black similar to 
hockey skates but rollerblade is now using brightlycolored boots 
and wheels 
rollerblade is taking measures to ensure the skates will not 
become just another fad the company is supporting an inline skate 
federation creating competitive events and is considering 
expanding into a line of accessories and clothing 
im very optimistic that this is not a fad said sundet who 
at age 40 is the companys oldest employee we really do think 
there is a longterm market for this product 
the companys sales in july were four times what they were last 
year and sundet said they plan to stay on top of the market the 
companys marketing strategy includes skating demonstrations from 
seven vans that travel around the country 
rollerblade received a publicity boost last winter when chicago 
bears coach mike ditka called the metrodome the rollerdome 
minnesota vikings general manager mike lynn countered by sending 
ditka a pair of rollerblades and lynn also outfitted the vikings 
cheerleaders with them to wear during the dec 6 vikingsbears 
matchup 
the company got its start nine years ago when scott and brennan 
olson both high school hockey players were looking for a way to 
condition in the summertime 
the brothers purchased a pair of what brennan described as 
crude slow inline skates on sale for 15 at a sporting goods 
store and set out to create a better skate 
six months later they were selling them out of their parents 
basement in bloomington minn scott olson later sold the company 
while brennan stayed on and is now rollerblades director of 
research and development 
we are constantly improving the product and coming up new ones 
that are more appealing to a wider variety brennan scott said 
while the inline skate seems like the latest innovation in the 
skating world the concept dates back to the early 1700s when a 
dutchman nailed wooden spools to strips of wood and attached them 
to his shoes

requirements for speculative trading in futures and expedited

a handful of large investors used to dump massive amounts of 
stocks contributed to the speed and intensity of the collapse

this panel headed by the undersecretary for finance george d 
gould evaluated the conclusions of the brady group which werent 
well received in the administration partly because they advocated 
more regulation the gould panel composed of senior aides in the 
federal reserve treasury department securities and exchange 
commission and commodities futures trading commission rejected the 
idea of a single regulatory authority 
it further rejected suggestions that the sec should regulate 
stockindex futures trading which is regulated by the cftc 
although the panel endorsed raising margin requirements in futures 
</TEXT>

the investigative arm of congress concluded that computerized 
trading and the regulation of transactions should be overhauled to 
avoid another crash 
since the nations financial markets are increasingly 
intertwined federal agencies and market officials must monitor the 
entire system not just individual stock exchanges and trading 
officials must find ways to prevent plummeting prices in one 
exchange from spilling into others the gao said the gao agreed 
with the brady panel that government should more effectively 
supervise the markets but it didnt endorse the idea of 
designating the federal reserve for that job it took no position 
on circuit breakers 
the gao is conducting a separate study still in the early 
stages that will examine the evolution of clearance and settlement 
procedures for securities and questions surrounding investor 
protection

the federal agency that oversees chicago commodities markets 
where stockindex futures and options are traded said it could 
find no evidence that computerized trading strategies caused or 
aggravated the market break 
the commission blamed what it called unprecedented change in 
investor psychology and suggested the crash was the culmination of 
a drop in stock prices that had begun months earlier

the federal agency that oversees stock and bond markets said 
computerized trading techniques did not cause the market plunge by 
themselves but had an indirect negative effect the sec said 
changes in investor perception institutional stock selling and 
program trading strategies combined to accelerate the markets 
downward slide 
the agency opposed limits on price movements and did not call 
for a new regulatory authority to oversee all financial markets as 
the brady panel did but the sec suggested increased curbs on 
stockindex futures

the nations biggest stock market largely blamed the crash on 
the chicago futures markets calling them a haven for speculators 
the report recommended tighter restrictions on futures markets 
including higher margin requirements 
the nyse further recommended that the sec regulate all financial 
instruments including stockindex futures

markets in individual stocks failed to keep the market orderly

the nations largest futures market blamed the crash on waves of

similar conclusions

the group that monitors the nationwide computerized network of 
overthecounter trading did not study the causes of the crash but 
said it clearly revealed vulnerabilities and deficiencies in all 
markets 
the nasd undertook an extensive review of trading procedures and 
tightened the rules for market makers in overthecounter issues 
it endorsed stricter rules for selling borrowed stocks known as 
short sales though the nasd said there was no evidence 
shortselling was a problem during the crash 
the nasd rejected the brady panels proposal for marketwide 
circuit breakers but it endorsed the idea of a congressionally

in the year since black monday government and 
securities industry groups have undertaken at least a dozen major 
studies into causes of the crash and possible safeguards to prevent 
another disaster 
but the proposed remedies are largely technical some are 
contradictory few have been implemented none has been written 
into law and chances seem increasingly remote that any will be in 
the foreseeable future 
moreover critics contend most studies have failed to confront 
important underlying problems and weaknesses in the nations 
securities markets such as why stocks shot up so far in the first 
place before crashing 
these critics say the recommendations made to date appear 
designed mainly to protect powerful interests that control the 
industry such as the specialists who make markets for stocks on 
the new york stock exchange and the floor traders on the chicago 
futures and options exchanges 
some say key issues such as speculative abuses the function of 
market makers and wall streets changing role in the economy 
remain unresolved or ignored 
the financial events of october 1987 will probably be 
remembered by our descendants as vividly as we remember the events 
of october 1929 junius w peake a capitalmarkets consultant 
and expert who has studied the crash wrote in a recent edition of 
investment management review 
what will ultimately matter most however is whether the 
forensic economists and writers who issue the final autopsy report 
will make a correct diagnosis of the near cause of death of the 
us equity market 
so far the black monday inquests have caused little more than 
disputes and bickering even the reagan administration couldnt 
agree on the conclusions of its own crash study headed by 
nowtreasury secretary nicholas brady and convened a second panel 
that largely refuted the brady groups recommendations the 
securities and exchange commission and commodities futures trading 
commission which regulate market practices couldnt agree on who 
should supervise stockindex futures an exotic product that some 
studies linked to the wild price swings during the crash 
the federal reserve which bradys group had suggested as the 
superregulator of all markets appears highly unwilling to assume 
that role 
the new york stock exchange a powerful bastion of market 
makers concluded that speculative selling in the chicago futures 
pits played a crucial role in the rout 
no the chicago exchanges retorted it was panic selling in new 
york that started the crash plus the failure or unwillingness of 
the nyse specialists to handle the flood of sell orders 
meanwhile an emotional debate has raged about the role of 
computerized program trading strategies that exploit price 
differences between stocks and stockindex futures sometimes 
causing sudden price jolts 
critics say these techniques intensified the crash and have 
continued to unnerve investors defenders say they are just a 
scapegoat and actually help stabilize the markets by keeping stocks 
and futures prices from diverging 
despite the quarreling and delays in postcrash reforms some 
significant progress has been made as a result of the studies 
leading figures in the securities industry contend 
all the studies have at least led to a de facto improvement 
some coordination among markets said william schreyer chairman 
of merrill lynch amp co the fact theyre all talking to each 
other working together has been an encouraging step 
for example in july the nyse and chicago mercantile exchange 
proposed a plan for jointly managed circuit breakers trading 
halts and price limits to discourage volatility and panic selling 
the nyse also proposed altering its computer system to allow small 
investors speedier access to the market 
since february the nyse has enforced a socalled collar 
that limits computerized trading when the dow jones industrial 
average swings 50 points from the previous sessions close 
the circuit breakers now being reviewed by federal regulators 
are expected to supercede the collar after it expires on oct 19 
the crash anniversary 
in the overthecounter market the national association of 
securities dealers has tightened rules on its market makers who 
buy and sell stocks via a nationwide computerized network in 
addition the nasd has said it will enable investors to find out if 
their brokers have ever been in trouble 
basically it seems to me that the studies were the 
appropriate response as opposed to rushing in with a lot of 
illadvised regulation said john damgard president of the 
futures industry association in washington 
i think this administration has done the proper thing 
damgard said they are not anxious to change any of the basic 
authorities that doesnt mean they dont see the need for 
improvement 
nevertheless others say longterm risks to the markets would 
persist even with the solutions advanced so far opponents of 
trading halts and price limits for example contend these are 
cosmetic measures that could hasten a market panic 
i think these collars and caps and circuit breakers and all 
that are just devices which reduce the liquidity of the market 
said morris mendelson a finance professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school im afraid that in a pinch they 
wouldnt work 
nevertheless he said the studies have at least helped heighten 
concern about the stock crash and whether it could happen again 
discussion is always useful the more discussion the better 
he said one of the things i worry about is when we stop talking 
about it

the story of last octobers stock market crash 
featured one notorious villain program trading 
singled out by some studies as an important ingredient in the 
collapse and its volatile aftermath the hightech strategy became 
a hate object for smalltime investors and a target of lawmakers 
and market officials 
the flood of criticism and scrutiny pushed the technique into 
the background but program trading lives on here and is beginning 
to spread overseas 
certainly if youre looking postcrash program trading hasnt 
played much of a role in market activity said jack barbanel a 
futures expert at the new york investment firm gruntal amp co but 
thats not to say that if wall street resumes momentum to the 
upside the major players would not come back in its most common 
form program trading is a computerized version of arbitrage the 
centuriesold practice of buying something in one market while 
simultaneously selling its equivalent in another market for a 
higher price pocketing the difference 
program traders use computers to buy stockindex futures in 
chicago and sell groups of the underlying stocks in new york or 
vice versa to profit from price gaps in the two markets 
critics say program trading strategies can dump tens of millions 
of shares of stock on exchange floors without warning jerking 
prices around and sending ordinary investors fleeing for safety 
supporters of program trading say its effect on the markets is 
negligible if anything they say program trading helps stabilize 
the stock and futures markets by keeping the price spread between 
them from widening 
as a defense they point to the nyses own statistics which 
show program trading accounted for only 81 percent of average 
daily volume in august and 101 percent the month earlier 
in months prior to the crash when prices were rising to record 
highs program trading volume on the nyse was the same percentage 
or less some studies have showed 
as far as the hysteria its totally unjustified said 
sanford grossman an economics professor at princeton university 
who has studied program trading the impact of program trading is 
infinitesimal 
the technique has its share of enemies nevertheless in 
washington program trading has received extraordinary review and 
some legislators have been devising ways of strictly regulating the 
strategy because they believe it is destroying the markets health 
the new york stock exchange also worried about the impact of 
such trading has taken several steps to limit the technique and 
now requires member firms to report all program trades both for 
themselves and their clients 
in chicago meanwhile down payments have been raised for 
stockindex futures a crucial component of program trading 
thereby making it more expensive and less profitable 
perhaps more important investment firms that once committed 
large amounts of money to program trading have been forced to 
divert capital to other areas partly because the crash erased much 
of their profits 
in addition most big firms have stated as a public relations 
gesture that they have curtailed program trading for their own 
accounts though theyll still do it for customers 
the net result investment strategists say has been a 
significant decline in the amount of program trading although its 
influence occasionally is felt 
many contend the postcrash restrictions on program trading and 
misguided public hostility against it inevitably will drive 
important sources of wall street business overseas some say this 
already has started 
the london market for example is now serving as a conduit for 
some usbased program trading 
in japan which only recently began trading in stockindex 
futures some us investment strategists say privately that they 
are looking at ways to use program trading there 
asked at a recent nyse briefing about postcrash reform whether 
the nations biggest securities market is worried about this 
potential exodus executive vice president donald solodar was vague 
we recognize the possibility exists but dont see clear 
evidence its happening he said nevertheless he added its 
a threat we have to watch out for

here are key elements of a postcrash reform proposal by the new 
york stock exchange and chicago mercantile exchange aimed at what 
both markets called enhancing investor confidence in the 
marketplace 
the joint plan was announced july 7 and submitted to the 
securities and exchange commission and commodities futures trading 
commission for review the nyse has said it hopes for approval by 
the anniversary of the oct 19 crash 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
under a oneyear pilot program temporary trading halts would be 
triggered by predesignated price movements trading on the nyse 
would stop for an hour if the dow jones industrial average fell 250 
points and for two hours if the average fell an additional 150 
points the same day at the cme trading would stop for an hour if 
the standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures contract fell 30 
points and for two hours if the sampp contract fell another 20 points 
the same day both markets would coordinate the exact timing of the 
halts 
in addition if the sampp contract fell 12 points equivalent to a 
approximately a 100point fall in the dow average the futures 
contract could not fall further for 30 minutes 
at the nyse meanwhile computerized program trading orders 
would be diverted into a separate area to determine order 
imbalances before they could be eligible for execution 
the oneyear experiment would supercede an nyse restraint on 
program trading triggered by a 50point move in the dow average 
the socalled collar has been in effect since february 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
both markets agreed to develop a common policy on socalled 
frontrunning an abuse akin to insider trading in which 
professionals take profitable positions in one market based on 
prior knowledge of an order executed in another market 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the nyse will institute what it called an individual investor 
express delivery service that will provide transmission priority 
to individual investor orders when the dow average is up or down 25 
points from the previous sessions close to qualify the orders 
must be 2000 shares or less 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in addition to the joint proposal the nyse began in july to 
disseminate a monthly breakdown of program trading statistics 
submitted by member firms john phelan nyse chairman and chief 
executive officer said disclosing this data would bring 
discipline to the market and further reinforce our commitment to 
less volatile markets

the stock market crash moved across time zones 
like a stadium wave last october but the recovery has proceeded 
unevenly around the world 
people are still quite nervous about stock markets said 
george murnaghan vice president at rowe pricefleming 
international in baltimore 
nervous enough to slow trading in most countries but not enough 
to impede strong advances in some markets particularly in asia 
george mulvey vice president for international research at 
shearson lehman hutton inc said volume has picked up recently on 
many major exchanges and he views that as a sign that investors 
are coming back to the market 
the worlds 20 major stock markets were up about 95 percent in 
late september compared with the end of october 1987 according to 
an index developed by a research unit of morgan stanley amp co 
the markets in japan france spain singaporemalaysia and 
australia have posted doubledigit gains in local currencies since 
october according to morgan stanley capital international while 
the us market was up 57 percent 
the west german and british markets grew more slowly than the 
us market did according to the index while markets in italy 
norway and switzerland posted small singledigit declines 
the japanese stock market the worlds largest is up about 14 
percent since the end of october and several analysts said it was 
the only major market to exceed its precrash highs 
the nikkei stock average a measure roughly comparable to the 
dow jones industrial average surpassed its precrash high of 
2664663 in april and has since risen an additional 3 percent 
japanese stocks have benefited from strong economic growth 
trends particularly in manufacturing shearsons mulvey said a 
surge in corporate profits and consumer spending has also 
contributed to the rise 
but some analysts believe the market in japan is ripe for a 
fall the market is so extended at some point it has to be more 
reasonably valued said murnaghan of rowe price 
mark sladkus a vice president at morgan stanley said japanese 
stock prices are trading at about 50 times expected earnings over 
three times more than in the united states at the end of august he 
said the japanese stock market has traditionally traded at big 
multiples of earnings but some analysts are wary about chances 
that further price gains can be sustained 
the markets in singapore and malaysia up more than 29 percent 
have been spurred by strong regional growth trends shearsons 
mulvey said 
even the hong kong market which closed for four days after the 
crash is up 14 percent 
rowe prices murnaghan said the australian market up nearly 25 
percent has benefited from the rise in commodity prices the 
market has a heavy concentration of commoditybased businesses 
but not all of the highperforming foreign markets are in the 
pacific 
the french market is up 198 percent and the market in spain is 
up 245 percent from october according to the morgan stanley index 
murnaghan said takeover activity and strong economic 
fundamentals have helped the french market while spain has drawn 
strength from improving economic growth and progress toward 
reducing inflation 
both markets have been helped by speculation about the impact of 
the planned 1992 dismantling of many trade barriers within europe 
he said 
nonetheless the british and west german stock markets turned in 
belowaverage performances since the crash according to the morgan 
stanley index 
murnaghan said the united kingdoms market up only 283 percent 
since last october has suffered from perceptions that the economy 
was growing too fast a worsening trade outlook lower oil prices 
and higher interest rates 
west germanys market was up 5 percent but has suffered because 
of slow growth the high value of the west german mark and the 
central banks vigilance against inflation murnaghan said 
the italian market is off 175 percent since late october 
mulvey said ongoing bank reforms there have hurt stock prices 
one money manager jeanmarie eveillard who manages the sogen 
international fund in new york said institutional investors are 
showing a greater willingness to invest internationally 
as time goes by and the equity market gets better 
psychologically they are saying after all that maybe the crash was 
an aberration not a warning im not in that camp but that is 
what some think 
eveillard has about 15 million of the funds 108 million 
invested in foreign stocks about the same ratio as in january

the tokyo stock market has outperformed most major 
world markets since last octobers crash but opinion is divided 
over whether thats a sign of strength or reason to worry 
there are so many uncertainties underlying in todays tokyo 
market said jeff bahrenburg an analyst at merrill lynchs tokyo 
unit though it appears to be a bull market at a glance we have 
to be very cautious because any of those uncertainties could bring 
down the market any time 
it only took a few months for shares on the tokyo stock exchange 
to regain what they lost in the crash last april the nikkei stock 
average a measure roughly comparable to the dow jones industrial 
average broke its precrash high of 2664663 and now stands some 
4 percent above that level while other major markets are still 
struggling to recover their losses 
the black monday was only a nightmare in tokyo and it was 
much more than a nightmare in new york and london said tetsuhiro 
miyake head of the research section of nomura securities co 
analysts who have confidence in the tokyo market say the 
prosperity should continue with a total value of more than 3 
trillion the japanese market is the worlds largest accounting 
for over 40 percent of the value of all shares traded in the world 
today 
given the current economic growth rate of about 5 percent and 
surging corporate earnings the current share price level on the 
tokyo stock exchange is sustainable at least until the end of the 
year or possibly longer said thomas zengage an analyst at 
international business information an investment and consulting 
firm in tokyo 
analysts like zengage say tokyo share prices are not as high as 
they appear if you take into account differences in accounting and 
cultural backgrounds between japan and new york or london 
cautious analysts insist tokyos tripledigit pricetoearning 
multiples indicate shares are at least four times overpriced 
compared to new york or london but defenders argue the ratios 
doesnt reflect japanese reality 
japanese corporations tend to understate their profits by 25 to 
30 percent said ibis zengage and other analysts 
it is partially because of the steep corporate tax in japan 
zengage said but it is also a tradition here to understate their 
earnings it is simply one of those things japanese have been doing 
for years and taken for granted 
the corporate tax rate goes as high as 52 percent 
also business relations in japan are considered more valuable 
than shortterm profits corporations commonly hold each others 
stocks not as an investment but as a testimony of their commitment 
to each other 
as a result of such crossholdings the actual number of shares 
in the market is low compared with the number issued analysts and 
securities company officials say as much as 70 to 80 percent of all 
shares issued on the tokyo stock exchange are locked in corporate 
safes for years 
this will automatically inflate share prices because it makes 
the supply and demand relation heavily in favor of demand 
zengage said 
the skyrocketing value of land another peculiarity of japan 
also strengthens share prices of companies that have substantial 
land holdings in tokyos main commercial district one acre of 
land can cost as much as 16 billion according to land agency 
statistics 
look closely at bullish shares said miyake you will find 
most of them are attributable to the value of the land they own 
other analysts counter that land prices have started to decline 
this year and warn that this will not only reduce the value of 
shares but also shrink the amount investors can borrow to buy 
equities 
its a really delicate balance now said ronald talmage 
real estate specialist at nm rothschild and sons ltd the 
britishbased investment bank i really think its this big 
bubble that could burst at any time with any imbalance from one of 
many sectors 
many foreign investors and fund managers complain of the lack of 
transparency in the tokyo market keisuke matsuura a veteran 
investment consultant said many stock prices are artificially set 
by four major securities companies nomura daiwa nikko and 
yamaichi securities who have practical control over 90 percent of 
shares on the exchange 
in the western standard what they do here is a pure 
manipulation of share prices but in the japanese rule book they 
are just traditional practices no one wonders about said 
matsuura 
such traditions may be reaching a turning point as a series of 
stockrelated scandals has caused the finance ministry to tighten 
the securities and exchange law on insider trading 
the increased presence of foreigners in the market also is 
affecting investment patterns of the japanese who used to regard 
foreign firms market analyses as impenetrable as technical 
computer manuals but now such analyses draw more attention from 
the newly emerging performanceoriented private japanese investor 
said david gerstenhaber a senior analyst at morgan stanley amp co 
in tokyo 
japanese are beginning to rely less on brokers 
recommendations and make their own decisions this may have a 
significant impact on the japanese investment patterns in the long 
run gerstenhaber said 
despite concerns about overpriced shares and uncertainties 
created by transitions under way many japanese contend the tokyo 
market can still provide a great investment opportunity 
there is no doubt that shares on the tokyo stock exchange are 
overpriced but so what said nomuras miyake they have always 
been high for years and they still have a potential for growth 
more than new york or london this is the fact of life

the great crash of 1987 cast a giant shadow over 
britains big bang 
the collapse hit the british markets amid a wave of deregulation 
nicknamed the big bang that promised to generate an 
americanstyle boom in the securities business here 
but after the crash trading on the london stock exchange 
dissolved to a trickle and the atmosphere in the city londons 
financial district turned from daring to cautious 
the crash also triggered unexpected problems for britains 
economy and it could hamper conservative prime minister margaret 
thatchers huge privatization program 
people have been and still are looking over their shoulders at 
the dramatic impact it had and are still a little bit nervous that 
there could be a sort of minirepeat of it said geoffrey 
lederman head of equities market making at the london investment 
firm smith new court ltd 
surprisingly the governments opponents havent been clamoring 
for increased regulation to prevent another crash and the 
securities industrys system of selfregulation remains intact 
during the past 12 months the market has wandered aimlessly 
with a tendency to react fitfully to the release of economic 
reports takeover speculation and signals from wall street 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index stands about 
22 percent lower than its precrash level of 23019 
an average of 489 million domestic shares were traded daily in 
august down 41 percent from 825 million daily in august 1987 
investment firms have lost millions of dollars because of 
reduced commissions laid off an estimated 2250 employees and cut 
salaries and perks there are some 28000 securities industry 
employees among the 273000 workers in the city 
it has been an especially rude awakening for firms that prepared 
for big bang by diversifying and increasing staff at huge salaries 
it was a sort of a catch22 situation before big bang one had 
to get into the act and become a serious player lederman said 
now there are far too many players there will have to be some 
further reduction 
in the months before the crash the fierce competition already 
was forcing a shakeout 
americans more used to such competition had been expected to 
do particularly well in postbig bang london us banks such as 
citibank were eager to take advantage of a freedom not yet won in 
their own country to engage in the securities business 
but the us companies found it like learning to sail in a 
hurricane one unidentified bank official said in a us 
government report on the subject 
the impact of the crash on the british economy has confounded 
experts who predicted a slowdown in consumer spending which would 
hobble economic growth 
the british government like others which feared a recession 
cut interest rates and that increased spending economic growth 
expanded to 4 percent annual inflation rose to 57 percent by 
august and the countrys trade deficit skyrocketed 
the effect of that was to stimulate the uk economy when it 
was growing already said david owen an economist with the 
london investment firm kleinwort grieveson ltd 
the government has reacted to this overheating by pushing up 
base interest rates 45 percentage points since june to 12 percent 
and that worries investors and homeowners alike 
the treasury insists the privatization program remains on 
schedule and says the next sale of british steel corp will take 
place at yearend but many analysts believe britons will now be 
less keen to buy 
the government has sold off billions of dollars worth of 
stateowned companies and the public has bought the shares eagerly 
over the years 
but the last sale of the governments onethird stake in 
british petroleum co plc coincided with the crash and flopped 
leaving most of 12 billion worth of stock in the underwriters 
hands 
looking ahead the experts are divided about the overall 
markets direction 
kevin gardiner a british economist at the london investment 
firm warburg securities predicted a significant rally within four 
months based on strong corporate profits 
but lederman said the market will jog gently downwards for the 
next year or so if the economic news does get worse then again 
people will just not invest

the fingerpointing began on the morning after 
with a wall street journal article that traced the stock markets 
collapse to the standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures pit at 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
the panic began here was the lead on the oct 20 1987 
story which was headlined chicagos shadow markets led free 
fall in a plunge that began right at opening 
the journal didnt blame the index futures market for the 
shocking 508point drop in the dow jones industrial average but 
many others did contending that the relatively low cost of futures 
compared with the potential gains invited reckless speculation 
sophisticated program trading techniques that use computers 
to trade huge amounts of stocks stockindex futures and 
stockindex options were scrutinized and criticized 
former treasury secretary donald regan even urged congress in 
may to force a halt to all trading of stockindex futures 
a year after the crash index futures and their even more 
esoteric cousins index options still are traded and new versions 
are planned but trading volume is off sharply from the precrash 
days and no one is predicting a return soon to volume levels 
approaching those of the first three quarters of 1987 
an index future is a contract to buy or sell at a specified 
time and price a basket of stocks represented by a recognized 
index an index option is a right not a contractual obligation 
to buy or sell the stocks 
stockmarket investors use futures and options to hedge against 
adverse moves in the stock market speculators play the stock 
futures and options markets in hopes of profiting from the 
constantly changing prices of all three 
the chicago mercantile exchanges sampp 500 contract is the 
worlds leading index future the chicago board options exchanges 
sampp 100 index option contract is the most popular product of its 
type 
the merc met some of the criticism of index futures by imposing 
limits on the daily movement of prices and increasing the 
speculative margin the amount of money speculators must put down 
as a performance bond from about 6 percent to 15 percent of the 
contracts face value 
officials say those changes plus the new york stock exchanges 
collar on program trading have cut both volume and volatility 
in the indexfutures market the collar is scheduled to expire on 
oct 19 and be replaced by a series of circuit breakers 
coordinated trading halts between the nyse and the merc 
leo melamed chairman of the mercs executive committee said 
the spotlight that shone on chicagos markets after the crash 
illuminated their importance to modern financial management 
it started with a lot of fingerpointing and kneejerk 
reactions based on a great deal of misconception and 
misunderstanding melamed said 
the futuresoptions industry responded with a major 
educational offensive he said in which we were able to 
present not just our case but a whole learning process to people 
in finance and within government who otherwise would never have had 
the need time or inclination to go through that learning curve 
alger b duke chapman chairman of the chicago board options 
exchange said it was inevitable even before the crash that 
index options would receive closer attention 
a lot of people were saying all along that these stocks 
futures and options are one market with different pieces i have 
no problem with that focus he said 
average daily trading volume in the mercs sampp 500 stockindex 
future was down about 41 percent during the first eight months of 
this year compared with the same period in 1987 
on average about 47000 sampp 500 contracts changed hands each 
trading day from january through august of this year compared with 
80000 per day during the first eight months of 1987 
but melamed said overall volume at the merc was down only 7 
percent with most of the slack in the indexfutures pit offset by 
increased trading volume in eurodollar and foreign currency futures 
the cboe which has a less diverse mix of products than the 
merc has suffered much more overall trading volume was down 44 
percent in the first eight months of this year with trading in sampp 
100 index options off about 48 percent 
despite a 10 percent staff reduction chapman said the cboe had 
net income of less than 500000 for the fiscal year ended june 30 
compared with a profit of 96 million in fiscal 1987 
in addition to those problems the cboe also faces a 
classaction lawsuit claiming the exchange and some of its traders 
are liable for 40 million in losses sustained by investors on oct 
20 1987 as financial markets reeled in the wake of the crash the 
cboe says the lawsuit should be dismissed 
chapman said trading volume was slowly rebuilding as part of 
the normal healing process that comes after a major market 
correction 
but melamed said the limits and linkages that have been placed 
on stocks and stockindex futures since the collapse cannot ensure 
that investors will return to the financial markets 
investor confidence is not going to come back because we agree 
to better coordination of market mechanisms and we have investor 
confidence is not going to come back because theres less 
volatility in the market and there is he said 
it is the macroeconomic geopolitical issues foreign 
exchange rates interest rates inflation trade deficits that 
bring confidence to the financial community melamed said

mexico and taiwan were awaiting word today on their bids for us 
soybeans 
wheat futures prices retreated on news that the usda had 
rejected egypts bid for 40000 metric tons of subsidized us 
wheat under the export enhancement program 
rejections of eep wheat tenders have grown more frequent and 
rightly so said grain specialist ted mao of shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
why keep promoting exports of a commodity that if we have dry 
weather again next year we could have a shortage of he said 
in early trading wheat was cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with december at 286 a bushel oats

a federal judge overseeing the securities and 
exchange commissions civil fraud case against drexel burnham 
lambert inc temporarily has blocked defense requests to interview 
potential witnesses the sec may use 
us district judge milton pollacks order issued wednesday 
was not unexpected because sec lawyers in other civil suits against 
drexel and defense attorneys have so far failed to agree on a 
common structure for the preliminary factfinding process known as 
discovery that takes place before trial 
the order means that at least for the immediate future 
attorneys for the wall street firm and other defendants in the sec 
case notably drexels highyield bond financier michael milken 
cannot compel pretrial testimony from any prospective government 
witnesses 
the most important of these witnesses is ivan f boesky the 
imprisoned former takeover speculator who has provided much of the 
information the sec used to accuse drexel and milken on sept 7 of 
widespread securities fraud the defendants have denied the charges 
and vowed to fight them in court 
pollack gave no indication when he would end the restriction 
but his order still allows defense attorneys to start reviewing 
sensitive documents that the sec also used to draft its charges 
he also ordered a conference of attorneys nov 10 to set a date 
for the start of pretrial witness interviews known as depositions 
defense lawyers have expressed unhappiness that pollack has 
charge of the sec case because they believe he is biased in the 
governments favor their pretrial maneuvering has included 
requests that pollack disqualify himself 
the 81yearold judge so far has given no indication he will 
surrender the case although a defenserequested hearing on the 
matter is set for oct 11 
after a nearly twoyear investigation the sec alleged that 
drexel milken and others secretly schemed with boesky to trade on 
inside information manipulate stock cheat drexel clients and 
commit other frauds 
the manhattan us attorneys office also has been conducting an 
inquiry into drexels activities and there has been increasing 
speculation criminal charges will be filed within the next few 
months

asher b edelman is about to become an american 
raider in paris 
with profitable runs on major companies like lucky stores and 
fruehauf corp under his belt edelman said in a rare interview 
this week that he plans to transplant part of his investment 
business overseas where the takeover environment is less hostile 
to the hostile 
despairing over the high prices of us companies and the legal 
roadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raiders hand 
edelman said hes looking to become very very active in europe 
for at least six months a year the 48yearold edelman plans to 
make camp in his computerequipped paris apartment and work through 
a holding company the edelman companies a menagerie of trading 
operations and limited partnerships will continue to operate in 
new york 
perhaps to prepare the takeover canvas he intends to paint 
edelman recently bought a 5 percent stake in the british 
conglomerate lonrho plc the foreign press relatively unacquainted 
with brash americanstyle dealmakers has been humming over just 
what hes up to and why he would want the company whose most 
valuable assets include the metropole and princess hotel chains in 
britain acapulco bermuda and the bahamas as well as african gold 
fields 
the eccentric art collector whos admittedly more comfortable in 
the company of ballerinas than bankers is rumored to be courting 
other large lonrho shareholders edelman had no comment but notes 
theres been no bid 
edelmans personal wealth is estimated at about 100 million 
and he is believed to have amassed a warchest for takeovers five 
times that amount hence lonrho chief executive tiny rowland said 
we are taking him very seriously 
lonrho aside edelman has warm words for the continent first 
off the common market lacks the tremendous deficits that the 
united states shoulders and europe already has emerged 
successfully from what edelman calls a social revolution that 
is only in its embryonic stages here 
he notes that european businesses already have faced up to 
their social responsibilities like kicking in for employees 
medical benefits something that many american companies havent 
been forced to do 
trade barriers are softening and european companies have an 
increasingly urgent need to expand their share of what in 1992 
officially will become a single unified market of more than 300 
million people 
for all of this to work european companies have to merge 
they have to consolidate they have to go across borders said 
edelman relaxing in his artbedecked office 
he also believes european companies are less expensive and 
relatively unencumbered by antitakeover devices like poison pills 
shareholders he says gleefully have ultimate power over the 
company 
edelman is no stranger to europe fluent in french he spent 
four years running the french and belgian operations of the 
investment firm carter berlind amp weill he holidays overseas 
several months a year this summer piloting his yacht through the 
mediterranean to visit archaeological digs 
the decision to focus more exclusively on europe came after his 
unsuccessful bid for burlington industries inclast year 
though he reaped an estimated 60 million edelman said the deal 
degenerated into a horrendous and saddening exchange 
punctuated by accusations that he and his partner canadas 
dominion textile inc had received inside information from a 
former burlington employee 
ultimately burlington was taken private assuming 3 billion in 
debt in the process spokesman bryant haskins said the resulting 
string of staff reductions and asset sales was like curing an 
ingrown toenail by cutting off a leg 
we are still not too happy with mr edelman we felt that 
being put into play in a hostile takeover attempt allegedly using 
inside information was certainly not the way to go about acquiring 
a company he said 
for edelman the incident convinced him that there were just 
too many legal hassles and not enough economic substance to getting 
deals done here 
raised on long islands manicured south shore edelman earned a 
degree in economics at bard college and then moved into the 
brokerage business in 1969 he went out on his own changing course 
over the years from brokering to arbitrage to takeovers while 
posting an average net return of 30 percent annually for his fewer 
than 100 wellheeled clients 
edelman not only has challenged the corporate status quo but the 
academic status quo as well last year while teaching a course at 
columbia university entitled corporate raiding the art of war 
edelman offered a 100000 finders fee to any student who 
spotted a takeover target 
columbia irked that he would have students do his legwork 
forced him to withdraw the offer but according to larry barth a 
student in the class edelman had no problem mixing academia with 
cash incentives 
on wall street edelman is held in varying degrees of esteem 
probably in general people have not made a lot of money with 
asher like they have with carl icahn or boone pickens said one 
arbitrager whose job it is to follow the dealmakers in betting on 
takeover stocks 
hes out there for himself and if you want to come along 
thats dandy but its caveat emptor said the dealer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the string of companies that lies in edelmans wake is lengthy 
fruehauf fended him off in 1986 in a leveraged buyout that resulted 
in divestitures and an 80 million net loss for the year and 
foster wheeler corp charged in court last year that edelman and 
his associates manipulated the companys stock in a takeover bid 
although he won ponderosa inc edelman sold out at no profit 
after cutting overhead and employees he contends the companies 
hes touched are more efficient after such changes 
no one can call edelman a typical businessman he brands 
himself emphatically so as avante garde and ranks his 
interests pyramid style with family at the top followed by the 
arts the community and business which is conspicuously last 
edelman has handpicked an impressive art collection and spends 
at least a full day each week galleryhopping sometimes in his 
chauffeurdriven jeep 
swerving through the curved corridors of his office a visitor 
comes upon a secretary working near a large piece of squashed 
metal its a chamberlain she sighs referring its creator 
john chamberlain 
within his 15room manhattan apartment objects darte are not 
confined to a 57foot gallery indeed a metal sculpture is 
suspended above the dining room table another chamberlain 
recently his eye has strayed from contemporary works to 
antiquities and european art of the 1940s 1950s and 1960s as 
testament to his diversity a secondcentury sculpture of a roman 
emperor has replaced two 500pound boxes by donald judd now on 
loan to the whitney museum 
he has a real sincere interest in the arts said one former 
business associate hes more interesting than many people give 
him credit for and can certainly be provocative i like the fact 
that he has these pretentions

japan is moving to the center of the world 
financial stage stepping into a leadership role temporarily 
vacated by us preoccupation with the presidential campaign 
never before have i seen so many people saying japan 
japan satoshi sumita japans central bank governor told 
reporters at this weeks annual meeting of the international 
monetary fund and world bank 
japan captured the attention of thousands of top financial 
officials and bankers meeting in west berlin with an offer to help 
ease one of the worlds most serious problems the 12 trillion 
third world debt 
it also suggested that the us dollar the worlds leading 
currency be given less weight in the holdings that governments 
keep in their coffers the implication was that japan would like to 
see its own currency the yen take on greater importance in 
international financial transactions 
a highranking official of the japanese finance ministry 
speaking on condition of anonymity confessed to japanese 
reporters japans presence was so powerful that i almost felt 
frightened 
the us role at the meeting was diminished by an uncertain 
dollar high trade and budget deficits and preoccupation with the 
november presidential election 
economists said it was about time japan the worlds no 2 
economic power after the united states exerted more influence 
john williamson a senior fellow at the institute of 
international economics in washington said people have been 
anticipating a more active japanese role for 10 or 15 years up to 
now theyve always remained almost deferential 
japans more visible performance likely stems from its ability 
to successfully manage its economy and reduce its heavy dependence 
on sales of export goods economists said 
its a sign of selfconfidence they feel theyve been most 
successful said tim odell an international economist at the 
london brokerage firm phillips amp drew 
williamson agreed it stems from their macroeconomic success 
in showing they are not dependent on exports 
japan had long relied on sales of goods to foreign countries to 
drive its economy but analysts say in the last year it has been 
able to promote growth based on domestic demand 
at the same time the united states has been criticized for 
failing to correct its federal budget and trade deficits which 
foreign officials fear will derail the world economic expansion 
the dollar has lost some of its luster although it has been 
gaining strength in recent months the united states and its major 
trading partners had agreed three years ago to devalue the dollar 
to narrow the us trade gap and stave off protectionist sentiment 
in congress 
a weaker dollar makes american products more competitive on 
overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the united 
states 
the japanese chose this weeks meeting the largest annual 
gathering of financial brass to make their move five weeks before 
the presidential election when the us focus is at home 
odell said the japanese used the hiatus of the presidential 
campaign to take the opportunity to increase their presence 
newly installed treasury secretary nicholas brady kept a low 
profile at the meeting unlike his predecessor james a baker iii 
baker who resigned as treasury chief to head the presidential 
campaign of vice president george bush was a powerful force in 
international financial affairs 
he was credited with fashioning in 1985 the industrial 
countries strategy for dealing with the third world debt problem 
the baker plan calls in part for providing new loans to 
developing countries that enact economic liberalization policies 
top finance leaders chose this week not to change course they 
agreed to maintain stable financial markets and supported the 
current debt strategy 
still japan persisted it offered a new way to ease the money 
woes of big debtors like brazil and mexico which have combined 
debts of 220 billion 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa floated the idea in june at the 
toronto economic summit attended by seven key world leaders it 
drew little support but prompted interest 
sumita fleshed out the plan under which some of the countries 
foreign debts would be converted into bonds interest on the bonds 
would be backed by money the debtors deposited in escrow accounts 
with the imf sumita also said the japanese exportimport bank was 
willing to make additional loans through the imf to debtor 
countries 
world bank president barber conable called the japanese 
outward looking 
they tend he said to view economic development financing 
in a much more favorable light than many other developed nations 
he said

maytag corp said thursday it is discussing 
the sale of its jenn industries and magic chef air conditioning 
operations as part of its effort to concentrate on major appliances 
maytag chairman daniel j krumm would not identify the potential 
buyers for jenn industries of indianapolis ind and magic chef of 
bellevue ohio 
these are good operations but the products they manufacture 
do not serve markets that are significant to maytag nor do they 
contribute substantially to our earnings krumm said in a 
statement 
combined sales of the two companies totaled 867 million in 
1987 when maytag reported total net sales of 19 billion 
jenn industries which employs about 100 people makes power 
exhaust units and ventilation equipment magic chef with about 400 
employees makes residential furnaces and air conditioners 
selling these operations will permit us to concentrate efforts 
and financial resources in our core businesses of fullsize major 
appliances and vending equipment which is where we can achieve the 
latest longterm benefit krumm said 
the planned sales are part of a reorganization that began 
shortly after maytag and magic chef merged in 1986 the companys 
main brands include admiral hardwick jennair magic chef maytag 
and norge

internationally known activists ended a mock trial 
of the world bank and international monetary fund on thursday with 
a verdict that the organizations perpetuate poverty in heavily 
indebted third world nations 
the permanent peoples tribunal said world bank figures show 
that 350 million people live in absolute poverty throughout the 
world and that the majority of humankind is worse off now than 10 
years ago 
the tribunal urged the united nations to arrange an 
international conference on the third world debt crisis and called 
for a widespread writeoff of the debt 
the threeday trial was staged as world bank and imf 
delegates held their annual joint meeting in another part of west 
berlin 
several renown activists participated in the mock trial 
including americans george wald who shared the 1967 nobel prize in 
physiology or medicine author cheryl payer and sociologist susan 
george 
the tribunal said the flow of resources out of poor countries to 
richer ones is steadily increasing to pay off enormous debts a 
situation it called profoundly unjust and an affront to every 
reasonable and humane person 
as a result the tribunal said in places where a decade ago 
there were primary schools and medical centers no education or 
health care is now provided in such places people have lost 
hope 
in a speech ending the proceedings novelist eduardo galeano of 
uruguay denounced the economic policies of the united states and 
other major industrial nations toward poor countries 
he charged that conditions attached to financial aid offered to 
heavily indebted third world countries have crippled those lands 
the international finance police have a tight hold on 
everything except sunshine and rainfall galeano said 
sparking applause from most of the 300 people in the audience at 
west berlins free university 
the more they people in those countries pay the more they 
owe they have to work longer to have less and less galeano said 
meanwhile he charged the great bankers of the world 
possess more wealth than kings 
in its verdict the tribunal said the world bank and the imf 
have breached the charter of the united nations in that they have 
not prompted higher standards of living full employment and 
conditions of economic and social progress and development in 
poor countries 
the imf has fashioned rescue packages to help financially 
troubled third world countries the world bank provides them with 
aid for economic development 
the tribunal said the monetary policies of united states japan 
and west germany are at least partly responsible for third world 
poverty 
the united states the statement said has contributed to the 
degradation of financial markets through its huge borrowing to 
cover its military expenditures without levying more taxes on its 
own population 
analysts say the large federal budget deficit in the united 
states keeps interest rates higher attracting savings from 
foreigners anxious to earn more money on their investments 
japan and west germany the tribunal charged are using their 
own surpluses to finance the american deficit instead of 
transferring resources to third world countries 
both the bank and the imf declined requests to send 
representatives to the trial saying they have their own 
institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations 
when told about the verdict world bank president barber conable 
replied thats life 
during the world bankimf talks the third world debt problem 
was one of the key topics of discussion financial officials from 
poor countries urged the rich nations to do more to ease their 
burdens 
the permanent peoples tribunal is part of the international 
basso foundation a romebased human rights organization founded by 
lelio basso an italian political activist who died in 1978

rates 
the socalled group of seven includes japan west germany 
britain france italy canada and the united states 
camdessus said he also agreed with the united states that the 
strategy for dealing with the third worlds 12 billion debt 
should be flexible he and representatives of the major industrial 
countries have insisted that debt reduction be done a casebycase 
basis 
i am quite happy with the support camdessus said 
there have been reports of a rift earlier in the meeting between 
the us government and the imf over loans offered by the world 
bank to argentina before argentina entered into a separate 
arrangement with the imf the reagan administration has supported 
the world bank loans 
but camdessus and barber b conable the american who is 
president of the world bank both said thursday that they had 
consulted each other on the argentine loans 
the imf chief defended the us administration against criticism 
that it is falling behind on plans to increase contributions from 
member governments a decision is due april 30 
such a plan would enable the fund to expand lending to third 
world countries in return for promises of policy changes by 
borrower governments so that they will be better able to repay 
the reagan administration has used its influence to delay the 
decision so that it did not have to ask congress in the same year 
for a contribution to both the imf and world bank congress is now 
considering the world bank contribution 
conable said the new capital will help the bank to increase its 
lending to 25 billion a year in 1992 it now lends about 17 
billion annually and is a major source of loans aimed at raising 
third world living standards 
in his closing remarks camdessus said he sensed broad agreement 
on where the world needs to go the world economy is moving on 
the right track he said

the stock market staged a broad advance today 
showing signs of life after the stalemate of the past several weeks 
analysts said there was no single development in the news to 
explain the rally 
however they said it appeared some traders were bidding for 
stocks simply because the market hasnt sold off lately despite a 
long list of worries and uncertainties 
among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of 
black monday on oct 19 which is presumed to be casting a pall 
over the market 
in addition investors are said to be reluctant to commit 
themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government 
economic policy is headed after the election of a new president 
nevertheless brokers said money managers at some investing 
institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios 
before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter 
which ends with fridays session 
the market has been lifeless for so long it started to move 
up and gave traders a sense of direction said hugh johnson at 
first albany corp in albany ny

fischbach corp a leading electrical contractor 
once targeted in an alleged stock parking scheme involving ivan 
boesky victor posner and drexel burnham lambert inc received a 
98 million cash takeover offer thursday from the head of a real 
parking company 
an investor group led by andrew n heine chairman and chief 
executive officer of the national carparking company kinney system 
inc said in a brief statement that it offered 25 a share for 
each of fischbachs approximately 391 million common shares 
edwin wilinski fischbach executive vice president said he had 
no comment on the offer 
the announcement caused fischbachs stock to surge 287 a 
share to 1750 on the new york stock exchange 
fischbach one of the nations largest electrical contractors 
drew prominent attention in april 1987 because it was identified by 
the federal government as the object of a criminal conspiracy 
described in a guilty plea by boesky the former stock speculator 
now serving a threeyear prison term 
the conspiracy concerned stock parking a fraudulent practice in 
which the ownership of stock is disguised in someone elses name 
stock parking can be used to avoid reporting requirements to the 
securities and exchange commission and to quietly accumulate stock 
for hostile takeovers 
earlier this month the sec alleged as part of a massive 
securities fraud complaint against drexel that its highyield bond 
chief michael milken and posner a miami industrialist were 
coconspirators in the fischbach stockparking arrangement with 
boesky 
the sec said the alleged arrangement enabled posner to 
ultimately acquire a controlling interest in fischbach and become 
chairman the defendants in the sec case have denied the 
accusations 
in a telephone interview heine called his offer friendly and 
unsolicited he also said the offer and its timing were unrelated 
to the sec case against drexel and the others but obviously 
were aware of all that 
heine declined to identify his associates in the takeover offer 
but said it had nothing to do with kinney which he once helped 
acquire via a leveraged buyout a transaction in which buyers use 
borrowed money and repay it with the acquired companys assets or 
earnings 
he said the fischbach transaction also would be structured as a 
leveraged buyout but declined to specify if he would sell any of 
the companys assets to finance it 
i really dont want to go into a game plan at this time he 
said 
based in new york fischbach has about 80 offices and 9000 
employees nationwide it earned about 36 million on revenue of 
11 billion last year

winnebago industries incs two top 
operating officers have resigned from the recreational vehicle 
manufacturer replaced by a sevenmember management council 
stepping aside were gerald w gilbert president and chief 
executive officer and richard berreth executive vice president 
the two resigned wednesday and the company announced the change 
thursday 
in a prepared statement the company did not elaborate on why 
the two top officers had quit 
berreth 52 implied that company directors werent satisfied 
with the firms growth in recent months although he declined to be 
specific he said he was disappointed with having to resign but 
that he had only good things to say about the company 
from my standpoint its an excellent company with an 
excellent product line and a good group of people i would prefer 
to let the company speak for itself on the shakeup im certainly 
disappointed in not being with the team but i certainly wish them 
the best of luck he said in a telephone interview from his home 
im going to take 30 days and do a little fishing a little 
hunting and decide what im going to do when i grow up i want to 
make it clear im not throwing mud at the company he said 
attempts to reach gilbert at his home were unsucessful company 
officials would not elaborate on the prepared statement 
berreth said he had been with winnebago for 26 months 
the financial slide for the firm apparently began with the stock 
market crash a year ago when winnebago lost about 86 million 
because of those losses the company posted an overall 19 million 
loss in the fiscal quarter ending nov 28 1987 compared to a 
profit of 28 million the year earlier 
obviously we took quite a hit gilbert said at the time 
but over a fiveyear period of time or so we made awfully good 
money in the market the company said its investments had earned 
an average of 185 percent before taxes 
profits continued to fall early this year in a second quarter 
statement the motor home maker said profits dropped to 13 
million from 63 million in the previous second quarter ending 
feb 27 pershare earnings dropped to 5 cents compared to 25 cents 
a year earlier and sales dropped to 94 million from 97 million 
at the time industry analyst frank rolfes said profits were 
weakened partly because winnebago underpriced its new super chief 
models to gain a market share 
its very successful saleswise but theyre not making any 
money on it he said 
the company recently announced it would begin making motor homes 
for export to japan 
for the first six months of the companys fiscal year the firm 
lost 680000 or 3 cents a share against a profit of 91 million 
the previous year 
berreth said yearend figures show an improvement but he would 
not be specific since the company has yet to release the data 
directing the new management team will be bryan a hayes vice 
president of sales and marketing other members include jerome v 
clouse vice president and treasurer edwin barker vice president 
and controller sharon l hansen director of administration 
richard b carlson vice president of engineering raymond m 
beebe vice president and general counsel and frank rotta

eveready battery co inc on thursday announced 
the first lithium battery in the widely used aa size a development 
that was hailed as a breakthrough by scientists and security 
analysts 
the pencilthin aa batteries make up about half of all batteries 
sold and are the fastestgrowing segment of the industry said st 
louisbased eveready a unit of ralston purina co 
eveready said the new lithium plus battery to be available 
early next year will last up to twice as long as alkaline 
batteries in many uses and will have a shelf life of 10 years or 
more 
its a terrific segment of the market to have hit said 
brian fernandez an analyst at brean murray foster securities inc 
its an area where a premium battery can make rapid market 
penetration 
the suggested retail price will be 5 to 6 a pair compared 
with 150 to 3 a pair for alkaline batteries j patrick mulcahy 
evereadys chairman and chief executive said in an interview 
its going to cream off the top of the market he said he 
declined to reveal marketshare projections 
aa size batteries are widely used in cameras flash units 
stereo headphone devices and toys fernandez predicted that many 
people would be willing to pay extra for a longlasting battery for 
such items 
the batteries will be made at an eveready plant in st albans 
vt using a complicated process on which the company has applied 
for patents mulcahy said 
in a news release eveready quoted supporting statements by 
battery experts at brookhaven national laboratories in long island 
ny and the battery technology center of carnegiemellon 
university in pittsburgh the experts could not be reached by phone 
for comment on thursday 
until now lithium batteries have been in narrow specialized 
segments of the market such as 9volt batteries 
eveready managed to squeeze the lithium technology down to the 
aa size by making many wraps of thin foillike electrodes in a 
kind of jelly roll said gilbert merritt the director of technical 
resources 
different chemicals had to be used to achieve the 15 volt 
standard that is used in aa batteries he said 
merritt said the complexity of the production technology means 
it will take some time before the company gears up to largescale 
production 
fernandez said that by his estimation eveready has the biggest 
share of the us replacement battery market followed by duracell 
inc eastman kodak co and several japanese companies including 
matsushita electric industrial co ltd and hitachi ltd eveready 
and duracell are roughly even in the alkaline segment 
the new battery will be unveiled next week at photokina the 
annual photography industry show in cologne west germany

supplies said bernard savaiko an analyst with painewebber inc

york noted that the price premium of december over the march 1989 
contract widened to 970 cents from 845 cents the widening of 
this gap which is known as threemonth backwardation is a key 
indicator of a tightsupply market

the federal reserve bank of new york handed a 
victory to the japanese securities industry thursday by designating 
a unit of japans yamaichi securities co as a primary dealer in 
us government securities 
the decision was criticized as illtimed and illadvised by 
rep charles e schumer dny the author of recent legislation 
that calls on the new york fed to deny primarydealer status to 
institutions whose home countries deny equal access to us 
companies 
the schumer provision was included in the trade bill recently 
signed by president reagan 
yamaichi international america inc is the seventh unit of a 
japanese securities firm and the 45th institution in all to be 
given the highly prized status of primary dealer the others 
include four british firms and one each from canada hong kong and 
australia 
primary dealers have the exclusive right to deal directly with 
the new york fed when it buys and sells government securities as 
part of its duties in controlling the nations money supply 
largely in reaction to pressure from the united states the 
japanese finance ministry earlier this month announced steps to 
open its own primary market in government bonds to foreign 
institutions 
in a prepared statement schumer said that since the pressure on 
japan was working it was too soon to let up on it an aide tom 
friedman said that under the legislation if the treasury 
department determines after a year that japan is not giving equal 
treatment to us firms it could require the new york fed to 
revoke yamaichis primarydealer status

florida has recovered 32 million from 
milk producers and distributors involved in a 10year pricefixing 
scheme that resulted in overcharges for nearly half the states 67 
school districts attorney general bob butterworth announced 
thursday 
he said the total reached with final agreements concluded 
wednesday made it the largest antitrust recovery in state history 
and a national record for a singlestate antitrust case 
florida schools just won the lottery said butterworth 
wednesdays settlements included payments of 104 million by 
borden inc of columbus ohio 18 million by kraft inc 
sealtest of chicago and 16 million by flavorich inc of 
louisville ky those companies and others were charged feb 16 in 
a civil lawsuit which butterworth filed in us district court in 
miami 
he charged that the companies had conspired to inflate prices of 
milk sold to schools in 32 counties butterworth said that in no 
case however was top management responsible instead sales 
people and distributors had colluded 
butterworth said thursday that the settlement total of 3223 
million equals more than three times the total overcharges suffered 
by the 32 school districts during four years of price fixing plus 
some legal fees the lawsuit alleged that the scheme had occurred 
over 10 years through 1987 but the suit was limited to four years 
because of a federal statute of limitations 
we hope the size of these recoveries will cause future vendors 
to think twice before they sit in a room and conspire to impose 
inflated prices on this states taxpayers said butterworth 
previous settlements included southland corp of dallas which 
formerly operated velda dairy farms of miami 966 million dean 
foods co of chicago which operates harts dairy of fort myers 
tg lee foods inc of orlando and mcarthur dairies inc of miami 
703 million pet inc of st louis 17 million 
the settlements also cover four florida distributors named as 
defendants pierson distributors inc of opalocka hampt 
distributors inc of homestead and butler foods of naples all 
part of the borden settlement and marshall simmons enterprise of 
mango part of the dean settlement

an explosion in a north sea oil rigs main gas 
compressor apparently sparked an inferno that killed 167 people in 
the worlds worst oilfield disaster an interim report of an 
official technical inquiry indicated thursday 
the explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbon 
gases setting off a series of explosions and fires that 
incinerated the piper alpha rig owned by occidental petroleum corp 
of los angeles the report showed 
the first explosions aboard piper alpha just before 10 pm july 
6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control and 
communications facilities the report said 
threequarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 miles 
off scotlands eastern coast trapping many of the victims two 
wouldbe rescuers were among the dead 
the british department of energys director of safety jim 
petrie who is heading the technical inquiry into the disaster 
announced that safety regulations for oil rig operators would be 
tightened 
among areas that need closer attention are oil companies 
technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies and 
their firefighting and evacuation systems he said 
the government recommended last month that additional safety 
valves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect the 
flow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion 
currently there are no regulations concerning the locations of 
valves although all rigs have some type of valves 
most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have been 
trapped in the sunken living quarters occidental said it hopes to 
lift the accommodation modules to the surface early next month 
a prehearing of a public inquiry will open nov 11 in aberdeen 
scotland and the technical inquiry will carry on separately as 
long as its necessary to get to the facts said a department of 
energy spokesman he declined to be identified by name in keeping 
with british practice 
this is not the final report and much remains to be done 
said energy secretary cecil parkinson a number of studies have 
been commissioned and the results are yet to be received 
our priority has been to pass on any lessons as quickly as 
possible and we will continue to do so he told a news 
conference safety has always been the first priority in the 
north sea

the united mine workers union which 
has represented the nations coal miners since its formation in 
1890 will expand its organizing efforts to workers outside the 
coal industry president richard trumka said thursday 
trumka announced the plan as part of a new growth policy 
adopted during a meeting of the umws 24member governing board 
held in washington dc on tuesday the plan calls for a new 
direction in organizing the union said which will emphasize 
recruiting in both coal and noncoal areas 
the plan will transform the umwa into the largest and most 
comprehensive energy union in north america according to a news 
release from the umw the union has watched its membership dwindle 
over the past 50 years from some 500000 in the 1940s to around 
110000 active members today about 80000 of whom are employed 
earlier this year the umw was rebuffed in an attempt to merge 
with the oil chemical and atomic workers union the umws 
international executive board approved the merger but it was 
rejected by the ocaws eightmember governing body trumka said the 
merger would have created the nations largest energy union 
coal miners and all working americans are facing a far 
different economic climate than our parents and grandparents and 
it has been obvious for quite some time that our union must change 
to better deal with the realities of the day trumka said 
thursday 
umw vice president cecil roberts who is in charge of the 
unions organizing said the umws new approach will be to 
concentrate resources in those areas which contain the largest 
number of nonunion miners and the highest tonnage of nonumwa 
coal 
in addition we will expand our activities in noncoal areas 
including but not limited to other energy industries and 
related manufacturing roberts said he said the unions 
governing board also had created a new associate membership 
that will be open to workers in companies where organizing drives 
are in progress as well as umw supporters 
the growth policy also includes the establishment of 
standing committees that will examine the possibility of 
reaffiliating with the aflcio or merging with other unions in its 
1986 convention the umw gave trumka and the rest of the governing 
board the authority to merge or affiliate with other organizations

a federal safety investigation of the commuter 
airline industry has uncovered management problems and in nearly a 
dozen cases the falsification of maintenance and operational 
records the federal aviation administration said thursday 
the agency said that one commuter airline voluntarily 
surrendered its operating certificate after being inspected and 
another may be forced to halt operations eight others air carriers 
singled out for inspection gave up their certificates before the 
inspections could begin although in at least one case the airline 
denied its action was related to the probe 
one airline that the faa says gave up its commuter operating 
certificate south pacific island airways denied thursday that it 
had done so and continues flying commuter service between american 
samoa and western samoa 
the faa investigation which began last march covered about 20 
percent of the commuter airline industry the agency is expected to 
issue a report on its findings by december 
faa officials said thursday that 35 commuter airlines were 
singled out and inspected one of the carriers air new orleans 
voluntarily surrendered its commuter certificate after the 
inspection the agency said 
seven other airlines turned in their operating certificates as 
commuter carriers voluntarily before the faa inspections could get 
under way according top faa spokesman fred farrar 
the faa identified the seven airlines as arctic circle air 
avair dade helicopter jet exec express texas national air and 
grand canyon airlines as well as south pacific island airways 
however the bankruptcy trustee for spia richard kennedy said 
the airline did not surrender its part 135 or commuter operating 
certificate although it did give up a different certificate for 
longerrange flights a few months ago 
farrar maintained thursday night that spia had given up the 
commuter operating certificate 
this whole thing that were talking about has to do with 135 
operations farrar said adding part 121 the certificate 
kennedy said spia had given up is the operating rules that united 
and the other larger airlines operate under 
as for spias 135 certificate farrar said thats the one 
that my people tell me they gave up 
kennedy said he checked with the faa office in honolulu and was 
told spia still was allowed to operate in the samoas 
an faa official in honolulu did not immediately return phone 
calls thursday afternoon 
as for grand canyon airlines a sightseeing aircraft belonging 
to the airline collided with a helicopter over the grand canyon in 
june 1986 killing 25 people it was not immediately clear whether 
grand canyons surrender of its commuter certificate affects its 
sightseeing operation 
at least three of the carriers avair dade helicopter jet and 
spia already had been under chapter ll bankruptcy proceedings 
according to the faa 
glenn schaab president of avair said in a telephone interview 
from raleigh nc that avair surrendered its certificate to the 
faa in june but he said the action had absolutely nothing to 
do with the impending faa inspection of the airline 
we had sold the flight operations portion of the company 
and didnt need the certificate anymore schaab said 
none of the other airlines subject to the inspections was 
identified 
faa officials said that as many as 200 enforcement actions may 
come out of the inspections of the 35 airlines and that one of the 
carriers may yet be forced to surrender its license 
john s kern acting deputy associate administrator for 
regulations and certification told a house investigations 
subcommittee wednesday that in some cases irregularities were 
immediately corrected by the airlines and in some instances 
enforcement actions have been initiated 
there have been at least 11 cases where records were found to 
have been falsified said farrar 
the special probe of the commuter airlines was announced last 
march by faa administrator allan mcartor after an unusually high 
number of commuter accidents in late 1987 and early l988 
seven commuter accidents over a fourmonth period from november 
1987 through february 1988 resulted in 56 fatalities and raised the 
concern of the national transportation safety board and the faa 
the commuters had their safest year ever in 1986 when there were 
only two fatal accidents and four deaths 
commuters airlines which normally fly aircraft of 30 seats or 
fewer have taken on an increasingly important role in air travel 
since many of the larger airlines no longer fly into small 
communities the commuters carried more than 30 million passengers 
last year compared with 14 million in 1979 and are expected to 
carry more than 60 million people by the end of this century 
kern provided no details in his testimony as to the infractions 
found at the commuter airlines but described the findings in broad 
terms saying a detailed report was expected to be available by 
december 
the inspections focused on management maintenance quality 
control procedures and record keeping because preliminary studies 
indicated those to be likely problem areas kern said
