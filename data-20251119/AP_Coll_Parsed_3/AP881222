a man who allegedly tried to ship a 11 million 
mainframe computer to a sovietbloc country has been arrested 
breaking up a large hightechnology smuggling network the us 
customs service said thursday 
customs said the investigation covered six us cities and eight 
foreign countries including libya iran and iraq 
the computer a digital equipment corp vax 8800 has military 
and civilian applications and the man was trying to ship it to 
bulgaria the center for computer technolgy in the soviet bloc said 
patrick obrien special customs agent in charge in miami 
the computer can upgrade and control systems that launch and 
guide ballistic missiles operate radar or run a masstransit 
system customs said it is on a federal list that regulates the 
export of technologically advanced products 
the computer which likely would have been used by the soviet 
defense system was seized last week at miami international airport 
obrien said 
search warrants were being served at us companies that 
manufacture vaxtype computers the system most highly sought by the 
soviets officials said 
four or five make this kind said dexter lehtinen us 
attorney for the southern district of florida they all will be 
checked out for possible involvement with the smuggling network 
he said 
neither lehtinen nor customs would identify the companies 
obrien said customs arrested eddy gorandus haak a dutch 
national on dec 14 after he paid 50000 in swiss francs to 
undercover agents they had promised to help haak smuggle the 
computer to bulgaria 
the arrest and seizure followed an eightmonth investigation and 
left the smuggling network in disarray obrien said 
customs spokesman michael sheehan said more arrests are expected 
in both chicago and boston where search warrants were being served 
customs said the investigation covered activity in boston 
chicago new york newark nj houston great lakes beach mich 
and belgium austria yugoslavia romania hungary libya iran and 
iraq 
obrien said the smuggling network has purchased and diverted 
numerous vax computers systems this year those computer systems and 
others smuggled to soviet countries in the past several years are 
worth tens of millions of dollars customs said 
their whole defense system is converting to the vax obrien 
said at a news conference but they cannot build their own the 
only way they can get it is through the united states 
if we can deny them from taking ours they have to build the 
factories he said it comes out of their defense budget and 
really slows them down 
by getting one of these computers they have saved themselves 
10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and 
development sheehan said these countries are walking from the 
stone age into the 21st century in one step at the expense of the 
united states and theyre using this technology for interests 
contrary to united states interests 
haak 42 is a resident of belsele belgium a grand jury 
returned a threecount indictment charging him with conspiring to 
illegally export computer equipment from the united states to 
bulgaria 
if convicted of all counts haak could receive a maximum sentence 
of 35 years in prison and a 575 million fine 
haak appeared before a federal magistrate thursday and was denied 
bond because of the likelihood he would flee from the united states 
lehtinen said

a soviet woman who knew she carried the aids virus 
has been sentenced to four years in prison for defying doctors 
orders to refrain from sexual relations to avoid spreading the 
disease a newspaper reported 
the prison term given the 31yearold woman identified only as 
olga l by the newspaper socialist industry was believed to be 
the first under a tough government measure aimed at stopping the 
spread of aids 
the council of ministers in august 1987 warned soviets that 
infecting others with the virus would be punished as a crime and 
said anyone in the soviet union could be forced to take an aids 
antibody test 
socialist industry said in wednesdays report taht olga had been 
married to an african student and left with him for the congo after 
four years she returned to her homeland without a husband but 
with aids 
doctors discovered she was carrying the virus after she fell off 
a balcony at a restaurant in the southern ukraine city of kakhovka 
and took a routine blood sample when giving her first aid 
apparently olga though carrying the aids virus showed none of 
its symptoms a carrier of the disease is not yet sick but is 
capable of spreading the infection socialist industry noted 
olga was treated at a moscow clinic where on discharge doctors 
warned her no intimate relations the paper said 
but she paid no heed to these words the number of her partners 
even increased the newspaper said eight of them have already 
been identified and authorities are searching for more it said 
authorities orginally confined olga to kakhovka but she fled a 
local court then sentenced her to a fouryear prison term 
in september 1987 a suspected aids carrier from leningrad 
lyudmila l signed a pledge to refrain from sexual activity for 
five years if she reneges she risks a prison term of up to eight 
years soviet press acounts said at the time 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring

pentagon employees contractors and defense 
consultants regularly deal in a black market of classified 
defense department documents and the government has closed its eyes 
to the practice for at least five years congressional investigators 
say 
a staff report of the congressional joint economic committee 
released wednesday said the pentagons internal investigators 
discovered the practice in 1983 and sought to bring it to the 
attention of defense secretary caspar weinberger and the justice 
department 
but efforts to sound the alarm were ignored by higherups 
leading some subordinates to believe the practice was condoned 
according to testimony at a hearing of the panels national security 
subcommittee 
in a practice that strongly parallels the pattern in the current 
pentagon procurement fraud case outside defense consultants would 
develop sources inside the pentagon who could furnish them with 
classified data the report said documents included secret bid 
specifications for weapons systems and longrange defense 
acquisition plans 
it could not be determined whether pentagon employees were paid 
for the documents the investigators testified 
the consultants then sold the secrets to contractors who could 
use them to get an edge on their competitors at the same time 
depriving the government of the costsaving benefits of open 
competition the investigation concluded 
sen william proxmire dwis the subcommittee chairman said at 
the hearing the practice is even worse than the procurement fraud 
scandal because it involves not just business information but 
secrets that if revealed could damage national security 
the practice which witnesses said involved at least two dozen 
defense contractors is continuing said donald mancuso an 
assistant pentagon inspector general 
john f donnelly director of the defense investigative service 
told the hearing eight of them are still under investigation 
he identified those as boeing co general dynamics corp litton 
systems inc martin marietta corp mcdonnell douglas corp 
northrop corp sanders associates inc and trw inc the pentagon is 
investigating seven of the contractors while the fbi is 
investigating the eighth he said later 
in a related development the inspector generals office 
announced a record 596 firms were barred in fiscal 1988 from doing 
business with the military and more than 4000 people most in 
uniform were convicted of contracting misdeeds in just the last 
half of the year 
the report to congress suggested department auditors are becoming 
more effective at finding waste fraud and mismanagement but it 
also was a reminder that industry wrongdoing remains pervasive 
the joint economic committees report noted that pentagon 
investigators unearthed the black market in secret documents in 
1983 while investigating an employee in california of gte corp a 
defense contractor the documents were obtained outside normal 
channels through a private consultant a similar investigation in 
ohio involving the national aeronautics and space administration 
surfaced at about the same time 
but when investigators went to pentagon superiors for support in 
broadening their investigation their requests were largely ignored 
the report said 
only the gte case went to court where it is still pending 
lawyers for the contractor have contended in their defense that 
unauthorized possession of classified program planning and budget 
documents is widespread in the industry 
by 1984 the pentagon investigators had linked defense department 
officials consultants and 25 contractors suspected of trafficking 
in classified documents a memorandum from pentagon inspector 
general joseph sherick said consultants acting as information 
brokers sell these documents to a number of major defense 
contractors 
some of the information would be of such value to hostile 
powers that it could not even be declassified for court use 
sherick wrote 
but shericks memo intended for weinberger never got past the 
pentagon general counsel chapman b cox the report said 
that and other information provide conclusive evidence that the 
government has indeed known for several years about the trafficking 
of classified and other sensitive documents and has simply failed to 
stop it said sen charles grassley riowa who attended the 
hearing the government was asleep at the switch

stung by cries of grinch planning 
commissioners are trying to write some yuletide spirit into an 
ordinance that inadvertently made lawbreakers out of most of the 
citys christmas tree dealers 
the citys building inspections department presented eviction 
notices earlier this month to 14 of the 17 outdoor christmas tree 
dealers in this grand rapids suburb including the wyoming park 
high school band boosters 
the evictions resulted from an ordinance enacted last summer to 
ban outdoor sales 
when we passed that ordinance frankly no one thought about 
christmas trees gerald mears head of wyomings planning and 
inspections departments told planning commissioners tuesday 
the dealers were told to clear the trees off their lots or pay a 
110 application for a zoning variance prompting councilman edward 
frederick to call mears a grinch 
at their latest meeting the council ordered that all christmas 
tree dealers should be left alone this year and that new language 
allowing their continued operation be written into the law 
it was not our intention to stop christmas said councilman

how do you wrap a christmas pickle and 
what about the pressing problem of wrapping an ironing board in a 
pretty holiday package

weve done a dill pickle an ironing board a boat ladder and 
an ornamental yard windmill said eva weber a volunteer at the 
booth run by the north platte church of god

from the tiny congregation of 35 will have wrapped an estimated 
2000 packages 
we use about 6000 bows over christmas said sheri clark 
whose husband bob is the minister of the church 
proceeds from the booth provide the church with money for 
community and mission work 
the volunteers said an important part of their job is to 
scrounge the dumpsters for oddsized boxes 
we want the finished product to look professional we take a 
lot of pride in how we do the job mrs weber said

roy collette will need a jackhammer and a 
torch this year to open the annual christmas gag gift of a 
2decadeold pair of moleskin pants from his brotherinlaw larry 
kunkel 
the gift was delivered to his home saturday in this southeastern 
minnesota city via flatbed semitruck in a concretefilled container 
resembling a space capsule 
as the truck moved slowly up the street collette acknowledged he 
was in for a heavy job of unwrapping 
there are three axles underneath the trailer that tells you 
something he said calling the whole business foolishness 
kunkel and his crew of six volunteers spent 45 minutes unloading 
the gift by crane and setting it upright in the driveway 
collette merely repeated hes gonna pay for this one 
the package weighs several tons stands more than 12 feet 
high measures 8 feet in diameter and comes with a us flag 
printed on the capsule which is actually the barrel of a concrete 
mixer are the words united states command module roy 88 
the moleskin pants circa 1964 are in a gas can somewhere inside 
theyve plagued the brothersinlaw for more than 20 years they 
originated as a gift to kunkel from his mother he discovered the 
cotton fake suede pants stiffened in cold weather and gave them to 
collette who found them just as unappealing 
collette wrapped them up and returned them to kunkel one 
christmas and the exchange continued each year until collette 
packaged them in a bucket of cement but kunkel managed to extract 
them 
the packaging has become increasingly elaborate as the men try to 
outwrap each other 
last year the brothersinlaw agreed to end the prank they were 
going to tie the pants to the trunks of their vehicles split them 
in half and burn them but collette added a twist with a slip of 
the rope the pants went sailing off fully intact behind kunkels 
vehicle

uncle sams annual greetings to taxpayers are 
ready to be mailed to 101 million americans complete with an 
estimate of how long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out the 
forms 
the internal revenue service previewed the new tax forms at a 
briefing wednesday supplying plenty of words of assurance that 
taxpayers should find preparing their returns relatively simple this 
year compared to the last filing season 
thats because there are few changes being made in the new forms 
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time 
the sweeping changes made by the landmark 1986 tax reform act 
while there had been dire predictions that befuddled taxpayers 
would throw up their hands in despair because they couldnt 
comprehend the new law the irs said the filing process went 
relatively smoothly 
millions of americans were asked to handle some very big tax 
changes and they did so with a minimum of fuss and far fewer 
mistakes than any of the socalled experts had predicted said 
arthur altman chairman of the irs forms committee 
altman said the irs was delivering a double dose of good news 
this year there are far fewer changes and the modifications that 
have been made should help clear up confusion uncovered in the first 
use of the forms 
the 1987 returns that taxpayers did last year will serve as an 
excellent reference point for preparing their new returns and the 
few changes that we did make will make life easier for them 
altman said 
altman said one section which was overhauled concerned the 
standard deduction taken by people who do not itemize last year 
many people either forgot to reduce their taxable income by the 
amount of the deduction or used the wrong number 
in an effort to simplify things taxpayers this year will be 
directed to a section in the instructions which will provide 
guidelines on which figures to use 
one of the biggest changes in the forms this year will not be 
noticeable because it is incorporated into the tax tables that 
change will reflect the final reduction in individual tax rates 
required under the 1986 law 
the new rates which have been used to compute the amounts 
withheld from paychecks since last january tax most americans at 
levels of 15 percent or 28 percent 
in addition to cutting tax rates significantly the new tax law 
almost doubled personal exceptions reduced or eliminated several 
itemized deductions and boosted the standard deduction for 
nonitemizers 
for the first time the irs will be supplying estimates of how 
long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out their returns 
for a taxpayer using the standard form 1040 the irs estimates it 
will require nine hours and 17 minutes to keep the records study 
the instructions and fill out the form 
this does not count an additional 5 hours and 51 minutes the 
agency estimates a taxpayer will need to fill out an accompanying 
schedule a used if the taxpayer itemizes deductions and schedule 
b used to list income from interest and dividends 
by contrast the irs estimated that the average taxpayer only 
needs 58 minutes to fill out the 1040ez the simplest irs form which 
can be used only by single people who do not itemize and who have 
taxable income below 50000 
the agency listed these changes for the 1988 forms 
the individual exemption for a taxpayer his spouse and each 
dependent has been increased from 1900 to 1950 
the standard deduction for those who do not itemize has been 
increased for 1988 for a single person the deduction will go from 
2540 to 3000 the deduction for a married couple filing jointly 
will rise from 3760 to 5000 
taxpayers will be able to claim an earned income credited for 
1988 if they earned less than 18576 and a child lived with them 
last year the income limit was 15432 
the rules governing deductions for home mortgage interest were 
liberalized in such a way that taxpayers who had their interest 
deduction limited in 1987 will likely be able to deduct more in 1988 
in some cases taxpayers will find they will need to mail their 
returns to a different processing center this year as the irs tries 
to redistribute its workload to better reflect population changes 
taxpayers living in alabama indiana louisiana mississippi 
minnesota and virginia will send their returns to different 
addresses this year taxpayers were advised to use the envelope that 
comes with their tax package or see the where to file section of 
the instructions 
the irs traditionally begins mailing out the new forms on the day 
after christmas to allow taxpayers plenty of time to prepare the 
returns which must be mailed back by april 15 
the forms which this year cost 294 million to print and mail 
have been waiting at post offices for the past several weeks with 
instructions to begin delivery on dec 27

president reagan will leave his successor a 
spending blueprint which projects that the federal budget can be 
balanced by 1993 nine years later than the target reagan set when 
he campaigned for the presidency in 1980 
officials who are putting the finishing touches on the 
administrations final budget said it will call for a deficit of 
925 billion for the 1990 fiscal year which starts next october 
that would represent a decline from an actual deficit of 1551 
billion in the 1988 fiscal year that ended sept 30 
the narrowing of the gap between government revenues and spending 
was accomplished by optimistic economic assumptions which boost the 
governments tax take and a combination of spending cuts increased 
user fees and 6 billion in sales of government assets 
the administration is projecting that its policies will result in 
a balanced budget by 1993 without the need to increase taxes 
the 1990 budget more than meets the 100 billion deficit 
reduction limit established by the grammrudman law that 
legislation sets declining deficit targets for each year ending with 
a balanced budget in 1993 
reagans final spending plan projects meeting those targets each 
year ending with a small surplus in 1993 when reagan campaigned 
for the presidency in 1980 he promised to balance the budget by 
1984 
joseph wright head of the white house office of management and 
budget briefed reagan vice president george bush and other members 
of the cabinet on the administrations final spending blueprint on 
wednesday 
officials said that all decisions have now been made on the 
budget which the administration will submit to congress on jan 9 
reagan told reporters that his budget will be in keeping with 
the grammrudman program leading toward a balanced budget 
wright told reporters at a briefing that the administration had 
succeeded in reaching its deficit goals without touching social 
security or abandoning the presidents goal of boosting defense 
spending by 2 percent above the inflation rate each year wright 
also said that the budget would not include any new taxes 
while wright would not reveal the actual deficit figure an 
administration source who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used said that reagans final budget would show a deficit of 925 
billion 
this figure includes 6 billion in asset sales the source said 
these sales do not count toward meeting the grammrudman target 
however even with the asset sales discounted the administrations 
budget would still be below the 100 billion target 
the administrations final budget is calling for spending of 
115 trillion in 1990 an increase over projected spending of 110 
trillion in the current fiscal year 
without any changes in current government services the 
administration projected the 1990 deficit would total 127 billion 
however this projection does not include about 9 billion in 
increased spending for defense space programs aids research and 
other areas where reagan will seek increases rather than reductions 
from current projections of growth in government programs 
wright said the administration would also ask for increased 
spending to rescue failed savings and loan associations but he 
refused to provide any specifics of how much money would be involved 
however the administration source said that the reagan budget 
would project spending of 25 billion over the next two years by the 
federal home loan bank board to close and merge failed sampls the 
agency spent 8 billion in the 1988 fiscal year 
critics have charged that the actual cost of resolving the sampl 
crisis could climb as high as 100 billion and should be one of 
bushs top priorities when he takes office 
the administration has been accused of using overly optimistic 
economic assumptions to reach the deficit reduction goals the 
congressional budget office using more pessimistic assumptions is 
expected to project a 1990 deficit about 20 billion higher than the 
administration when it releases its own report early next year 
wright said that bush and his choice for omb director richard 
darman have been kept informed of the work on the 1990 budget bush 
has indicated he intends to provide congress with at least a 
blueprint of his own spending priorities but he has refused to say 
he will submit an entirely new document after he takes office 
it has been previously reported that the administration would 
seek to cut 52 billion from medicare the program that provides 
health care for 33 million elderly and disabled social security 
recipients the reductions would be achieved by reducing payments to 
doctors and hospitals 
in addition the administration is seeking savings of 11 
billion in the medicaid program which pays the health costs of poor 
persons 
wright has also said other savings would be achieved through 
cutting farm subsidy payments and government pension benefits

a mate is being sought for a lonely 
wolf that a local official says is in danger of dying of a broken 
heart 
arnsberg administrator richard gruenschlaeger on wednesday asked 
residents to help find a young female mate for a north american 
timber wolf recently found caged in the city 
authorities took the wolf to a nearby zoo but he remains 
isolated because other wolves would attack a newcomer 
gruenschlaeger said 
timber wolves have a very strong need to live within a 
community gruenschlaeger said he is destined to die without 
company 
gruenschlaeger said the wolf could not be returned to the wild 
because he had spent too long in a cage 
his only hope is to find a pretty young female wolf with whom 
he can build his own pack gruenschlaeger said

north is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired 
air force maj gen richard secord to illegally divert more than 12 
million in usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
north through his lawyer invoked his fifth amendment right 
against selfincrimination last may in refusing to turn over to the 
senate foreign relations committee dozens of his spiralbound 
notebooks 
as a national security council aide north took extensive notes 
on a variety of topics during phone calls and in the course of daily 
business with people in and out of the reagan administration 
the notebooks some 2848 pages in all first came up in 
testimony before congress in the irancontra hearings last year and 
portions of them previously given to congressional investigators 
also are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs drug 
traffickers the drug enforcement administration and the cia but 
large segments committee aides said about half the contents have 
been blacked out by brendan sullivan one of norths lawyers or by 
white house censors 
keker said the prosecution would file a motion in the next few 
days for the notebooks in norths possession which he compiled 
while running the program to give covert aid to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
last may sen john kerry dmass chairman of the foreign 
relations panels narcotics subcommittee complained that sullivan 
was custodian of documents that have been walked out of the 
workplace of the most highly sensitive government agency that we 
have 
gesells decision to set a trial date was prompted by comments 
from one of norths lawyers barry simon who said several key 
witnesses in the case will be leaving the reagan administration next 
month for the four corners of the earth 
keker head of independent counsel lawrence walshs trial team 
said we certainly hope we can meet that date 
some uncertainty remains however whether norths trial actually 
will take place as scheduled 
us intelligence specialists are trying to decide whether they 
can permit disclosure of national security secrets contained in 
classified documents that prosecutors want to introduce as evidence 
national security concerns have placed in jeopardy norths trial 
on the major conspiracy and theft charges which involve extensive 
use of classified material other charges against him such as lying 
to congress and illegal use of a taxexempt foundation involve such 
material to a much smaller extent 
gesell ruled dec 12 that too much material relevant to the case 
had been excised from the 300 classified documents that walshs 
prosecution team wants to use as evidence at trial 
gesell said that while the documents had all been properly 
classified too much had been held back especially if a jury was to 
understand the facts of the case

a consumer federation of america report 
concluding residential telephone subscribers have been shortchanged 
since the bell system breakup was branded inaccurate and misleading 
by the phone industry and its regulators 
the regional bell phone companies and the federal communications 
commission rejected the reports findings that phone rates have 
ballooned since the atampt divestiture while the spinoff companies 
earn excessive profits 
service has never been better the percentage of homes with a 
phone has never been higher said bellsouth one of seven regional 
bell companies spun off from american telephone amp telegraph co in 
the breakup five years ago 
the federations annual report on phone service released 
wednesday said telephone service is no longer the consumer bargain 
it once was 
overall phone rates which rose at less than onethird the rate 
of general inflation in the 50 years before divestiture have been 
rising as fast as inflation since then the report says 
local rates followed the same predivestiture trend as overall 
rates but after the breakup local rates have climbed twice as fast 
as inflation the study said much of the increase resulted from a 
charge imposed by federal regulators that now costs each residential 
subscriber 320 per month it was intended to reduce longdistance 
subsidies of the local phone network 
inflationadjusted local rates are up 25 to 35 percent while 
longdistance rates have dropped 43 percent the report said 
however most americans make too few interstate calls to offset the 
higher local rates according to the federation 
segments of the telephone industry used the bell breakup as a 
trojan horse to conceal their assault on one of the best consumer 
bargains of modern times said gene kimmelman author of the 
report from the washingtonbased federation which claims to be the 
nations largest consumer advocacy group 
had we preserved traditional regulation consumers would be 
paying about 4 per month less for local service and ratepayers 
would be saving 1 billion to 2 billion dollars each year he 
said 
bellsouth said the report lumps outofdate statistics in an 
attempt to plant inaccuracies in the minds of customers and 
charged kimmelman with juggling the figures 
gerald brock the fccs top telephone official said the report 
was intentionally misleading it is an attempt to put together 
figures that have no relevance to each other to show a trend that 
doesnt exist 
he said a substantial portion of the local rate increases 
granted by the states to bell companies after they were spun off 
from atampt resulted from the companies writing off old equipment and 
facilities he said that caused an increase in prices but that 
was going to happen at some time 
we are now seeing real telephone rates decline he said 
citing government figures showing the consumer price index for local 
and longdistance phone service declined 13 percent in 1987 and 
dropped 01 percent this year 
bell atlantic said none of its local phone companies has had a 
general rate increase since october 1985 and rates for many 
services have been reduced 
prices have stabilized and the trend is down said dan 
behuniak a bell atlantic assistant vice president 
the divestiture separated atampts longdistance operations from 
its monopoly local bell units the local companies were formed into 
seven regional holding companies that operate extensive local phone 
networks 
since the breakup the report said these bell companies have 
earned higher profits that are far out of line with historical 
bell system earnings and the current marketplace

the government is getting off to a good start 
toward reducing the budget deficit in 1989 but analysts say rising 
interest rates and a slowing economy will make the task increasingly 
difficult 
the treasury department said wednesday that a budget gap of 565 
billion for the first two months of the fiscal year which began 
oct 1 was 24 percent lower than for the same period in the 
previous year 
the federal government ran up a 290 billion budget deficit in 
november and 274 billion in october the november red ink was 74 
percent higher than a year earlier but the october figure was 109 
percent below the yearearlier total 
the october deficit was held down by two special factors a 
decline in farm subsidy payments and a drop in military spending 
caused by a shift in paycheck dates 
the reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in 
fiscal 1989 will shrink to 1455 billion from 1551 billion in the 
1988 fiscal year ended sept 30 the congressional budget office 
forecasts a 148 billion shortfall 
this year were going to have a bigger deficit because the 
economy isnt going to grow as fast as it did in 1988 and interest 
rates will be higher said michael k evans an economic 
consultant in washington we had a break in october but now 
were just about even 
weak growth hurts deficitcutting efforts by slowing tax 
collections higher interest rates force the government to spend 
more to finance the 27 trillion national debt 
the need to spend billions of dollars to clean up government 
nuclear power plants and to rescue the ailing savings and loan 
industry also could add to presidentelect bushs budget problems 
on the face of it it looks like were beginning to put in a 
good performance for 1989 but everyone is fairly skeptical about 
whether we will be able to maintain that pace there are a lot of 
expenditures in the pipeline said samuel d kahan an economist 
with kleinwort benson government securities inc in chicago 
government revenue in november totaled 644 billion or 74 
billion higher than a year earlier but spending rose an even 
heftier 94 billion to 934 billion 
as usual the largest spending categories in november were the 
military social security other programs in the department of 
health and human services interest on the national debt and farm 
subsidies 
military spending totaled 239 billion last month and 491 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 69 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 184 billion last month and 
358 billion for the past two months up 63 percent from the same 
period in the 1988 fiscal year 
interest on the national debt totaled 181 billion last month 
and 333 billion so far this fiscal year an increase of 83 
percent over the same period last year 
the other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid spent 
136 billion in november and 253 billion so far this budget year 
a 06 percent decline 
spending by the agriculture department totaled 53 billion in 
november and 111 billion since oct 1 down 136 percent from 
fiscal 1988 
evans said the drought assistance to farmers likely will boost 
farm spending in coming months 
even though the numbers havent shown up in the budget they 
have to congress passed the drought relief bill its just a matter 
of timing as to when the treasury sends out the checks thatll be 
about 5 billion he said 
the federal deposit insurance corp which insures deposits in 
commercial banks spent 171 billion more than it collected in 
revenue in november it spent 840 million last month as part of the 
2 billion rescue of first republic bank of dallas 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which backs 
deposits in savings institutions spent 107 billion more than it 
collected so far this fiscal year approximately double from last 
year

broadcasters and freespeech advocates say they 
will appeal a new federal communications commission rule banning 
sexually explicit programming from the airwaves 
the agency issued the rule wednesday in response to a new law 
that closes the fccs current midnightto6 am window during which 
indecent material may be aired 
our view is that the statute is plainly unconstitutional 
said washington dc attorney timothy dyk who is representing a 
coalition of broadcasters and freespeech groups 
one fcc commissioner patricia diaz dennis also said she has 
constitutional questions about the rule because recent court 
decisions have upheld first amendment protection of indecent 
broadcast programming 
the democratic commissioner said the fcc had no alternative but 
to order the aroundtheclock ban in compliance with the measure 
passed earlier this year by congress but she said she has grave 
misgivings about the constitutionality of the rule 
the recent court decisions she said suggest that the courts 
would not uphold an outright ban on the broadcast of indecent 
speech 
the new rule is to take effect 30 days after it is published in 
the federal register it applies only to overtheair radio and tv 
broadcasts and does not apply to cable tv 
in its order the fcc noted that it previously had interpreted 
existing law to prohibit obscene programming at any time and 
indecent programming only when there was a reasonable risk that 
children might be in the audience it said the courts also held that 
opinion 
but the agency said the directive of congress affords us no 
discretion and we will now enforce the indecency restrictions 24 
hours a day 
diane killory fcc general counsel said that although the fcc 
previously argued before the courts that indecency could not be 
removed entirely from the air a defense of an outright ban can 
be put forward 
she said the fcc previously interpreted court rulings as 
permitting the agency to channel indecent programming to avoid 
children congress she said feels that such material should be 
channeled right off the medium 
indecent material is defined by the fcc as that which in 
context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as 
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast 
medium sexual or excretory activities or organs 
obscene material which is already banned from the airwaves is 
defined as that which appeals to the prurient interest and lacks 
serious artistic literary political or scientific value 
dyk said an outright ban on indecency would deny this material 
to adults who would like to receive it were talking about a 
lot of material that has important social value

scholars have determined a book bound in wood 
and leather and buried under a childs head more than 1600 years 
ago is the earliest complete book of psalms and probably the oldest 
book of any kind 
we have for the first time a complete book of psalms dating 
from the second half of the 4th century ad making it the oldest 
complete book of psalms ever found museum director gawdat gabra 
said wednesday 
never before have we seen such an early book in egypt and i 
can find no evidence of an earlier true book anywhere this volume 
is a book in every sense of the word he said 
gabra director of cairos coptic museum first saw the book 
within days of its discovery four years ago and has studied it for 
the past 2 years he is an egyptologist as well as one of the 
worlds top experts in coptic studies 
the book includes about 490 parchment pages bound between wooden 
covers stitched with leather the psalms are handwritten in a 
dialect of coptic a nowdead language of old greek characters 
supplemented by seven hieroglyphs from ancient egypts late period 
gabra said the text contains many greek and some coptic words 
never seen before it is written in brown ink derived from iron 
except in a few passages where words were written over in black 
carbon ink in apparent attempts to repair damage wear is obvious 
where fingertips turned the parchment pages 
the books pages were stuck together when it was found in 1984 
all but the last five two of which are blank have been separated 
a tiny key of life carved from bone was attached to the book by 
leather threads the key or ankh is a symbol from ancient egypt 
that was incorporated in the christian cross 
it is the earliest complete book of psalms at the same time 
written in a new dialect for scholars and we have its whole 
history said martin krause coptic studies professor of munster 
university in west germany 
i must stress that this manuscript is important not only for 
coptic study but for all biblical traditions said krause who has 
studied the text for four months 
the book was discovered by egyptian antiquities inspectors in a 
cemetery for the poor about 85 miles south of cairo and 25 miles 
north of a grecoroman city called oxyrhynchus 
nothing indicated much of historical interest in the 
cemetery gabra said some bodies were buried with textiles but 
there was little else to be found 
then workers found the grave of a little girl about 12 years 
old and under her head was this book with the tiny key of life 
he said it is not known why the child was buried there because 
the value of the book indicates her family must have been rich 
they must have loved her very much perhaps she was an only 
child gabra said to put something of such an immense value 
indicates how they felt about her this book would have taken a long 
time to copy and would have cost a lot 
gabra said the book has immense historical value epecially 
because it was found in a grave and did not arrive via antiquities 
smugglers he said everything about the book can be documented 
until now what we had were fragments of psalms such as found 
in the dead sea scrolls and later versions of the old testament 
book some of questionable origin gabra said most original texts 
have disappeared 
the coptic church traces its book of psalms to two greek 
versions one of which is incomplete gabra said the new book 
will add much to what has been missing because its the version 
nearer the missing manuscript 
the coptic church is among the worlds oldest christian faiths 
traditionally dating from st marks arrival in egypt between ad 
4875 there are 5 million to 6 million coptic christians about 10 
percent of egypts population 
only two other manuscripts have been found written in the same 
oxyrhynchus dialect one the gospel of st matthew is in the 
private collection of william scheide of princeton nj the other 
called the glazier codex contains the first 15 chapters of acts of 
the apostles and is in new york citys pierpont morgan library 
gabra said psalms was the biblical book most often buried with 
early egyptian copts the bookburying tradition evolved from 
ancient egypt when the book of the dead surrounded mummies on 
tomb walls to help the deceased enter the afterworld he said 
psalms was the favorite work throughout early christianity in 
egypt no other book was so quoted gabra said monks had to 
memorize the book and even until modern times psalms was used for 
magical purposes 
museum director gabra said the first scholastic publication about 
the books archaeology conservation and historical importance is 
expected next year years of study lie ahead 
eventually he said we plan to display the book in a special 
room of its own in the coptic museum giving it the importance it 
deserves

an atomic reactor in new york and a 
twinreactor plant in southern maryland where a worker recently 
drowned have been added to the nuclear regulatory commissions list 
of the nations worst nuclear power stations 
the calvert cliffs plant near lusby md about 50 miles 
southeast of washington has recently had a number of accidents 
including one in which a worker drowned in a condensate tank that 
was blanketed with nitrogen gas 
also added wednesday to the nrcs watch list of problem 
plants was the nine mile point no 2 reactor on the shores of lake 
ontario near scriba ny 
at the same time the commission removed from its list of problem 
reactors the rancho seco plant near sacramento calif as well as 
commonwealth edisons dresden units no 2 and 3 near morris ill 
rancho seco operated by the sacramento municipal utility 
district narrowly avoided being shut down in a ballot question in 
november instead voters decided to give the plant another 18 
months to prove that it can be operated efficiently 
altogether the nrcs semiannual rating had 16 reactors at nine 
different locations on the watch list meaning they warrant 
particularly close attention 
assessing overall performance of the nations 110 operating 
nuclear power reactors thomas e murley director of the nrcs 
office of nuclear reactor regulation told the commissioners at a 
briefing wednesday there are firm indications that show that 
average operating performance is improving 
but he added that we have a long way to go noting there were 
problems with complacency about safety at some plants 
the calvert cliffs plant includes two 825megawatt pressurized 
water reactors that went into commercial service in the mid1970s 
william russell administrator of the nrcs king of prussia pa 
regional office said the maryland plant had been put on the problem 
list due to fairly significant operational errors and failures to 
follow procedures 
he cited three incidents at calvert cliffs 
on june 6 during a test of emergency diesel generators the 
operators failed to follow procedures and put the voltage regulators 
from the automatic mode to manual mode and failed to restore 
them to automatic following the test this meant the emergency 
generators were inoperative for 48 hours until the problem was 
discovered 
on july 4 while starting up one of the reactors operators 
failed to respond properly when they got two different readings for 
the reactors power because instruments were not recalibrated for a 
new fuel cycle this was particularly disturbing in that they had 
extra people available and there were a number of opportunities 
for people to question what was being done russell said 
on sept 15 a worker drowned in a condensate tank used to store 
fresh water for use in the plants steam system this happened after 
one worker entering the tank passed out due to nitrogen gas 
blanketing the top of the tank another worker then entered the tank 
to help the first one fell into the water and drowned 
in a statement edward a crooke president of baltimore gas and 
electric co owner of calvert cliffs said the utility was 
dedicated to taking all necessary steps to address the nrcs 
concerns 
our goal in all of this is to promptly return calvert cliffs to 
a position of excellence in the commercial nuclear industry we will 
be satisfied with nothing less crooke said 
regarding nine mile point no 2 owned by niagara mohawk power 
co russell told the commission the reactor was added to the list 
because we concluded that they were not able to effectively 
operate the station 
he pointed to a very high rate of scrams sudden shutdowns and 
operating events and said the utility needed to develop a 
comprehensive plan to deal with deficiencies at the plant 
the plants unit no 1 was already on the nrcs problem list 
stephen brady a spokesman for niagara mohawk said william j 
donlon the utilitys chairman had sent a telegram to the nrc 
saying the company has taken steps to strengthen its nuclear 
management team and is driving hard to improve operations at nine 
mile point units 1 and 2 to make those plants the standard of the 
industry 
other plants on the nrcs problem list are sequoyah 1 and 2 
owned by the tennessee valley authority browns ferry 1 2 and 3 
also tva turkey point 3 and 4 florida power amp light co fermi 2 
detroit edison co fort calhoun omaha public power district

at the height of its power drexel burnham 
lambert inc bestrode the financial world like a colossus using its 
moneyraising power to finance everything from nursery school chains 
to corporate takeovers 
drexel is like a god in that end of the business and a god can 
to anything it wants they are awesome you hate to do business 
against them said one awed competitor michael boylan the 
president of macfadden holdings in 1986 
on wednesday the colossus dropped to its knees legally if not 
financially drexel agreed to plead guilty to six federal felony 
counts and pay a record 650 million fine to settle the biggest wall 
street securities fraud case in history 
the deal requires approval of the securities and exchange 
commission and senior justice department officials 
drexels power came from its exploitation of an area of finance 
that other investment bankers had ignored either because of lack of 
imagination or lack of appetite for risk 
drexel helped clients raise large amounts of money quickly by 
issuing bonds that were riskier than investmentgrade securities and 
hence paid higher yields 
the securities quickly became known as junk bonds to the dismay 
of drexel and michael milken the brilliant strategist who helped 
pioneer them and was also a target of the criminal probe 
in spite of its upstart image drexel was not a newcomer to wall 
street it traces its roots to the founding of burnham amp co in 
1935 drexel firestone which burnham acquired in 1973 goes back to 
the 1830s and once counted jp morgan among its partners 
drexel was a secondtier investment bank though until the 
mid1970s when it came up with the concept of selling junk bonds as 
original issues 
until then the only junk bonds were securities that had 
originally been issued with a higher rating but whose issuers had 
fallen on hard times 
drexel worked both sides of the deal lining up investors who 
were attracted by the bonds attractive yields and grateful issuers 
who had never before been able to raise money in the bond market 
frederick h joseph now drexels chief executive was then head 
of corporate finance leading underwriting efforts 
milken led drexels junkbond trading operation and moved it to 
beverly hills calif from new york in 1977 
the companys biggest break came in the early 1980s when it hit 
on the idea of using junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers that 
idea vaulted it to the front ranks of investment banks and 
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business 
corporate raiders such as carl icahn sir james goldsmith saul 
steinberg and t boone pickens jr established close relations with 
drexel as did stock speculators such as ivan boesky 
among the companies taken over with the help of junk bonds 
floated by drexel were twa inc and crown zellerbach corp drexel is 
also playing a major role in financing kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
cos 245 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
drexel earned enormous fees for underwriting and trading junk 
bonds and for its takeover advice boosting its capital more than 
tenfold from 1981 to 22 billion last year that made the privately 
held company the fifth largest firm on wall street 
but drexels influence in the takeover game began to diminish 
somewhat amid the insidertrading scandal on wall street which 
erupted with the arrest of a drexel investment banker dennis r 
levine and then led to a government investigation of drexels 
tactics 
still drexel has denied suggestions that the probe severely 
impaired the firm claiming its junk bond business and its other 
investment banking operations remained strong 
as recently as wednesday before drexels agreement to plead 
guilty southland corp the parent company of 7eleven convenience 
stores announced it had switched its investment banking business to 
drexel dumping the prestigious investment banking firms of goldman 
sachs amp co and salomon brothers inc

field trials have proved the safety of the 
technology for a new product that would enable corn to grow its 
own pesticide the manufacturer says 
the bioinsecticide or cxcbt was developed by crop genetics 
international corp of hanover md and is aimed at controlling the 
european corn borer a pest estimated to cost 400 million in losses 
annually to the nations corn crop 
a series of tests was performed in maryland this year and crop 
genetics said it will seek further approval from the agriculture 
department and the environmental protection agency to carry out 
additional field trials in 1989 at various locations including 
major corn areas of the midwest 
the scientific data from our field trials in maryland confirms 
the environmental safety of our bioinsecticide peter s carlson 
chief scientist and cofounder of the company said wednesday 
some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spread 
to other plants or to humans and other animal species 
but crop genetics said the maryland tests showed that cxcbt does 
not multiply or survive outside its host plant the cxc part of the 
vaccine was described as a naturally occurring microorganism 
which can live only inside a plants vascular system 
the bt part is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans 
animals birds and nontarget insects the company said the 
product which the firm calls incide is inserted in corn seed 
enabling corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against the 
borer 
company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yield 
and production information to see how well the biopesticide performs

a federal audit shows the farmers home 
administration is losing money at a record pace but a spokesman 
says the agriculture department agency is in business to help 
people not make a profit 
the audit by the general accounting office says the agency has 
built a 40year deficit of at least 36 billion of which about 22 
billion occurred last year 
farmers home was created by the congress to do specific 
things spokesman marlyn aycock said wednesday i dont think it 
was created to make a profit or else they wouldnt have said we 
have to lend to people who cant get money elsewhere 
the gao an investigating agency of congress said that since 
fmhas revolving credit accounts began in 1946 cumulative losses 
have amounted to about 59 billion of which congress reimbursed the 
agriculture department agency 23 billion 
our opinion on fmhas statement of financial position reflects 
our concerns over the agencys inability to repay its borrowings and 
to meet its current operations without incurring additional debt and 
the magnitude of its accumulated 36 billion deficit which includes 
22 billion for losses recognized in fiscal year 1987 said 
frederick d wolf director of gaos accounting and financial 
management division 
the agency has its roots in the mid1930s during the depression 
and is often called the governments lender of last resort for 
hardpressed farmers who cannot get credit from banks and other 
commercial lenders 
although farm loans are a key element of fmha operations rural 
housing and rural development also are involved 
the gao audit was for the fiscal year that ended sept 30 1987 
and was the first in the agencys history it was submitted on 
tuesday to agriculture secretary richard e lyng who is required by 
law to respond to congress within 60 days 
aycock said in an interview that as of sept 30 1988 the agency 
had total loans outstanding of about 62 billion less than half 
255 billion was owed under the farm lending programs the 
balance was loans for rural housing and community development 
of the total 62 billion in loans about 92 billion were 
delinquent the farm delinquencies represented 83 billion of that 
amount aycock said 
every loan we make is subsidized to one extent or another he 
said over half of 62 billion loans weve got are made at 
interest rates below 5 percent 
as to gaos finding that the agency lost 22 billion last year 
aycock said much of that was bookkeeping that the gao itself had 
insisted upon

the city council reversed two previous votes 
wednesday and approved an ordinance protecting the rights of 
homosexuals 
this grants everyone in the city a right of a house a job and 
city services said mayor eugene sawyer theres nothing 
outlandish about that 
sawyer who personally lobbied for the ordinance met with 
reporters along with leaders of the homosexual and lesbian 
communities after the council action 
in addition to homosexuals the ordinance protects the elderly 
and the handicapped from discrimination in housing employment and 
other areas 
the measure was approved 28 to 17 with some aldermen saying they 
had changed their minds since the ordinance was last defeated while 
others said they hadnt changed their minds but switched their vote 
to reflect their constituents views 
alderman bernard stone said his north side ward supports the 
human rights ordinance but he said he still believes homosexuality 
is an abomination 
with a special mayoral primary election coming up in february 
some aldermen were under pressure to abandon previous opposition so 
the mayoral candidates they support would not lose the votes of 
homosexuals 
sawyer himself had voted against the ordinance when he was an 
alderman in 1986 but like all the major mayoral candidates now 
supports the ordinance

a homeless activist charged with trespassing may 
not use a choice of evils argument to defend her illegal 
occupation of a vacant federal house last august a judge ruled 
wednesday 
denver county judge raymond satter denied dorothy kings motion 
to use the defense saying he was unconvinced it was applicable to 
her case 
had the defense been allowed a jury could have acquitted king of 
the trespassing charge if it found she committed the crime to 
prevent a greater evil in this case the lack of shelter for the 
homeless 
after satter denied the motion jury selection began opening 
arguments were expected to begin thursday morning a spokeswoman for 
satters court said 
king 36 faces the misdemeanor trespassing charge for taking a 
group of women and children from the shelter she operated to a 
vacant house owned by the federal department of housing and urban 
development on aug 15 
king was arrested after refusing to leave the house the next 
day hud regional director grady maples made 55 vacant hudowned 
houses available to community groups as leased housing for the 
homeless 
the action was justified because she was trying to find housing 
for the destitute and call attention to the plight of the more than 
2000 homeless people in denver her attorneys diana degette and

dalife and 24yearold angelo fico ansa reported two other men in

massachusetts gov michael s dukakis is going 
to court to try to block the restart of the pilgrim nuclear power 
plant and promises more legal fights if federal regulators issue a 
lowpower license for the seabrook plant in neighboring new 
hampshire 
the nuclear regulatory commission in unanimous votes wednesday 
cleared the way for the 57 billion seabrook reactor to receive a 
longsought lowpower testing permit perhaps within several weeks 
and ruled that the pilgrim plant in plymouth mass can slowly 
begin operations after a shutdown of nearly three years 
in a related development nrc chairman lando w zech jr said the 
commission will not rule until next year on whether the state and 
local governments in new york have legal standing in the licensing 
procedure for the idled shoreham nuclear plant on long island under 
fire for reasons similar to those cited by critics of seabrook 
dukakis who says it is impossible to evacuate the seacoast towns 
around seabrook and argues that pilgrim should not be restarted 
without an approved evacuation plan called the commission votes 
irrational and irresponsible 
the states lawsuit filed in us circuit court of appeals just 
hours after the vote calls the nrc action on pilgrim arbitrary 
and capricious and urges an immediate injunction to halt the plant 
from getting up to 25 percent power 
zech said seabrook could get its lowpower license which permits 
testing at 5 percent power as early as jan 6 if it can set aside 
721 million the nrc said the owners must have that money on hand 
for decommissioning costs in case seabrook receives the testing 
permit but never gets a fullpower commercial license 
seabrook also cannot receive the license which it has sought for 
more than two years until the atomic safety and licensing board 
rules on a request by massachusetts officials to review alleged 
problems with the operators response during a june exercise of the 
plants emergency plans 
but seabrook officials said the commissions staff already has 
recommended that the licensing board reject the states request and 
that they expected the issue to be resolved shortly 
ted g feigenbaum vice president at new hampshire yankee 
operator of seabrook predicted lowpower testing would be under way 
next month 
the nrc also rejected an appeal by opponents to review the 
financial qualifications of seabrooks owners the plants lead 
owner public service co of new hampshire filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in january in june the projects fourth largest 
shareholder the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric co 
withdrew from the project and halted its 2 million monthly payments 
in boston dukakis said that in the case of seabrook it is 
unconscionable that the nrc continues to discuss ways to advance 
lowpower testing because it is impossible to adequately evacuate 
the area 
in new hampshire govelect judd gregg urged seabrook officials 
to hold off on nuclear tests until they are certain the reactor will 
be allowed to operate commercially 
the vote to restart the pilgrim plant which was shut down in 
april 1986 because of several management and safety problems also 
was unanimous 
zech said the commission was convinced that an estimated 35 
million in safety improvements and a sweeping management overhaul by 
boston edison co has made the 16yearold plant ready to resume 
operations 
but dukakis leads a legion of critics who point to a 1987 report 
by the federal emergency management agency which found that the 
plans to evacuate suburban residents around pilgrim were inadequate 
the plant is 40 miles south of boston 
pilgrim officials said they expected the restart to take four 
months beginning before jan 1 
todays vote is an insult to the local officials and south 
shore residents who have shown convincingly that no emergency 
evacuation plan can safely protect the public said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass the nuclear regulatory commission has again 
demonstrated its disregard for public safety

infection from being sexually tortured and three others died of a

he said the launches of discovery and atlantis on sept 29 and 
dec 2 demonstrated the united states has rebounded from the 
challenger disaster of 1986 and is ready to move forward with the 
shuttle program 
an immediate key to meeting next years schedule mccartney said 
is the resolution of the two unexpected problems that developed 
during the atlantis mission 
atlantis returned to earth with severe damage to nearly 200 of 
the 28000 thermal tiles that protect it from atmospheric reentry 
heat and when engineers inspected the crafts main engines they 
found a tiny crack in a bearing in a liquid oxygen pump 
it is believed insulation peeling off the shuttles external fuel 
tank struck the tiles during launch a national aeronautics and 
space administration team is investigating the cause but mccartney 
said it probably wont have a solution until early in the year 
weve got to find out what caused it and stop it because 
thats clearly not an acceptable condition for flying he said 
if youve got a bearing thats cracked in atlantis you can bet 
your sweet bippy were not going to fly discovery until we 
understand more about that bearing and feel good about it 
mccartney said 
he said similar cracks had been discovered after earlier flights 
and he predicted the bearing and tile problems would be resolved in 
time for discovery the next shuttle slated for flight to meet its 
scheduled feb 18 launch with a crew of five astronauts and a 
communications satellite 
a longer range key to meeting the schedule is whether the third 
shuttle columbia will be ready for a july launch date 
columbia for the most part sat on the sidelines last year while 
workers concentrated on refitting discovery and atlantis with 200 
modifications developed after the jan 28 1986 challenger 
explosion that killed seven astronauts 
weve got a lot of work to do on columbia but im encouraged 
with the way its coming along mccartney said 
it will be a hell of a horse race all the way down but theres 
no reason to believe we cant get the work done and support the 
present schedule 
heres the projected schedule 
feb 18 discovery with a tracking and data relay satellite 
april 28 atlantis to dispatch the magellan spacecraft to map 
the planet venus 
july 1 columbia on a defense department mission 
aug 10 discovery on a defense department mission 
oct 12 atlantis to release the galileo spacecraft to explore 
the planet jupiter 
nov 13 columbia to deploy a syncom communications satellite 
and to retrieve for return to earth a scientific satellite called 
ldef that was placed in orbit in 1984 
dec 11 discovery to deploy the hubble space telescope

the jumbo jet that crashed wednesday in 
scotland had a maintenance history that included an onboard fire 
cracks and corrosion it was reported 
service records filed with the federal aviation administration 
show that since 1980 the boeing 747 experienced at least 24 
mechanical difficulties severe enough to warrant notation the los 
angeles times reported in thursdays edition 
in 1980 five reports were filed including one that cited a 
crack and one that cited failure of the plane to turn when it was on 
autopilot another difficulty involved a flameout of an engine 
during cruise flight the newspaper said 
reports in 1981 and 1983 cited numerous cracks in the planes 
floor beams and a floor beam web a 1984 report detailed fractures 
in exhaust casing rails and trailing edge flaps that were locked in 
place the times said 
the cause of wednesdays crash was not determined 
the pan am 747100 tail number n739pa was delivered to pan 
american in february 1970 it was the 15th 747 built the first 747 
ever delivered to an airline also pan am entered the fleet the 
previous month said david jimenez spokesman for boeing commercial 
airplanes which builds 747s in everett wash 
the plane that crashed had about 16500 cycles with one cycle 
being a takeoff and a landing jimenez said that however is not 
considered a particularly high number of cycles for a commercial 
jetliner he said a high number is considered to be more than 
50000 he said 
by comparison the aloha airlines boeing 737 that lost part of 
its fuselage during a flight over hawaii last april had more than 
89000 cycles a factor that was investigated in determining whether 
metal fatigue caused part of the fuselage to rip away 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said the plane that crashed was 
taken out of service between april 11 1987 and sept 27 1987 for 
substantial modification work and any structural deficiencies 
observed earlier would have been corrected then 
service difficulty reports filed in 1987 when the plane was out 
of service detailed corrosion and cracks the largest found near 
the upper part of the fuselage bulkhead measured 163 inches the 
times said a 22inch crack was found in a splice plate a joint 
area between metal parts the times said moderatetosevere 
corrosion also was found on those splice plates the times said 
other service difficulties cited in 1987 include a sheared nose 
gear bolt a missing pylon panel two instances of smoke in the 
passenger cabin and fire spewing from an engine pylon the newspaper 
said 
problems were reported after the plane was returned to service 
in october 1987 maintenance personnel responding to a boeing 
bulletin found severe corrosion at the rear bulkhead of the aircraft 
and severe corrosion on a portion of its fuselage the newspaper 
said 
a report in 1988 noted that a leading edge slat fell off the 
plane during takeoff from pakistan the newspaper said 
another boeing spokesman paul fang said the manufacturer would 
not release service records on any plane because once the 
airplanes are out of here theyre not our property anymore 
pan am spokesman jeff kriendler declined immediate comment on the 
report about the planes maintenance record 
pan am said in new york that the jetliner was part of the civil 
reserve air fleet a program to provide planes to the government in 
the event of national emergency 
fang later confirmed the plane was converted by boeing in 
wichita kan in 1987 to make it cargocapable in 48 hours for the 
national emergency program the air force pays for the modification 
but it was not able to convince most airlines to participate fang 
said so the conversion involving adding a cargo door and 
strengthening the floor was not a common procedure 
the federal aviation administrations mike monroney aeronautical 
center in oklahoma city has only two repair and alteration forms on 
file for the pan am plane a conveyance examiner who declined to 
give her name said such reports are not required and are sometimes 
submitted voluntarily by airlines 
the records show that in 1971 a rear spar fitting assembly was 
repaired in brussels belgium according to one document 
in 1974 the plane had a turnaround modification at the 
boeing division in seattle according to the other document 
jimenez said he did not know specifically what either of those 
servicings would involve but added theyre nothing that would 
say hey im excited just normal normal stuff 
over the years pan am has bought 45 747s from boeing according 
to tom cole another boeing spokesman as of september 1988 pan am 
still had 38 747s in its fleet he said 
to date boeing has sold 883 747s of all models worldwide cole 
said of those there have been 18 recorded hull losses in 
accidents or terrorist acts four including wednesdays involved 
pan am planes jimenez said 
a pan am 747 was one of two jets involved in the worst disaster 
in commercial aviation history the march 27 1977 collision 
between two 747s at tenerife in the canary islands in which 582 
people died

a pan am jumbo jet bound for new york 
with 258 christmas travelers crashed wednesday in a scottish 
village exploding in a huge fireball destroying 40 homes and 
spreading burning wreckage for 10 miles 
no survivors were found from the boeing 747 according to john 
boyd the police chief for the area royal air force rescuers said 
the plane demolished two rows of houses there are no survivors 
from those houses 
the jetliner pan am flight 103 crashed in the heart of the 
village of lockerbie 10 miles northeast of dumfries in southern 
scotland about an hour after departing londons heathrow airport 
a heathrow spokesman said three children were on the plane and 
many of the passengers were laden with christmas gifts there were 
15 crew members among the 258 people aboard 
the aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion said 
scottish secretary malcolm rifkind because wreckage was scattered 
over a very wide area but rifkind who arrived early thursday with 
us ambassador charles price refused to speculate on the cause 
police airline and civil aviation officials also said they had 
no idea what caused the crash the only possibility immediately 
ruled out by the civil aviation authority was a collision with 
another aircraft 
the los angeles times reported in thursdays editions that the 
jet had a maintenance history that included an onboard fire cracks 
and corrosion delivered to pan am in 1970 it underwent a 
structural modification in 1987 
pan am said there was no communication with the cockpit that 
indicated any problem before the crash civil aviation officials 
said scottish air traffic controllers had been talking routinely to 
the jet until minutes before the crash when the pilot was asked a 
question and no reply was received 
shortly after that the plane disappeared from the radar screen 
at about 715 pm 215 pm est without issuing a distress 
signal said caa spokesman richard wright 
new yorks syracuse university said it confirmed that 36 of its 
students studying abroad were on the plane and that two others held 
tickets for the flight but it was uncertain if they were aboard 
there were unconfirmed reports some us servicemen were aboard 
in thursdays editions the washington post quoted a state 
department spokesman as saying six members of the departments 
diplomatic security service who were returning from beirut were 
aboard the jet state department spokesman ben justesen said he 
could not confirm the report 
the un commissioner for namibia bernt carlsson 50 of sweden 
also was a passenger said un spokesman francois giuliani on 
thursday representatives from south africa cuba and angola are to 
sign a pact that begins an independence plan for namibia 
also aboard were john mulroy the associated press director of 
international communications and his son sean and 
daughterinlaw ingrid 
two american volkswagen executives were believed on the plane 
james fuller 50 vice president in charge of volkswagen united 
states inc and lou marengo 33 the marketing director of the 
troy michbased automaker had boarding passes for the flight 
said volkswagen spokesman tom mcdonald 
it is obviously still too early to put a precise figure on the 
number of dead and injured but indications suggest there were no 
survivors from the aircraft boyd told a news conference 
the raf rescue and coordination center said two rows of houses 
about 40 in all were demolished and a rescue situation does not 
exist any more we are just recovering bodies 
boyd said five cars traveling along the a highway near lockerbie 
were hit by parts of the aircraft and no one inside them survived 
the plane was in pieces before it plunged into the village of 
2500 plowing down a street and crashing into a highway bypass 
outside lockerbie 
the blueandwhite nose section bearing the pan am clippers 
name maid of the seas landed in a muddy field near a church at the 
village of tundergarth 3 miles from lockerbie orange life jackets 
and a dinghy lay nearby 
police standing by the wreckage said several bodies were found in 
nearby woods 
witnesses to the crash described an approaching roar then a huge 
bang followed by a 300foot tower of flame burning debris rained on 
the town scattering debris and chunks of smoldering metal 
we thought it was an earthquake but it was above us said 
villager cathy gilmour we saw this great ball of fire as if it 
were stars 
helicopters ambulances and mountain rescue teams rushed to the 
village in southwest scotland traffic jams blocked access and the 
village square was sealed off for fear that a gas station hit in the 
crash could blow up 
lockerbrie resident sheila mcdonald was delivering christmas 
presents to a friends home on a hillside overlooking the town when 
she heard a horrible droning sound 
this vshaped object just seemed to come flying through the air 
it was the wings and front section of an aircraft another 
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like 
sparks she said 
it hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame 
and everything just started to shake 
police said wreckage was strewn over 10 miles 
wreckage has fallen at six different locations both within 
lockerbie and some miles outside the town there are bodies at each 
of these locations boyd told a news conference 
villager john glasgow said the whole road was ablaze two 
houses were blazing the road was completely covered with masonry 
garden gates and apparently parts of the plane but not very big 
parts there was a lot of smoking debris on fire it looked as if 
the road was burning 
there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the 
sky was actually raining fire said mike carnahan a resident who 
was a few hundred yards from the scene

it was just like liquid we have actually found an aluminum 
rivet embedded in the metal of my car carnahan told the british 
broadcasting corp television 
carnahan said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed 
because it was trailing flames when it went over the village 
flight 103 had taken off 25 minutes late and was at 31000 feet 
when contact was lost the heathrow airport authority said 
the aircraft was following its exact flight plan said jeffrey 
kriendler a spokesman for pan american world airways in new york 
nothing would suggest that weather was a factor especially 
since we believe it happened at altitude he said 
a collision with another aircraft also was ruled out 
we have rerun radar records and these indicate there were 
apparently no other aircraft in the vicinity said wright the 
civil aviation spokesman 
the jet took off from heathrow at 125 pm est and disappeared 
off radar screens an hour later said pat coffey spokesman for the 
raf rescue coordination center near edinburgh scotland 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt west germany using a boeing 
727 with passengers who continued on to new york boarding a boeing 
747 in london that plane normally connects with another 727 flying 
from new york to detroit 
conrad jacoby the pan am chief for central europe told the zdf 
television network that 48 people had boarded the flight in 
frankfurt it was not known how many of them got on the boeing 747 
air force maj mike stepp a spokesman for the defense 
department said he had no information on whether any us military 
personnel were aboard 
the airline did not release a passenger list 
at the pan am terminal at kennedy international airport in new 
york a tv monitor told people waiting for flight 103 to see 
agent at the clipper club a lounge for waiting passengers a pan 
am employee turned down the sound on a tv set when a report of the 
crash was broadcast 
another witness hotelier graham byerley said the fireball from 
the plane towered 200 to 300 feet into the air 
carnahan said all i could see was flames and fire i could 
see several houses on the skyline whose roofs were totally off and 
all you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the 
houses 
les callaghan spokesman for dumfries and galloway royal 
infirmary said the hospital treated about 12 people believed to be 
local residents hurt when the plane crashed in the village of 2500 
a pan am 727 left london early thursday for scotland carrying 
airline representatives british department of transport officials 
and a boeing technical representative to assist in work at the crash 
site said airline spokeswoman pamela hanlon in new york 
other pan am officials were en route from new york she said 
in addition national transportation safety board officials from 
washington were dispatched to the scene to help with the 
investigation 
the crashed jet was delivered to pan am in february 1970 said 
david jimenez spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes in everett 
wash it had about 16500 cycles with one cycle being a takeoff and 
a landing jimenez said that is not considered a particularly high 
number for a commercial jetliner he said 
the aloha airlines 737 that lost part of its fuselage in flight 
in april had more than 89000 cycles a factor that was investigated 
in determining whether metal fatigue caused part of the fuselage to 
rip away

convince most airlines to participate said boeing spokesman paul 
fang so the conversion involving adding a cargo door and 
strengthening the floor was not a common procedure 
a japan air lines 747 crashed aug 12 1985 killing 520 people 
it was the worst singleplane aircraft accident in history boeing 
later admitted its faulty repairs were one of the causes of the 
crash which was attributed to a crack in the rear cabin wall that 
caused a sudden loss of pressure the force of the air tore the 
planes tail apart 
the faa in 1986 ordered a modification of all boeing 747s as a 
result of that crash 
two boeing 747 jets collided on a runway in the canary islands in 
1977 killing more than 500 people 
pan am suffered a major crash involving one of its airplanes in 
july 1982 when a boeing 727 crashed after taking off from new 
orleans international airport in a thunderstorm killing 154 people

an army intelligence analyst who boasted of 
spying for greed and a turkishborn floridian were arrested for 
selling highly sensitive documents to east bloc agents over six 
years authorities said 
warrant officer james william hall iii 30 who is stationed at 
nearby fort stewart and served in west germany was arrested here 
wednesday and taken to the base detention facility said lt col 
john chapala an army spokesman in washington 
huseyin yildirim was arrested at his home in belleair beach 
fla near st petersburg and was scheduled to appear before a us 
magistrate in tampa fla for a bond hearing this afternoon 
yildirim a 60yearold turkish native was charged with 
conspiracy to commit espionage by giving agents of a foreign 
government national defense secrets said ed dutko an agent in the 
fbis savannah office if convicted yildirim could be sentenced to 
life in prison 
hall has not yet been formally charged chapala said 
hall as a member of the military can be charged with a 
similar offense by the military and courtmartialed dutko said 
yildirim is a civilian so he faces civilian charges 
chapala said he could provide nothing on the classification or 
nature of the information allegedly provided by hall or to whom it 
went 
but published reports today said the espionage inflicted serious 
damage on electronic spying efforts in europe although the damage 
was still being assessed 
halls home in richmond hill and yildirims home were searched 
wednesday by fbi and army intelligence officers the fbi said 
the arrests followed a meeting at a savannah hotel tuesday night 
between hall and an fbi agent posing as a soviet intelligence 
officer according to an affidavit fbi agent charles b youmans jr 
filed wednesday with us magistrate gr smith here 
hall told the unidentified agent that he had been passing 
highly sensitive signal intelligence documents to both the soviets 
and the east german intelligence services since late 1982 the 
affidavit said 
hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information 
he had passed and admitted his motivation to be greed the 
document said it did not give details on the information 
hall said yildirim participated in the copying of the documents 
and acted as the army mans courier and paymaster until last 
january the affidavit said the affidavit said hall was paid in 
us and german currency but did not say how much he made 
hall also told the undercover agent that yildirim contacted him 
after his transfer to fort stewart and met with him in savannah the 
document said 
hall has spent most of his army career as a signals 
intelligenceelectronics warfare analyst working on intercepted 
radio traffic telephone conversations and coded messages chapala 
said 
the new york city native joined the army in 1976 the first of 
three european assignments came the following year when he was 
assigned to an army security agency company in schneeberg west 
germany chapala said 
in 1981 hall went to west berlin where he again worked in a 
signals intelligence assignment 
hall returned to the united states in 1985 and was assigned to a 
military intelligence group at fort monmouth nj in 1986 he 
returned to west germany serving in a military intelligence 
battalion in frankfurt 
he was sent back to the united states in may 1987 and was 
assigned to fort stewart last july 
chapala said there was no indication of any connection between 
halls arrest and another military spy case last summer involving 
nato secrets 
a former us army sergeant clyde lee conrad was arrested in 
that case in west germany last august and two hungarianborn 
brothers were sentenced to 18 months in prison in october in sweden 
for relaying nato information to hungary investigators said conrad 
reported to a hungarian spymaster living in vienna austria

doctors giving patients high doses of 
cancerfighting cells taken from their tumors have turned back 
lethal skin cancer at a rate nearly four times greater than by using 
chemotherapy scientists reported today 
the work is the latest development in a new strategy of revving 
up the bodys own weapons to stop cancer however experts say this 
approach is still highly experimental and no one knows whether it 
will turn out to be a practical way to fight disease 
only one of the 20 patients treated has had a lasting remission 
after more than a year but doctors were encouraged because most of 
the patients had at least partial responses 
the study was directed by dr steven a rosenberg who has 
developed the strategy known as adoptive immunotherapy at the 
national cancer institute in earlier attempts he used a natural 
chemical called interleukin2 to prime cancerfighting cells taken 
from the blood these cells were then turned loose inside the body 
to hunt for cancer 
his latest effort described in todays new england journal of 
medicine is a refinement of that approach instead of using cells 
from the bloodstream he drew killing cells from patients own 
tumors multiplied them and injected them back 
we are finally zeroing in on the important cells and he is 
getting better numbers to indicate that the strategy is the right 
one said dr malcolm s mitchell of the university of southern 
california 
rosenberg said the new approach used so far on patients with the 
skin cancer melanoma is more potent and less toxic than his earlier 
treatment 
the first treatment which we have now used in over 400 
patients is a first step he said now we are seeing an 
improvement upon it hopefully there will be improvements beyond 
this 
in experimental use they found that the latest approach shrank 
the tumors of 55 percent of advanced melanoma patients ordinary 
chemotherapy produces a response in about 20 percent of such 
patients 
this is very exciting commented dr michael atkins of new 
england medical center i hope it will give us clues as to where 
to go next but it shouldnt be considered applicable to the general 
patient population 
other experts were also cautious about the new therapy 
it offers potentially a more specific approach said dr 
richard fisher of loyola university medical center in chicago 
whether that will turn out to be better is unknown although in 
his early data he has an impressive number of responses 
the treatment is based on a variety of cancerkilling cells 
known as tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes that are taken from the 
patients own cancer 
they have unique specificity for the tumor from which they are 
derived said rosenberg presumably they are part of the host 
defense against the tumor but there are not enough of them 
after being grown outside the body in interleukin2 the 
tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes are returned to the patient along 
with extra doses of interleukin2 and a chemotherapy drug 
after one treatment melanoma shrank in nine of 15 patients who 
had never received interleukin2 they also regressed in two of five 
patients who had failed earlier treatment with interleukin2 
the tumors that shrank had spread to other parts of the body 
including the lungs liver and bones the cancer disappeared 
completely in one 56yearold man who remains cancer free about 15 
months after the treatment ended 
until now using interleukin2 alone or combining this substance 
with treated blood cells has produced a response in about 
onequarter of melanoma patients 
the latest approach rosenberg said is giving the highest 
response rate im aware of in patients with melanoma but its only 
20 patients so its got to be considered very preliminary 
the latest approach was less toxic because it required smaller 
doses of interleukin2 among the dangerous effects of the substance 
are heart attacks severe confusion fluid retention low blood 
pressure kidney impairment and liver congestion

prime minister felipe gonzalez has agreed to 
some demands for higher wages and pensions made by labor unions 
whose general strike brought the country to a standstill last week 
in a speech to parliament on wednesday the 46yearold socialist 
a former labor lawyer pledged to increase wages of civil 
servants and raise the lowest pensions to the legal mininum wage 
the equivalent of 394 a month he also said he would withdraw a 
controversial youth employment program 
but gonzalez rejected union demands that the government broaden 
availability of unemployment insurance from 30 percent to 48 percent 
of the 27 million jobless and recognize civil servants right to 
enter collective bargaining 
he also ruled out calling early elections which now must be held 
by june 1990 
in a dec 14 general strike 78 million of the countrys 118 
workers stayed off the job to call for a bigger share in the 
countrys booming economy 
the strike called by the socialist general workers union and the 
communist workers commissions brought nearly all industrial 
commercial and labor activity to a halt 
gonzalez offered to meet today with union leaders and the head of 
the countrys key business organization after acknowledging before 
the 350seat lower house that the strike represented political 
failure for his government 
antonio gutierrez head of the workers commissions said 
wednesday he did not plan to join the meeting with the spanish 
employers organization president jose maria cuevas but he said he

a gene found to be key to schizophrenia 
medication will trigger an avalanche of research that could 
improve treatment for psychosis parkinsons disease and other brain 
ailments a scientist says 
scientists worldwide have really been poised to take advantage 
of this development which could provide insights into the bodys 
potential role in mental illness said kenneth l davis chairman of 
the psychiatry department at the mount sinai school of medicine in 
new york 
the results could include improved treatments for diseases that 
include psychosis which is a loss of touch with reality seen in 
schizophrenia and sometimes in depression manicdepression and 
other disorders he said 
it also could lead to better treatment of parkinsons disease 
which is often characterized by tremors and rigidity huntingtons 
disease which hinders movement and intellectual abilities and 
tourette syndrome which includes jerky movements and vocal 
mannerisms davis and other researchers said 
davis was responding to a report in todays issue of the british 
journal nature 
in the article researchers said they had isolated the gene that 
acts as a blueprint for a protein called the d2 dopamine receptor 
which is made by brain cells the receptor which sits on the 
surface of the cells is where antipsychosis drugs exert their 
effects on the brain 
normally the receptors role is to respond when adjacent brain 
cells secrete a substance called dopamine allowing brain cells to 
communicate 
the defining of one receptor in the past has led to discovery of 
a related family of them davis said if a family of dopamine 
receptors is found scientists may be able to design drugs that 
affect only the receptors linked to disease and avoid side effects 
of current medications he said 
side effects of current antipsychosis medications for example 
include tardive dyskinesia a syndrome of involuntary movements of 
the mouth tongue limbs or trunk 
in the study researchers said they identified the receptor gene 
in rats defined its chemical makeup and made functioning copies of 
it since then they also have isolated and partially defined the 
human receptor gene olivier civelli said in a telephone interview 
the researcher reports the work in nature with james bunzow and 
others at the oregon health sciences university in portland and 
with researchers at the veterans administration medical center in 
portland and the oregon regional primate center in beaverton 
other scientists called the discovery an important boost for 
research into the dopamine receptor 
davis predicted an avalanche of research by investigators 
weve all been waiting for it he said 
this is an important and essentially fundamental step in 
helping scientists understand how antipsychotic drugs work and 
thereby indirectly understand what may be the biological mechanism 
underlying psychotic disorders 
scientists also may be able to learn about the mechanisms that 
turn the receptor gene on and off which may shed light on 
schizophrenia he said 
in addition focusing on the receptor gene may help scientists 
study the inheritance of a tendency toward schizophrenia and perhaps 
other diseases said arnold friedhoff psychiatry professor at the 
new york university medical center that in turn could lead to 
better matching of patients to proper medications he said 
he said other followup studies could help scientists understand 
the overall dopamine communication network among brain cells which 
is undoubtedly going to provide extremely important new insights 
into its role in regulating mental processes 
since it is the target of drugs that ease psychosis caused by a 
wide range of conditions it must have a regulatory role in 
keeping things on track he said 
the more we understand about its function the more likely it 
is well be able to not only treat mental illness but in the long 
run prevent it friedhoff said

home for the holidays for the nations growing legions of 
homeless could be under a bridge in oklahoma city a cardboard box 
in philadelphia or the streets in the nations capital for those 
with no bed of their own 
in new york city the estimated number of homeless has increased 
25 percent during the last year with the total estimated between 
60000 and 90000 in portland ore the number rose 10 to 20 
percent each year this decade 
the need doesnt stop with christmas said salvation army 
major raymond l peacock in seattle where he said there has been a 
15 percent increase this year in the number of people seeking 
assistance 
a big holiday celebration in a heated tent is planned for the 
homeless in front of the us capitol on christmas eve featuring 
entertainers athletes gifts for the children and a special feast 
but the lack of beds is especially acute in washington dc 
where despite the estimated 10000 to 15000 people living in the 
streets there are only about 2500 shelter beds said maria 
foscarinis an attorney for the national coalition for the homeless 
the coalition estimates there are as many as 3 million homeless 
nationwide 
there are some communities who use our inability to count the 
homeless as an excuse not to provide services said mary orton 
executive director of central arizona shelter services in phoenix 
where estimates range from 6000 to 9000 
the simple fact is regardless of the exact number of people 
they are there and they do need help she said 
one hard hit city is oklahoma city where the number is estimated 
at 17000 according to christine byrd regional director of the 
national coalition she said a december report from a governors 
task force put the total for the state at 35000 
ms byrd said 48 percent are families and that is blamed on 
oklahomas central location she said poor families traveling 
between the west and east coasts run out of gas or have car trouble 
there 
ms byrd said homelessness in rural areas is increasing because 
of farm foreclosures bank failures depressed oil and farm 
economies neither the state or the city provides any aid to the 
homeless 
people dont want to accept a homeless problem exits because 
it is a harsh reality that could happen to them too said ms 
byrd who works at the jesus house shelter which holds 350 people 
per night the rest of those without shelter huddle in groups under 
bridges sleep on sidewalks or stay in abandoned buildings or cars 
she said 
baloney joes a portland shelter for homeless men is so full 
were stacking people on top of each other said gene ediger of 
the burnside community council a private agency for the homeless 
he said the number of homeless has gone up 10 to 20 percent each 
year this decade 
theres been a steady increase of about 25 percent a year that 
hasnt changed in six years said keith summa of the coalition for 
the homeless in new york city 
in philadelphia the city has started daily cleanups of a subway 
concourse where homeless people cart cardboard boxes mattresses and 
blankets around thanksgiving 
mayor w wilson goode said the cleanup was not an eviction 
police have not stopped homeless people from returning 
a few blocks away a group of homeless people and supporters 
monday erected a disenchanted village of cardboard boxes outside 
the federal courthouse where they said they would stay for the 
holidays 
christmas is a time of enchantment but not when youre 
homeless said sister mary scullion who runs the women of hope 
residence for mentally ill homeless women 
but a connecticut waitress barbara fox has seen to it that 
homeless children there at least get some gifts she got the names 
and wish lists of 1200 homeless children from a state agency 
and tied wish cards to christmas trees in her employers saybrook 
fish house restaurants in five cities 
within two weeks the wishes were gone some customers grabbing 
handfuls of them and soon replaced by vanloads of wrapped 
packages fox said

unexpected thunder and fire shattering 
the winter night were the first vivid impressions of some of the 
2500 inhabitants of the village where pan am flight 103 crashed 
there was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the 
sky was actually raining fire it was just like liquid said mike 
carnahan who was a few hundred yards from wreckage that came down 
wednesday 
all 258 people aboard the boeing 747 were killed and authorities 
said there were no survivors in several houses and cars hit by the 
wreckage 
witnesses said the plane hit a gasoline station in lockerbie 
all i could see was flames and fire carnahan told british 
broadcasting corp television i could see several houses on the 
skyline whose roofs were totally off and all you could see was 
flaming timbers and what was left of the houses 
reporter ian fisher of border tv said the south side of the 
town near the main road has been wiped out houses are gutted 
sheila mcdonald who was delivering christmas presents to a 
friends home on a hillside overlooking lockerbie told reporters 
she heard a horrible droning sound 
this vshaped object just seemed to come flying through the 
air it was the wings and front section of an aircraft another 
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like 
sparks it hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame 
and everything just started to shake 
marian peel told independent radio news i pulled into the 
garage and was getting petrol gasoline when i heard a rumble that 
sounded like thunder it just got louder and louder and louder 
there was a great big crash and a big burst of fire within 
seconds there was debris flying all over the place i just left the 
car and ran like hell i didnt see the plane hit the ground because 
the garage has a canopy and it was the other side of the canopy 
there was a lot of fire about and a lot of debris and flames 
flying all over the place the tarmac was on fire i ran from the 
car and there were flames all round the tires 
bbc tv reporter craig anderson said he saw up to eight houses 
demolished and others on fire 
i saw a massive crater 20 feet deep and 100 feet long but 
nowhere have i seen any wreckage from the plane more than about 
three feet across he said 
he said choking smoke and fumes continued to billow through the 
town several hours after the crash 
hotelier graham byerley told the bbc we initially heard a 
rumbling over the hotel we thought the roof was falling in and 
then we heard a tremendous shudder on the ground as though it were 
an earthquake and then we saw sparks and this enormous flame going 
200 or 300 feet into the air 
rescue helicopters flew overhead as firefighters fought the 
flames 
police and rescue vehicles were held up by traffic as roads 
leading to the site became jammed with motorists trying to get a 
glimpse of the disaster 
theres a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but 
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over 
toward the scene of the crash carnahan said 
he said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed 
because it was trailing flames when it went over the village

the united nations considered carlsson the chief official of 
namibia and he planned to guide the transition to an independent 
government following signing of the accords allowing for transition

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said today that moscow does not support local marxist 
rebels and will not seek to drive a wedge between manila and the 
united states 
shevardnadze the highestranking soviet official ever to visit 
this former us colony also invited president corazon aquino to 
the soviet union before departing for north korea after a 24hour 
stay 
mrs aquino said a date for her trip would be set after foreign 
secretary raul manglapus visits moscow next year 
during a luncheon meeting with mrs aquino shevardnadze said he 
had come to the philippines to dispel the myth of a soviet 
military buildup in asia and to stress the need for negotiations 
to sort out our differences 
we have to take a first step toward building new relationships 
in the asiapacific region he said 
shevardnadze who arrived wednesday from japan urged a 
conference of asian foreign ministers to reduce tensions in the 
region 
we have absolutely no intention of trying to drive a wedge 
between the philippines and its traditional allies shevardnadze 
added in a reference to the united states 
during his talks shevardnadze avoided detailed discussions on 
us military bases in the philippines in october soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev offered to withdraw kremlin forces from vietnam 
if the americans close their six bases in this country 
shevardnadze told reporters at a departure news conference that 
moscows view of the us bases is negative but of course what 
happens to the bases is entirely for the government and people of 
the philippines to decide 
in october the united states and the philippines signed an 
agreement allowing washington to use subic bay naval base clark air 
base and four smaller installations until 1991 in return for 962 
million in economic and military aid over two years 
mrs aquinos spokesman teodoro benigno said shevardnadze told 
the president the soviets would never interfere in internal 
philippine affairs 
the soviet union has never supported nor has any intention of 
supporting the rebels benigno quoted shevardnadze as saying 
later the soviet official told reporters i would like to state 
in all responsibility that the soviet union is not giving and will 
never give support to any insurgent group 
the maoist communist party of the philippines has been waging a 
nearly 20yearold insurgency to establish a marxist state 
filipino and western sources say there is no evidence of soviet 
support to the rebels but that filipino communists have been making 
overtures to moscow and other communist countries 
filipino officials praised the shevardnadze visit and said it 
marked a first step in overcoming what manglapus called biases 
acquired in the early years of the cold war 
the philippines which gained independence from the united states 
in 1946 has been among the slowest noncommunist southeast asian 
nations to pursue closer ties with the soviet union 
a joint statement said the two sides agreed to expand trade from 
404 million last year to 200 million a year in the future

the government has signed a 10year 
agreement with one of worlds biggest art collectors to bring 
paintings by el greco goya and velazquez home for display 
the loan agreement with baron hans heinrich thyssenbornemisza 
will bring 787 of the works in his priceless collection of classic 
and modern art to spain boosting spain to the rank of one of the 
worlds leading art centers 
the acquisition which spanish officials hope will become 
permament also includes works by holbein franz hals tintoretto 
ghirlandaio canaletto max beckmann van gogh cezanne monet and 
degas 
the agreement signed tuesday by the baron and culture minister 
jorge semprun caps years of negotiations and represents a success 
for spain over such rival bidders as west germany britain and 
switzerland and the private getty foundation in malibu calif 
the baron said his desire to have as many people as possible see 
his collection was probably the most important motive in his 
decision to bring the works temporarily to spain 
in doing 10 years we can see how it works and take a 
decision the baron said referring to the ultimate destination of 
his collection he said the final decision would be up to him his 
wife and his four children 
bringing the collection to spain reportedly is due in large part 
to the influence of carmen tita cervera a former miss spain and 
the barons fifth wife and to the duke of badajoz luis 
gomezacebo the husband of king juan carlos sister pilar 
the barons collection of between 1200 and 1600 works rivaled 
only by that of queen elizabeth ii as the most impressive private 
gathering has been valued at 2 billion that figure is relatively 
meaningless however because of the rapidly escalating prices for 
in the international art market for both old masters and modern 
paintings 
most of the paintings to be loaned to spain will hang in madrids 
prado museum while others mostly of a religious nature will hang 
in the pedralbes monastery in barcelona 
both sites will be renovated to display the collection now at 
the barons villa favorita residence in lugano switzerland 
mrs thyssenbornemizsa said spanish architects rafael moneo 
head of harvard universitys school of architecture and ricardo 
bofill would draw up a design 
the accord calls for the establishment of a private thyssen 
foundation with initial funding by the government of 80 million and 
annual 5 million compensation payments for the loan of the artworks 
the paintings will be available for public viewing within 18 
months the government estimates 1 million visitors will see them a 
year 
the agreement says the pieces on loan to spain can travel freely 
to other countries and museums without prior authorization from 
spanish authorities 
the collection was started by baron heinrich thyssenbornemisza 
the german steel magnate and father of the present baron who became 
a swiss citizen in 1950

in an apparent bid to create a younger 
more reformminded leadership gen wojciech jaruzelski has 
overhauled the ruling politburo and offered the clearest indication 
yet that solidarity may be reinstated 
at wednesdays meeting of the communist partys governing central 
committee prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski announced that the 
party would reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed trade union 
federation 
we are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the future 
model of the trade union movement different from the present 
together with the opzz official union movement and moderate 
leaders of former solidarity he said 
reached today at his home in gdansk solidarity leader lech 
walesa called rakowskis remarks significant but said direct talks 
with the government were needed to make sure the authorities are 
ready to legalize the union movement 
it is a pretty farreaching statement and we hope we are 
talking about the same thing walesa said by telephone to see 
if it is we will still have to conduct direct talks we believe it 
is the point but we want it formulated in a clearer manner 
it is a signal but we are saying once again that without 
solidarity without relegalizing solidarity there is no possibility 
of agreement walesa said the movement was crushed by a 1981 
military crackdown and outlawed the following year 
rakowski told committee members wednesday to return to local 
party units and poll members on the subject of solidarity and on 
walesa 
he told them to return to warsaw in midjanuary with their 
answers at the 230member bodys next session your answer 
will decide about what we will do and what we do will decide the 
future of socialism in poland 
in the leadership shakeup jaruzelski removed six hardliners and 
veteran members from the politburo in favor of younger pragmatists 
among those promoted to full membership was stanislaw ciosek a 
liberal who has been active in conducting talks with walesa ciosek 
was also given an important additional post of full party secretary 
where he was expected to assume responsibility for propaganda 
in all eight new politburo members were appointed increasing 
the politburos size from 15 to 17 members four members of the 
secretariat responsible for daytoday operations of the party 
were replaced by new blood 
the twoday meeting was capped by jaruzelskis plea to the 
opposition to accept the partys offer for talks he said it appears 
walesa can be trusted to keep a moderate course 
referring to the oppositions formation on sunday of a citizens 
committee intended to gather mainstream antigovernment forces in 
one structure under walesas leadership jaruzelski said 
one can freely create governments in exile or shadow cabinets 
but the real reconcilation of poles is the cause of supreme 
importance our party opts for it decisively and honestly 
the newly named secretariat members were ciosek zygmunt 
czarzasty the slupsk province party chief who developed a 
reputation as a strong advocate of pragmatic reforms leszek miller 
a young party chief from skierniewice province and marian stepien 
a highranking party ideologist 
among those ousted from the politburo was zbigniew messner 
rakowskis predecessor as prime minister who resigned in a barrage 
of criticism of his handling of the economy 
poland is in the throes of an economic crisis and strikes last 
summer calling for the solidaritys reinstatement only aggravated 
the situation 
in an attempt to make the centrally planned economy more 
marketoriented the government raised prices by more than 40 
percent early this year wages have not kept up 
new politburo members were ciosek gabriela rebisz kazimierz 
cypryniak iwona lubowska zdzislaw swiatek viktor pyrkosz janusz 
reykowski and zbigniew michalek 
jaruzelski had said personnel changes were necessary for the 
success of party reforms at the opening of the meeting tuesday he 
said the party should be open to unconventional compromises with the 
opposition but it must remain polands key political force

bomb exploded that had been put aboard by a terrorist said david 
kyd chief public relations officer for the organization 
sabotage is the most likely explanation he said but of 
course we have to find the black boxes that may or may not give us 
additional clues and the fuselage of the aircraft has to be examined 
for indications whether there was an explosion on the inside for 
instance in the cargo hold 
he said the sudden loss of contact with the plane and because the 
jumbo is known to be very rugged it would seem to us that the most 
likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard 
kyd said structural problems were unlikely to have been involved 
in wednesdays crash he noted that previous accidents such as in 
the case of the illfated japanese jal airliner in 1985 have 
demonstrated that 747s can stay aloft for a while even with serious 
damage to the structure 
a bulkhead blew out in the japanese crash and they lost the 
tail and a rudder but the aircraft was able to continue flying for 
over 20 minutes just on the strength of the engines and the pilots 
skill to find some way of getting it down ultimately they crashed 
into the mountains because they were unable to make it to an 
emergency base 
authorities said all 258 people aboard flight 103 from london to 
new york were killed as the 747 plunged in pieces into a scottish 
village the death toll on the ground was not yet known

an agreement to dismiss charges against 13 
civil rights leaders who tried to halt a city council meeting is a 
step toward resolving a struggle with toledo over its treatment of 
minorities some black leaders say 
but if the city does not negotiate in good faith other civil 
rights leaders are warning of more civil disobedience 
the city of toledo and its government must learn to consult 
with us prior to action or there will be continual problems with the 
black community said jb simmons a lawyer for the defendants 
mayor donna owens called the settlement a strong statement that 
government will not tolerate people taking over government 
the settlement came wednesday as jury selection for five of the 
13 was to resume in municipal court 
the city reduced the charges against the 13 from obstructing 
official business charge to failure to disperse resisting arrest 
charges against two defendants also were dismissed 
the defendants who included 12 ministers pleaded no contest 
visiting judge john patterson dismissed the case and ordered their 
records expunged 
prosecutor john madigan said he was not pressured by city 
officials to reach a compromise 
sometimes it takes a court trial to figure out this isnt the 
way to go he said 
the 13 were arrested for trying to stop a june 28 city council 
meeting they were protesting the firing of a black community 
development official the reassignment of another black the 
retirement of a third and the resignation of a fourth because of 
alleged mismanagement of the housing program 
defendant leroy williams president of the toledo chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people said the 
agreement was not a retreat 
it is a step forward and another phase in resolving the larger 
picture said williams 
but another defendant the rev floyd rose a leader of a group 
of black ministers known as the interdenominational ministerial 
alliance had doubts about the settlement 
im not sure the community will understand now why we did what 
we did he said 
simmons said city officials agreed to meet with the ministers by 
midjanuary to try and resolve differences he said the defendants 
agreed to the settlement because it was in the best interest of the 
community 
the mayor said she has been meeting privately with civil rights 
leaders to discuss issues facing blacks 
ms owens who said she had no part in the plea agreement 
insisted that the city would not be threatened by future acts of 
civil disobedience 
i look at it the agreement as a strong statement that 
government will not tolerate people taking over government that 
there are laws and those laws are to be respected by everybody 
ms owens said 
the dispute began over the citys handling of problems in its 
community development department the departments management 
shuffle followed an investigation by the us department of housing 
and urban development that said the citys housing rehabilitation 
program was deficient 
the civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were 
reprimanded without being consulted about the problems they also 
asked for a hearing into the allegations 
city officials rejected their requests

church leaders who believe a dallas judge has been 
wrongly criticized for letting his antihomosexual views influence 
his sentencing have pitted themselves against other religious groups 
calling for his ouster 
state district judge jack hampton has already been the subject of 
rallies from angry opponents following his disclosure that he gave a 
lighter sentence to a murderer partly because his two victims were 
homosexuals 
however at least seven pastors have agreed to participate in a 
rally tonight in support of hampton said the rev don skelton 
pastor at fountain of the living word he said he expects to draw 
about 100 to 150 people 
theyre in favor of the stand the judge has taken to sodomy 
skelton said were very much opposed to sodomy its against 
texas law for one thing and gods law for another thing 
on wednesday a coalition of other church leaders some with 
large gay congregations called on other religious leaders judges 
and lawyers to join them in publicly criticizing hampton 
we deplore the mentality recently expressed by judge jack 
hampton in the press which suggest that all human beings are not of 
equal value and are not entitled to equal protection under the 
law said the rev howard tyas pastor of bethany presbyterian 
church reading from the groups statement at a news conference 
the church leaders who criticized hampton said the issue was not 
homosexuality or sodomy but justice 
every person has a right to equal justice under the law said 
the rev lou arceneaux pastor at holy trinity catholic church 
hamptons comments in an interview last week in the dallas times 
herald prompted the gay community and equal rights activists to seek 
his removal from the bench on tuesday elected officials including 
state treasurer ann richards and us sen edward kennedy dmass 
joined protesters in criticizing hampton 
hampton told the newspaper that he sentenced richard lee 
bednarski 18 to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life 
sentence on nov 28 in part because the two men bednarski was 
convicted of killing were homosexuals 
the judge also referred to the two victims as queers

a letter to santa claus from a 10yearold boy 
who wanted an electric wheelchair for his mother has elicited 
christmas greetings and gifts from around the world including one 
brandnew wheelchair 
the christmas spirit is incredible said denise reusche a 
clerk at the us postal service in palm springs in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
the postal service in the desert resort 110 miles east of here 
annually processes about 1000 letters to santa each year normally 
workers send a letter in return 
but when ms reusche saw john f wonggouns letter from nearby 
banning this year she decided to do something more for the boy who 
along with his mother was partially disabled in a 1981 traffic 
accident 
his letter read the only gift i would like is an elecric 
wheelchair for my mom she cant walk and her hands are too weak for 
the one welfair sic gave her 2 years ago i would love to see her 
outside without help and watch me play can you help me with my 
wish 
ms reusche and her fellow workers contacted fortress scientific 
co of palm springs a wheelchair manufacturer and it donated a 
threewheeled motorized wheelchair for johns mother victoria 
coslett 39 
then the workers bought a bunch of gifts for john food for 
christmas dinner and established a wheelchair maintenance fund they 
delivered the gifts on monday 
stories about johns letter were distributed worldwide by the 
associated press 
ms reusche said in addition to the newspaper stories the postal 
workers were featured on several television and radio interviews 
we had a call from new zealand for a radio interview a 
sunnyvale man is sending a letter of encouragement a train set and 
a gift for the mom because he had the same background a lady in 
connecticut said a group of women was getting together to do 
something for john after christmas was over she said

john was partially brain damaged and suffers recurring seizures and 
memory lapses he also has juvenile arthritis 
ms coslett in a telephone interview said she was shocked by 
the reaction to her sons letter 
i couldnt speak all i could do was sit there and cry hes 
done so many things for me and for the kids out here in the 
apartment complex if he earns money here and there hell go out 
and buy a toy for one of the kids hes never selfish she said

the second earthquake in alaska in 27 hours 
rocked two fishing villages early today but there were no reports 
of damage or injuries from the strong temblor officials said 
the tremor registered about 58 on the richter scale at 142 am 
ast and was centered beneath the ocean 20 miles northeast of 
unalaska in the aleutian islands said alec medbery of the alaska 
tsunami warning center 
medbery said the quake jolted unalaska and neighboring dutch 
harbor a major base for fishing vessels but caused no damage no 
other settlements were close enough to the epicenter to feel the 
tremor he added 
late tuesday a quake registering 43 was centered beneath kodiak 
island about 600 miles away 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which each 
increase of one number reflects a tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage and 6 can be severe the quake that devastated san francisco 
in 1906 has been estimated at 83

hardly a place in this market town 
escaped the crash of pan am flight 103 
the jumbo jets metal skin and body lay scattered on streets and 
sidewalks and houses bore smoldering testimony to the force of the 
explosion when the aircraft slammed in pieces into the village 
wednesday night 
in the center of this town of 2500 residents a complete 
aircraft engine lay embedded in a street early today 
windows in homes and shops were smashed and searchers crunched 
over the broken glass and crumpled bits of metal 
a row of white houses only their gabled ends and walls still 
standing smoldered in the early morning darkness 
clouds of smoke rose from a huge crater gouged by a chunk of the 
crashing plane near the highway at one end of town a large piece of 
fuselage smoldered in the fourlane road alongside it was a wrecked 
car almost flattened one of five hit by the plane 
townspeople and rescue workers combed the area for bodies and 
carried the victims into a makeshift mortuary in the town hall 
residents anxious for news about friends and relatives were allowed 
inside the sandstone building to check the lists of survivors from 
the most badlyaffected streets 
earlier stunned villagers stood in small knots watching the 
police firefighters soldiers and ambulances go back and forth 
rescue workers flinched as a chimney suddenly crashed to the ground 
it seems almost incongruous that in this quiet and peaceful 
place this awful thing has happened said donald dewar the 
opposition labor partys spokesman on scottish affairs 
survivors were being housed with friends in the tightlyknit 
community and the town hall noticeboard was serving as a bulletin 
board for the whereabouts of the evacuees 
the worst thing is the uncertainty said a woman shopkeeper 
who would not give her name we know there were a lot of people on 
the plane but where are the local people 
this a close community and we still just dont know who might 
be alive or dead 
scott maxwell and a neighbor had rushed to a garage devastated by 
the blast and helped injured people get clear of the scene with 
telephones knocked out he used the radio in his van to call 
emergency services and then helped clear debris from the roads to 
enable emergency vehicles to get through 
bungalows in sherwood crescent and sherwood park appeared to have 
caught the full force of the crash and police said no one inside 
the struck houses had survived 
broken roof tiles and pieces of metal probably from the 
aircraft lay everywhere and houses that were not hit were evacuated 
in case of gas leaks 
three miles east of lockerbie the cockpit of the aircraft lay 
almost intact on banks hill it was about 50 feet from the road near 
a church with bodies scattered nearby 
barely 15 miles from the english border lockerbie is set in the 
middle of annandale the narrow valley of the annan river 
the quarry near lockerbie is celebrated among fossil hunters for 
footprints of dinosaurs 
the villages people manufacture cheese and cream and woollen 
goods and hold popular livestock fairs

dr curt paul richter credited with discovering 
the biorhythms that regulate sleep and other basic body functions 
died of natural causes at age 94 
richter a professor emeritus of psychobiology at johns hopkins 
medical institutions died wednesday at a retirement community here 
said hopkins spokesman phil kibak 
richter demonstrated during more than 50 years of research on 
animals and humans that some behavior is driven by internal 
mechanisms operating in predictable cycles said dr paul mchugh 
director of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at 
johns hopkins university school of medicine 
richter determined that such drives as hunger sleep thirst and 
the need for particular nutrients were part of the bodys mechanisms 
and he discerned that those mechanisms were driven by portions of 
the brain 
his work evolved into the study of biorhythms or the cyclical 
nature of the body in controlling basic body functions such as 
sleep 
before richters work everyone agreed that the body was driven 
by instincts but lacked a sense of how to investigate the body in 
that regard mchugh said 
richters 1927 paper on animal behavior and the internal 
mechanisms that drive their behavior is widely regarded as the 
primer that spurred modern research on how behavior affects health 
richter is also credited with discovering that behavior will 
automatically seek to keep the body nutritionally balanced 
in a series of what became known as the cafeteria 
experiments richter deprived mice of particular nutrients such 
as potassium and salt he then set before the animals various foods 
and found that the mice ate the particular foods that offered high 
concentrations of nutrients their bodies lacked mchugh said 
he demonstrated the wisdom of the body expressed in behavior 
mchugh said 
the denver native earned an undergraduate degree in 1917 from 
harvard university and a doctorate from johns hopkins in 1921 
richter served as director of the psychobiology laboratory in the 
henry phipps psychiatric clinic of johns hopkins hospital from 1922 
until 1957 when he was appointed professor of psychobiology at 
hopkins medical institutions 
after retiring in 1960 he continued to work in his laboratory 
until this year 
he wrote more than 250 research papers and received honorary 
degrees from the university of chicago hopkins and the university 
of pennsylvania 
he also was the recipient in 1977 of the prestigious passano 
award given each year to those who make outstanding contributions 
to the advancement of medical science 
he was a great natural scientist who would get simple 
experiments out of looking at the behavior of animals and those 
simple experiments illuminated for us the biological control of the 
instincts mchugh said 
richter is survived by his wife a son and two daughters 
a memorial service was scheduled for friday

six us congressmen accused a taiwan 
company of perpetuating racial stereotypes by marketing a locally 
produced toothpaste named darkie the american institute in 
taiwan said today 
in a news release the institute said the congressmen citing the 
toothpaste as an example told taiwans authorities and business 
community that xenophobia and racism would never be tolerated 
the institute is the unofficial us representative office in 
taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations 
the statement initiated by rep john conyers jr dmich was 
issued two days after the sixmember congressional government 
operations committee left for home following a threeday visit to 
taiwan 
the other representatives were texas democrats jack brooks and 
ron coleman robert wise a democrat from west virginia edolphus 
towns a democrat from new york and donald lukens a republican 
from ohio 
darkie toothpaste is one of many examples of racism in 
consumer products in asia the statement said adding that 
governments in asian countries should stop such racial stereotypes 
if they want strong relations with the united states they 
should understand this it added 
the yellow package of the toothpaste bears the english word 
darkie and a chinese equivalent as well as a drawing of a 
grinning black minstrel 
last year after several american groups said the name was 
offensive the governments tourism bureau sent a letter to travel 
agents advising the public not to carry that brand of toothpaste 
abroad 
the manufacturer hawley and hazel says it does not plan to 
change the name because the popular toothpaste has been known to 
local users since 1937 and is not for export 
the manufacturer is a subsidiary of the hong kongbased hawley 
and hazel chemical corp partially owned by colgate palmolive co

the 35 nations at the helsinki conference 
on european security and cooperation are close to a final accord and 
should wrap up more than two years of tough bargaining with a 
meeting of foreign ministers in vienna jan 1719 diplomats said 
today 
an eastwest dispute over a proposed human rights conference in 
moscow is one of the few outstanding issues to be resolved in 
latenight bargaining by diplomats who will work through christmas 
and new years in a dash to get agreement before president reagan 
leaves office jan 20 
diplomats say the accord would be a landmark achievement breaking 
new ground in committing the soviet bloc to many new provisions on 
human rights affecting citizens rights to travel practice religion 
and communicate freely 
the conference which involves the soviet union united states 
canada and all european nations except albania also would sign a 
mandate for new eastwest talks on reducing conventional forces in 
europe 
us ambassador warren zimmermann said today that one american 
disappointment was the failure to secure the right of free 
emigration for soviet bloc citizens 
but the soviet union has announced it will adopt new laws on 
secrecy that advise citizens taking sensitive jobs that this will 
prevent them from leaving the country for a certain number of years 
after they cease that work 
britain the united states and canada are among the western 
delegations that have made the strongest demands on human rights at 
the conference which opened in november 1986 
diplomats who insisted on anonymity indicated that toplevel 
talks are going on now in western capitals to determine whether the 
west will agree to a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 
the united states and other nations have pressed for the release 
of all political prisoners before agreeing to a moscow conference 
zimmermann said the soviet union has made significant progress in 
recent weeks but there are still gray areas 
the west considers as political prisoners some patients in 
psychiatric hospitals or prisoners in labor camps sentenced on 
trumpedup charges zimmermann said 
in some cases the soviet union has argued those people are 
mentally insane or jailed on criminal charges zimmermann said in 
others moscow reports it has no trace of people the west lists as 
political prisoners he said 
diplomats from western soviet bloc and neutral nations at the 
conference said other outstanding issues beside the moscow 
conference include 
a western request for a lasting soviet bloc commitment to end 
jamming of all western radio stations bulgaria the last soviet 
bloc nation still jamming radio free europe is expected to lift 
jamming this week according to an informed source who demanded 
anonymity 
the right of soviet bloc citizens to monitor their nations 
compliance with the 1975 helsinki final act and subsequent 
agreements by the 35 signatories to that accord 
adoption of a code of good conduct listing conditions such 
as free access which countries hoping to hold followup conferences 
must meet zimmermann said the united states will insist on such an 
agreement 
at a news conference zimmermann refused to say the vienna 
meeting would wind up before reagan leaves office 
but torovsky told a separate news conference that austrian 
foreign minister alois mock invited the foreign ministers of the 35 
participating nations to a final meeting jan 1719 in vienna 
torovsky said he was confident the 12 neutral and nonaligned 
nations charged with finding compromise formulas acceptable to both 
east and west would wrap up a draft final agreement next week or at 
the latest in early january

a senior official of the palestine liberation 
organization today said it was nonsensical to link palestinians 
to the pan am airliner crash in scotland 
it cannot possibly occur to the palestinians or the arabs to 
commit such an act mahmoud abbas codenamed abumazen told 
reporters when asked about reports that the plane may have been 
downed by sabotage any attempts to draw the arabs into this are 
nonsensical 
the crash wednesday night of the boeing 747 en route from london 
to new york killed all 258 people on board and a number of villagers 
in lockerbie scotland where it crashed us and british officials 
said the plane probably exploded in midair before the crash 
abbas is a member of the 15man plo executive committee chaired 
by yasser arafat he spoke after meeting with foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid 
in washington a us government source said the us embassy in 
helsinki finland received a telephone threat about two weeks ago 
from a person claiming to belong to the abu nidal group a radical 
palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks 
the caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a pan am plane and 
that it would be carried by a woman said the government source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

us conditions leading washington to open a dialogue with the plo 
after a 13year ban on contacts with the group

california said dea spokesman ralph lochridge 
federal agents discovered 65 wellcultivated marijuana plants at 
the ranch located about 15 miles from the ranch owned by the

this is part of an aggressive approach by federal and local 
authorities to use the federal forfeiture law to confiscate and 
forfeit the assets of drug traffickers said us attorney robert 
c bonner

and county sheriffs deputies wednesday was valued at 475000

israels two largest political blocs today 
joined forces in another coalition government and prime minister 
yitzhak shamir called the move necessary to withstand world pressure 
to accept a palestinian state 
shamir also called on the united states to reverse its recent 
decision to hold talks with the plo which israel considers a 
terrorist organization 
the agreement between shamirs rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftleaning labor party headed by shimon peres comes more than 
seven weeks after deadlocked general elections nov 1 
the new 28member cabinet took office after the 120member 
knesset the parliament approved the coalition in a vote of 
confidence by 8419 margin with three abstentions fourteen 
legislators were absent or did not vote 
the developments in the international arena require us to 
bridge our differences and solve problems together shamir told 
the legislature 
i make specific reference to the multifaceted political 
propaganda campaign of the terrorist organizations their friends 
and supporters against israel shamir said referring to the plo 
shamir also said the new government would stick by its policy of 
refusing contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
unfortunately we have been forced to strongly differ from the 
last decision of the us administration concerning the dialogue 
with the plo shamir said 
according to our knowledge it the plo has not changed its 
skin its habits its evil charter and the terror that it uses 
shamir added we still hope the united states will reconsider its 
decision concerning the plo 
shamir spoke after likud and labor signed a ninepage coalition 
agreement at a brief ceremony at which ministers also drank a toast 
of lchaim the traditional jewish toast meaning to life 
the policy guidelines and distribution of cabinet posts differed 
little from that of the outgoing laborlikud coalition formed after 
indecisive elections in 1984 
shamir who will serve as prime minister for the next four years 
said he would immediately launch a peace offensive but his proposal 
appeared no different from previous plans rejected by israels arab 
neighbors 
shamir said he could have formed a narrow coalition government 
with small religious and rightwing parties but preferred to share 
power with labor to withstand growing international pressure on 
israel to negotiate with the plo and accept a palestinian state 
we must unify all the nations political forces to build a 
national unity government to repel these dangers shamir said 
he also called on palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip to end their yearlong uprising against israeli occupation in 
which more than 330 palestinians and 14 israelis have died 
at this point his speech was interrupted by shouts from two 
leftwing arab legislators who support negotiations with the plo 
peres noted ideological differences between likud and labor 
which favors an international conference and the return of occupied 
territory in exchange for peace 
we have two views but one country and one future said 
peres who was foreign minister in the outgoing government and now 
will become finance minister we will try with our two views to 
serve the same country and the same future 
the cabinet consists of 28 ministers 11 from labor 11 from 
likud and others from three small religious parties the national 
religious party shau and agudat iraev 
in addition to shamir as prime minister and peres as finance 
minister the top posts went to shamir confidant moshe arens who was 
named foreign minister and labors no 2 yitzhak rabin who 
retained his post as defense minister 
elements in both labor and likud opposed another coalition 
government but both parties approved the agreement wednesday 
in the nov 1 balloting likud gained a slight edge winning 40 
seats in the 120member knesset to labors 39 the rest of the votes 
were split among smaller parties making some form of coalition 
necessary 
but political commentators were skeptical that the new government 
could operate effectively and predicted the same type of paralysis 
that plagued the outgoing coalition especially on peace issues 
shamir and peres will go forward like two convicts in 
legirons hobbling painfully said a frontpage editorial in the 
jerusalem post newspaper and if hobbling proves too painful they 
will just stand still

aircraft using this base in 
the suburbs of the nations capital have changed their flight 
patterns after a general living at the facility complained of the 
noise 
col william phillips commander of the 1776th air base wing 
apologized in writing to gen bernard randolph a fourstar general 
who heads the air force systems command which has its headquarters 
at andrews 
randolphs belle chance mansion is just 1200 feet from a main 
runway 
randolphs complaint stemmed from a sept 12 incident in which an 
air traffic controller directed a c141 to change its path for 
safety reasons because it was on a crash course with an approaching 
f4 fighter 
base spokeswoman maj val elbow explained wednesday that the 
c141 banked sharply over randolphs house drawing the generals 
concern for the safety of those below 
i apologize that we appear to have ignored your request to 
reduce noise when possible in the vicinity of belle chance 
phillips wrote to randolph i talked to each of our flying unit 
commanders personally and requested they emphasize the location of 
belle chance to their air crews 
phillips also said most flights on the belle chance side of the 
runway will not be allowed 
the noise abatement policy has been in effect for years but 
pilots didnt receive special notices to follow the rules until 
after randolphs complaint the washington times reported thursday 
maj elbow said the matter could have been smoothed over if 
phillips letter had focused on the safety issues 
its not realistic not to expect noise at an air force base

china and india have agreed to establish a group 
to take up their thorny border dispute following discussions with 
visiting prime minister rajiv gandhi of india the foreign ministry 
announced today 
ministry spokesman li zhaoxing speaking at the end of gandhis 
visit to the chinese capital also said good will fostered by the 
trip could lead to a solution to the border issue in the near 
future 
gandhi the first indian head of government to visit china since 
his grandfather jawaharlal nehru in 1954 left beijing for the 
ancient capital of xian this afternoon following three days of talks 
with chinas top leaders 
both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared that the 
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of 
expanded ties that will end the two countries decadeslong cold war 
the border dispute which exploded into a short war in 1962 and 
since has poisoned relations between the worlds two most populous 
nations was the most pressing topic in gandhis talks with premier 
li peng and other senior leaders 
spokesman li speaking at a news conference said 
thanks to the visit the sinoindian history of relations now 
ushers in a new period leaders of the two countries conducted 
sincere and indepth discussions on the border question between 
china and india which are conducive to reaching a solution on the 
boundary question in the near future 
he declined comment on the makeup of the working group but 
indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign ministerlevel 
and will be like a joint commission 
china and india have held eight rounds of talks in the past seven 
years on the border but there has been no formal structure to the 
meetings which have achieved little or no progress 
china claims 36000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what 
new delhi says is northeast indias arunachal pradesh province 
india says china illegally occupies 14500 square miles on its 
western border 
gandhi and the chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the 
boundary question the border issue is very complicated gandhi 
said at a wednesday news conference we cant expect instant 
solutions 
the symbolic restoration of friendly ties dominated the gandhi 
trip although the two sides added some substance today by signing a 
civil aviation agreement calling for direct flights between new 
delhi and beijing and two other accords 
the two sides also signed a threeyear cultural exchange 
agreement and a science and technology accord promoting contacts 
between their scientific communities 
gandhi also is to tour shanghai before returning to new delhi on 
friday the two sides are to issue a joint communique when he 
departs

a pan am jumbo jet apparently exploded 
in the air before crashing and killing all 259 people aboard and 
investigators focused today on terrorist threats to place a bomb on 
a pan am airliner 
the wreckage of the boeing 747 bound for new york with christmas 
travelers scattered bodies and wreckage over the countryside and 
ravaged the village of lockerbie 
twentytwo people died on the ground most of them in cars hit by 
wreckage desmond park deputy chief executive of the areas local 
council told the dumfriesshire newspapers group 
the plane smashed into the ground destroying 40 houses 
triggering an explosion at a gas station and engulfing cars in 
flames 
the death toll on the plane rose to 259 today when it was 
discovered that another flight attendant was on board said pamela 
hanlon a pan am spokeswoman in new york the victims included us 
servicemen 38 students from syracuse university and an associated 
press executive and five of his family members 
neither scottish secretary malcom rifkind the chief british 
official at the site nor us ambassador charles price would 
speculate on the possibility of sabotage but both the international 
air transport association and the british airline pilots association 
said that was the most likely explanation 
in washington a us government source said the us embassy in 
helsinki finland received a telephone threat about two weeks ago 
from a person claiming to belong to the abu nidal group a radical 
palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks 
the caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a pan am plane and 
that it would be carried by a woman said the government source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the government source said that threat was the basis for posting 
notices at us embassies 
in moscow the us embassy last week warned american diplomats 
that a bomb threat had been made against a pan am flight flying from 
frankfurt west germany to the united states sometime in december 
the warning left it to the diplomats discretion whether to change 
travel plans 
the doomed pan am flight 103 originated in frankfurt aboard a 
different aircraft 
in frankfurt the airport security chief said officials stepped 
up security at pan am after receiving threats against the carrier 
earlier this month 
an anonymous male caller to the associated press in london 
claimed responsibility for the disaster and said it was in 
retaliation for the shooting down of an iran air airbus by the us 
navy cruiser vincennes in july the navy said the plane carrying 290 
people over the persian gulf had been mistaken for an iranian 
fighter at the time some islamic extremists vowed revenge but 
later iranian officials said they understood the attack was a 
mistake 
we the guardians of the islamic revolution are undertaking this 
heroic execution in revenge of blowing the iran air plane by america 
a few months ago and keeping the shahs family in america we are 
very proud the caller said then hung up quickly 
the group also claimed responsibility for a july 18 1987 car 
bombing in london that wounded amir hussein amirparviz chairman of 
national movement for iranian resistance and a former iranian 
cabinet minister under the shah 
transport secretary paul channon told the house of commons that 
searchers had recovered both the airplanes flight recorders the 
vital electronic devices which monitor all flight data and 
conversation by the pilots 
prime minister margaret thatcher and prince andrew the duke of 
york visited lockerbie and talked to rescuers 
rifkind the british cabinet minister responsible for scotland 
said the widespread wreckage of the plane indicated the aircraft 
clearly experienced some form of explosion 
its clear that the accident happened in the air because parts 
of the wreckage are strewn over such a wide area said rifkind 
who toured the crash site with price 
price also said the way the plane had split into several sections 
would indicate a midair explosion 
asked on nbctvs today show about the reported bomb threats 
price said no we did not have any specific information such as 
that in london 
when he was asked how many americans were on board he said he 
understood that there were some 49 servicemen on the jet 
also on the jet was john mulroy director of international 
comunications for the associated press mulroy 59 died along with 
five family members 
wednesdays crash the worst in british history occurred 54 
minutes after takeoff from londons heathrow airport and followed an 
apparently routine climb to a cruising altitude of 31000 feet 
airline officials and traffic controllers said the only cause ruled 
out was a collision with another plane freddie yetman technical 
secretary of the british airline pilots association said only 
sabotage or structural failure could have destroyed the airplane at 
that height and it seems to me that the possibility of 
structural failure is almost too remote to be considered 
sabotage is the most likely explanation said david kyd 
chief public relations officer for the international air transport 
association in geneva he said structural problems were unlikely to 
have been involved 
pan am spokesman jeffrey kriendler said wednesday night in new 
york that the possibility of an explosion was only speculation 
we have no indication there were any problems kriendler 
said there was no mayday distress signal 
police superintendant angus kennedy told a news conference today 
that the bodies of 150 passengers including three children had 
been recovered and were taken to a makeshift morgue in the town hall 
around the town singed pillows lifejackets and fragments of 
clothing lay scattered in gardens chunks of metal some as small as 
coins and two feet in diameter had sliced through roofs and 
shattered windows in homes and cars 
the wreckage was strewn over a 10mile area and it appeared the 
boeing 747s nose fell to earth before the main part of the jet 
struck lockerbie 
the planes 243 passengers many of them carrying christmas 
packages included three children 38 undergraduates studying abroad 
on a syracuse university program and the un commissioner for 
namibia bernt carlsson of sweden the plane had a seating capacity 
of 412 
there also was a crew of 16 aboard the illfated plane 
the plane had a long history of maintenance problems including 
an onboard fire cracks and severe corrosion service information 
filed with the federal aviation administration showed 
the 18yearold jet the 15th 747 built by boeing commercial 
airplanes experienced at least 24 mechanical difficulties severe 
enough to warrant notation the los angeles times reported today 
the jets blueandwhite nose section its clipper name maid of 
the seas clearly visible landed three miles short of lockerbie 
near a church in tundergarth 
eight bodies fell on the tundergarth golf course they were 
covered in tarpaulins and under police guard 
john boyd the areas chief constable said the 747 struck a hill 
outside lockerbie and in town hit a gas station and two rows of 
houses and blasted a huge crater in the highway 
the crash at 219 pm est happened while sheila mcdonald was 
delivering christmas presents to a friends home on a hillside 
overlooking the 2500resident town 
this vshaped object just seemed to come flying through the air 
it was the wings and front section of an aircraft another 
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like 
sparks she said 
the investigation will be conducted by a 10member team from the 
department of transports air accident investigation branch

un headquarters along with the foreign ministers of cuba and 
angola who also pledged to send home 50000 cuban troops posted in 
angola

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and other diplomats 
the regional settlement concluded here today represents a 
momentous turning point in the history of southern africa shultz

question will have been resolved as the guns fall silent across the 
borders of southwestern africa the world will look to the nations 
of the region to resolve their pressing internal matters through

angolas government and usbacked rebels 
the governments and individuals gathered in this place have

and for all of them to be gone by july 1 1991 half of the 50000 
soldiers are to pull out by nov 1 1989 when namibia is to hold

will monitor the cuban withdrawal from angola 
cuba angola and the united nations do not officially recognize 
that the two accords are linked they have always insisted on 
namibias independence as a matter of principle without conditions 
south africa insisted on the cuban withdrawal in talks mediated 
by chester crocker the us assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs 
one diplomat who had been expected to attend was bernt carlsson 
of sweden the un commissioner for namibia who was aboard the pam 
am jetliner that crashed in scotland wednesday night 
carlsson 50 was flying from london to new york when the plane 
crashed no survivors were reported among the 259 passengers and 
crew 
a decadeold security council plan for namibias independence 
calls for about 2000 civilian administrators and military police to 
back about 7500 un peacekeepers as south african troops withdraw 
and a civilian government is organized 
the southwest african peoples organization which has fought 
south african forces in namibia for more than 20 years was not part 
of the accords but said it will honor a ceasefire 
the organization is recognized by the united nations as the 
legitimate representative of the namibian people and holds 
nonvoting observer status in the world body 
the guerrillas battling the marxist government of angola were 
also excluded from the accords 
crocker told reporters wednesday that unita the national union 
for the total independence of angola also supports the accords 
crocker indicated washington will not give diplomatic recognition 
to angola unless it holds peace talks with unita 
angola has refused to talk with the rebels 
cuban troops went to angola in 1975 to help it fight invading 
south african troops and the guerrillas 
south africa has ruled the mineralrich territory of namibia 
which now has a population of roughly 12 million since capturing 
it from germany during world war i in 1920 the league of nations 
granted south africa a mandate to administer namibia the united 
nations revoked that mandate in 1966

dr louis w sullivan expected to be the first 
black to join presidentelect bushs cabinet moves easily in 
democratic as well as republican circles according to friends and 
associates of the school administrator 
sullivan 55 president of the morehouse school of medicine in 
atlanta was expected to be formally announced today as bushs 
secretary of health and human services 
he had drawn criticism from antiabortion activists this week 
after he said in an interview that women should have a right to 
choose abortion he later said he opposes abortion but would allow 
it in cases of rape incest or when the mothers life was endangered 
friends describe him as a political independent whose 
associations with lawmakers range from rural georgia figures to 
bush who attended a dedication ceremony at the medical school in 
1982 and invited sullivan on a trip to africa later that year 
dr jim kaufmann a friend of sullivans since the 1970s said 
sullivan has been very close to bush and his wife barbara a 
member of the medical schools board of trustees since 1983 
he has strong republican leanings kaufmann said that 
doesnt mean hes not a strong democratic supporter thats how it 
is when you represent a school and youre trying to develop 
education he works well with everybody 
sullivan had never made public statements on his views about 
abortion until bush began considering him to lead the department of 
health and human services his remarks on the subject in an atlanta 
newspaper interview sunday in which he said he supports a womans 
right to seek an abortion but opposes federal funding to pay for it 
brought an outcry from antiabortion forces 
monday sullivan wrote a letter to the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution saying he is opposed to abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and where the life of the mother is 
threatened 
dr clint warner chairman of the morehouse medical schools 
board of trustees said sullivans views on abortion are aligned 
with those of bush 
his views are consistent with the president and more 
importantly consistent with the law warner said dr sullivan 
is the most qualified person in the country for that position i 
think the president holds that view too 
kaufmann said sullivan is not a political neophyte but has 
generally steered clear of political controversies 
he said sullivan got so attached to bush about four years ago 
because he felt bush would be a proeducation president 
lee raudonis executive director of the republican party of 
georgia said sullivan has never actively worked with the state 
party or aligned himself with it 
dr sullivan has been very close to the presidentelect he has 
participated in some functions but he has not been listed as an 
active member raudonis said hes tried to remain independent 
i dont recall that hes attended any republican party 
fundraisers 
rep john lewis dga said sullivan a native atlantan is 
widely respected in the citys mostly democratic black community and 
regularly visits lewis washington office to update him on the 
medical schools progress 
when hes in washington he keeps us briefed on what is 
happening he uses our office sort of as his office because 
morehouse is in the heart of the district lewis said 
sullivan set up many influential political contacts during his 
efforts to establish the morehouse medical program in the 1970s 
lewis said sullivan on behalf of the medical school made 
contacts early with some of the movers and shakers in georgia 
politics including sens sam nunn and wyche fowler as well as tom 
murphy speaker of the georgia house and a powerful democrat 
if anyone can come to grips with health and human services in 
this time of limited resources i think dr sullivan could lewis 
said one thing i can say about him hes a hard worker hes 
persistent and hes very aggressive 
professionally sullivan is a blood specialist who has been 
president of the morehouse school of medicine since 1981 he has 
taught medicine at harvard morehouse the new jersey college of 
medicine and boston university where he graduated with honors in 
1958

here at a glance are developments today involving the crash of 
pan american world airways flight 103 wednesday night in lockerbie 
scotland that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people 
on the ground 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the jumbo jet a boeing 747 apparently exploded in the air 
before crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to 
place a bomb on a pan am airliner 
the crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from londons 
heathrow airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of 
31000 feet the only possible cause immediately ruled out was a 
collision with another aircraft 
searchers recovered both the airplanes flight recorders 
scottish secretary malcom rifkind the chief british official at 
the site said the widespread wreckage indicated the aircraft 
clearly experienced some form of explosion 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 miles 
of countryside and ravaged the village of lockerbie 
twentytwo people were killed on the ground most of them in cars 
hits by wreckage authorities said forty houses were destroyed when 
the plane crashed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the international air transport association believes sabotage is 
the most likely explanation for the crash 
david kyd chief public relations officer said it would seem 
to us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard and 
that structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in the 
crash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane the 747 
has a reputation for ruggedness and is able to stay aloft even with 
serious damage to the structure

the state department warned us embassies that a bomb threat had 
been made against pan am jetliners flying from frankfurt to the 
united states 2 weeks ago and the federal aviation administration 
told pan am this month that the airline might be the target of a 
terrorist bombing 
an unidentified us government source said a a person claiming 
to belong to the abu nidal group a radical palestinian faction 
telephoned the us embassy in helsinki finland about two weeks 
ago and said a bomb would be placed aboard a pan am plane and that 
it would be carried by a woman

an anonymous caller to the ap office in london claimed 
responsibility for the crash and said it was in retaliation for the 
downing of an iran air airbus by the us navy cruiser vincennes in 
july

this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the iran air plane by 
america a few months ago and keeping the shahs family in america

it was nonsensical to link palestinians to the crash

reporters when asked about reports that the plane may have been 
downed by sabotage

the jumbo jet that crashed had at least 24 mechanical problems 
during the past eight years including cracks severe corrosion and 
an onboard fire according to faa service records 
faa spokeswoman joann sloane said there have been problems with 
minor cracks in 747s over the past few years but inspections did 
not find much cracking 
those are certainly very reliable airplanes she said adding 
that the problems reported did not appear unusual given the length 
of time the plane had been in service 
officials at pratt amp whitney in said they doubted their engines 
which powered the aircraft caused the crash and that the plane 
could have continued to fly even if three of the four engines failed 
at once

500 rookie of the year tearfully told us district judge james

the boeing 747 that crashed in scotland had 
been repaired for at least 21 mechanical difficulties since 1980 
including a small inboard fire and a large crack in an upper 
bulkhead according to federal records 
federal aviation administration service records show that in 
november 1987 a 163inch crack near the upper part of the fuselage 
bulkhead was discovered in the plane that crashed wednesday in 
scotland with 259 people aboard investigators today focused on 
terrorist threats to place a bomb on the jet and officials said 
sabotage seemed the most likely cause of the crash 
the faa report said the crack in the plane was corrosionrelated 
and corrosion was noted in the planes floor beam and other areas 
according to records filed march 25 a leading edge slat fell off 
the plane during takeoff from karachi pakistan and the slat 
section was found on the runway 
in october 1987 maintenance workers responding to a boeing 
service bulletin suggesting inspections of the plane and all similar 
aircraft found severe corrosion at the rear bulkhead and on part of 
the fuselage the report said 
a boeing spokesman said the plane was taken out of service last 
year for substantial modifications and any structural deficiencies 
observed earlier would have been corrected 
other service difficulties cited included a sheared nose gear 
bolt a missing pylon panel two instances of smoke in the passenger

for the crash company investigators were dispatched to the accident 
scene

fiscal plan includes financial reforms backed by both the united 
states and soviet union 
the united states responded to wednesdays action by paying 
nearly 30 million of the more than 500 million it owes in back 
dues to the world body a un official said 
the budget adopted wednesday allocates 176 billion for 1990 and 
1991 about 22 million less than the revised figures for the 
198889 budget it does not include funds for several special 
peacekeeping operations 
in real terms what is happening is staff is being reduced so 
personnel costs are going down and all other costs are being held 
at zero growth said un financial spokesman fred eckhard 
us soviet japanese and western european officials sought a 15 
percent un staff reduction the world body has cut 12 percent so 
far 
eckhard said a us treasury official gave the united nations a 
check for 296 million today 
the united states is assessed for onefourth of the uns 
regular budget 
by september the united states was behind more than 500 million 
in payments eckhard said todays us payment reduced the us 
arrears to 3077 million for the regular budget and 961 million 
for peacekeeping 
the last time the general assembly achieved unanimity on the 
budget was during its first working session in 1946 
the soviets blocked consensus in the first decades of the world 
body and the united states raised roadblocks in recent years and 
withheld part of its dues to agitate for reform 
the united states abstained on the budget resolution last year 
us delegate noel l gross lauded the assembly action wednesday 
as a major step forward in implementing the wideranging 
administrative and budgetary reforms approved two years ago 
consensus adoption of the budget which effectively gives the 
major contributors to the world body veto power over the budget was 
one of the main reforms the united states wanted when it launched a 
campaign to overhaul un management about five years ago 
withholding part of the us dues to the world body gave teeth to 
the american demands

like many high school students ivan 
kershner showed up in jeans passed notes in class and skipped study 
hall with a forged pass 
the next day though kershner buckled down to work again as 
principal of north platte high school 
kershner traded places with a student wednesday as part of the 
school newspapers fundraising effort principal for a day for 50 
cents a chance students bought tickets for the raffle which was 
won by senior charles swanson 
swanson showed up wednesday in suit and tie and spent the day on 
such matters as inspecting the grounds for needed repairs and 
reviewing lunch policies with administrators 
kershner meanwhile struggled through swansons classes he 
began the day with physics but was forced to leave class early when 
he was called to the principals office and reprimanded for parking 
his car in the faculty lot 
which was good because i wasnt understanding what was 
happening in physics kershner said 
then it was on to american history algebra spanish american 
government english and orchestra the last was a problem because 
swanson plays firstchair viola while kershner said he plays 
25thchair harmonica 
kershner said if he were to trade places with swanson 
permanently he would have to drop physics and orchestra and enroll 
in remedial algebra 
anybody who thinks school is for kids implying it is easy it 
is not a job or it is not the real world is sadly mistaken 
kershner said i worked hard today i learned things i have never 
known before and i was challenged 
theres an awful lot of hard work in being a student in todays 
schools he added kids simply are expected to know more now 
than any other point in history and there is more to know now than 
any point in history 
swanson too found the principals job harder than expected 
during the day he discussed student tardiness and ideas for an open 
campus with associate principals observed classes served as hall 
monitor and was host at a faculty christmas party 
id imagine in some ways its harder to be a student but 
altogether i think its harder being a principal swanson said 
there are a lot more people to take care of and a whole lot of 
responsibility its a tough job

hundreds clustered around syracuse 
universitys chapel to share the horrible news that 38 students were 
aboard a doomed pan am flight listen to prayers and utter a common 
refrain it cant be true 
it still hasnt really hit said chris healy a junior from 
seaford ny he said one of his friends was among the students in a 
syracuse university program who were booked on the jetliner that 
crashed wednesday in scotland 
authorities believed there were no survivors among the 259 people 
aboard flight 103 which was en route from london to new york 
its hard to think of christmas this year i think about the 
parents who hadnt seen their kids since august healy said as he 
was joined by a group of anguished friends at hendricks memorial 
chapel 
new york gov mario cuomo issued a statement today expressing his 
sorrow and ordering flags at all state facilities be flown at 
halfstaff through saturday 
for all the lives lost and particularly to the syracuse 
university community we extend our most profound and heartfelt 
sympathies and our prayers for strength cuomo said 
elsewhere on campus wednesday night more than 25000 people 
attending a basketball game paused for a minute of silence and a 
brief prayer by the university minister 
inside the chapel about 500 mourners sat in silence and lit 
candles at a prayer service led by chaplains of five faiths the 
rev paul kowalewski a protestant chaplain said the ceremony 
filled a need in the university community 
we gathered because we needed to come together the students 
needed to demonstrate their sorrow to be with one another 
kowalewski said its christmas theyre students and young 
everything in a tragedy is built into this 
the 38 students were part of a group of about 250 mostly 
juniors selected for study in europe based on their academic 
standing and ability to adapt to a foreign country said lore heath 
associate director of the universitys division of international 
programs abroad 
the program includes the cost of their flight over but students 
made their own arrangements for return travel heath said the 
semesters program ended saturday 
university chancellor melvin eggers called the crash one of the 
greatest tragedies in syracuse university history 
this is the saddest day of my life he said weve lost 
some of the brightest talented most beautiful people its hard to 
express our sorrow 
eggers said the fact that the crash may have been the result of a 
terrorist act made it even harder for families and friends of the 
victims 
the first impact of such an event plummets us into almost 
depair eggers said this morning on nbctvs today show but 
to learn that it might have been a deliberate act is just beyond 
belief something we cant cope with 
farshad hajir of south orange nj a senior who learned that a 
close friend had been returning on the pan am plane said in a 
cracking voice 
i told her what a great experience it would be to study abroad 
i encouraged her then you come back to hear this what can i say 
nearby people clustered in small huddles to seek consolation 
pain and disbelief were evident in most faces friends hugged one 
another and cried together 
it cant be true was a common refrain amid the sobs that 
split the chill night 
this is the mood thats all around said junior scott meach 
pointing to emotional people around the chapels front steps 
its really so hard to believe said meach a resident of 
west bloomfield mich who said one of his fraternity brothers was 
on the jetliner it helps to bring people together to share the 
pain 
george h couch a junior in geography also came to pray for a 
fraternity brother the thing about this couch said is that 
at our age you feel so indestructible you see it happening on 
television but dont think it will ever happen to us

divers and scientists failed again 
today to rescue a bottlenose dolphin that became stranded in the 
chilly waters off this coastal community after neglecting to migrate 
south for the winter 
at one point the rescuers managed to snare the frisky dolphin in 
a net but the mammal slipped away before he could be brought out of 
broad bay 
the effort was then suspended until jan 4 to reassess strategy 
and get a stronger net said robert helfant captain of the 
emergency medical services dive team in virginia beach 
the net wasnt really the right kind of net helfant said 
the biggest thing is safety for both the fish and the people 
rescue officials were worried about the divers safety because one 
diver got caught in the net the diver had to be cut out but he was 
uninjured said bruce edwards director of emergency medical 
services 
excited shouts and curses came from the divers as they briefly 
trapped the animal get it together one diver shouted as he 
handled the net 
about 10 boats left around dawn in the second day of the rescue 
attempt divers and marine scientists tried for seven hours 
wednesday to rescue the dolphin nicknamed rascal before 
suspending the effort until this morning 
everything went right except for the dolphin said robert 
schoelkopf the leader of the effort to move the dolphin to warmer 
water 
the young dolphin remained strong enough to evade the net despite 
being stuck in the 40degree water with little food schoelkopf said 
hes not weak at all he said still he added the mammal 
remained in danger from the cold water 
if the 200 to 300pound dolphin is caught he will be airlifted 
by a coast guard helicopter to waters off north carolinas outer 
banks 
thirteen rescue vessels ranging from inflatable rafts to 
sportfishing boats and carrying more than 50 people made a 
halfdozen attempts wednesday to net the dolphin 
about 100 spectators gathered wednesday on a point of land near a 
narrow channel where most of the rescue attempts took place others 
watched from private boats including mayor meyera oberndorf four 
businessmen in suits and nearly two dozen reporters and 
photographers 
today about a dozen people watched from the shore including the 
staff of a radio station that broadcast the event live 
schoelkopf director of the marine mammal stranding center in 
brigantine nj said the wouldbe rescuers were thwarted wednesday 
by strong currents as well as the dolphins strength he also said 
the mammal was frightened by the number of rescue boats and by the 
net 
residents believe the dolphin lingered in the bay long after 
fellow dolphins headed south because he was frightened by bridge 
construction over a narrow channel leading to the open waters of 
chesapeake bay 
the national marine fisheries service approved the unusual rescue 
monday and asked schoelkopf to supervise it because of his 
experience rescuing dolphins

president reagan today offered his condolences 
to the victims of the pan am jet crash as his spokesman defended the 
process by which the state department warned us embassies that a 
bomb threat had been made against pan am jetliners flying from 
frankfurt to the united states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he could not explain 
why more people had not been notified of the threat and he 
acknowleged that the public should be aware of such threats 
i think that certainly will be looked at fitzwater told 
reporters public notification has to be considered 
the spokesman said the state department warned us embassies 
around dec 7 about a bomb threat had been made two days earlier 
against pan am jetliners flying from frankfurt west germany to the 
united states 2 weeks before the crash of a new yorkbound flight 
originating in germany 
at his daily press briefing fitzwater said no information had 
been discovered that can confirm sabotage as the cause of the 
crash 
the president he said planned to call prime minister margaret 
thatcher about the matter later in the day reagan has also 
dispatched a team of us officials from the federal aviation 
administration the national transportation safety board and the fbi 
to help in the investigation the spokesman added 
fitzwater said the faa told pan american world airways that it 
might be the target of a terrorist bombing and that appropriate 
police in various parts of the world were also told of the dec 5 
threat 
asked why more people werent warned fitzwater said i dont 
have an answer on that there are threats like that on a continuing 
basis the issue is there are so many of these threats that 
this was determined to be the appropriate level of notification 
but pressed as to whether the general public should have a chance 
to make its own judgments about travel in regard to such threats 
the spokesman said he believed the matter would receive some 
consideration 
the public should be aware of the general threat he said 
whether there is a press release is a thing that should be 
considered 
president reagan is deeply saddened by this tragic accident 
the president and mrs reagan wish to convey their condolences to 
the families of all the victims the president has promised the full 
cooperation and support of the us government in this 
investigation fitzwater said

presidentelect bush pledged thursday to pursue 
president reagans policy of seeking the removal of gen manuel 
antonio noriega from power in panama 
our policy will be that noriega must go there should be no 
misunderstanding about our policy bush told eric arturo delvalle 
the ousted president whom the united states continues to recognize 
as panamas legitimate leader 
the vice presidents words were relayed to reporters by white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater after bush met privately with 
reagan delvalle and national security adviser colin l powell 
fitzwater said delvalle requested the meeting because of rumors 
and unfounded stories in panama of a change in us policy 
he was looking for assurance of steadfastness the spokesman 
said 
delvalle has lived in hiding in panama since being deposed last 
february by forces loyal to noriega who was indicted on 
drugsmuggling charges by two federal grand juries in florida 
earlier this year 
fitzwater said delvalle did not suggest any changes in policy and 
there was no discussion of relaxing the economic sanctions that the 
united states has applied against the noriegarun government 
fitzwater said there was no discussion of the possibility of 
delvalle resigning and no discussion of possible us military 
action as to the latter possibility he would say only we dont 
discuss military options 
on wednesday state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
appeared to rule out us military force to depose noriega saying 
that panamas political crisis can be resolved only by 
panamanians 
fitzwater said reagan commended delvalles courage and patriotism 
and promised his continued support he said delvalle thanked the 
president and vice president for their backing 
the spokesman described the meeting which lasted about 15 
minutes as a general discussion of where we go from here 
delvalle met wednesday afternoon with secretary of state george 
p shultz shortly after his arrival from panama aboard a us 
military jet neither man spoke to reporters after the meeting 
the washington post reported in thursdays editions that during 
a meeting in panama city last week with adm william j crowe jr 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff delvalle threatened to give 
up his struggle against noriega unless the united states came up 
with a specific plan to remove him 
the post said that according to notes of the secret meeting 
provided by a source delvalle said he saw no reason to continue 
making personal sacrifices without a specific plan of action to 
remove noriega 
the newspaper said the dec 11 meeting also was attended by us 
ambassador to panama arthur davis and the commander of the us 
militarys southern command gen fred f woerner

the soviet union plans to recycle engines from the 
10000 army tanks being withdrawn from europe for use in the lagging 
domestic economy the official news agency tass reported thursday 
fuel tanker trucks and cargo trailers attached to the six tank 
divisions being disbanded also will be transferred to civilian use 
tass said quoting maj gen yuri lebedev of the armed forces 
general staff 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the united nations on dec 7 
the soviet armed forces would be cut by 500000 soldiers in the next 
two years to show the west that its intentions are defensive rather 
than offensive 
the reductions include six tank divisions on the front line with 
nato in hungary czechoslovakia and east germany 
gorbachev has said repeatedly that the soviet union must 
concentrate its resources on domestic problems soviet media 
previously have reported plans to shift certain military factories 
to the production of badly needed consumer goods 
last spring a factory in odessa reportedly began to convert 
missile platforms into 80ton construction cranes as the soviet 
union started dismantling ss20 rockets under the superpower arms 
control treaty signed last year 
lebedev denied western charges that the reductions in soviet 
armed forces in eastern europe and the european part of the soviet 
union would cover only aging outdated tanks or only auxiliary units 
to the armored divisions 
six tank divisions will be disbanded and the military hardware 
including the most uptodate tanks will be destroyed except for 
the engines tass reported lebedev as saying the article said 
lebedev emphasized that the units will be pulled out in full stre 
ngth with all their military hardware 
lebedev also said the soviet union expects the north atlantic 
treaty organization to take reciprocal steps toward making its 
armed forces truly defensive tass reported 
lebedev also said the greatest difficulty for the soviet union in 
connection with the troop cuts will be finding housing for the 
veteran servicemen the soviet union has a severe chronic housing 
shortage and most construction resources have been dedicated to 
rebuilding the areas of armenia devasted by the dec 7 earthquake

pope john paul ii today said the ordination 
of women in the anglican church poses serious obstacles to 
relations with the roman catholic church 
in a yearend address to cardinals the pope speaking with 
sincere pain deplored a resolution adopted by the worlds 
anglican bishops in august 
the anglican bishops voted 42328 with 19 abstentions to maintain 
links with any of their 27 selfgoverning churches that consecrate a 
woman bishop even if they disagree with the practice the measure 
was a compromise to avoid dividing the anglican communion on the 
issue 
john paul said the action poses serious obstacles to that 
progress in reciprocal reconciliation which in the course of recent 
decades has arrived at such promising results 
the late pope paul vi and the late archbishop of canterbury 
michael ramsey committed themselves in 1966 to the search for full 
communion between anglicans and roman catholics john paul has 
reaffirmed the commitment 
he called on the anglicans to try to avoid the painful and 
deplorable consequences to relations with the catholic church and 
inside the anglican communion he said the resolution failed to 
consider the ecumenical dimensions of ordaining women priests 
while the church of england doesnt ordain women some of the 27 
independent provinces around the world do in september the boston 
diocese elected the rev barbara c harris a bishop and the 
118diocese us episcopal church is expected to approve her 
ordination 
in a document issued in september john paul reaffirmed the roman 
catholic churchs ban on priesthood for women 
the pope said a second cloud over the church this year was the 
vain attempt to ward off a schism by traditionalist archbishop 
marcel lefebvre 
the vatican excommunicated the french prelate after he 
consecrated four bishops without papal approval in june john paul 
said the church has the serene knowledge of having done all it 
could do avoid the break the first major schism in more than a 
century

china announced thursday that it and india will 
establish a group to tackle a border dispute that flared into a 
brief war in 1962 and has poisoned relations between the worlds 
most populous nations ever since 
the agreement was announced at the end of indian prime minister 
rajiv gandhis historic visit to the chinese capital foreign 
ministry spokesman li zhaoxing also said good will fostered by the 
gandhi visit could lead to a solution to the border issue in the 
near future 
gandhi the first indian head of government to visit china since 
his grandfather jawaharlal nehru in 1954 left beijing for the 
ancient capital of xian on thursday following three days of talks 
with chinese leaders 
both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared the 
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of 
expanded ties that will end the two countries decadeslong cold war 
the border dispute exploded into a short war 26 years ago and has 
since kept the nations apart it was the most pressing topic in 
gandhis talks with premier li peng and other senior leaders 
li zhaoxing speaking at a news conference said thanks to the 
visit the sinoindian history of relations now ushers in a new 
period leaders of the two countries conducted sincere and indepth 
discussions on the border question between china and india which 
are conducive to reaching a solution on the boundary question in the 
near future 
he said the two sides agreed to establish a joint working 
group which is specially devoted to the boundary question 
he declined comment on the makeup of the working group but 
indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister level 
china and india have held eight rounds of talks since 1981 on the 
border issue but there has been no formal structure to the 
meetings which have achieved little progress 
china claims 36000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what 
new delhi says is northeast indias arunachal pradesh province 
india says china illegally occupies 14500 square miles on its 
western border 
gandhi and the chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the 
boundary question the border issue is very complicated gandhi 
said wednesday we cant expect instant solutions 
gandhis trip to beijing brings a new era of detente to 
sinoindian relations that is likely to be followed next year by a 
visit by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the gorbachev visit 
will formally end 30 years of political strain and distrust between 
the soviet union and china 
the symbolic restoration of ties dominated the gandhi trip 
although the two sides added some substance thursday by signing a 
civil aviation agreement calling for flights between new delhi and 
beijing and accords for cultural and technological exchanges 
gandhi also is to tour shanghai before returning to new delhi on 
friday

some of this years drought in the midwest may 
have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator 
in the pacific ocean according to a new computer study reported 
thursday 
such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature 
abnormalities turn out to be predictable one of the authors said in 
the report appearing in fridays issue of science magazine 
the authors are kevin e trenberth and grant w branstator of the 
national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo and 
phillip a arkin of the climate analysis center of the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration in camp springs md 
they noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much 
of north america in 1988 meteorologists often reply the jet 
stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms 
which tend to track along the path of the jet stream were similarly 
displaced northward 
such an answer is however just a brief description of the 
weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the 
cause a more satisfying response would address why the jet stream 
was displaced northward the team wrote 
their proposed answer focuses on the development in april may 
and june of drought in the midwest where several states recorded 
less rain than at any time since 1895 by july the weather pattern 
they studied was breaking up and continuing dryness in the study 
area and elsewhere probably had other causes arkin said 
but during the apriljune period there were alternating high and 
low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the western 
hemisphere a highpressure center north of hawaii a low in the 
gulf of alaska a high in central canada extending down into the 
northern great plains states and a low on the east coast 
in this period pacific ocean temperatures ranged up to 54 
degrees fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about 
4000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of south 
america with the coolest spot midway along the band 
at the same time a bit to the north of this band surface 
temperatures ranged up to 09 degrees above normal 
when this temperature pattern was fed into the computer the 
pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was 
reproduced the belownormal equatorial temperature by itself did 
not give such a result 
we havent proved anything all weve done is shown that its a 
possibility arkin said 
the global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of 
a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these 
abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought he 
said 
if the model holds up the work will be the first demonstration 
of tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the 
tropics in the summer arkin said 
the authors took note of computer models predicting increased 
frequency of drought with the buildup of the greenhouse effect 
global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere 
the greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions 
for droughts and heat waves are more likely but it cannot be blamed 
for an individual drought they said

many of the nations growing number of homeless may find no room 
at the shelter this christmas meaning home for the holidays could 
be under a bridge over a steam vent or in a cardboard box 
boston guarantees a bed arizona vows to make shelter available 
by christmas eve and a celebration in a heated tent is planned for 
the homeless in front of the capitol on christmas eve but the 
nations capital has only 2500 slots for the 10000 to 15000 with 
no bed of their own 
california gov george deukmejian last month authorized counties 
to continue to use armories as shelters under a program started last 
year estimates of the number of homeless there range from 100000 
to 200000 
california may be the place of yearround sunshine in the eyes 
of our eastern friends but when you have no roof over your head 
even a california winter can be cruel and punishing deukmejian 
said 
in new york city the estimated number of homeless has increased 
25 percent during the last year with the total estimated between 
60000 and 90000 in portland ore the number rose 10 to 20 
percent each year this decade 
theres been a steady increase of about 25 percent a year that 
hasnt changed in six years said keith summa of the coalition for 
the homeless in new york city 
in oklahoma city there are an estimated 17000 homeless and no 
state or cityrun shelters in phoenix with 6000 to 9000 
homeless mary orton director of central arizona shelter services 
said there are only about 1000 beds 
the remainder sleep on the streets in parks in their cars 
under bushes anywhere they can ms orton said 
arizona gov rose mofford tried to make a national guard armory 
or other state buildings available for phoenixarea homeless but was 
advised she could not legally use state emergency funds to pay for 
the operation 
the governor will find some other way to make more beds available 
by christmas eve said vada manager her press secretary 
christine byrd regional director of the national coalition for 
the homeless in oklahoma city said a december report from a 
governors task force put the total for the state at 35000 and 
17000 for the city 
ms byrd said 48 percent are families in part because of 
oklahomas location at the nations center poor families going from 
the west coast to the east or vice versa run out of gas or have car 
trouble there she said 
the coalition estimated the number of homeless nationally at as 
many as 3 million 
boston seems to have the distinction of being one of the few 
cities where the number of homeless has not drastically increased in 
the last two or three years in both 1987 and 1988 the citys 
estimate of homeless was under 3500 
whoever needs a bed gets one says ann maguire executive 
director of the boston emergency shelter commission if there is no 
room at one shelter the city provides a van or police car to get 
the person to a shelter with room 
baloney joes a portland ore shelter for homeless men is 
so full were stacking people on top of each other said gene 
ediger of the burnside community council a private agency for the 
homeless he said the number of homeless has gone up 10 to 20 
percent each year of the 1980s 
in philadelphia the city has started daily cleanups of a subway 
concourse where homeless people set up boxes mattresses and 
blankets police have not stopped homeless people from returning 
christmas is a time of enchantment but not when youre 
homeless said sister mary scullion who runs a residence for 
mentally ill homeless women in philadelphia

frankfurt to the united states 2 weeks before the crash of a new 
yorkbound flight originating in germany us officials said today 
in addition a pan american world airways official said the 
federal aviation administration told the airline early this month 
that pan am might be the target of a terrorist bombing on a route 
from frankfurt west germany 
pan am flight 103 crashed wednesday in scotland killing all 259 
people aboard and more than 20 people on the ground and us and 
british officials said the plane probably exploded before the crash 
the flight originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 passengers and 
luggage were transferred to the 747 at londons heathrow airport 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the state 
department notification of the embassies but he acknowledged that 
the public should be aware of the general threat as well 
i think that certainly will be looked at fitzwater told 
reporters public notification has to be considered 
asked why there was none in this case he said i dont have an 
answer on that the issue is there are so many of these 
threats that this was determined to be the appropriate level of 
notification 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said that on dec 5 
an inidentified caller told the us embassy in helsinki that 
sometime within the next two weeks an unidentified person in 
helsinki would unwittingly take the device to frankfurt and 
eventually onto the new york onto the usbound flight 
pan am had received notification from various sources that 
there was the possibility of a threat against pan american 
airways said pan am spokeswoman pam hanlon in new york we 
immediately acted and put supplementary security procedures in 
effect not only at frankfurt but at airports around the world 
she declined to say what steps were taken 
ms hanlon said added precautions were taken at london and all 
other major airports with some given higher priority but she 
declined to say which airports were considered at most serious risk 
she confirmed that one of the warnings came from the faa in the 
form of a memo but said for security reasons we do not circulate 
them publicly 
at the us embassy in moscow a dec 13 circular from william c 
kelly the administrative counselor had been posted on bulletin 
boards 
it read post the embassy has been notified by the federal 
aviation administration that on dec 5 1988 an unidentified 
individual telephoned a us diplomatic facility in europe and 
stated that sometime within the next two weeks there would be a 
bombing attempt against a pan american aircraft flying from 
frankfurt to the united states 
it continued the faa reports that the reliability of the 
information cannot be assessed at this point but the appropriate 
police authorities have been notified and are pursuing the matter 
pan am has also been notified 
in view of the lack of confirmation of this information post 
leaves to the discretion of individual travelers any decisions on 
altering personal travel plans or changing to another american 
carrier kellys circular said 
dennis harter spokesman for the state department task force 
assigned to deal with the crash said today that notices such as the 
one posted in moscow had been sent to all us missions around the 
world 
however he also said such notices are routinely sent out to us 
embassies when word is received of threats against american targets 
and a warning of that nature would not have been viewed as 
anything unusual 
ronald spiers under secretary of state for management told 
cable news network that there were four us government employees on 
the plane at least two who were assigned to the us embassy in 
beirut he said the us ambassador to lebanon john mccarthy would 
have been on the flight had he not been delayed in cyprus 
one us source who spoke only under the condition of not being 
further identified said the faa issued the warning on dec 5 but 
cautioned that it was not in a position to evaluate the reliability 
of the report 
the faa in recent years has issued a number of similar reports 
involving potential terrorist activity involving air carriers 
worldwide but it could not be ascertained how frequent such reports 
are 
faa spokesmen declined to comment on whether such a warning was 
issued 
another source familiar with the warning officially termed an 
intelligence alert said it named no specific terrorist group 
but that the threat was middle east oriented 
a former faa official familiar with such warnings said that 
while they are not unusual they should be considered seriously 
its more than a hint its a direct request to beef up 
security said this former official who asked that his identity 
not be revealed he said that the frequency of such alerts is 
sporadic depending on other events in the world at times the faa 
might issue one every few months but there also might be as many as 
a half dozen in two weeks 
a frankfurt airport official said today that security was stepped 
up at pan am after tips were received earlier this month that a bomb 
might be smuggled aboard a jet the official horst harnstein told 
the associated press by telephone that the tips were about the 
transportation of a bomb from frankfurt heading in the direction of 
the united states 
enku kebede an employee of pan am who works at the airlines 
office in the embassy in moscow said the threat apparently was 
delivered to american officials in germany and was investigated by 
germanys security service ms kebede said she learned of the 
threat from the memo in the embassy not from pan am 
a lot of people changed their reservations from pan am she 
said she said more than a dozen customers changed their flight 
plans 
abc news quoted fbi sources who said the threat apparently came 
from what they described as some kind of islamic group an fbi 
spokesman contacted by the associated press william carter refused 
comment 
in london today an anonymous caller to the ap office in london 
claimed responsibility for the crash of flight 103 and said it was 
in retaliation for the downing of an iran air airbus by the us 
navy cruiser vincennes in july 
we the guardians of the islamic revolution are undertaking 
this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the iran air plane by 
america a few months ago and keeping the shahs family in america 
we are very proud the male caller said then hung up quickly the 
navy said the iranian plane carrying 290 people over the persian 
gulf was mistaken for an iranian fighter

a federal judge ruled today that portions of a 
1952 law allowing deportation of aliens for advocating world 
communism are unconstitutional because they violate immigrants 
first amendment rights 
us district judge stephen v wilson also threw out a 
congressional exception to a subsequent law which gave free speech 
rights to all immigrants except members of the palestine liberation 
organization 
congress he said already has passed sufficient laws dealing 
with terrorism and his decision didnt diminish the governments 
power to deport aliens for reasons unrelated to their speech 
we do not minimize the governments concerns with foreign 
policy or national security interests wilson said reading his 
decision in a crowded courtroom nor do we in this day and age 
deny the real and lethal threat that terrorism poses for our 
nation 
our decision today however will not significantly deplete the 
governments arsenal in combatting terrorism he said 
by invoking the mccarranwalter provisions he said the 
government is trying to stifle certain ideas from entering our 
society from certain aliens 
our society however was built on the premise that only 
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper he 
added 
wilson addressed both the 36yearold mccarranwalter act and a 
1987 statute the foreign relations authorization act the latter 
act gave aliens the same first amendment rights as citizens when it 
came to deportation proceedings but made several exceptions such as 
the denial of first amendment rights to members of the plo 
the four provisions of the mccarranwalter act which he ruled 
unconstitutional provide that aliens may be deported if they 
advocate or are affiliated with a group that advocates the doctrines 
of world communism totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful 
destruction of property 
the plo exception that was struck down provided for deportation 
of plo members who advocated the same ideologies 
the judge ruled in the case of eight immigrants who appealed 
deportation proceedings begun under the mccarranwalter act after 
they were arrested by federal agents and held without bail

a us air force a10 attack jet crashed and 
burned in britain this morning while on a routine training flight 
the pentagon said the pilot might have ejected safely 
it was the second crash of a thunderbolt jet in europe in two 
weeks another a10 crashed dec 8 in tracy ariz 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman originally identified 
the plane as an a10 aircraft from the 81st tactical fighter wing at 
raf bentwaters england the air force later corrected that 
statement saying the a10 was assigned to the 10th tactical fighter 
wing at raf alconbury 
howard said the plane crashed at 953 am est about four miles 
south of st ives or about 25 miles north of cambridge 
the pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we dont know 
his status howard said 
the aircraft was carrying dummy bombs and practice 33mm 
ammunition the spokesman said 
he said he had no information about damage on the ground 
the a10 a twinengine jet designed to support troops by killing 
enemy tanks and other ground targets is an older model plane 
designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude 
and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition 
the thunderbolt ii is also one of the safest planes 
statistically in the air force inventory 
nonetheless todays crash comes just two weeks to the day after 
another a10 slammed into the west german city of remscheid killing 
five and injuring dozens 
that crash prompted the united states and its nato allies to 
agree to suspend all a10 flights over west germany until jan 2 
the suspension was ordered as german political parties and public 
interest groups increased their demands for an end to lowlevel 
flight training in germany 
on the same day as the crash in remscheid an a10 crashed near 
the heart of the tohono oodham indian reservation about 80 miles 
west of tuscon but the pilot ejected safely 
howard refused today to discuss the possible cause of the crash 
in england saying the pentagon was still awaiting initial reports 
from the scene and confirmation that the pilot survived 
the thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with 
the air force in 1977 the plane is no longer in production but the 
air force has more than 700 of them in its inventory 
statistically the a10 over time has been the safest fighter or 
attack plane currently in the inventory the aircraft has chalked up 
a major accident rate of less than 4 class a mishaps per 100000 
flying hours over its lifetime which now consists of more than 
175 million flight hours 
a class a mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or 
damage exceeding 500000 to an aircraft 
the air force describes the a10 as a simple effective and 
survivable twinengine jet aircraft that can be used against all 
ground targets the aircraft has excellent maneuverability at low 
air speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery

two skeletons at first thought to be the 
remains of crime victims have turned out to be part of an ancient 
indian cemetery a rare find on this part of floridas gulf coast 
an archaeologist says 
the site which holds the remains of more than 20 indians was 
discovered last week on a secluded gulffront lot where a home was 
being built 
the remains are thought to be at least 400 and possibly as much 
as 2600 years old said sonny cockrell director and chief 
archaeologist of the warm mineral springs archaeological research 
project 
he was called in after state investigators determined the 
skeletons were historical in nature not evidence of a crime 
the site is in an area where indian cemeteries are thought to be 
rare cockrell said 
cockrell said the indians adults teenagers and infants buried 
in fetal positions appear to have belonged to a buffer society 
that was weaker than tribes that settled to the south and to the 
north of it 
one indication of that is a lack of ceremonial pottery which 
more advanced and wealthier societies used in burying their dead he 
said 
for the last week cockrell and amateur archaeologists have been 
digging on the spot with help from residents 
we just found a nice tooth here a couple of minutes ago said 
residenet david atwater i keep saying im going to get a bottle 
of glue and put it all together

evidence mounted thursday that 
terrorists blew up a pan am jumbo jet bound for new york killing 
all 259 people aboard and at least 22 in this scottish village that 
was showered with flaming debris 
terrorist threats that a pan am jet was marked for destruction 
and the boeing 747s sudden plunge from the sky wednesday night 
prompted experts to focus on sabotage 
britains top antiterrorist official joined the britishled 
investigation on thursday 
transport secretary paul channon announced that the planes 
flight data and cockpit voice recorders had been found 
officials said the jet jammed with christmas travelers likely 
exploded in the air before it plummeted from an altitude of 31000 
feet 
witnesses said the giant aircraft was bathed in flame before it 
plowed into a hillside outside the southwestern scotland village of 
lockerbie and bounced into the center of town gutting dozens of 
homes and raining burning metal onto cars 
people living up to 70 miles away reported finding clothing and 
christmas cards hurled from the jet 
an anonymous caller claimed thursday that iranians blew up the 
plane in retaliation for the us navys downing of an iranian 
airliner carrying 290 people in july tehran strongly denied 
involvement 
the flight originated in frankfurt west germany changed planes 
in london and was in the air 54 minutes when it vanished from radar 
screens at 719 pm 219 pm est on wednesday authorities said 
the plane was on course and weather conditions would not have 
contributed to the crash 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the state department 
warned us embassies about dec 7 about a bomb threat that had been 
made two days earlier against pan am jetliners flying from frankfurt 
he said he could not explain why more people had not been 
notified of the threat and he acknowleged that the public should 
be aware of such threats 
i think that certainly will be looked at fitzwater told 
reporters 
no passenger list was released but the dead included 38 syracuse 
universty students who had been studying abroad and were returning 
home for the holidays at least six us servicemen and bernt 
carlsson of sweden the un commissioner for namibia 
the jet which destroyed 40 houses killed 22 people on the 
ground most of them occupants of cars pounded by wreckage said

police superintendant angus kennedy told a news conference 
thursday that the bodies of 150 passengers including three 
children had been recovered 
us ambassador charles h price ii and scottish secretary 
malcolm rifkind inspected the wreckage and both said they believed 
there had been an explosion in the air 
the aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion said 
rifkind the cabinet minister responsible for scotland 
in july the us warship vincennes downed an iran air airbus 
a300 in the persian gulf saying it was thought to be a hostile 
warplane 
an anonymous man telephoned the associated press bureau in london 
and said we the guardians of the islamic revolution are 
undertaking this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the iran air 
plane by america a few months ago and keeping the shahs family in 
america we are very proud the caller said then hung up quickly 
the same group had also claimed responsibility last year for a 
car bombing in london that wounded amir hussein amirparviz 
chairman of the national movement for iranian resistance and a 
former iranian cabinet minister under the shah 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi categorically denied any 
iranian involvement and expressed regret at the crash said irans 
official news agency 
in washington a government source said the us embassy in 
helsinki finland received a telephone threat about two weeks ago 
from a person claiming to belong to the abu nidal group a radical 
palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks 
the caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a pan am plane and 
that it would be carried by a woman said the government source who 
spoke on condiition of anonymity 
the government source said that threat was the basis for posting 
notices at us embassies 
finlands foreign ministry said it had found no direct connection 
between the bomb threat it received and the crash in scotland the 
ministry confirmed the israeli and us embassies had received 
several threats during the year by an arab resident most recently 
on dec 5 
the foreign ministry statement indicated the authorities knew the 
callers identity and said the suspected phone caller has not 
left finland since he made his last threatening telephone call 17 
days ago 
in the investigation so far no direct connection has been 
found between the arab living in finland and the air accident in 
question the statement said 
in moscow the us embassy last week warned american diplomats 
that a bomb threat had been made against a pan am flight flying from 
frankfurt to the united states sometime in december pan am flight

in frankfurt the airport security chief said officials stepped 
up security at pan am after receiving threats against the us 
airline earlier this month 
pan am spokeswoman pam hanlon in new york said the airline was 
aware of the threat and put supplementary security procedures in 
effect not only at frankfurt but airports around the world 
she said pan am received a memo from the federal aviation 
administration about the threat and quoted the document as saying 
the information in this bulletin is soley for the use of us 
carriers and airport security personnel and may not be further 
disseminated without the specific approval of the director of civil 
aviation security 
scotland yard said the head of its antiterrorism squad 
commander george churchillcoleman had taken charge of the london 
end of the crash inquiry 
sabotage is the most likely explanation said david kyd 
spokesman for the international air transport association in geneva 
he said structural failure was unlikely 
freddie yetman technical secretary of the british airline pilots 
association agreed the possibility of structural failure is 
almost too remote to be considered 
federal aviation service records showed the 18yearold aircraft 
had 21 mechanical defects since 1980 a boeing spokesman said the 
plane was taken out of service last year for substantial 
modifications and any structural deficiencies observed earlier 
would have been corrected 
pratt amp whitney in east hartford conn which built the engines 
said the plane could have continued to fly even if three of its four 
engines had failed 
ariel merari an israeli terrorism expert interviewed by a 
british tv network said iranian involvement was unlikely given 
tehrans eagerness to improve relations with the west 
he pointed to the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command a hardline faction opposed to plo leader 
yasser arafats attempts to project a moderate image 
merari said a very large terrorist team from that group was 
rounded up in west germany last month 
they apparently had in mind exactly what happened now 
merari said it is possible that another team like the one that 
was caught was in the area and succeeded in carrying out its 
mission

three swiss red cross delegates flew home from 
cyprus on thursday completing an unprecedented evacuation of the 
relief organizations personnel because of terrorist threats 
switzerlands ambassador to lebanon also left the middle east 
nation for cyprus on thursday 
speculation grew that palestinian radicals opposed to the plos 
new policy toward israel were behind the death threats against red 
cross personnel and also behind last months kidnapping of peter 
winkler the red cross chief delegate at sidon in south lebanon 
winkler was released dec 16 after being held hostage for 29 
days foreign minister rene felber said last weekend that winklers 
captors had identified themselves as the organization of socialist 
revolution a dissident palestinian group 
a senior official in the foreign ministry alfred ruegg told 
swiss radio thursday it seemed that the same group also issued the 
death threats against winklers colleagues in lebanon 
in beirut leaders of lebanons rival moslem and christian 
governments were dismayed at the action of the international 
committee for the red cross 
we cannot but express our regret over the evacuation said 
gen michel aoun who heads the christian military cabinet 
salim hoss prime minister of the moslem cabinet instructed 
lebanons chief diplomat in geneva salim naffaa to express 
lebanons dismay and surprise at the swiss action an official 
statement said 
michel dufour the chief red cross delegate in lebanon arrived 
in switzerland on a swissair flight from cyprus with two companions 
michel berger and peter franken 
on an earlier ferry from lebanon to cyprus they were accompanied 
by swiss ambassador dino sciolli his wife and nine other swiss 
nationals believed to be staff from the embassy in beirut all 
declined to talk to reporters 
airport officials said sciolli did not accompany the red cross 
delegates to switzerland and would remain in nicosia cyprus for a 
day or two before returning to switzerland for consultations 
eleven other red cross officials arrived in larnaca on the south 
coast of cyprus wednesday and flew on to zurich several hours later 
it was the first evacuation because of terrorist threats in the 
125year history of the organization 
a swiss radio commentary said thursday that syrianbacked 
opponents of arafat seemed to be trying to spread doubts about his 
renunciation of terrorism and to sabotage the plo talks with the 
united states which opened last week after a 13year ban 
it noted that winkler had been abducted two days after the 
palestine national council meeting in algeria declared an 
independent palestinian state and recognized israels right to exist 
in geneva last week for a special un general assembly meeting 
on palestine arafat followed this up with an explicit recognition 
of israels right to exist 
a red cross spokesman carlos bauverd said wednesday that the 
threats must be seen in the context of the situation following the 
general assembly but refused to elaborate 
the palestine liberation organization is an umbrella for several 
groups including arafats fatah several plo members angered over 
arafats comments have said they would work to oust him from the 
plo leadership 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are missing and 
believed held hostage in lebanon the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
he was abducted march 16 1985

the commerce department reported thursday that 
orders for big ticket durable goods excluding the volatile 
defense category climbed 18 percent in november a healthy 
increase which economists took as a sign of continued strength in 
the new year 
when defense orders are included total durable goods orders 
edged up only 01 percent in november to a seasonally adjusted 
12289 billion that followed a giant 29 percent rise in october 
the overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders 
in october and then depressed when military orders returned to more 
normal levels last month 
discounting the swings in defense orders in the civilian 
category climbed 18 percent in november the best showing since a 
52 percent august increase civilian orders had risen only 02 
percent in october 
analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian 
orders saying the orders should keep us plants humming through 
the first half of 1989 
this was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure 
that the economy will keep growing next year said michael evans 
head of a washington forecasting firm 
analysts were particularly impressed with a 26 percent rise in 
orders for business capital goods which rose to 355 billion this 
industry is closely watched for signals of business intentions to 
expand and modernize 
it was the first increase in this category after two consecutive 
monthly declines and eased fears that business investment could be 
tapering off 
with business investment bouncing back up there is a lot less 
reason to worry about next year said david wyss an economist 
with data resources inc on the whole things look pretty good 
with strong shipments and strong orders promising continued growth 
the manufacturing sector has been a driving force in the economy 
this year as us companies have benefited from a weaker dollar 
which has boosted overseas sales the boom in exports has in turn 
led to a surge in investment spending as businesses rushed to 
expanded production facilities 
for november much of the strength in durable goods items 
expected to last at least three years came from an 81 percent 
rise in demand for electrical machinery which climbed to 205 
billion much of this increase reflected rising demand for defense 
communications equipment 
total defense orders however fell by 176 percent to 881 
billion following a 431 percent surge in october the defense 
category is highly erratic depending on when big government 
contracts are signed 
transportation orders fell 63 percent to 3269 billion as 
virtually all categories except civilian aircraft suffered setbacks 
orders for nonelectrical machinery edged down 05 percent to 
2105 billion the third consecutive decline 
orders for primary metals rose 08 percent to 1252 billion and 
now stand 114 percent higher than they were a year ago 
shipments of durable goods increased 1 percent to 1196 billion 
in november following a 03 percent advance in october

a bottlenose dolphin escaped from a 
net and dragged a diver underwater thursday prompting a rescue team 
to postpone efforts to move the stranded mammal to warmer waters 
until after the new year 
officials said they were worried about injuries to the dolphin 
and to divers after spending two days trying to capture the 
creature they planned to resume the effort jan 4 
marine experts launched the rescue effort because of fears the 
dolphin which failed to migrate south for the winter would starve 
to death or catch pneumonia in the chilly waters of the broad bay 
a coast guard helicopter stood ready to carry the dolphin to 
north carolinas outer banks to join other dolphins migrating south 
robert schoelkopf director of the marine mammal stranding center 
in new jersey led more than 50 volunteers during seven hours of 
rescue attempts wednesday and half as many when the undertaking 
resumed after dawn thursday 
rescuers netted the dolphin nicknamed rascal but it hit the net 
with such force before swimming free that a diver was caught in it 
and dragged under officials said 
he was uninjured but that incident and the ripping of the net on 
a buoy prompted rescuers to quit around midmorning 
the biggest thing is safety for both the fish and the people 
said robert helfant captain of the virginia beach emergency medical 
services dive team 
schoelkopf leader of the rescue effort said he wanted to get a 
net with a smaller mesh so the 6footlong dolphin could not become 
entangled and strangle or drown he also said he wanted more divers 
in order to make the job less dangerous 
about a dozen people gathered on shore to watch the divers chase 
the dolphin cursing and shouting as the dolphin swam with the 
encircling net a local radio station broadcast the event live 
the dolphin knows how to swim better than divers said mark 
jacobson a volunteer rescuesquad member standing by in case a 
diver was hurt 
among the spectators were residents who got to know the dolphin 
that lingered in the bay over the summer and fall 
fay edwards said the mammal often swam beside her rowboat he 
came along one day and i could have reached out and touched him 
she said i would really be upset if he dies

israels rival likud and labor parties formed 
their second successive national unity government thursday to 
meet the challenge of the more moderate plo image and the 
palestinian declaration of independence 
developments in the international arena and challenges we are 
facing require us to bridge our differences to overcome the 
obstacles and dangers we face prime minister yitzhak shamir told 
the knesset or parliament in an hourlong speech 
the new 28member cabinet led by shamir of the conservative 
likud bloc was presented to the knesset for ceremonial approval 
two labor members and one from likud abstained in protest 
a coalition was necessary because neither major party won control 
of the 120member knesset in the nov 1 election likud got 40 
seats the centerleft labor party 39 and smaller parties the other 
41 
similarly indecisive results in the 1984 election led to the 
first coalition in which the two major parties were equal partners 
this one is led by likud 
in his speech to the knesset shamir called making peace the 
first and foremost objective 
he urged palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
end their yearold uprising so they and israel can create 
conditions for a peaceful coexistence freedom and prosperity for 
you and your children 
the prime minister again ruled out talks with the palestine 
liberation organization and said negotiations should be based on the 
usmediated camp david accords of 1978 which provide for direct 
talks between israel and jordan and the palestinians the plo and 
arab nations want an international conference under un sponsorship 
labor party leader shimon peres who will be deputy premier and 
finance minister supports an international conference he also has 
recommended elections in the occupied territories to choose 
palestinians who would negotiate with israel 
peres was foreign minister in the outgoing government but moshe 
arens of likud has the portfolio in the new one holdovers include 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor and industry minister ariel 
sharon of likud 
shamir urged the united states to reverse its decision to deal 
directly with the plo after yasser arafat the plo chairman 
recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization and shamir said 
thursday according to our knowledge it has not changed its skin 
its habits its evil charter and the terror that it uses we still 
hope the united states will reconsider its decision 
foreign policy guidelines adopted by the coalition reject 
establishment of a palestinian state in the occupied lands and call 
for five to eight new jewish settlements to be built in the there in 
1989 
the coalition agreement was signed about two hours before the 
knesset session and toasted with wine asked after the ceremony how 
he felt peres said 
i am not excited im worried we have problems we are not 
going to be able to solve over a glass of wine 
he pledged to work for reform of a complicated electoral system 
that favors small parties and makes coalitions necessary

jean harris the school headmistress 
convicted in the shooting death of her lover scarsdale diet 
developer dr herman tarnower is hoping for christmas clemency 
after eight years behind bars 
gov mario cuomo traditionally grants clemency at christmastime 
and sometimes new years and friends and supporters are working 
hard to make sure the 65yearold mrs harris is on the list 
she tries not to think about it at all said her lawyer 
michael kennedy its so important to her she tries not to 
concentrate on it i think shes guardedly optimistic 
mrs harris was convicted of murdering tarnower a cardiologist 
at his home in purchase north of new york city prosecutors said 
she killed her lover of 14 years in a jealous rage over his romance 
with a younger woman 
the former head of the exclusive madeira school for girls in 
mclean va maintained she shot tarnower by accident in 1980 when 
he tried to stop her from committing suicide 
mrs harris who is serving a 15yearstolife sentence at the 
bedford hills correctional facility became eligible for clemency in 
august when she served half her minimum sentence the unofficial 
benchmark 
clemency commutes a sentence and allows an inmate to become 
eligible for parole final release from prison must be granted by 
the state parole board 
inmates generally have to serve their minimum term before 
appearing before the parole board in mrs harris case that would 
mean 1996 
she declined a request for an interview and has not commented on 
the issue she wrote a letter applying for clemency but it has not 
been released 
health can be a factor in clemency approval mrs harris suffered 
at least one heart attack in prison her age and good prison record 
also may be grounds she has been active in the childrens center at 
the prison has taught and wrote two books 
cuomos decisions on clemency are based on advice from a 
threeperson executive clemency board which reviews opinions from 
those involved in a case the clemency process is kept under close 
wraps until a decision is announced 
each case is decided on its own merits said cuomo spokesman 
terry lynam theres no concern of public relations if an inmate 
is deserving of clemency he or she will get it 
mrs harris applied for clemency in 1986 but it was denied on 
the ground that she had not served half her minimum sentence 
anne lennox a former professional colleague who now heads the 
jean harris defense fund in monroe nh said mrs harris knows to 
be realistic about clemency 
shes been turned down once lennox said shes seen other 
women in prison be turned down 
last summer lennoxs group and harris son began soliciting 
letters and petition signatures on her behalf as many as 10000 
letters and 25000 signatures have been sent to cuomo said the son 
james harris 
tarnowers sister nieces and nephews wrote cuomo last summer 
opposing release said the family lawyer roger sirlin 
russell leggett the judge who sentenced harris has backed 
harris bid for clemency rich weill a spokesman for the 
westchester county district attorney would not say whether his 
office has voiced an opinion to the governor

the soviet union and china have bought more 
grain from the united states including wheat sold to beijing at 
subsidized prices the agriculture department said thursday 
moscows order was for an additional 1 million metric tons of 
corn for delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between 
the two countries the department announced china bought 400000 
tons of wheat under the subsidy program 
the latest sales by private exporting companies brought total 
corn sold to the soviets to almost 803 million tons in the 
agreements sixth year which began oct 1 last year us corn 
sales to the soviet union totaled slightly less than 52 million 
tons 
exporters are required to report foreign grain sales of 100000 
tons or more to the usda within 24 hours smaller sales are reported 
weekly 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 1 million tons of 
corn would be about 394 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 103 million 
although no wheat has yet been sold for 198889 delivery under 
the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
532500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said seven export companies were 
involved in the sale of 400000 tons of wheat to china some 147 
million bushels having an estimated farm value of 58 million at 
recent prices 
the companies included cargill inc 90000 tons central states 
enterprises 40000 tons nissho iwai american corp 30000 tons 
bunge corp 40000 tons tradigrain inc 50000 tons tradecom 
inc 30000 tons and louis dreyfus corp 120000 tons 
sims said the sales were part of an authorized 1 million tons of 
wheat announced on dec 7 under the export enhancement program or 
eep with the latest sales china now has 210000 tons remaining 
under the authorization 
the program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated 
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to 
meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the seven exporters for the latest deal 
averaged 2310 per ton of wheat or about 63 cents per bushel

the us death rate from diabetes the nations 
seventhleading killer dropped sharply during the 1970s but seems 
to have stalled in recent years the centers for disease control 
said thursday 
the mortality rate from diabetes as the primary cause of death 
fell by an average of 4 percent each year from 1970 to 1979 from 
21 such deaths per 100000 people in 1970 to 149 nine years later 
the cdc said 
the number of deaths caused by diabetes dropped from 38324 in 
1970 to 33192 in 1979 
but in the following six years the mortality rate from diabetes 
fell only slightly to 147 per 100000 by 1985 the latest year for 
which data are available the number of deaths actually increased 
somewhat to 36969 
thats something we dont have an answer for said robert r 
german a cdc diabetes specialist after 1980 for some reason it 
appears to be leveling off 
the same pattern is evident in statistics on cases in which 
diabetes was part of the diagnosis but not necessarily the primary 
cause of death 
the rate of diabetesrelated deaths dropped from 757 per 100000 
people in 1970 to 577 in 1979 then went up to 591 by 1985 german 
said the number of deaths dropped from 137241 in 1970 to 128373 
in 1979 then went up again to 148284 in 1985 
were in the process of trying to determine what is going on 
german said 
overall the decline in mortality from diabetes may reflect two 
factors the cdc said a trend away from listing diabetes on death 
certificates or an actual decline as a result of improved treatment 
and longer survival for patients 
diabetes typically is present in older people in 1980 84 
percent of diabetes patients were 45 or older and 40 percent were 
65 or older the cdc said 
the cdc report concerns diabetes mellitus which is widely 
referred to simply as diabetes 
according to the american diabetes association more than 11 
million americans suffer from diabetes a disease caused by the 
bodys inability to produce or properly use insulin a hormone 
needed to convert sugar into energy 
complications from diabetes include blindness heart and kidney 
disease nerve damage and gangrene that can cause loss of limbs

there have been instances in which we will ask the parties to 
freeze the status quo while we sort out the facts 
the investigation deals with possible violations of the sherman 
antitrust act sheehan said 
the sherman act among other things prohibits anticompetitive 
agreements among competitors or monopolistic conduct 
the renegotiated joint operating agreement announced in october 
calls for cox enterprises which owns the news to share in the 
operating profits of the knightridderowned miami herald until the 
year 2021 whether the news is publishing a newspaper in miami or not 
the amended agreement calls for cox to receive a lower percentage 
of operating profits from the herald than it has been receiving 
since the two papers engaged in a partial merger 22 years ago 
for knightridder the renegotiation means being relieved of 
having to cover 85 percent of the news losses through 1996 the 
revised agreement calls for miami herald publishing co to absorb 
half of the news losses in 1989 and none after that 
a week after the renegotiation cox announced it would fold the 
92yearold evening news on dec 31 if it is unable to sell the 
newspaper 
the herald took over advertising circulation and printing of the 
two newspapers in 1966 under a joint operating agreement the news 
and editorial operations of the two papers remained separate 
the chairman of cox james kennedy said in a letter to the 
justice department last month that the news which now has a 
circulation of 48000 had sustained losses of more than 90 million 
since the operating agreement was implemented the news circulation 
in 1966 was 112000

irans prime minister on thursday denied 
there was an iranian role in the fiery crash of a pan am jet and he 
expressed regret over the incident 
prime minister hussein musavi categorically denied any iranian 
involvement in the crash said the official islamic republic news 
agency monitored in nicosia 
pan am flight 103 on its way from london to new york after 
originating in frankfurt crashed wednesday evening in the scottish 
village of lockerbie 
there were two claims of responsibilty one from a litleknown 
supposedly proiranian group and one from the abu nidal radical 
palestinian faction 
an anonymous male telephoned the associated press in london 
identifying himself as from the guardians of the islamic 
revolution he said the group had staged what he called a heroic 
execution in reprisal for the downing of an iran air airbus a300 
by the us navy cruiser vincennes in july in which 290 people were 
killed 
the navy said the plane had been mistaken for an iranian fighter 
we are very proud the caller said before hanging up 
as far as is known the group surfaced only once before last 
year in london when it claimed responsibility for a car bombing in 
which an iranian dissident leader was wounded 
beyond that nothing is known of the group and proiranian 
terrorists constantly change the group names they use 
the downing of the iranian jet raised what iranian president ali 
khamenei termed a wave of rage among his countrymen and howls 
for revenge the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for allout war 
against the americans 
but more pragmatic figures led by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani sought to cool tempers and turn the disaster to irans 
political advantage 
on july 20 the united nations security council unanimously 
adopted a resolution expressing deep distress over the downing 
a mild formulation aimed at avoiding a us veto 
president reagan offered to compensate the families of the 
iranian victims as a humanitarian gesture but the state department 
said thursday the reparations have not been made because washington 
has rejected any scheme under which the money would be handed over 
to the iranian government iran insists that it handle the payments 
it also emerged thursday that us diplomats had been warned of a 
bomb threat against a pan am jet flying from frankfurt to the united 
states sometime in december 
a us government source in washington said the embassy in 
helsinki received a threat earlier this month from a person claiming 
to speak for abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council faction which 
has been blamed for scores of terrorist attacks over the last decade 
in the past abu nidals renegade palestinian group has rarely 
if ever been known to give advance warning of its attacks which 
included the december 1985 massacres at the rome and vienna airports 
but the terrorist masterminds organization which has bases in 
lebanon has been expected to strike to thwart plo chief yasser 
arafats peace initiative and dialogue with the united states 
in 1974 the palestine liberation organization expelled abu 
nidal born as sabri albanna and sentenced him to death in 
absentia for trying to assassinate arafat because of his 
increasingly moderate policies 
in helsinki the foreign ministry said it had found no direct 
connection between the bomb threat and the crash the ministry 
indicated in a statement that it knew the caller that he had made 
several threats and that he had not left finland since making his 
last threat on dec 5 
the us embassy in moscow last week warned american diplomats of 
the threat on a pan am flight from frankfurt to the united states 
the warning left it to the diplomats discretion whether to change 
their travel plans 
but despite the warning us state department personnel 
reportedly were on the plane the washington post on thursday quoted 
an unidentified state department spokesman as saying six members of 
the departments diplomatic security service who were returning 
from beirut were aboard 
state department spokesman ben justesen told the associated press 
he could not confirm the report 
in nicosia a nonamerican diplomatic source who refused to be 
further identified said at least three americans working at the us 
embassies in cyprus and lebanon were killed the source quoted us 
ambassador bill k perrin as confirming that a us marine guard 
from the embassy in nicosia was on the plane 
the domestic british news agency press association reported that 
the initial information about the bomb threat had come from the 
mossad israels intelligence service

doctors should not give in to pressure to write 
phony excuses so healthy workers can call in sick say two 
researchers 
dr marsha cline holleman of the family practice center at baylor 
college of medicine in houston and her husband warren l holleman 
an assistant professor of ethics there suggested doctors not 
provide excuses unless they actually treat the patients 
physicians also should develop guidelines for handling requests 
for school and work releases they said 
until guidelines are developed doctors will continue to be 
placed in a compromising position medically ethically legally 
and financially while doing little to ameliorate the problems of 
casual absenteeism the hollemans wrote in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
while the report had no figures on the number of casual 
absentee cases per year the hollemans said earlier research 
indicated casual absenteeism has been on the rise for 25 years and 
may cost us industry 30 billion a year 
workers who appear well often tell doctors they are sick the 
researchers said in addition they said some employers pressure 
doctors to reveal confidential information about a patients 
illnesses to get a patient back to work 
the worker has few incentives to tell the truth and the 
physician has few incentives to ascertain the truth the hollemans 
wrote the physician who questions the veracity of this workers 
claim can look forward to losing the workers family as patients 
or if they remain to a strained relationship the physician who 
refuses to sign this workers release might feel awkward about 
charging a fee for the visit 
they said absenteeism often is triggered by workplace atmosphere 
finances or other nonmedical problems that should be dealt with by 
someone other than a doctor 
asking physicians to police the problem is treating the symptom 
rather than the disease they wrote 
at least one ethics professor was troubled about the idea of 
strict guidelines 
kenneth vaux a professor of ethics at the university of illinois 
college of medicine in chicago said doctors should retain their 
traditional roles as protectors of the weak 
guidelines allowing absence excuses only with treatment could be 
aimed at generating more medical business and workers may not be 
well protected if companies hire doctors to screen patient care he 
said 
we cant go to the point where a physician becomes an 
instrument of societal vigilance and societal vengeance vaux said

authorities said thursday they had 
been warned weeks ago that terrorists threatened to smuggle a bomb 
aboard a pan am jet and they defended the security arrangements at 
the frankfurt airport 
airport officials said they tightened security after the threats 
authorities also indicated a passenger would have to board an 
aircraft in order to ensure that explosivesladen luggage could be 
loaded on the plane 
questions about security at the airport and whether adequate 
warnings were given about terrorist threats were raised thursday 
after a boeing 747 crashed into a village in southwest scotland on 
wednesday night killing all aboard 
flight 103 originated on a boeing 727 in frankfurt it flew to 
london where the flight is transferred to a boeing 747 the 
fourengine jumbo jet was in the air 54 minutes when it vanished 
from radar screens at 719 pm 219 pm est on wednesday 
the plane had been bound for new york once there it was to 
continue on to detroit on a boeing 727 
the international air transport association said thursday that 
sabotage was the most likely explanation for the crash in the 
town of lockerbie 
a hesse state official said he doubted a bomb could have been 
placed aboard the flight before it took off from frankfurt 
we have no indication there was a lapse in security at 
frankfurt airport thomas pier an official with the hesse economics 
ministry said on the ardtv network thursday the economics 
ministry is responsible for air traffic in hesse state 
hans neusel state secretary at the federal interior ministry 
told the ard we dont believe there are any soft spots in 
security at frankfurt airport 
we do everything we can to minimize security risks he said 
neusel indicated it would be difficult for someone to put a bomb 
on board the plane at frankfurt without boarding the aircraft 
himself 
no luggage would be flown for a passenger who has not appeared 
for boarding neusel said in an ard interview 
harald kosel a pan am spokesman in frankfurt indicated that it 
would be unlikely for a passenger to have left the plane in london 
while baggage was transferred to the boeing 747 for the flight to 
new york 
i think thats out of the question kosel said he said pan 
am had developed a system that makes sure passengers are on board if 
their luggage is on board 
frankfurt airport officials tightened security at pan am after 
receiving tips earlier this month that a bomb might be smuggled 
aboard one of the carriers jets the airports security chief said 
thursday 
the official horst harnstein said the tips were for the 
transportation of a bomb from frankfurt heading in the direction of 
the united states 
there were indications in that direction harnstein said in a 
telephone interview as a result we stepped up security measures 
for pan am 
there were solid indications that it was to be pan am 
harnstein added the international air transport association said it 
believed sabotage is the most likely explanation for the crash 
we were struck by the similarity of this accident and the air 
india 747 that came down in june 1985 off the irish coast after a 
bomb exploded that had been put aboard by a terrorist said agency 
spokesman david kyd 
us government and airline industry officials acknowledged that 
they received a threat in early december that pan am might be a 
target of a terrorist attack the federal aviation administration 
issued an intelligence alert on dec 5 warning that there might 
be a bombing attempt against a pan am flight from frankfurt 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said that on that day 
an anonymous caller told the us embassy in helsinki that an 
unidentified person in helsinki would unwittingly take the device to 
frankfurt and eventually onto the usbound flight 
another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried 
by a woman 
ms oakley said the caller targeted pan am and told the embassy 
that individuals who would provide the device have ties to abu 
nidal leader of a radical palestinian faction 
the finnish foreign ministry said an arab resident had made 
several bomb threats during the year most recently on dec 5 but 
that in the investigation so far no direct connection has been 
found between the arab living in finland and the air accident in 
question 
the statement said authorities knew the callers identity and 
that he had not left finland since dec 5

the arab leagues representative urged the 
reagan administration on thursday to reopen the palestine liberation 
organizations office in washington and to condemn new israeli 
settlements on the west bank as illegal 
in a yearend meeting with reporters clovis maksoud said it was 
illogical to keep the office closed now that the administration 
had begun talks with the plo 
the state department citing involvement in terrorism by 
individuals and organizations associated with the plo had the 
plos washington information office shuttered last december a 
subsequent us move to also close the plo mission to the united 
nations in new york was reversed in federal court 
last week secretary of state george p shultz concluded chairman 
yasser arafat had renounced terrorism shultz recommended the 
opening of a substantive dialogue with the plo the first talk 
was held last friday in tunisia 
maksoud said what the united states did about the plo office and 
israeli settlements on the west bank were the two litmus tests 
of american policy in the middle east 
he predicted presidentelect bush would be less ideological 
than president reagan on the arabisraeli conflict and that james a 
baker iii because of his closeness to bush could be the most 
powerful secretary of state in history 
however maksoud said he did not expect a reversal of the strong 
us support for israel that characterized reagans two terms the 
arab envoy said he hoped for a modification of american policy 
looking to 1989 maksoud said this is the year of challenge 
this is the year that we will see either reconciliation or 
confrontation in the area 
maksoud said the opening of us talks with the plo was not a 
breakthrough and did not call for the euphoria expressed in 
some arab quarters 
on the other hand the arab league official said fears expressed 
in israel were contrived paranoia designed to undercut the us 
move 
he said us officials meanwhile were a little bit on the 
defensive unecessarily in warning the plo that the dialogue would 
be suspended if terrorism recurs 
maksoud said the officials were acting as if theyve done 
something wrong but necessary 
the arab envoy began with a statement of deep sorrow and 
regret that a pan american world airways jumbo jet had crashed in 
scotland on wednesday killing at least 279 people 
an anonymous caller to the associated press office in london on 
thursday claimed responsibility for the crash and said it was in 
retaliation for the downing of an iranian airliner by the us navy 
in july and for keeping the family of the late shah of iran in the 
united states 
maksoud said if the crash was not the result of malfunction it 
has to be condemned without qualification 
on another subject the arab league representative questioned 
us statements that libya was on the verge of fullscale production 
of chemical weapons and that reagan had not ruled out taking 
military action 
maksoud said it was not true that libya was producing 
chemical weapons 
this atmosphere of creating a focus on libya as a scaepgoat may 
be an attempt directly or indirectly by the israelis to shift from 
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the plo and the 
arabs are undertaking maksoud said 
he said the us accusation that libya was on the verge of 
fullscale production might give a prior pretext for those who 
want to strike at an arab country in order to prevent the maturing 
of the moderating developments that are taking place in the arab 
world as a result primarily of the arabplo dialogue

an unprecedented plan by boston university to run 
chelseas troubled schools deprives parents of a say in their 
childrens education the state education commissioner and teachers 
unions charged thursday 
education commissioner harold raynolds said the chelsea school 
committee was abdicating its responsibility to run the communitys 
schools and depriving chelsea residents of a role 
this is a sort of modernday tragedy reynolds said 
the private university has proposed taking over the management 
and operation of chelseas schools for 10 years schools in the 
industrial city north of boston have among the lowest test scores 
and highest dropout rates in the state 
the school committee is the local school board in chelsea and is 
expected to endorse the takeover 
the massachusetts federation of teachers opposes the plan 
the citizens ought to control their schools the citizens ought 
to determine the climate in which their children learn said 
annemarie dubois union director it is not necesssary to take the 
public out of public education 
the plan calls for bu to raise money from private sources and use 
students and faculty from its school of education 
other elements in the proposal raised hackles including the 
universitys request for an exemption from state openmeeting and 
openrecords laws and freedom from liability if students parents or 
others sue it 
the state wants those elements revised and an amended plan was 
due thursday but it did not materialize 
peter greer dean of the school of education and university 
attorney michael rosen said those concerns were being worked out and 
a revised plan would be ready next month 
once the chelsea school committee agrees to the contract it 
still requires the legislatures approval 
greer said that at a public meeting last month in chelsea 38 out 
of 44 people spoke in favor of the plan the people of chelsea 
have said please do this he said 
teachers unions have questioned the constitutionality of the plan 
but failed several weeks ago to persuade a judge to bar the contract 
from going forward 
about 275 chelsea teachers are represented by the 650000member 
american federation of teachers which also opposes the plan 
we delude ourselves into thinking this is a model or experiment 
that could be duplicated said bella rosenberg assistant to 
national aft president albert shanker 
this is a small school district that is about to become a 
colony of a very large university ms rosenberg said

a woman has launched a drive to save a 
minnesota mans dream of planting a tree for each of the 58000 
americans killed and missing in the vietnam war 
we cant allow what vietnam veterans are trying to do to be 
destroyed said terry thompson of geoffrey steiners veterans 
national living memorial geofs forest is a symbol 
thompson who is not a veteran started the drive to save the 
100acre memorial after she read that the land will be sold at a 
foreclosure sale jan 4 unless about 400 in back taxes and the 
5400 balance on a bank loan are paid off 
steiner a 39yearold vietnam veteran has spent eight years 
planting about 35000 trees on the land in cushing about 100 miles 
northwest of st paul last year newsweek magazine cited him as one 
of 50 american heros 
steiner said he paid 23000 in cash for the land in 1980 after 
selling his home in minneapolis in 1984 he used the property to 
secure an 8000 bank loan 
thompson a resident of dayton ohio brought up the issue at her 
local chapter of the vietnam veterans of america where she works as 
a volunteer legislative coordinator 
the group not only voted to donate 500 but also authorized 
thompson to send letters to 400 other chapters representing about 
35000 members 
we dont have that much time thompson said wednesday she 
said shes motivated by the belief that the forest will be good for 
vietnam veterans 
the vietnam war was a different kind of war that involved a 
type of fighting that so psychologically affected the vets she 
said these guys have to be brought out of their shells 
steiner a marine who served in vietnam in 196768 and was 
wounded during the tet offensive said he felt fantastic when 
thompson told him about her campaign to save the forest i was 
ready to give up totally he said 
he said those affected by the war say they are thankful for 
washingtons vietnam memorial but like his forest idea because it is 
a living memorial 
pows can come home and walk through the forest with their 
families and say somebody cared enough to plant these trees in their 
honor steiner said

more than 1300 people swarmed into a hotel 
to apply for about two dozen jobs at a coal mine this week a 
turnout a company official thursday called a sad statement about 
eastern kentuckys economy 
im pleased on one hand but its kind of depressing on the 
other said ed stone personnel director for sidney coal co 
some applicants drove more than 100 miles to apply for the 19 to 
25 jobs that should be available when sidney coals mine in pike 
county reopens early next year stone said 
most of the applicants were unemployed miners from pike county 
and surrounding areas in kentucky and west virginia stone said 
the new hires would help during a yearlong renovation of the 
mine which eventually might employ about 100 people he said 
the volume of applications was the largest for such a small 
number of jobs stone said he had seen in 19 years of work in the 
coal industry the positions pay a minimum of 11 per hour and 
include full benefits 
stone said he had begun sorting through the stacks of 
applications filled out monday and tuesday im going to have a 
very short holiday he said of the task 
sidney coal was a focus of a bitter threeyear selective strike 
by the united mine workers at massey coal co which owns sidney 
coal agreed in may to pay 447 million to settle a lawsuit with 
the umw 
the settlement called for 35 union miners to go back to work for 
a contractor the strike began when two mines owned by sidney coal 
were sold to massey in 1984 and massey announced the mines would 
become nonunion 
despite the past union problems a number of the people who 
showed up to apply for the openings were past or present umw 
members including union workers laid off this year from the scotts 
branch mine in northern pike county 
the unemployment rate for pike county was 121 percent in 
october according to the latest figures available 
i wish we could help everybody but unfortunately we cant

soccer players all split an eyepopping 734 million pot thursday in 
the worlds richest lottery making christmas much merrier for 
thousands of spaniards 
millions nationwide bought tickets or shares of tickets in the 
wildly anticipated yuletide drawing the total pot 83 billion 
pesetas made it the richest since king carlos iii established 
spains first lottery in 1763

the administration is extremely concerned 
about libyas chemical weapons factory and hasnt ruled out using 
military force against it president reagans spokesman said 
thursday 
the president was quite clear that military action is an 
option were not ruling it out white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said in answer to reporters questions about a comment 
reagan made in a television interview 
the united states is extremely concerned about production 
facilities in libya which we believe can produce enormous 
quantities of chemical weapons fitzwater said 
asked if a us strike against the facility is under 
consideration the spokesman said im not saying its our 
intention we will not rule out options 
reagan in an interview taped for broadcast thursday evening on 
abctv said military action against the site has been discussed by 
the united states and its allies 
well let me say thats a decision that has not been made 
yet reagan said in the interview portions of which were 
broadcast on abcs world news tonight wednesday 
were in communication with our allies and with nato forces 
and all and were watching very closely that situation but even if 
i had made a decision i couldnt 
david brinkley who conducted the interview then broke in to 
say you wouldnt want to tell it now 
no reagan responded 
asked whether military action had been discussed with the allies 
the president said we are discussing with them and we want to 
pin down completely so that there is no question but that thats 
what it is a plant that he is building and one of tremendous 
size 
reagan said the united states knows where the factory is but he 
did not disclose the site 
meantime thursday libya reiterated its denial that the facility 
is a chemical weapons plant and declared its full commitment to 
all international conventions on such arms the official news 
agency jana reported 
it said that the reagan administrations aim was to blunt the 
development of arab societies and to this end it will market all 
the excuses it can find to mislead and trick world public opinion 
libya contends the plant produces pharaceuticals 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that the 
united states believes the plant can produce enormous quantities 
of chemical weapons 
answering questions thursday after announcing cabinet 
nominations presidentelect bush said his administration also would 
be committed to seeing that libya does not develop a chemical 
warfare capability 
bush said he hoped us allies or other countries in the middle 
east could help stop development of chemical weapons but very few 
of them have any influence whatsoever over mr gadhafi libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi 
he added this is is a matter of real concern to us and yes 
we all ought to be committed to seeing that that plant not be 
committed to spread further destruction 
clovis maksoud the arab leagues representative here said it 
was not true that libya was producing chemical weapons 
this atmosphere of creating a focus on libya as a scaepgoat may 
be an attempt directly or indirectly by the israelis to shift from 
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the plo palestine 
liberation organization and the arabs are undertaking maksoud 
told reporters 
he said the us accusation might give a prior pretext for 
those who want to strike at an arab country in order to prevent the 
maturing of the moderating developments that are taking place in the 
arab world as a result primarily of the arabplo dialogue 
the washington post has quoted intelligence sources as saying the 
factory is in a large complex 35 miles southwest of tripoli the 
complex reportedly includes a plant intended to produce aerial bombs 
and canisters to carry poisonous gas the sources also said it is 
guarded by sovietmade missiles 
a senior administration official told the post that military 
action was one of several options that had been discussed but it 
is not under active consideration 
more than 100 countries will represented in paris on jan 711 to 
discuss enforcement of the 1925 geneva convention outlawing poison 
gas and other chemical weapons secretary of state george shultz 
will represent the united states at the conference which was 
proposed by reagan 
fitzwater said he did not know whether the option of military 
force against the site will be raised at the conference but he said 
the complex is representative of the kind of problems that will 
be dealt with at the meeting 
us warplanes bombed libya in 1986 in retaliation for the 
terrorist attack on a west berlin disco where two us servicemen 
and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 soldiers and 
others were injured 
at the state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the 
united states has been consulting for several months with its allies 
in an effort to withhold from libya the technology needed to make 
the chemical weapons plant operational 
she said japan west germany and other governments had been asked 
not to give libya any help 
japan has assured the united states that it has stopped work on a 
metallurgical plant in libya that had been linked to the chemical 
weapons plant she said and we believe they have stopped

with presidentelect bushs apparent support 
the labor department is looking at lifting the last of its 
prohibitions against industrial homework in the garment industry 
officials said thursday 
the department last month two days after bushs election 
announced it was lifting bans on work in the home in five apparel 
fields effective jan 8 the move potentially would cover an 
estimated 50000 to 75000 workers 
but in what became a major showdown within the reagan 
administration between labor secretary ann mclaughlin on the one 
hand and officials in bushs office and the white house budget 
office on the other the department continued the ban in the womens 
apparel industry for the time being 
the last week of october according to labor department 
officials mrs mclaughlin received a letter from bush saying i 
look forward to the next step referring to womens apparel 
mrs mclaughlin said in an interview thursday she told budget 
director joseph wright on tuesday she intends to issue a notice of 
proposed rulemaking and schedule hearings in february on the womens 
apparel ban before leaving office next month 
my intention all along was to go with a twotier approach 
she said because womens apparel was more controversial the idea 
was to do more of a negotiated rulemaking there after getting six or 
eight months experience with the others 
the bans on garment industry homework were imposed 47 years ago 
to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other lowwage 
workers getting rid of the prohibitions has been a priority of 
reagan and bushs vice presidential task force on deregulation for 
nearly eight years 
the administration succeeded in 1984 in removing the ban on 
knitted outerwear but unions effectively blocked the lifting of the 
prohibitions in the six other fields through the courts 
however two days after the election the labor department 
published new regulations effectively allowing homework on gloves 
and mittens embroideries buttons and buckles handkerchiefs and 
some jewelry that left only womens apparel still entirely under 
the prohibitions after jan 8 
the international ladies garment workers union which represents 
about 170000 of the estimated 500000 workers in womens apparel 
said wednesday it will file suit next week to block the jan 8 
regulations 
mrs mclaughlin said she had hoped to negotiate a rulemaking 
between ilgwu president jay mazur and industry officials to also 
remove the ban on womens apparel homework 
however other officials including bushs counsel c boyden 
gray and former white house budget director james a miller iii 
wanted apparel homework included in the proposal last month 
according to several sources 
gray did not return a telephone call seeking comment thursday 
allan mcmillan a deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of 
enforcing the homework regulations said the department was still 
looking at several options that could stretch out the time before 
the ban is removed on womens apparel 
clearly the demographics show that worker flexibility is 
something we need to achieve he said the question is how we 
balance that with effective enforcement of federal labor 
standards its my hope we will be able to conclude this process 
fairly quickly 
susan cowell a vice presdent of the ladies garment workers said 
the union had anticipated a renewed attempt to remove the homework 
ban in womens apparel 
the sense we had always gotten was that bush was very much a 
part of this initiative she said without a ban there is no 
hope of enforcing the fair labor standards act in this industry 
what makes enforcment difficult and violations of minimun wage 
and other labor standards common she said is the mobile nature of 
the industry and its domination by tens of thousands of small 
contractors typically employing between 10 and 50 workers each

six youngsters who scrounged for two weeks 
for a place to live after being abandoned by a drug addict mother 
have been split up among foster homes and friends according to 
authorities who want to reunite them 
anytime we can help a family we certainly will go the extra 
yard to try to do that said norman reim a spokesman for the 
state division of youth and family services the goal is to get 
them in a permanent home 
the six four children ages 11 to 16 two with children of their 
own told police they wandered for a place to live after their 
37yearold mother left them 
they was going from building to building door to door said 
32yearold gabriel rosa the oldest daughters boyfriend and father 
of her 2monthold son who took the family into his onebedroom 
apartment thats a shame 
the camden housing authority had threatened to evict rosa because 
the youngsters were unauthorized to live in the apartment he said 
not knowing what to do the children called police 
detectives took the children to police headquarters after 
meeting tuesday with a social worker the family was separated 
its bad for kids to be without a home and struggling from 
house to house said reim who declined to comment specifically 
about the case certainly in this business weve seen it all 
thirteenyearold cassandra wilson and her brother james wilson 
11 were placed in foster homes rosas girlfriend joanne victor 
16 and their son moved in with him patricia wilson and her 
7weekold son moved in with friends at the housing project 
police searched for the familys mother sandra wilson the 
children said their troubles began about two years ago when their 
mother started smoking cocaine 
although the familys house was heavily damaged in a june fire 
the family continued to live there using candles and kerosene 
heaters but after the gas was shut off for nonpayment in november 
the youngsters moved out 
they said their mother left them at the end of november taking 
her welfare check three days later they said she came back and 
took 405 in cash from the family and left again

a us air force pilot ejected safely from 
his a10 attack jet thursday just moments before it crashed into a 
field officials said 
the pilot lt frank cavouti of garden city ny was ending a 
training mission and approaching for a landing at the royal air 
force base in alconbury when the crash occurred said an air force 
spokesman 
it was the second crash of a twinengine thunderbolt jet in 
europe in two weeks a third a10 crashed on dec 8 in tracy ariz 
cavouti was being held for observation at a military hospital 
his jet crashed several miles west of this central english village 
and about 60 miles north of london said the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
witnesses said it appeared the pilot was trying to miss this 
village and hit the open field 
tony woolsenhomes 53 of the nearby village of earith said he 
watched cavoutis jet circle for about 30 minutes and knew it was 
in trouble it seemed to me he was circling to look for somewhere 
away from the village to put the plane down 
the spokesman said a board of officers would investigate the 
incident 
he said cavouti was assigned to the 10th tactical fighter wing at 
alconbury the aircraft was carrying dummy bombs and practice 33mm 
ammunition he added 
the a10 a jet designed to support troops by hitting enemy tanks 
and other ground targets is an older model plane designed to be 
highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude and to carry a 
lot of bombs and ammunition 
thursdays crash came two weeks after an a10 slammed into the 
west german city of remscheid killing five and injuring dozens 
the remscheid crash prompted the united states and its nato 
allies to agree to suspend all a10 flights over west germany until 
jan 2 the suspension was ordered as west german political parties 
and public interest groups increased their demands for an end to 
lowlevel flight training in west germany 
on the same day as the remscheid crash an a10 crashed near the 
heart of the tohono oodham indian reservation about 80 miles west 
of tuscon the pilot ejected safely 
the thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with 
the air force in 1977 the plane is no longer in production but the 
air force has more than 700 of them in its inventory 
statistically the a10 over time has been the safest fighter or 
attack plane now in the inventory

the federal trade commission on thursday issued 
complaints against six of the nations largest book publishers for 
allegedly discriminating illegally against independent bookstores by 
selling books at discounted prices to major chains 
the complaints alleged that the six publishers sell books at 
lower prices to large bookstore chains including the nations three 
largest waldenbooks inc b dalton bookseller and crown books corp 
the complaints were issued against harper amp row publishers inc 
the hearst corp and william morrow and co inc macmillan inc 
the putnam berkley group inc random house inc and simon 
schuster inc 
the complaints charged that the publishers use pricing schedules 
that charge a lower price per book on large orders they said the 
publishers also treat orders placed by bookstore chains as a single 
order even if the books are shipped separately to individual chain 
outlets 
the chain stores therefore allegedly pay lower prices than 
independent bookstores that receive shipments as large as or larger 
than the shipments to individual chain outlets the ftc said 
the higher prices paid by independent stores have hurt them 
financially limiting their ability to complete with the bookstore 
chains for sales to consumers and retail locations the complaints 
said 
in response simon amp schuster said in a statement our pricing 
practices have always been fair and have resulted in providing the 
consumer with the broadest range of books at the lowest possible 
price the ftc is going to have a real fight on its hands 
william t loverd a random house spokesman said the company had 
not seen the complaint and could not comment on specifics but he 
said the company has been cooperating with an ftc investigation of 
pricing practices of publishers and we are convinced that our 
pricing of books is both lawful and fair 
harper amp row spokeswoman barbara hufham said her company also 
cooperated with the ftcs eightyear investigation we are 
convinced our trade practices are entirely proper she said 
the ftc voted 31 with one abstension to issue the complaints 
which begins a proceeding in which a formal hearing will be held if 
the allegations are upheld the ftc could order the publishers to 
stop the pricing practices 
ftc chairman daniel oliver said in a dissenting statement that 
the practices did not appear to violate antitrust law and probably 
have not hampered competition 
additionally he said most of the price differences probably are 
justified by differences in the cost of selling to different buyers 
and the publishers cited probably are responding to competition from 
other publishers

president reagan said in an interview broadcast 
thursday that some homeless people sleep on grates or on the grass 
from their own choice instead of going to shelters 
in the television interview with abc news reagan also said the 
possibility of soviet president mikhail gorbachev being ousted has 
to be considered although he has seen no indication of it 
abcs david brinkley asked reagan for his views on the homeless 
noting that some of them sleep in a park about 200 yards from the 
oval office where the interview was taped on wednesday 
the president responded doesnt that go back that there are 
always going to be people they make it their own choice for 
staying out there 
there are shelters in virtually every city and shelters here 
and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to 
going into one of those shelters he said 
mitch snyder a nationally known advocate for the homeless who 
runs a shelter in washington reported during a bitterly cold spell 
earlier this month that people had to be turned away from shelters 
already filled beyond capacity 
asked whether the opposition to gorbachev in the soviet union was 
strong enough to force him out reagan said that up until now the 
government of that huge country or nation is the communist party 
which is really a tiny elite of the population of the soviet union 
but they literally appoint so it is possible for and weve 
seen it in the past soviet leaders to suddenly be ousted i dont 
see any indication yet or threat of that but i think its something 
that has to be considered if you look at their past history 
in a portion of the interview that was broadcast on abcs 
wednesday evening news program reagan said that the united states 
and its allies were discussing the possibility of taking 
military action to destroy a huge chemical weapons factory in libya 
although no decision has been made 
in the hourlong interview the president also suggested that 
maybe our founding fathers made something of a mistake in the 
method of reapportionment by which state legislators redraw 
congressional district lines after each census 
i think that a bipartisan citizens committee representing both 
parties and topranking citizens would perhaps do a job that would 
be based on the needs of the district he said repeating 
criticism that the present system is too partisan 
the president also elaborated on his recent attack on an 
interlocking iron triangle of members of congress the news 
media and special interest groups 
he said that the media which reports on whats going on here 
in this company town well let me say that the incumbents have 
more access to th press than some unknown newcomer also the 
interests of many of these special interests the press is aware of 
and comments on and so forth 
on the subject of the homeless reagan also said that a large 
proportion of those people were homeless because of changes in 
laws with regard to the mentally impaired that they could only be 
committed to an asylum or a mental hospital if they represented a 
threat a danger to others or to themselves 
and the result of that was that all across this country 
people particularly in you call it retarded walked away from 
those institutions they wanted freedom but they walked out to 
where there was nothing for them 
reagan who told brinkley that i like people i really do 
was asked for his views on some individuals including former white 
house chief of staff donald t regan who wrote a book critical of 
some of the presidents working habits and of the predilection of 
his wife nancy for astrology 
i was shocked by some of the things that he chose to say in his 
book he said 
he also said that he has been frustrated by congressional 
opposition to his program of aid to rebels fighting the sandinista 
regime in nicaragua but some lawmakers who have been to nicaragua 
are totally on our side in getting rid of that government

two screenwriters one american one 
soviet are betting that capitalists and communists alike can find 
humor in a comedy about a us businessmans efforts to open a chain 
of fried chicken restaurants near moscow 
jeremy leven of woodbridge and valentin chernyck have been 
struggling for four weeks to overcome differences in language and 
culture and create the first draft of the script to no money down 
in zagorsk 
chernyck and director alexander pankratov who joined the 
screenwriters and their translator two weeks ago and from mosfilm 
the largest of 17 film studios in the soviet union 
the film will tell the story of a nearbankrupt capitalist peter 
washington who is induced by the soviets to go to a village north 
of moscow to open a chain of restaurants called chicken heaven 
its 100 percent a comedy but it deals with what really would 
happen if an american capitalist came over to a soviet village that 
was struggling financially and was under the gun to become 
profitable leven said there are problems and we dont hide 
them bad materials materials they cant get 
in the end capitalism absolutely blows up in his 
washingtons face leven said filming will begin by july he 
said 
chernyck won an academy award in 1980 for moscow does not 
believe in tears which was voted best foreign language film 
leven wrote the screenplay for the movie creator and the book on 
which it was based 
leven said outside investors will put up at least 5 million 
while the soviets will put up at least an equivalent sum leven said 
he has not yet lined up a major studio to distribute the film in the 
united states 
it should be a very extraordinary film because we want it to 
play in both countries simultaneously without changes said leven 
soviet studios have recently gained greater independence but 
remain dependent on government financing of production and 
distribution said vladimir padunov a professor at wheaton college 
in norton mass and an authority on the soviet film industry 
chernyck said one difficulty in writing the screenplay was a 
different in approaches to humor our jokes and humor are not so 
fast as american humor when jeremy told us a joke we would start 
laughing after five minutes he said 
the film will be in both english and russian with no dubbing or 
subtitles but characters will usually speak no more than a sentence 
or two so that viewers can figure out the meaning much of the 
humor will be visual leven said 
in one scene leven said the american and a soviet counterpart 
become covered in mud and are ushered into a tiny bathroom to 
undress the two are left standing naked facetoface 
the soviet igor looks at peter and shrugs to show he is 
unimpressed then says america 
peter looks back and shrugs to show he too is unimpressed and 
says russia 
igor then says in russian no big deal 
peter nods back no big deal

ordered his officers to stop telling people to have nice day 
now he wants them to shed their dragnet image and put on a 
happy face 
in his new years message to the 39member department richard 
mears said a smile makes people feel good and it may even 
preclude an attack of ulcers a smile also can defuse a hostile 
situation and comfort the distressed he said 
last years message urged officers to clean up their language and 
advised them to can have a nice day farewells especially when 
handing out tickets 
mears admitted he has mellowed over the years from his 
justthefactsmaam approach to law enforcement 
he cautioned officers however not to smile at inappropriate 
times such as when you arrest someone you know is going to jail 
for a hundred years 
smile when irate citizens are screaming in your face but dont 
smile when seconds later youre winding the cuffs to them mears

the defense department should not have to 
cannibalize existing nuclear weapons for their tritium but the next 
administration faces unspecified hard choices energy secretary 
john herrington said thursday 
and cannibalization of some warheads to build or upgrade others 
is something that we must look at to keep our options open 
herrington said in a speech at the national press club 
but as things now stand i do not anticipate the need to 
resort to such methods 
tritium used in thermonuclear weapons and as a booster in some 
plutoniumpowered weapons decays rapidly and must be replenished 
from time to time in bombs or warheads half of any amount of 
tritium becomes inert helium in 126 years 
tritium has been made in three nuclear reactors at the 
departments savannah river plant in south carolina reactors that 
have been closed for safety upgrading since last summer or earlier 
herrington has said it will be spring or summer before the 
reactors can be restarted and there have been some estimates that 
production could not be resumed until the end of the year 
an advisory committee has refused to approve the departments 
restart plans and herrington disclosed that he had accepted the 
panels recommendation in one principal area of concern 
piping at the three reactors will be subjected to ultrasonic 
tests for cracks he said 
asked after his speech how much time those examinations might add 
to preparations for restarting the reactors herrington said i 
dont know it depends on what we find 
the recommendation he said is reasonable and i had pretty 
much concluded myself that we ought to do it 
in recent weeks cracks have been discovered on piping of two of 
the reactors a headquarters team has been in savannah river this 
week assessing the significance of those findings 
herrington has been granted an additional 900 million for 
nuclear waste cleanup activities in the budget being submitted to 
congress next month but the white house turned him down for 360 
million more ordering him to use unspent departmental funds to 
bridge the gap 
we are still working inside the department to figure out how 
that will be done he said 
the amount of money being given to us is reasonable and a good 
start he said i do not say that without saying this there are 
going to be some hard choices and the bush administration will 
have to review reagans budget decisions 
herrington has estimated that 110 billion will be necessary to 
clean up weapons plant waste over the next 40 years and some other 
estimates range up to 170 billion 
asked if the press had fallen down in not spotlighting 
environmental and safety concerns before herrington said on the 
local level the press has been extremely diligent in following 
congressional developments hearing testimony and congressional 
reports for almost four years 
but it probably took an unexplained power surge at one of the 
savannah river reactors last august to draw national attention he 
said 
on civilian subjects herrington said it was an outrage that 
the nation had two completed but unused nuclear power plants in an 
area vulnerable to electricity brownouts the seabrook plant in new 
hampshire and the shoreham plant on new yorks long island 
i speak as a citizen concerned about energy independence as a 
taxpayer concerned that new york is going to issue taxfree bonds to 
buy the plant and tear it down 
the plants would replace oilburning plants help counter the 
greenhouse effect global warming that results from fossil fuel 
use and help reduce emissions of pollutants that cause acid rain he 
said 
i think its an outrage i want to see those plants operate 
i guarantee you if we dont turn this around we will be 
importing japanese reactors 
the two plants have been unable to win federal approval of 
emergency evacuation plans because of opposition from state 
governments the massachusetts government in the case of the new 
hampshire plant 
but the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission has 
recommended approval of a 25 percent power license for shoreham and 
may grant a testing license to seabrook in the next several weeks

disclosure that a caller had warned that 
someone would unwittingly carry a bomb aboard a pan am flight from 
frankfurt to new york recalled a similar incident involving an 
israeli airliner in 1986 
jordanianborn nezar hindawi was condemned on oct 24 1986 to a 
45year sentence for handing boobytrapped hand baggage to his 
pregnant irish girlfriend as she prepared to board the flight on 
april 17 that year 
an el al guard found the bomb as the woman annmarie murphy 
passed through security british officials said the bomb consisted 
of three pounds of czechoslovakianmade plastic explosive hidden 
behind a luggage panel and likely would have killed all 375 
passengers aboard the el al boeing 747 murphy told officials she 
had no knowledge of the bomb and she was not charged 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said thursday that on 
dec 5 an anonymous caller told the us embassy in finland that a 
pan am flight would be bombed 
she said an unidentified person in helsinki would unwittingly 
take the device to frankfurt and eventually onto the usbound 
flight 
however the departments top counterterrorism official said in a 
television interview that it was still not clear whether pan am 
flight 103 had fallen victim to terrorism and that authorities 
frequently received detailed threats that turned out to be false 
in fact ever since this method was tried and thwarted on an el 
al plane in london two years ago weve had a number of times people 
come to us saying that someone in an unsuspecting way is going to 
carry a bomb on a plane so its not unusual to have that kind of 
specificity in a threat l paul bremer told cable news network 
mrs oakley said the caller told embassy officials that the 
individuals who would provide the device would have ties to abu 
nidal leader of a radical palestinian faction 
another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried 
by a woman 
the finnish foreign ministry said in a statement thursday that an 
arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year most 
recently on dec 5 but that in the investigation so far no 
direct connection has been found between the arab living in finland 
and the air accident in question 
the statement said authorities knew the callers identity and 
that he had not left finland since dec 5 
the sentence handed down in the el al case in 1986 was the 
longest ever in a british court 
during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that hindawi 
entered britain in late january 1986 on a syrian diplomatic passport 
with a false name and that his visa applications had been endorsed 
by syrian foreign ministry officials 
the prosecution presented evidence that hindawi then 32 was 
acting in concert with syria for a group called the jordan 
revolutionary movement he allegely received help from the chief of 
syrian air force intelligence gen mohammed khouli an aide to 
syrian president hafez assad 
murphy testified during the trial breaking into tears and 
accusing the defendant of intending to kill her and their unborn 
child the baby a girl was born in july 
after the bomb was discovered hindawi fled to the syrian 
embassy where prosecutors said he met with syrian ambassador loutof 
haydar hindawi then was taken to a syrian safe house in london 
where syrian embassy employees cut and dyed his hair however he 
fled in fear and turned himself in to police 
the incident prompted britain to sever diplomatic ties with syria 
and other members of the european common market to impose trade and 
diplomatic sanctions against that nation in october 1986 the 
measures were lifted the following july after western officials 
concluded that syria had curtailed its support for terrorism

lech walesa expressed satisfaction thursday 
with communist party statements on apparent willingness to change 
the labor union system but said he wants solidarity legalized 
before talking with officials 
it is a signal from the party but we are saying once again 
that without solidarity without relegalizing solidarity there is 
no possibility of agreement walesa told the associated press from 
his home in gdansk 
at a meeting wednesday of the party central committee polish 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski replaced six hardline politburo 
members with seven younger pragmatists and prominent party liberal 
stanislaw ciosek 
solidarity adviser andrzej stelmachowski said as a first step 
it was a very positive one because the group of hardliners seems to 
be far weaker now than before therefore the climate for further 
steps is far better 
in another effort to accelerate reforms parliament thursday 
considered a package of bills that would change the polish economy 
dramatically 
if passed the bills will allow anyone to start a private 
business liberalize foreign investment in poland reform banking 
and permit free exchange of zlotys for foreign currency 
deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula introduced the package as 
the basis for freedom equality and competition in the economy 
the duty of the socialist state is to assure people equal 
opportunity further possibilities should depend on their 
individual achievements this is the only way one should understand 
justice he said 
at the party meeting wednesday prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski praised walesas recent statements and said he judged the 
solidarity leader a reliable and moderate partner for talks 
in the clearest signal that the party may lift its sevenyear ban 
of the independent trade union rakowski told the committee to poll 
local party members on walesa and solidarity which was crushed by a 
1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year 
rakowski told them to return their answers at the 230member 
bodys next session in midjanuary your answer will decide 
about what we will do and what we do will decide the future of 
socialism in poland he said 
however he also asked the opposition to come to the negotiating 
table without conditions 
we are saying clearly that we desire together with the opzz 
official unions and moderate leaders of former solidarity to 
discuss the future different from the present model of the trade 
union movement 
walesa said it was a pretty farreaching statement and we hope 
that we are thinking about the same thing to see whether this is 
so we still have to conduct direct talks we want it formulated 
in a clearer manner 
he warned the party should remember that the working people are 
at the limits of their endurance just listen to what people are 
saying in the shops whats in store for us is dangerous if we dont 
solve the most significant problems 
walesa said a chicken costs 6 while some people earn only 54 a 
month so it is a drama 
if nothing is done by spring then we wont be able to do 
anything at all he said the people have had enough 
the opposition movement has united behind walesas call for 
legalizing solidarity before it will take part in proposed talks on 
economic reforms and greater democracy

a federal judge on thursday struck down 
portions of a 1952 law allowing the government to deport aliens for 
espousing antiamerican beliefs saying the provisions violate 
immigrants freespeech rights 
us district judge stephen v wilson also threw out an exception 
to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights for all immigrants 
in deportation proceedings but members of the palestine liberation 
organization 
wilson said congress already has passed a powerful array of laws 
dealing with terrorism and his decision would not significantly 
deplete the governments arsenal in combating terrorism 
the ruling came in a twoyearold case involving seven jordanians 
and a kenyan who were arrested held without bail and subjected to 
deportation proceedings under the mccarranwalter act a federal 
immigration judge released them and the government eventually 
dropped mccarranwalter proceedings against all but two although it 
sought deportation of the others on technical grounds 
a government attorney said wilsons ruling would be appealed 
wilson on struck down sections of the 1952 mccarranwalter act 
providing for deportation of an alien who advocates or is 
affiliated with a group that espouses world communism 
dictatorship or unlawful destruction of property 
the ideological provisions of the mccarranwalter act do not 
withstand first amendment analysis he said 
he said the mccarthyera statute was overbroad and could 
cause deportation for something as simple as wearing a political 
button 
he cited the landmark 1969 decision in brandenburg vs ohio in 
which the us supreme court held that the government can only 
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action 
the judge also ruled that the plo exception to the 1987 foreign 
relations authorization act violated guarantees of due process and 
equal protection under the law 
in this case the government is trying to stifle certain ideas 
from entering our society from certain aliens the judge said 
our society however was built on the premise that only through 
the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper 
the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee had sued the 
justice department on behalf of the immigrants and the battle was 
joined by the american civil liberties union and the center for 
constitutional rights based in new york 
one of the original defendants khader hamide 34 called the 
decision a victory for arab and palestinian immigrants 
we feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the 
palestinian issue hamide said we can speak our minds on the 
uprising on the west bank and in gaza and express our opinions 
freely without the fear of being put in jail 
david cole of the center for constitutional rights said the 
judges ruling on the plo exception to the 1987 law means that 
congress cannot make politically motivated distinctions in 
providing first amendment rights to aliens 
paul hoffman of the aclu noting the governments decision to 
appeal said the case would most likely be decided by the us 
supreme court 
when it is decided i think it will be one of the handful of 
major first amendent cases that have ever come down in this 
countrys history he said

indiana university has asked the 
director of the kinsey institute an internationally known sex 
research center to resign the institute confirmed thursday 
the university requested june reinischs resignation in a letter 
written monday by morton lowengrub dean of the college of arts and 
sciences lowengrub cited concerns about the quality of research 
during reinischs six years as director and about her management 
ability 
reinisch said wednesday that opponents have yet to come up with 
one stitch of evidence to support any of their claims 
the institute which was founded in 1947 by alfred c kinsey is 
affiliated with and financed largely by indiana university but is a 
separately incorporated entity university officials do not have the 
authority to fire reinisch who reports to a 10member institute 
board 
lowengrub said in his letter that university officials including 
president thomas ehrlich were convinced that the institute has 
not satisfied the universitys reasonable expectations with regard 
to the quality of its research under reinischs leadership 
he said the opinion was based on a review committees study 
lowengrub could not be reached by telephone thursday and a 
spokeswoman said the dean would have no comment on the kinsey 
situation 
five university faculty including lowengrub sit on the kinsey 
board which met wednesday the board issued a statement thursday 
saying it was studying the review committee report and would not 
comment until it was done 
some board members however strongly supported reinisch 
i think shes doing an excellent job said kinsey trustee 
sherry hackett president of the ultimate experience inc of beverly 
hills calif 
mrs hackett blamed the attacks on reinisch 45 on sex 
discrimination jealousy and pardon me stupidity 
david hendin another trustee and vice president of united 
features syndicate which distributes reinischs the kinsey 
report column also supported reinisch and said the criticisms 
would not have surfaced had she been male 
eugene eoyang also a trustee and a professor of east asian 
languages said in a written response to the review committees 
report that it was biased incomplete and flawed by poor review 
techniques 
if june reinisch has not spent as much time as she should have 
on her research its because she has been promoting the institute 
indefatigably in other ways eoyang wrote 
the review committees report said the institute was in crisis 
over the last five years relatively little has resulted from 
its endeavors the research library and collections have continued 
to deteriorate the institute has become progressively more isolated 
from the indiana university faculty and it has been beset by nearly 
continuous personnel problems the report said 
reinisch a tenured professor in the universitys psychology 
department said she would not comment further until the institutes 
trustees finished their review of the report

the fourparty working commission on cambodia met 
thursday to discuss withdrawal of vietnamese troops the crux of a 
fivepoint plan proposed by prince norodom sihanouk unofficial 
leader of the rebel movement 
in bangkok thailand guerrilla leaders and officials of the 
association of southeast asian nations ended a twoday meeting to 
prepare for peace talks with vietnam thailand indonesia the

regional organization 
li zhaoxing a spokesman for chinas foreign ministry said in 
beijing it is imperative for vietnam to show its sincerity by 
pulling out and repeated chinas demand for international 
supervision of the withdrawal 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and has said it will 
remove all occupation forces by 1990 it claims to have taken out 
50000 soldiers this year which it says is half the total but 
china and other nations say most of the withdrawals were merely 
troop rotations 
the working commission was formed last month to seek a political 
solution it includes representatives of the government vietnam 
installed in phnom penh the capital the khmer rouge whose 
government the invaders overthrew and guerrilla groups led by 
sihanouk cambodias former ruler and by son sann 
cambodian government delegate hor nam hong demanded at the 
thursday meeting that sihanouks plan include an end to guerrilla 
activity an idea opposed by the khmer rouge and the other two rebel 
groups the plan now provides for a withdrawal timetable accompanied 
by dismantling of the vietnamese client government and the khmer 
rouge exile regime 
sihanouk also has rejected hongs proposal that subcommittees be 
created to examine the plan in detail 
the session ended after hong withdrew to consult with his 
government and no date was set for the next meeting

summit meeting thursday pledging to consolidate the iraniraq peace 
drive safeguard freedom of navigation in the persian gulf and seek 
an international conference on the palestinian question 
the six member nations endorsed saudisponsored talks between the 
soviet union and afghan rebels amid speculation that oil giant saudi 
arabia was moving toward resuming diplomatic ties with moscow after 
a 50year break 
attending the fourday summit were king fahd of saudi arabia 
sultan qaboos of oman sheik jaber alahmed alsabah of kuwait 
sheik khalifa bin hamad al thani of qatar sheik zayed bin sultan al 
nahyan of the united arab emirates and sheik isa bin salman al 
khalifa of bahrain 
they stressed their resolve to strengthen collective defense 
capabilities and boosted economic integration plans with a manama 
declaration calling for speededup efforts toward a gulf common 
market 
in a closing communique read by council secretarygeneral 
abdullah bishara of kuwait the group said it backed efforts by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to promote a peace treaty 
between iran and iraq to formally end their 8yearold war iran and 
iraq agreed to a unsponsored ceasefire in august 
the summit appealed for world support for an international 
conference on the palestinian question to pave the way for a lasting 
arabisraeli peace and an independent palestinian state it said the 
palestine liberation organization must take part in such a 
conference 
the gulf cooperation council was formed mainly as an economic 
alliance eight months after the gulf war broke out in september 
1980 but the conflict prompted efforts for military integration as 
well 
among steps approved by the council in its drive for a gulf 
common market was one entitling a citizen of any member nation to 
own shares in companies in another member country 
the six leaders requested an arab league foreign ministers 
conference in a new push to end lebanons 13yearold civil war 
they expressed support for egypts reinstatement into the 
22member arab league nearly a decade after egypts membership was 
suspended to protest its 1979 peace treaty with israel 
the leaders pledged to abide by oil production quotas agreed by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries in november to 
take effect jan1 and urged other opec member states to observe 
their quotas 
saudi arabia the emirates qatar and kuwait belong to the 
13member cartel bahrain and oman do not but all six depend on oil 
revenues 
the summit affirmed the necessity of cooperation between opec 
and other oil producers outside the organization considering that 
stability of oil prices in a collective responsibility 
runaway overproduction by some opec members in recent months has 
driven oil prices below opecs benchmark level of 18 a barrel

president reagan described as deeply 
saddened by the pan am jumbo jet crash in scotland offered 
condolences to the bereaved and help in the investigation thursday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan was briefed on 
the crash by his national security adviser lt gen colin l 
powell shortly after the plane went down on wednesday 
he said the president was continuing to receive updated reports 
on the crash of the flight from london to new york that killed all 
258 people aboard and at least 22 others on the ground 
president reagan is deeply saddened by this tragic accident 
fitzwater said the president and mrs reagan want to convey 
condolences to the families of all the victims 
the president has promised the full cooperation and support of 
the us government in the investigation he added 
the national transportation and safety board sent four 
investigators and the federal aviation administration sent three 
observers to britain but faa spokeswoman joann sloane said the 
investigation including examination of the black box flight 
recorder would be led by british agencies 
the ntsb investigators included an expert on fire damage and a 
metallurgist 
the justice department also announced it offered the services of 
the fbis forensics and disaster units in the crash investigation 
the offer of assistance was being made through l paul bremer head 
of the state departments counterterrorism office said justice 
department spokesman loye miller 
fbi director william sessions speaking with reporters in san 
francisco said he had reports of a number of calls taking 
credit for the disaster some callers claimed association with 
terrorist organizations sessions said 
sessions said fbi bomb experts will visit the crash site 
promptly and assist with a technical investigation at scotland 
yard as well 
authority for the fbi action sessions said comes from federal 
law allowing investigation abroad in cases of destruction of us 
aircraft or when americans might be victims of terrorism 
fitzwater said the president telephoned british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and told her on behalf of the american people 
i want to thank the rescue workers who responded so quickly and 
graciously our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this 
accident both the passengers on the plane and the villagers in 
scotland and with their loved ones 
reagan spoke with mrs thatcher shortly after she completed a 
visit to the crash site near the englishscottish border fitzwater 
said 
under questioning fitzwater defended the process by which the 
state department warned us embassies that a bomb threat had been 
made earlier this month against pan am jetliners flying from 
frankfurt to the united states 
he said he could not explain why more people had not been 
notified of the threat however and acknowledged that the public 
should be aware of such threats 
i think that certainly will be looked at fitzwater said 
public notification has to be considered 
presidentelect bush said that if there was hard evidence 
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not 
be averted the public should be warned 
but bush answering questions after announcing appointments to 
his administration warned against giving undue attention to what 
the terrorist wants to call attention to 
so often its best to handle these matters by aborting a 
threat bush said 
youve got to evaluate the threat and ive found with some 
experience in the intelligence business enormous numbers of 
suggestions that there is going to be some terroristic action and 
most of them never materialize said bush a former director of 
the cia

the federal aviation administration cannot run 
mock weapons through foreign airports to test security as it does 
in the united states but it can do more to help make the airports 
safer a congressional study said thursday 
the study was made public by the general accounting office was 
released a day after a usbound pan american world airways 
jetliner exploded and crashed in scotland killing all 258 people 
aboard and at least 22 people on the ground 
investigators were focusing on a telephoned threat made against 
flights on the route two weeks ago 
the faa which has imposed fines totaling 26 million against 
dozens of us airlines for safety lapses over the last six months 
uses undercover agents to smuggle fake weaponry aboard planes at 
american airports but it conducts far less aggressive inspections 
abroad 
the agency in a report released last year said that 20 percent 
of mock weapons and bombs smuggled onto planes at us airports went 
undetected with results varying widely among the 28 airports 
checked faa officials say more of the fake weapons are now spotted 
by improved airport security 
the gao an investigative arm of congress agreed with the faa 
that it could not conduct such testing at foreign airports because 
of sovereignty concerns and possible danger to inspectors 
kenneth m mead gao associate director said the study looked 
into faa inspections at five foreign airports considered likely 
terrorist targets he declined to identify them but said they did 
not include either frankfurt or london 
mead said the study was not released because of the pan am crash 
but had been scheduled for release thursday 15 days after it was 
sent to the house subcommittee on government activities and 
transportation which requested it 
raymond salazar faa director of security said the report was 
fairly complimentary of what the agency was doing abroad but he 
conceded it identified areas that need more attention 
faa inspectors check foreign airports with onsight inspections 
and interviews with local officials the study said it recommended 
that the aviation agency require its inspectors to analyze tests 
conducted by foreign officials at their own airports 
we believe the faa could enhance the overall security 
assessment process by requiring inspectors to make some analysis of 
host country test results the report said 
it also said the faa has failed to notify the state department of 
training needed for foreign airport personnel under the 
antiterrorism assistance program in fiscal 1987 the program 
trained 3000 people in 46 countries and provided 28 million worth 
of equipment to 18 countries according to the report 
the faa uses twoperson teams to inspect foreign airports 
spending from three to five days at each depending on the airports 
size 
a 1985 law requires the secretary of transportation to notify a 
foreign country when the faa concludes that security is lax at one 
of its airports 
in 600 inspections of 200 airports during 1986 and 1987 the faa 
found only two occasions where the country had to be formally 
notified that it was not meeting international standards the report 
said 
in 1986 the secretary issued public notice that the manila 
international airport was unsafe at the other airport which was 
not identified safety was upgraded within 90 days and no public 
notice was given the report said

as investigators centered on sabotage as the 
cause of a pan am jumbo jet disaster aviation experts said thursday 
a crash could be caused by a relatively small bomb if the blast 
damages a planes sensitive control systems 
depending on where a bomb is placed even a relatively small 
explosive device can fatally cripple an aircraft were not talking 
about the kinds of explosive force you would need to cripple a 
tank said john mazor a spokesman for the private air line pilots 
association 
kenneth plunkett a representative of the aviation safety 
institute agreed noting that its not the size of the bomb its 
where it is placed 
both mazor and plunkett stressed that they had no firsthand 
details about what caused the crash of pan am flight 103 in scotland 
wednesday all 258 people aboard the boeing 747 jetliner were 
killed along with 22 people on the ground in the village of 
lockerbie 
the new yorkbound flight had originated in west germany and us 
officials said thursday that american embassies had issued travel 
warnings about a recent threat that a pan am frankfurttonew york 
plane would be the target of a bomb 
aviation experts noted that the widely scattered wreckage 
witness reports of a flash of light from the jet when at a high 
altitude and its sudden disappearance from radar at 31000 feet all 
tend to support the sabotage theory 
mazor said aircraft in flight are extremely vulnerable 
aircraft have to be designed to balance the two considerations 
of structural strength versus weight he said even an aircraft 
designed to structural standards which are well above adequate for 
normal flying operations and minor problems is not going to be 
anywhere near strong enough to withhstand the effects of any 
decentsized explosive device they just arent made to withstand 
that kind of thing 
you dont even have to blow off a major piece of the aircrafts 
structure to cripple it said mazor if a bomb severs some major 
or important electrical wiring or hydraulic lines or cables you 
could lose your ability to control the airplane 
plunkett agreed speaking for the safety institute a private 
organization based in worthington ohio which has studied 
airlinerelated issues since 1972 
the biggest problem is the concussion pressure the bomb 
causes he said if the plane was at 31000 feet it was 
pressurized if a bomb goes off and punctures the outside skin of 
the plane that would cause an explosive decompression of the cabin 
and the entire aircraft 
when that happens the entire cabin fills with a mist or a 
cloud caused by the swift change in pressure he said it might 
take a little longer to affect the cockpit but the cockpit would be 
affected 
normally an explosive decompression sends a plane into an 
immediate steep dive he explained 
another possibility is that if there was a bomb the plane went 
out of control he said depending on where a bomb is located 
the explosion might cut cables or wiring and you would lose the 
ability to control the plane

pan american world airways stepped up security 
at key airports and us embassies issued travel warnings after a 
threat two weeks ago that someone would unwittingly carry a bomb 
aboard a frankfurt to new york flight officials said thursday 
while other causes have not been ruled out the investigation 
into wednesdays crash of pan am flight 103 is focusing on the 
possibility of sabotage 
the boeing 747 jetliner crashed into a scottish farming town 
killing all 258 aboard and at least 22 people on the ground the 
flight originated in frankfurt west germany and after a plane 
change in london was en route to new york when it disappeared from 
radar 
aviation experts cautioned thursday that it was too early to 
pinpoint a cause of the crash but said the widely scattered 
wreckage witness reports of a flash of light from the jet when at a 
high altitude and its sudden disappearance from radar at 31000 feet 
all tend to support the sabotage theory 
government and airline industry officials acknowledged that they 
received a threat in early december that pan am might be a target of 
a terrorist attack the federal aviation administration issued an 
intelligence alert on dec 5 warning that there might be a 
bombing attempt against a pan am flight from frankfurt west germany 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said that on that day 
an anonymous caller told the us embassy in helsinki that an 
unidentified person in helsinki would unwittingly take the device to 
frankfurt and eventually onto the usbound flight 
another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried 
by a woman 
mrs oakley said the caller targeted pan am and told the embassy 
that individuals who would provide the device have ties to abu 
nidal leader of a radical palestinian faction 
the finnish foreign ministry said in a statement thursday that an 
arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year most 
recently on dec 5 but that in the investigation so far no 
direct connection has been found between the arab living in finland 
and the air accident in question 
the statement said authorities knew the callers identity and 
that he had not left finland since dec 5 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the state department 
warned embassies of the threat two days after it first was made and 
also notified pan am and appropriate police in various parts of 
the world 
flight 103 started in frankfurt with a boeing 727 its passengers 
and their luggage were transferred to a boeing 747 and joined by 
other passengers at londons heathrow airport for the flight to new 
york the crash occurred an hour after departure from london 
mrs oakley said british authorities also were notified of the 
threat but in london a spokesman for heathrow airport frances 
aldridge told reporters i can say categorically that we have not 
heard of this 
pamela hanlon a pan am spokeswoman said in new york pan am 
had received notification from various sources that there was the 
possibility of a terrorist threat we immediately acted and 
put supplementary security procedures in effect not only at 
frankfurt but at airports around the world 
she confirmed one of the warnings came from the federal aviation 
administration but defended the airlines decision not to further 
disclose the potential for danger citing a portion of the memo that 
directed the information to be solely for the use of us carriers 
and airport security personnel and may not be further disseminated 
without the specific approval of the director of civil aviation 
security 
the faa in its alert said it was not in a position to evaluate 
the reliability of the report which named no specific terrorist 
group although it said the threat was middle east oriented 
according to sources who spoke on the condition that they not be 
identified 
according to government sources the alert was sent to airline 
security officers airport officials and specifically to pan am 
because the airline was mentioned in the threat the alert also went 
to the state department 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the agency had no comment on the 
reported alert 
a former faa official familiar with such warnings said that while 
such alerts are not infrequent they are expected to be taken 
seriously its more than a hint its a direct request to beef up 
security said the former official 
as a result of the alert airport officials at frankfurt also 
stepped up security earlier this month according to horst 
harnstein an official at the airport 
the state department meanwhile warned its embassies of the 
possible threat and at some embassies including the one in moscow 
an advisory was placed on employee bulletin boards 
the faa reports that the reliability of the information cannot 
be assessed at this point but the appropriate police authorities 
have been notified and are pursuing the matter pan am has also been 
notified william c kelly the administrative counsel at the 
embassy in moscow wrote in the advisory posted there 
in view of the lack of confirmation of this information the 
embassy leaves to the discretion of individual travelers any 
decisions on altering personal travel plans or changing to another 
american carrier the memo continued 
state department officials said at least four of those killed in 
the pan am crash were government employees including two assigned to 
the us embassy in beirut

the reagan administration said thursday that it 
was reexamining its policy against public disclosure of terrorist 
threats against commercial airliners such as the one that was made 
against pan am two weeks ago but disclosed only to diplomatic 
personnel 
pan am flight 103 originating in frankfurt west germany with a 
change of planes at londons heathrow airport crashed in scotland 
on wednesday killing all 258 people aboard and more than 20 on the 
ground 
us embassies around the world and pan am officials were 
informed about the threat against the airliner by an arab resident 
of helsinki but no word went out to the general public 
i think that certainly will be looked at presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said as controversy swirled over the 
governments policy not to inform the public of terrorist threats 
involving us carriers 
fitzwater acknowledged that the public should be aware of 
such threats public notification has to be considered 
presidentelect bush said that if there was hard evidence 
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not 
be averted the public should be warned 
but he warned against giving undue attention to what the 
terrorist wants to call attention to 
so often its best to handle these matters by aborting a 
threat bush said 
until now the policy has been for the state department to pass 
on information about terrorist threats to the carriers through the 
federal aviation administration and to the airports 
its then up to the airlines to take the precautions that they 
deem are necessary for the security of their flights state 
department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
pan am spokeswoman pam hanlon in new york said the airline 
received a memo from the federal aviation administration about the 
threat and quoted the document as saying the information in this 
bulletin is solely for the use of us carriers and airport security 
personnel and may not be further disseminated without the specific 
approval of the director of civil aviation security 
private lawyers said thursday that the fact that the us 
government and pan am were both aware of the bomb threat could raise 
liability problems for the airline but probably not for the 
government 
its a difficult area but if the government notifies the 
airline in question i think the government position is justified 
said lee kreindler a new york lawyer who specializes in aviation 
accident cases 
asked what an airlines obligation is once it has been notified 
of a specific threat kreindler said its a tough situation 
they dont have to stop operating or stop flying but certainly they 
have a duty to meticulously inspect 
he said that in other instances of terrorism involving air 
travel lawsuits have focused on airline security precautions 
the prior notification on us embassy bulletin boards is going 
to raise an interesting question for the other passengers who were 
not members of the state department staff whether they should have 
received similar notice from pan am said george n tompkins jr 
a lawyer specializing in defending airlines in accident cases 
in washington officials were bombarded with questions about the 
governments policy after powerful evidence emerged pointing to an 
explosive device as the cause of the crash of pan am flight 103 
bush said individual threats had to be evaluated ive found 
with some experience in the intelligence business enormous numbers 
of suggestions that there is going to be some terroristic action and 
most of them never materialize said bush a former director of 
the cia 
mrs oakley said that on dec 5 an unidentified individual 
telephoned the us embassy in helsinki and said that there would be 
a bombing attempt within two weeks against a pan am aircraft flying 
from frankfurt to the united states 
the conduit would be an unwitting passenger who would take 
the device from helsinki to frankfurt and then board a usbound 
flight she said 
mrs oakley said dozens of threats are received each day and all 
are taken seriously l paul bremer who heads the state 
departments counterterrorism office said there have been 87 calls 
similar to the helsinki call over the past three months 
but the dec 5 call apparently from a tipster appeared to be 
taken more seriously than most others many us embassies were 
apprised of the threat including the american mission in moscow 
where a notice of the threat was posted on a bulletin board 
ronald spiers the state department under secretary for 
management suggested that chaos would result if the government 
reacted to each terrorist threat 
one of the kind of problems you face is overkill spiers 
said you get a lot of these threats people tend to get bored 
with it 
we try to be responsible we try to make sure that everybody 
who is possibly involved receives this information but were not 
the airlines ourselves he said 
at the pentagon spokesman dan howard said no posting of the 
warning was made at the various us military commands around the 
world 
the only explanation that i have been able to get is that there 
are many of these notices sent out in the course of the year and 
they are not generally posted howard said 
he said at least six us military personnel were aboard the pan 
am flight

corpses were strewn on a golf course 
and children played beside twisted airplane wreckage thursday in 
this village scarred physically and emotionally by the pan am crash 
residents recalled whooshing noises and tremendous flames as the 
stricken boeing 747 jumbo jet roared low overhead spewing pieces 
over the rolling countryside and finally crashing in fragments 
across their streets and houses wednesday evening 
all 258 people aboard pan am flight 103 from frankfurt to new 
york via london died and as many as 22 people were killed on the 
ground some in cars hit by wreckage officials said the number of 
people on the plane was lowered when it was found that an airline 
employee was counted twice 
it is beyond ones comprehension murmured prime minister 
margaret thatcher who toured the village it is beyond ones 
imagination you have to come here to see it and to realize 
a long deep crater tore a black scar along a row of houses 
other homes drenched in flaming aviation fuel were gutted 
survivors comforted each other felt lucky to be alive and tried 
to clean up some of the mess in the town of 2500 people 
in a yard next to the main street lay the cover of one engine 
but the fence and adjacent building were undamaged children 
bicycled around a chunk of fuselage and the grocer boarded up his 
shattered store front 
scorched pillows lifejackets and fragments of clothing lay 
scattered in gardens chunks of metal some as small as coins and 
others two feet in diameter had sliced through roofs and shattered 
windows in homes and cars 
charred dollar bills a mudspattered seatbelt and tattered 
copies of the pan am inflight magazine added to the melancholy scene 
lockerbies town hall became a makeshift morgue as firefighters 
recovered remains strewn about town eight bodies lay on a 
neighboring golf course covered in tarpaulins and guarded by police 
four miles outside town the nose cone of the blueandwhite 
jumbo jet was tipped on its side in a muddy field 
therell be no christmas this year as far as lockerbie is 
concerned said bobby scott a builder who had just finished work 
wednesday night when he heard the explosion 
he dashed out to see the jet heading toward the gas station and 
watched the disaster unfold yards from him 
the plane was breaking up as he saw it come over a hill about 200 
yards from the main street that runs through the town of mainly 
twostory stone shops and houses 
there were flames everywhere and pieces dropping off the plane 
and it just kept going said scott 30 who escaped unscathed 
i was very very lucky many of us here were he said i 
think all of us just think so much of all those americans who were 
on that plane 
nora pickersgill 60 was out playing bingo when her house was 
damaged by wreckage 
normally i would have been in she said as she swept up 
shattered glass i still cant believe what happened it just 
isnt the sort of thing that happens to you just not the sort of 
thing that happens in a quiet place like this 
in sherwood park the worsthit street two houses were 
demolished and their occupants feared dead pieces of fuselage were 
embedded in gardens 
ronald miller 74 was watching television and his wife jane 
was in the kitchen getting a glass of water when the home they had 
bought six months ago was turned into a ball of flame and partially 
demolished 
i heard a huge whoosh said miller i thought it was a 
lowflying military plane i ducked down then the window fell in 
and i was shot head first into the television set 
the millers rushed outside and were saved now miller a retired 
plasterer clutched a plastic bag containing a shaving set he had 
just bought and sat with his wife in a cafe on the main street 
millers head was badly cut but otherwise they were uninjured 
outside police put up barriers for the arrivals of prince 
andrew the duke of york and mrs thatcher 
weve lost everything miller said things we can never

investigators on thursday began to reconstruct the 
final hours of pan am flight 103 giving special attention to 
threats of a terrorist attack 
the chief of scotland yards antiterrorist branch opened an 
investigation of the london stopover of the boeing 747 that crashed 
wednesday night in southern scotland killing all 258 on board and 
22 on the ground the number of those on the plane was lowered when 
pan am discovered it had counted a flight attendant twice 
the flight originated with a boeing 727 in frankfurt west 
germany and continued as a boeing 747 from london en route to new 
york 
the us state department said an anonymous caller said dec 5 
that a bomb would be planted on the flight from frankfurt west 
germany to london us officials said warnings were issued to its 
embassies 
according to british authorities word never reached heathrow 
airport 
i can say categorically that we had not heard of this we 
were definitely unaware of any threat said airport spokesman 
frances aldridge 
on thursday an anonymous caller to the associated press in 
london claimed an explosive had been planted aboard flight 103 in 
revenge for the downing of an iranian airliner by the us navy in 
july 
the sabotage theory focused on the transfer of luggage between 
the boeing 727 that flew the frankfurtlondon leg and the boeing 
747 that took off for new york 
experts said such switchovers could pose security risks because 
a passenger could leave the flight in london while sending deadly 
cargo on to new york 
pan ams baggagechecking system is intended to ensure that every 
person who checks baggage boards the aircraft airline spokesman 
harold kosel said in frankfurt 
asked whether a passenger might have disembarked in london while 
sending luggage on to new york kosel said i think its out of 
the question 
hans neusel state secretary at west germanys interior ministry 
said thursday night the west german federal criminal office was in 
continuous close contact with scotland yard for the immediate relay 
of information to us 
neusel told west german tv we dont believe there are any soft 
spots in security at frankfurt airport 
but david learmont an editor of the industry magazine flight 
international said in london that i think they can be very 
confident but i dont think anyone can be totally sure 
press association britains domestic news agency reported that 
54 million pieces of luggage move through heathrow in a year 
pan am operates two daily nonstops to the united states from 
frankfurt as well as flight 103 
in washington the state departments counterterrorism office 
offered fbi forensics and disaster units to assist british 
authorities i would think we would probably use our own said a 
department of transport spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
government and industry officials said it seemed clear that the 
boeing 747 had broken apart in flight strewing blazing wreckage 
over the scottish village of lockerbie and surrounding hills and 
that the most likely causes were an explosive device or structural 
failure 
such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with flight 
controller reports that the cockpit sent no distress call as the 
plane having reached cruising altitude of 31000 feet disappeared 
from radar 
speculation is not evidence said prime minister margaret 
thatcher during a visit to the crash scene we are systematically 
searching the evidence and the hills around 
the devices that record flight data and cockpit conversations 
were recovered and a multinational investigation was taking shape 
donald cooper chief inspector of the air accident investigation 
branch of britains department of transport had overall charge of 
the probe 
under international agreement a department of transport 
spokesman said the united states was entitled to participate 
through the national transportation safety board experts also also 
expected from the boeing co and from pratt and whitney which 
manufactured the engines 
george churchillcoleman commander of scotland yards 
antiterrorist branch opened an investigation that was expected to 
focus on the 65 minutes between flight 103s arrival at heathrow on 
wednesday night and its departure for new york

a bus loaded with christmas travelers careened 
off a highway in the andes on thursday and tumbled down a 100foot 
ravine killing at least 21 people and injuring at least 12 police 
said 
in the same area maoist guerrillas from the shining path 
movement blew up part of a railroad bridge close to the 15700foot 
summit of the highest standardgauge railroad in the world 
according to police 
they said the two incidents were not connected though they took 
place hours apart and both occurred outside casapalca a town 60 
miles east of lima lying in a key transportation corridor linking 
the coast with the highlands 
police said the bus death toll could grow 
they said a preliminary investigation indicated recent heavy 
rains caused a rockslide at a curve in the highway 
surviving pssengers and police said heavy fog obscured visibility 
and contributed to the predawn crash 
the privately owned bus was bound from cerro de pasco to lima a 
distance of 120 miles and carried about 45 passengers police said 
shining path guerrillas exploded dynamite around midnight

libya on thursday denied us charges that it built a 
chemical weapons plant and declared its full commitment to all 
international conventions regarding such weapons the official 
news agency jana reported 
the statement from the peoples bureau for foreign liaison 
libyas foreign ministry was issued after president reagan said the 
united states and its allies were discussing military action against 
the plant 
the radical north african arab nation has said repeatedly that 
the factory produces pharmaceuticals jana said earlier thursday 
that libyan doctors nurses and pharmacists are planning a sitin at 
the plant in a move apparently intended to discourage any attack 
libya has repeatedly denied all misleading us claims said 
the peoples bureau statement according to the agency monitored in 
rome and london 
it said the reagan administrations aim was to blunt the 
development of arab societies and to this end it will market all 
the excuses it can find to mislead and trick world public opinion 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday the united 
states believes the plant can produce enormous quantities of 
chemical weapons 
the washington post quoted intelligence sources as saying the 
plant is 35 miles southwest of tripoli and includes facilities for 
producing bombs and canisters to carry poisonous gas 
the subject of chemical weapons will be taken up next month at a 
convention of more than 100 countries in paris called to discuss 
enforcement of the 1925 geneva convention outlawing chemical arms 
libya on thursday accused the united states of trying to ruin the 
paris convention and divert attention from its own chemical weapons 
stocks 
while categorically denying all the american allegations libya 
reaffirms its full commitment to all international conventions and 
treaties concerning chemical weapons the statement said 
janas earlier dispatch which quoted unidentified senior 
medical sources did not say when the sitin at the plant would 
begin 
those sources also said that this noble civilized 
accomplishment the plant will never be destroyed except over the 
dead bodies of us the doctors pharmacists and nurses it said 
the united states bombed libya in 1986 in strikes that killed at 
least 100 people in retaliation for a terrorist attack on a west 
berlin disco that killed two us soldiers and a turkish woman and 
wounded 229 people

the fbi will help scotland yard investigate 
the cause of a pan am jet crash in scotland that killed all 258 
people aboard fbi director william sessions said thursday 
sessions said he had reports of a number of calls taking 
responsibility for the disaster that killed everyone on the plane 
along with 22 residents of the scottish village of lockerbie where 
it crashed wednesday 
some callers claimed association with terrorist organizations 
sessions said at a news conference he declined to say if pan 
american flight 103 en route from frankfurt germany to new york 
was the target of terrorism 
but david kyd spokesman for the international air transport 
association in geneva said structural failure of the plane was 
unlikely 
sabotage is the most likely explanation kyd said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the state department 
warned us embassies earlier this month about a bomb threat made 
against pan am jetliners flying from frankfurt to the united states 
bomb experts with the fbi will visit the crash site and assist 
with a technical investigation at scotland yard as well sessions 
said britains top antiterrorism official commander george 
churchillcoleman also joined the investigation thursday 
fitzwater said he couldnt explain why more people were not 
notified of the threat and sessions said actions following the 
threat will be evaluated 
the authority for the fbi action sessions said comes from 
federal law allowing investigation abroad in cases of destruction of 
us aircraft or when americans might be victims of terrorism

parliament with a big agenda and a 
newfound propensity for debate decided on thursday to postpone 
debate until next month on landmark new laws recognizing formation 
of political groups independent of the communist party 
the laws are part of the communist governments package plan 
for democracy which calls for adoption of a new constitution and 
a separate law on new political parties before parliamentary 
elections in 1990 
the new laws were the ninth item on a 15point agenda adopted 
when this parliamentary session opened tuesday it was the third 
meeting in three months of what was once a rubber stamp legislature 
in session just 12 days a year 
speaker istvan stadinger said earlier that the 383member 
parliament would take an unprecedented christmas recess and 
reconvene on jan 10 to conclude business if the agenda was not 
completed by friday 
debate this week centered on economic issues including the 1989 
budget and modification of the east blocs first personal income 
tax introduced jan 1 
struggling with a 17 billion foreign debt and a stagnating 
economy hungary has embarked on comprehensive economic reforms it 
introduced market forces invited foreign investment cut subsidies 
to moneylosing firms and taxed personal incomes 
following a recent trend for deputies to engage in genuine 
debate more than 40 deputies asked to speak on the budget this week 
pressure from deputies caused a vote to be postponed on a 
proposed modification of the personal income tax law until another 
compromise could be worked out 
the laws on association and assembly have been long awaited and 
much debated in hungary where over the past year dozens of 
independent groups have developed many have highly political 
platforms and want to put up candidates in 1990 elections 
according to drafts published this week the laws will recognize 
the basic right of citizens to assemble and associate and determine 
registration procedures and regulations for independent groups the 
ruling party is the hungarian socialist workers party

a leading serbian politician assailed 
plans to establish independent political parties in yugoslavias 
liberal northern republic of slovenia newspapers reported thursday 
those who demand that the communist party divest itself of 
power are trying to turn the party into a debating club and to 
push the party off the political scene said vjislav micovic 
according to a report in politika daily 
micovic a leader of the serbian socialist alliance and close 
associate of serbian party chief slobodan milosevic was quoted as 
saying purported party reformers are offering us stale old forms 
of multiparty political organization 
two slovenian groups have announced plans to set up independent 
parties in yugoslavias most westwardlooking republic where 
authorities have adopted an unprecedented degree of tolerance 
the social democratic party is to hold its founding conference 
dec 27 and the slovenian democratic union is to be established jan 
10 
although top communist party and government officials in slovenia 
have said the formation of the new parties would be damaging no 
other measures seem to have been taken to prevent the gatherings 
the slovenian and serbian leaderships have been at odds since 
milosevics hardline faction came to power last year and are 
sharply divided over ways to overcome yugoslavias economic and 
social crisis

the state departments chief counterterrorism 
official said thursday night that not enough is known to conclude 
that sabotage caused wednesdays crash of a pan am jumbo jet with 
258 people aboard 
we dont know if this is a terrorist attack l paul bremer 
us ambassador at large for counterterrorism said in an 
associated press interview regarding the crash in scotland that also 
killed 22 people on the ground 
bremer said at least three groups claimed responsibility for the 
crash after it occurred but he said thats not unusual there 
are often claims after an event like this 
a caller identifying himself with the guardians of islamic 
revolution a group that supports irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini telephoned the ap in london 
another caller who said he was with the islamic jihad a moslem 
fundamentalist group called a television network in new york while 
a third claim was made by the ulster defense group bremer said 
so far he said none has proved to be connected to the crash 
he noted that the federal aviation administration has pretty 
good reporting about very heavy winds at this altitude up to 200 
knots in the jet stream so its premature to assess this as 
sabotage 
still bremer said you certainly want to rule this out until 
we look at the black box and forensic evidence we should hold our 
cool 
so far bremer said there is very little you can determine 
meanwhile bremer said an investigation is continuing on a call 
to the us embassy in helsinki two weeks ago claiming the radical 
palestinian abu nidal group planned to sabotage a pan american 
jetliner on the way from frankfurt west germany to new york 
as a result bremer said us embassies in europe and faa 
officials were advised to alert airlines and security personnel to 
upgrade security in both frankfurt and london 
a total of 105 such advisories were issued in the last three 
months an average of about one a day bremer said many of them 
followed tips that seemed more serious than the helsinki call he 
said 
in many many cases of sabotage the us official said we 
find out who did it but it takes time

although he says its too early to judge 
presidentelect george bush michael dukakis tentatively gave the 
man who trounced him in the nov 8 election credit thursday for 
showing signs of moderation on central america 
if thats the way the new administration begins then i think 
thats hopeful the governor said in an interview with the 
associated press his first since immediately after the presidential 
election once you get elected you cant talk about reading your 
lips youve got to get serious 
seated in his statehouse office dukakis who held one press 
conference immediately after his loss to assess the campaign 
refused to review the campaign in detail saying he preferred to 
focus on the future 
but the democrat also declined to tip his hand about his plans 
when his current term as governor runs out in 1990 
its much too early at this point im decompressing working 
hard on whats happening here enjoying a certain amount of normalcy 
in my life dukakis said 
after a weeks vacation in florida dukakis appeared relaxed and 
reflective more interested in his states budget problems than in 
the national agenda he touted before losing to bush 54 percent to 46 
percent 
theres not much sense in rerunning the campaign i mean we 
did some things well we did other things not so well he said 
it wasnt successful obviously im disappointed lots of people 
are disappointed we worked very hard but i dont think its 
something to dwell on 
dukakis who had never waged a national campaign before said his 
biggest surprise was the change that overtook him immediately after 
the democratic national convention in july 
youre spending half your life on the plane he said the 
rest of the time its a combination of the press and the secret 
service that makes it very difficult for a guy like me who loves 
public life because of the contact you have with people and the 
chance to talk you cant do anymore everything you do is a kind of 
massive public event 
asked to evaluate bushs initial appointments and policy 
statements dukakis said it was too early to draw conclusions 
however the governor who has attacked president reagans 
central america policies said he was pleased by reports that bush 
has decided not to ask congress immediately for renewed support for 
the contra rebels in nicaragua and that bush hopes to forge a 
bipartisan consensus and involve latin leaders 
i think its the right policy dukakis said when i met 
with him i strongly urged him to do that i said i think the present 
policy is a failure 
dukakis said he would give bush a good six months to a year 
before he would criticize the new president 
obviously hes got massive budget and deficit problems every 
day theres another story saying its worse he said citing 
saving and loans troubles farmers home mortgages and other 
budgetary woes 
these are all things that had been deferred hes got to 
deal with them dukakis said

manslaughter and his brother jonathan swapp 21 guilty of 
negligent homicide their brotherinlaw john timothy singer 22

toward the swapp brothers the ensuing firefight ended a 13day 
police siege of the clans rural northern utah farm

michael murphy amended his instructions to allow jurors to consider 
lesser charges against addam swapp 
in addition to the seconddegree murder charges jurors were 
instructed that they could consider convicting jonathan swapp and 
singer on lesser charges including manslaughter and negligent 
homicide 
the jury had begun deliberating monday night following nine days 
of testimony from 51 prosecution and seven defense witnessses 
including addam swapp and jonathan swapp 
ann house the slain officers widow issued a statement saying 
she attended the trial to better understand her husbands death 
i know there is sympathy for people who are young socially 
isolated and therefore limited in experience and maturity she 
said but when there is planned and continued violence that 
results in the death of a police officer these people cant be let 
off easily 
clan members were generally upbeat about the verdicts 
the judge did a fair job said charlotte singer swapp who 
along with her sister heidi is wife to addam swapp im glad i 
got a chance to hug him addam swapp and that he got to hug the 
children she said referring to murphys allowing the clan 
patriarch to hold his young sons before being led away 
charlotte swapp said she and anne swapp jonathans new bride 
hoped the swapp brothers would be incarcerated at the same federal 
prison so the two wives could share a home nearby 
heidi swapp said that while the trial was fair in mans eyes 
she still prayed for a miracle 
prosecutor creighton horton told jurors that the defendants 
deliberately embraced a course of confrontation that led to houses 
death defense attorneys countered that clan members while 
wellarmed never intended to hurt anyone and feared police were 
looking for an excuse to kill them 
house was killed and addam swapp seriously wounded in the 
firefight that ended the standoff at the clans marion farm the 
compound was surrounded by an army of 100 fbiled police jan 16

members in may the three and vickie singer the mother of john 
timothy and addam swapps two wives were convicted of federal 
violations in the standoff

five years

battle with society had really begun in 1979 when polygamist 
patriarch john singer was gunned down by police during at arrest 
attempt at the same farm where clan members barricaded themselves 
last january 
police said singer who had clashed with authorities over his 
refusal to send his children to public schools or teach a

former miss america bess myerson was acquitted 
thursday of all charges in an alleged divorcefixing scheme that 
defense attorneys branded a soap opera not a criminal trial 
the federal court jury also acquitted miss myersons lover carl 
andy capasso 43 and former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel 76 of all charges stemming from an alleged scheme 
to fix capassos alimony payments 
miss myerson a former city cultural affairs commissioner took 
off her glasses and wiped her eyes as jury forewoman linda berardi 
read the words not guilty for each of the five counts against 
all three defendants and for a sixth count against miss myerson 
when the final acquittal was announced a small cheer erupted 
from the little group of the defendants supporters and capasso 
embraced miss myerson 
miss myerson 64 who was miss america in 1945 walked the length 
of the defense table to embrace the frail retired judge 
im grateful for the american judicial system and i thank the 
jury for exonerating me miss myerson said outside the courthouse 
after a startling announcement by the jury that it had not yet 
reached a verdict on the key conspiracy count after almost four days 
of deliberations the judge reread the instructions on reasonable 
doubt at the panels request 
within minutes the jury sent out a note that it had reached a 
verdict and overwhelmingly rejected the prosecutions contention 
that the three were guilty of conspiracy mail fraud and 
briberelated charges 
the jurors had been sequestered since monday when they began 
weighing the evidence in the 12weekold trial 
miss myerson was charged with trying to bribe the judge in 
capassos divorce case by giving a city job to the judges daughter 
sukhreet gabel 
sukhreet gabel sat with a dazed expression as each verdict was 
delivered 
miss myerson capasso a onetime city contractor and mrs gabel 
were charged with plotting to cut capassos temporary support 
payments to his estranged wife 
all three were charged with conspiracy mail fraud and promoting 
bribery miss myerson also was charged with obstruction of justice 
for allegedly trying to influence the grand jury testimony of 
sukhreet gabel 
as the panel left the room myerson broke down sobbing into her 
hands as capasso massaged her neck and back capasso before he was 
taken back into custody by federal marshals offered a oneword 
opinion outstanding the millionaire contractor pleaded guilty 
to federal tax evasion charges in january and is serving a 
threeyear sentence in lewisburg pa 
the jurors were the most conscientious group i have ever seen 
i feel just great said mrs gabel 
as her daughter congratulated her the former judge said my 
daughter is here and im glad she stood by me all the way she 
told the truth all the way 
everybodys a winner the truth came out sukhreet gabel said 
jay goldberg capassos lawyer said had it not been bess 
myerson us attorney rudolph giuliani would have never brought 
this case 
giuliani whose office has rarely lost a major case praised the 
work of his staff and did not dispute the verdict 
ive never argued with a jurys verdict and will not do so 
here said giuliani the jury concluded there was insufficient 
evidence 
giuliani added this case was a case that should have been 
tried should have been brought to a jury obviously were 
disappointed with the result 
as for the testimony of miss gabel who admitted her memory was 
faulty giuliani said you dont have a chance to select your 
witnesses we were stuck with the witnesses existing in the case 
i made a decision to go ahead

businessman alan bond said friday he was 
the anonymous buyer of the worlds most valuable painting vincent 
van goghs irises but kept the purchase secret for a year 
because he had nowhere to hang it 
bond who won the americas cup challenge in 1983 said he bought 
the oil painting at a sothebys auction in new york in november 1987 
for a record 50 million but kept the picture under wraps until he 
found a place secure enough to satisfy insurers 
news reports said bond spent the past year building the most 
secure art gallery in perth and possibly in all of australia 
bond who has extensive media and brewery interests displayed 
the painting to reporters on the 49th floor of the rampi tower 
perths tallest skyscraper 
since the purchase bond said he had received offers for the 
masterpiece significantly in excess of what he paid 
the dutch impressionist master painted irises in 1889 while 
he was in a french asylum 
van gogh is the worlds bestselling artist five of his 
paintings are among the 10 that have fetched the highest prices at 
christies and sothebys auction houses 
at the time of the sale sothebys said they sold irises to 
an anonymous buyer for 539 million

disclosure that a caller had warned that 
someone would unwittingly carry a bomb aboard a pan am flight from 
frankfurt to new york recalled an attempt to bomb an israeli 
airliner in 1986 
although cause of the pan am crash wednesday in scotland had not 
been determined investigators were examining terrorist threats and 
evidence that the plane exploded in the air before its crashed 
killing 280 people 258 of them on the plane and the rest on the 
ground 
jordanianborn nezar hindawi was condemned on oct 24 1986 to 45 
years in prison for handing boobytrapped hand baggage to his 
unwitting pregnant irish girlfriend as she prepared to board an el 
al flight on april 17 that year 
an el al guard found the bomb as the woman annmarie murphy 
passed through security british officials said it consisted of 
three pounds of czechoslovakianmade plastic explosive hidden behind 
a luggage panel and likely would have killed all 375 passengers 
aboard the el al boeing 747 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said thursday that on 
dec 5 an anonymous caller told the us embassy in finland that a 
pan am flight would be bombed she said an unidentified person in 
helsinki would unwittingly take the device to frankfurt and 
eventually onto the usbound flight 
however the departments top counterterrorism official said in a 
television interview that it was still not clear whether pan am 
flight 103 had fallen victim to terrorism and that authorities 
frequently received detailed threats that turned out to be false 
in fact ever since this method was tried and thwarted on an el 
al plane in london two years ago weve had a number of times people 
come to us saying that someone in an unsuspecting way is going to 
carry a bomb on a plane so its not unusual to have that kind of 
specificity in a threat l paul bremer said in an interview on 
cable news network 
mrs oakley said the caller told embassy officials that the 
individuals who would provide the device would have ties to abu 
nidal leader of a radical palestinian faction 
another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried 
by a woman 
the finnish foreign ministry said in a statement thursday that an 
arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year most 
recently on dec 5 but that in the investigation so far no 
direct connection has been found between the arab living in finland 
and the air accident in question 
the statement said authorities knew the callers identity and 
that he had not left finland since dec 5 
the sentence handed down in the el al case in 1986 was the 
longest ever in a british court 
during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that hindawi 
entered britain in late january 1986 on a syrian diplomatic passport 
with a false name and that his visa applications had been endorsed 
by syrian foreign ministry officials 
the prosecution presented evidence that hindawi then 32 was 
acting in concert with syria for a group called the jordan 
revolutionary movement he allegedly received help from the chief of 
syrian air force intelligence gen mohammed khouli an aide to 
syrian president hafez assad 
hindawis former fiancee miss murphy testified during the 
trial breaking into tears and accusing the defendant of intending 
to kill her and their unborn child the baby a girl was born in 
july 
after the bomb was discovered hindawi fled to the syrian 
embassy where according to the prosecution he met with syrian 
ambassador loutof haydar hindawi was then taken to a syrian safe 
house in london where syrian embassy employees cut and dyed his 
hair however he fled in fear and turned himself in to police 
the incident prompted britain to sever diplomatic ties with 
syria and other members of the european common market imposed trade 
and diplomatic sanctions against that nation in october 1986 the 
measures were lifted the following july after western officials 
concluded that syria had curtailed its support for terrorism

pentagon employees contractors and defense 
consultants regularly deal in a black market of classified 
defense department documents and the government has closed its eyes 
to the practice for at least five years congressional investigators 
say 
a staff report of the congressional joint economic committee 
released wednesday said the pentagons internal investigators 
discovered the practice in 1983 and sought to bring it to the 
attention of defense secretary caspar weinberger and the justice 
department 
but efforts to sound the alarm were ignored by higherups 
leading some subordinates to believe the practice was condoned 
according to testimony at a hearing of the panels national security 
subcommittee 
in a practice that strongly parallels the pattern in the current 
pentagon procurement fraud case outside defense consultants would 
develop sources inside the pentagon who could furnish them with 
classified data the report said documents included secret bid 
specifications for weapons systems and longrange defense 
acquisition plans

president reagan will leave his successor a 
spending blueprint which projects that the federal budget can be 
balanced by 1993 nine years later than the target reagan set when 
he campaigned for the presidency in 1980 
officials who are putting the finishing touches on the 
administrations final budget said it will call for a deficit of 
925 billion for the 1990 fiscal year which starts next october 
that would represent a decline from an actual deficit of 1551 
billion in the 1988 fiscal year that ended sept 30 
the narrowing of the gap between government revenues and spending 
was accomplished by optimistic economic assumptions which boost the 
governments tax take and a combination of spending cuts increased 
user fees and 6 billion in sales of government assets

uncle sams annual greetings to taxpayers are 
ready to be mailed to 101 million americans complete with an 
estimate of how long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out the 
forms 
the internal revenue service previewed the new tax forms at a 
briefing wednesday supplying plenty of words of assurance that 
taxpayers should find preparing their returns relatively simple this 
year compared to the last filing season 
thats because there are few changes being made in the new forms 
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time 
the sweeping changes made by the landmark 1986 tax reform act 
while there had been dire predictions that befuddled taxpayers 
would throw up their hands in despair because they couldnt 
comprehend the new law the irs said the filing process went 
relatively smoothly

a old friend happened to drive by richard 
benjamins house and drop a 20 million movie in his lap 
at least thats the way benjamin tells how he became involved 
with my stepmother was an alien the yearend release starring 
dan aykroyd and kim basinger it helps that the old friend was jerry 
weintraub founder of the instant major film company weintraub 
entertainment 
jerry drove down my street one day as i was getting into my 
car benjamin relates he stopped me and said i got this 
script you got to do it im not going to take no for an answer 
its hard to say no to jerry i thought that when somebody 
pulls you over gets out of a car and stands on a street corner 
thats the way you should make a deal 
benjamin had already read a halffinished version of 
stepmother two years before and had admired it 
theres something terrifically real about a little girl saying 
to her dad but shes from another planet and the dad saying 
now shes going to be your new mother tell me you dont like her 
cooking but dont tell me shes from another planet theres 
something psychologically right about that he said 
benjamin signed on as director having directed my favorite 
year city heat racing with the moon the money pit 
and little nikita he now entered the whole new world of special 
effects 
john dykstra and his company apogee that did the special 
effects are awesome because they can do anything he said they 
would say heres what we think it should be but what would you 
like this spaceship could be anything you want the characters can 
be anywhere you want them 
you had to use your imagination and then you had to be 
responsible to that imagination because they could execute it 
aykroyd entered the project early a saturday night live 
alumnus he is part of the new breed of film comedy actor 
they work fast and they dont like to do a lot of rehearsal 
benjamin observed neither does kim so that was all right 
when we started dan said do you want me to put anything else 
in or do you just want the words in the script i said if you 
want to say something just say it i used to keep the camera 
rolling at the end of a scene and just let him go a lot of that 
stuff is in the movie 
although he doesnt appear in stepmother benjamin did a lot 
of acting on the set the reason he had to portray the special 
effects that would be inserted later 
the actors were looking at me with a stick that said ship 
explained the director i said now this thing is coming out of 
the stars its beautiful its magnificent its awesome then 
there are these great superbeings in the sky and im standing on a 
ladder doing them 
except for a few gray hairs dick benjamin at 49 still possesses 
the preppie look he first displayed in goodbye columbus new 
yorkborn he attended the famed high school for the performing 
arts then studied drama at northwestern university where he met 
his wife paula prentiss

on a soundstage west of london mickey 
rooney is sporting a fur shawl a shaggy white wig and a scar on 
his forehead 
its only makeup explains the sprightly actor whos a bit fuzzy 
on the details of the script somebody whacked me i think with a 
club or a stick or a bat 
rooney 68 who is in london repeating his starring role in the 
broadway musical sugar babies picked up a sixday contract to 
star among a band of medieval thugs in erik the viking a 15 
million movie which will be released by orion pictures next summer 
the author and director former monty python trouper terry jones 
also plays the role of king arnulf 
tim robbins the acclaimed sidekick of last summers hit film 
bull durham is the adventurous erik on a quest to graduate 
from barbarian to nice guy rooney plays his grandfather singer 
eartha kitt is the soothsayer freya and john cleese another former 
python is eriks nemesis halfdan the black 
the movie is based on a collection of 28 stories about the 
fictional erik which jones wrote for his young son bill 
jones 46 will be remembered by python fans as the blackhaired 
one who would play plump old matrons with shrieking voices with the 
breakup of the troupe he has gone on to directorial fame with 
personal services 
he says his latest film is less a childrens story than an 
extension of the indiana jones sagas which combine comedy 
fantasy and adventure 
its the kind of thing i would enjoy seeing said the 
oxfordeducated welshman who was busy on the set one recent day 
marshaling characters with pythonesque names such as sven the 
berserk ulf the maddeningly calm and lief the lucky 
jones was shooting the final scene in which the dark ages the 
socalled age of ragnarok come to a triumphant end with the sudden 
emergence of the sun and enlightenment for erik 
the setting is the vikings home village of valhalla in norway a 
community marked by constant winter and warfare the film begins 
with a rape followed by plenty of the kind of bloodshed and 
dismemberment familiar to python addicts 
jones knows he is courting outcry from campaigners against screen 
violence but says theres violence in life i dont think thats 
what corrupting when people glory in violence i get disturbed 
the film spent four weeks on location in malta creating an 
enchanted island called hybrasil but a decision was made against 
location shooting in norway in favor of studio work 
rooney was eager to make clear he isnt taking his role too 
seriously 
its a lot of fun being with john cleese and terry he said 
in an interview i havent even read the script i dont know 
anything about it i like good humor im a guy that loves good 
humor 
and i love the money 
producer john goldstone said that unlike the monty python skits 
the viking movie is a real story with a beginning a middle and an 
end goldstone first worked with jones in 1974 on monty python and 
the holy grail which cost just 229000 pounds then about 
535000 
erik the viking is the last of three films made by python 
alumni in the past 12 months cleeses a fish called wanda was 
a summer boxoffice hit and terry gilliams the adventures of 
baron munchausen has just opened in west germany to mixed reviews 
wed like to have three successful films said jones but 
one mustnt count ones chickens

ray cooneys run for your wife the 
longestrunning comedy on the london stage is broadwaybound after 
six years on the west end 
its so readily acceptable thats what people relate to 
cooney 56 said of his farce about a bigamous taxi driver 
it can be summed up so simply he said people can 
understand the dilemma of an innocent guy who because he didnt 
have the heart to say no has got two wives 
cooney last went to broadway with his 1967 london hit not now 
darling but it closed after just six weeks 
run for your wife starts previews at new yorks virginia 
theater feb 22 opening march 7 after a tryout stint jan 17 to 
feb 19 at the coconut grove playhouse in miami 
cooney directs and stars alongside paxton whitehead an alumnus 
of the hit broadway and london farce noises off 
after such successes as move over mrs markham cowritten 
with john chapman two into one and wife begins at forty 
cooney believes he is ready to try broadway again 
my plays are pure situation he said there are no local 
jokes 
run for your wife has been slated for broadway for years and 
cooney has directed it in productions in new jersey with david 
mccallum in baltimore with bob dishy and at oakbrook outside 
chicago 
but cooney said only now had talent and script meshed properly 
under a special agreement with the american actors union equity 
three british actors will appear in the play for four months on 
broadway at which point the five americans completing the new york 
lineup will transfer to the london production at the criterion 
theater 
while emphasizing his play is a farce cooney said run for your 
wife had a darker underside 
my farces are really inverted tragedies said cooney a 
londonborn carpenters son who left school when he was 14 to become 
an actor 
if the story of this bigamist had been written by tennessee 
williams it would be a tragedy said cooney pointing out that 
his twicemarried cabbie has committed a criminal offense for which 
he could go to jail 
if youre going to write a pure for want of a better word 
farce i think it does need to have tragedy at its core 
run for your wife will be one of several farces on broadway 
this season neil simons rumors surmounted mixed reviews to 
become a smash hit at the broadhurst theater 
ken ludwigs lend me a tenor an american comedy which ran 
successfully in london opens at the royale theater the night before 
run for your wife 
cooney said the best farce has a strong basic plot 
all my plays take place in real time and usually start at quite 
a high dramatic point theres a lot at stake for the characters 
in them 
because hes wearing a triple cap the plays budget is 600000 
unusually low for broadway it breaks even at 36 percent of capacity 
and with full houses can recoup its investment in just six weeks 
if broadways going to have plays produced there everybodys 
got to chip in said cooney who is forgoing all royalties for a 
share of the profits 
regardless of whether run for your wife runs cooneys next 
play is ready to go it runs in the family is a comedy about an 
adolescent who at age 18 discovers his fathers true identity 
he said the play to open on the west end next fall was at 
heart a drama 
i just happen to write these plays because i see the funny side 
of the dramas around us he said i have a feeling theres 
enough depressing news when i switch the tv on

meetings between saudi arabia 
anticommunist guardian of islams holiest shrines and the 
officially atheist soviet union have inspired predictions of an end 
to their 50yearold break in relations 
officials in saudi arabia the arab worlds richest nation will 
not discuss their intentions openly but king fahd met with yuli 
vorontsov the soviet deputy foreign minister on dec 5 
it was the highestlevel contact since josef stalins government 
broke relations in 1938 after having been the first to recognize 
what was called the kingdom of the hijaz 12 years earlier 
the dec 5 meeting climaxed two years of political courtship by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev as part of an effort to increase 
soviet influence in the persian gulf region which contains nearly 
60 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves 
resuming relations with saudi arabia the noncommunist worlds 
leading oil exporter and a us ally of long standing would be a 
triumph for gorbachev 
before seeing fahd voronstov met with moslem afghan guerrillas 
under saudi sponsorship in the taif mountain resort 
saudi leaders have insisted the soviets end their 9yearold 
military involvement in afghanistan as a condition for resuming 
relations the red army began withdrawing may 15 under a 
unmediated agreement 
knowledgeable sources in riyadh said the main soviet reason for 
meeting afghan insurgent leaders in taif was to please the saudis 
the official saudi press agency quoted vorontsov as telling fahd 
the soviet union is determined to withdraw its forces from 
afghanistan at the time already fixed or perhaps earlier 
a western diplomat said privately if the withdrawal is 
completed in february it seems theyre likely to resume relations 
by terms of the withdrawal agreement signed april 14 in geneva 
half the soviet unions more than 100000 soldiers were withdrawn 
from afghanistan by aug 15 and the rest must be out by feb 15 
saudi arabia has been among the staunchest supporters of the 
moslem insurgents who began fighting after a communist coup in 
april 1978 
other western and arab diplomats believe the saudis are more 
likely to establish diplomatic ties with china which has sold 
riyadh intermediaterange ballistic missiles before resuming 
relations with moscow 
frank carlucci the departing us defense secretary recently 
paid a last visit to saudi arabia reports said he asked fahd if the 
taif meetings meant relations with moscow were imminent and was told 
the matters were not related 
an arab diplomat also speaking privately said its now a 
question of the right price china may have paid with the missiles 
and with the soviets it might well be a complete withdrawal from 
afghanistan 
prince salman fahds brother and governor of riyadh said the 
saudisoviet dialogue has never been suspended despite the rupture 
in diplomatic ties between the countries 
alanbaa a kuwaiti newspaper quoted the soviet ambassador to 
the emirate ernest zverev as saying efforts were under way to 
normalize relations but so far we havent received an official 
gesture from saudi arabia concerning diplomatic representation 
for more than four decades after stalin ended formal relations 
theocratic saudi arabia shunned diplomatic ties with communist 
governments 
saudi officials resumed contacts with the communist world in the 
early 1980s to discuss the palestinian question and the arms embargo 
king fahds government sought to impose on iran in the iraniraq war 
prince saud alfaisal the foreign minister visited moscow in 
1982 and again in 1988 oil minister hisham nazer went there this 
year and the soviets have become major purchasers of saudi wheat 
vladimir polyakov soviet undersecretary for middle east affairs 
held cooperation talks with senior saudis in riyadh in february 
arab diplomats said foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will 
visit the saudi capital next month 
the united states remains a major arms supplier for arab nations 
in the persian gulf but congressional blocking of advanced weapon 
sales has forced them to look to the soviets french and british 
kuwait established relations with moscow nearly 30 years ago in 
1960 and the united arab emirates and qatar did so more recently 
those conservative governments also have relations with china 
end adv for fri pms dec 30

the senate will convene next month minus one of 
its genuine mavericks the blunt and bombastic lowell weicker 
faithful friend to underdogs outcasts and causes not in vogue 
the imposing 6foot6 connecticut republican was a master of 
theatrical floor performances and shrewd backroom negotiating he 
practiced both on two key committees appropriations and labor and 
human resources 
he could fight in the trenches with the best of them he liked 
being involved in the fray said ralph neas executive director of 
the leadership conference on civil rights he was one of a kind 
and it will be much more difficult for us without him 
loyal to nothing but his own unshakeable beliefs weicker 
alienated many of his gop colleagues and ultimately lost his 
threeterm grip on connecticut voters they are sending democrat 
joseph lieberman a more traditional politician to the senate in 
january 
without weicker senate visitors will be deprived of some 
dramatic entertainment and those whose causes he championed 
tenaciously and sometimes pugnaciously are bereft 
he certainly stuck out his neck a lot farther than most said 
barry w lynn chief lobbyist for the american civil liberties 
union he was one of the few members of the senate who had an 
instinctive sense of constitutional violation and he was a guy 
who could actually persuade people to change their views 
lynn credits weicker with heading off constitutional amendments 
proposed during president reagans first term that would have 
required school prayer or silent meditation 
he alone was responsible for the success of the education of 
the public lynn said he was a oneman orchestrator of 
sufficient delay to let peoples better instincts prevail and if 
that had failed everyone realized he was prepared to do a 
filibuster 
weicker did in fact wage a filibuster for nine months in 1981 
staving off conservative attempts to strip the supreme court of 
jurisdiction over school desegregation what was important to him 
was protecting the constitution not necessarily being the most 
popular member of the club said neas 
that he was not 
he was more like a charging bull in the china shop of senate 
civility spouting thinly veiled insults and selfrighteousness 
particularly in his dealings with conservative colleagues such as 
jesse helms of north carolina and gordon humphrey of new hampshire 
an exercise in bigotry period about the most objectionable 
thing ive seen on the senate floor he fumed last july of a 
humphrey amendment that said federally funded aids education 
materials could not use words stating that homosexuality is 
normal natural or healthy 
helms was reproached after stating in an earlier debate that i 
may throw up over aids materials produced by a homosexual group 
we dont have time to get into moralistic debates weicker 
lectured if somebodys ill then they deserve the help of their 
government period over and out 
not that weicker was above moralizing on aids civil rights 
civil liberties abortion federal health and education spending or 
any number of other matters on which he felt strongly 
what the hell could be more important than 15 million people 
who are going to die weicker exploded once when former senate 
majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia sought to move off 
an aids bill for a brief vote on an unrelated matter 
to those who tried to exempt some federal aid recipients from 
complying with civil rights laws weicker had this to say if you 
cant get it knocked through your head that discrimination is out in 
this nation period then you dont deserve the help of the american 
people 
colleagues who might have preferred more of a team player give 
him credit for sincerity at least he believed in what he was 
doing and i admire people who stand up for their beliefs said 
utah sen orrin hatch the senior republican on the labor and human 
resources committee 
one of weickers less flamboyant crusades was the disability 
rights movement for which he and his staff wrote programs and laws 
and secured the money to carry them out but even that cause was 
controversial in the budgetcutting reagan years 
paul marchand chief lobbyist for the association for retarded 
citizens said disability groups were among the few that emerged 
unscathed from the reagan era due to weickers efforts he never 
lost for us marchand said he may have alienated people that 
was out of our control the bottom line is that he never lost for 
us 
one of the last things weicker did before his defeat was persuade 
congress in its waning hours to extend a 15 million program 
making the drug azt available to aids patients it was a typical 
weicker performance fraught with urgency and melodrama 
he just got up on the floor of the senate and said we have to 
do this or people are going to die and it was done said jeff 
levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian task force 
he did it and no one else did

abc has figured out a way around those low 
nielsen ratings for news specials produce one for a potentially 
vast new audience in outer space 
no kidding the koppel report news from earth beamed by abc 
on monday is a yearinreview by earthlings for any alien 
intelligence out there that might tune in demographics unknown 
it might seem a silly notion but it is an often enlightening and 
occasionally amusing hour of selfexamination that who knows might 
be the first interplanetary newsmagazine and what better earthling 
to represent us than ted koppel unless mean joe greene or perhaps 
pat sajak and vanna white 
see while newspapers pile up in a corner and turn yellow a 
television signal travels into space at 186000 miles per second 
the thought may fascinate or horrify you says koppel in an 
aside to fellow earthlings who are probably more fascinated and 
horrified by the absence of monday night football but what if 
someday a thousand lightyears from now some alien intelligence 
decoded the signal 
in case they do koppel and guests address themselves to 
extraterrestrial viewers so what do we tell you out there in the 
far reaches of space about us and our planet well for one thing 
by the time you see this well all be long dead koppel informs 
them cheerily 
during this year just past we took detailed note of a great 
many things that were so important to us and must seem so 
irrelevant to you says koppel explaining the concept of the 
yearend wrapup no doubt many here on earth found such news nuggets 
as the resignation of us attorney general ed meese just as 
relevant as venutians will 
but if our nextsolarsystem neighbors pick up news from 
earth theyll hear among others surgeon general c everett koop 
on aids environmentalist jeanmichel cousteau on pollution 
fasttalking comedian john moschitta on stress south african 
archbishop desmond tutu on racism billy graham on god vladimir 
pozner on nogod and richard nixon on ussoviet relations 
the only prominent women on the program are the united nations 
representative from barbados dame nita barrow who talks about 
hunger in the third world and anthropologist jane goodall who 
discusses endangered species a message to aliens the sexual 
balance of the program notwithstanding females are not on the 
endangered list 
passersby in persononthestreet mostly act silly when offered 
the chance to talk to their neighbors on other planets if theres 
anybody out there giggles one harried woman come get me a 
man who can turn his hands upsidedown on his head and encircle his 
eyes instructs the aliens to disregard all others he is the true 
leader of the planet a segment on narcissism is illustrated by a 
montage of tv commercials id like to get rid of this gray but i 
dont want a total dye job and look ridiculous 
koppel and company cover just about everything the only apparent 
oversight is not taking the opportunity to issue an invitation to 
the miss universe pageant 
halfway through the program koppel gives an update on those 
travelin tv signals which he estimates are well past mars a 
mere five minutes from jupiter and halfway to saturn 
we think about you all the time koppel tells outerspace 
audiences introducing a segment on earthly fascination with ufos 
illustrated with clips of scifi movies from war of the worlds 
to et the extraterrestrial 
but he does offer in conclusion a confession this program 
was designed much more for us on earth than for you he says 
sending messages out to the farthest reaches of the universe 
or even to generations yet unborn here on earth is a function 
of faith it presumes that life goes on either here or somewhere 
and that you will feel some kinship to us and what was important to 
us we have a great need to feel that this is so 
nor does koppel warn our neighbors lightyears away that if they 
do receive the signal for news from earth they may soon be 
subjected to a strange and uncontrollable forces from our planet

former ibm corp vice chairman paul rizzo 
wants to put the business school at the university of north carolina 
at chapel hill on the map and even has hired a public relations 
firm to help promote the school 
this school has been able to attract quality students 
without promoting itself he said this no longer works when 
our students come here one of the first things they want to know is 
our placement record 
when he became dean of the school rizzo said his top priority 
was to make the school a vital cog in the states business 
community but as any successful executive knows first things first 
if were going to compete we need to play the game said the 
1950 graduate of unc who lined up in the same backfield as charlie 
choo choo justice on the tar heel football team we dont want 
to be secondrate 
rizzo was impressed with the faculty when he took the job in 
september 1987 at the same time he understood why some had left 
with all of the problems of a state university including the 
bureaucracy and underfunding we have still managed to build a high 
quality faculty he said in a recent telephone interview from his 
office in chapel hill were in danger of losing them 
rizzo said money was only one reason why talented professors were 
leaving the school for other opportunities thats why he is the 
chief proponent of a plan to construct a new home for the business 
school at a cost of between 20 million and 30 million 
weve got a majorleague faculty with a bushleague facility 
he said a new building would be practically and symbolically very 
important 
just like a good medical school a business school cant be 
successful without significant clinical activity he said other 
business schools may be too lavish but if were going to conduct 
programs with the corporate world we need adequate facilities 
despite those obstacles the business school recently was ranked 
no 8 in the country in a poll of 3000 mbas conducted by 
businessweek magazine 
rizzo has put his stamp on the schools curriculum giving it 
what he described as a global perspective 
a globalization of the curriculum is not unique to this 
business school he said explaining that any reputable business 
school could not ignore the study of international business in the 
late 1980s 
the school also has introduced the international executive 
series a program which brings in business leaders from such 
countries as japan and the soviet union as well as prominent 
american corporate executives who have worked overseas 
the first lecture last month was given by kenichi ohmae 
management director of mckinsey amp co of tokyo the subject do 
trade deficits really matter in a global economy 
other speakers include vf lishchenko of the academy of sciences 
of the ussr in moscow s parker gilbert chairman of morgan 
stanley group inc johnson amp johnson chief executive officer james 
burke ibm corp chairman and ceo john akers and john welch 
chairman of general electric 
rizzo wants to encourage more faculty and students from the 
business school to work and study abroad and he wants to bring in 
more foreigners to teach and study at the school 
the impact of culture on business is important he said 
just learning the language is not enough we need to develop an 
appreciation for the things we dont understand because we lack the 
cultural background 
for example he said the conversation at a business lunch in 
some european countries may focus on music or literature not the 
latest leveraged buyout or stock tip 
its easy to pick up the phone and do business in this country 
because we speak the same language rizzo said building 
relationships in other countries can be difficult we need people 
groping and struggling to do business effectively in the foreign 
marketplace 
the schools reputation seems to be improving as evidenced by 
its move up in the businessweek rankings from the top 15 last year 
to the top 10 in addition a washington dc public relations 
firm peabody fitzpatrick communications inc is hard at work 
promoting the international lecture series among other projects 
to be this good given all the drawbacks we have is 
remarkable rizzo said

by weeks end a presidential panel is to 
recommend to the pentagon how many and which of 3800 military bases 
around the country should be closed many jobs will be lost but the 
anticipated savings to taxpayers could be 5 billion a year two 
decades ago base closings were relatively common until congress 
started blocking individual closings to spare their constituents 
for sidebyside stories the associated press went back to towns 
that lost their bases in the 60s moses lake wash survived and 
prospered edgemont sd is still trying to replace that big 
payroll both provide examples for the towns about to get word from

the lumbering japan air lines 747 drones 
over bustling grant county mall on its landing approach the most 
dramatic sign that this remote little town has survived and 
prospered since larson air force base closed in 1966 
locals once feared the closure would dry up their desert 
oasis but many now say they are glad the air force is gone 
with recommendations expected this week on which of 3800 
military bases the pentagon should shut down to save 2 billion to 
5 billion a year anxious towns around the country could look to 
moses lakes economic recovery as a model 
once a home for b52 bombers the old base is now a jet pilot 
training center an aircraft testing site a community college a 
housing development a municipal airport and an industrial park 
that ironically includes the air force as a tenant 
while larson provided only 38 civilian jobs before closing the 
diversified site now supports 825 workers 
were a heck of a lot better off now that the base is closed 
said robert trask an insurance agent in the area for 42 years an 
air base isnt the greatest thing in the world 
most of larsons 4000 airmen lived on the base and spent their 
money at the base stores rather than in town he said 
taverns and used car lots miss them the most trask said 
but those sentiments were not in evidence when the shutdown 
shocked this town of 10600 located in the columbia river basin 150 
miles east of seattle 
originally created as an army air corps base in world war ii 
larson was the biggest employer in what was little more than arid 
semidesert before irrigation projects brought cultivation in the 
1930s 
the initial years after the closure of larson air force base 
were not an easy time said karen wagner of the local chamber of 
commerce 
larson was among 3600 installations the defense department shut 
down from 1961 to 1977 but no bases have closed since because 
members of congress loathe to upset constituents by taking away 
jobs have blocked the pentagon from closing individual facilities 
in 1986 the defense department issued a report looking at 100 of 
the bases that closed before 1977 
you never can really replace the military jobs said wally 
bishop of the defense departments office of economic adjustment in 
washington dc 
but the report found that new civilian jobs outnumbered the lost 
civilian jobs 138138 to 93424 because of diversification at the 
100 sites 
replacing those civilian jobs is considered the sign of success 
bishop said still many communities were not able to do that 
the black hills army depot in edgemont sd went from 512 
civilian jobs to eight closing the frankford arsenal in 
philadelphia cost 2800 jobs shutting the erie army depot in ohio 
cost 885 jobs and tiny glasgow mont lost 239 jobs when its air 
force base closed 
residents of moses lake were determined to escape that fate 
the first thing leaders did was organize said clyde owen the 
air force colonel who closed the base then became the first director 
of the newly formed port of moses lake 
the port which has taxing authority was created to buy or 
otherwise acquire base facilities from the government and to manage 
them owen said 
you have to know what you want and know who to deal with 
owen said 
ideas like turning the hangers into a cattle feedlot were 
rejected said port commissioner leon bodie 
its best use was as an airfield bodie said 
their first major client the seattlebased boeing co was 
already using larsons runways for routine flight testing about to 
unveil its new 747 model boeing urgently needed a long runway and 
uncluttered skies for testing and to train the pilots of its 
potential client airlines 
boeing put up 120000 which basically got the port through its 
first year since that time 280 airlines have trained pilots at 
moses lake according to port officials 
one of those japan air lines established a permanent 747 
training center at the port in 1968 with two dozen fulltime 
employees and a rotating series of pilot trainees who give the 
little town a touch of the far east 
they also give it more than a touch of noise pollution as huge 
jets scream over town all day with trainees making touchandgo 
landings at the airport for hours at a time 
people in town on the whole dont worry a bit about the 
noise owen said they know its revenueproducing 
airlines pay the port 3750 each time one of their planes takes 
off or lands on the 13000foot runway 
jal is by far the biggest user paying landing fees of 392000 
in fiscal 1988 the air force pays 84000 a year to rent hangar 
space and train pilots on landing 
the ports 1988 income included 66700 in landing fees 94000 
in jet fuel sales 673000 in space rental and 274000 in other 
income for a total of 17 million 
major commercial tenants on the 4500acre site include 
sundstrand data control boeing union carbide and columbia steel 
fabricators 
there is a corrugated box manufacturer an aircraft parts maker 
a potato processor and a soft drink distributor the old hospital is 
rented to a day care center 
manufacturers are attracted by the nations lowest electricity 
rates thanks to the local public utilitys share in two columbia 
river dams 
also on the former base is big bend community college which has 
140 employees and 1200 students 
the school uses former base buildings including the theater 
cafeteria and dormitories the old bowling alley is now a science 
and math building the airmens club is a student center 
the school also set up a commercial pilot training program 
shortly after larson closed to take advantage of the runway and 
hangars 10 percent of the student body is now enrolled in that 
program said spokesman doug sly 
for all the good news the area will never be able to replace the 
4000 lost military jobs owen said the bases 14 million budget 
in the early 1960s would likely top 100 million in todays money 
he said 
by contrast the current annual payroll is probably 3 million to 
4 million 
but if the base were still around moses lake would have little 
incentive to pursue economic diversificiation ms wagner said 
trask the insurance agent says good riddance 
the town generates more money now he said

in the two decades since an army ammunition 
depot closed and stripped this town of more than 500 jobs edgemont 
has tried to find another healthy payroll even courting a string of 
potentially hazardous industries 
a uranium mining and milling operation succeeded for a while 
then closed town leaders also wooed companies that proposed a 
lowlevel nuclear waste dump a sewage ash processing plant a 
munitions testing site and most recently a landfill for municipal 
waste from northeastern cities 
for various reasons including opposition from environmental 
groups all the proposals failed a farmer raised pigs on the base 
for a time but recently pulled out because of falling pork prices 
we need more jobs and were still looking mayor pete ziemet 
said the only thing we have going for us which i guess is both 
bad and good is the notoriety edgemont has had 
other civic leaders fear they may never find the industry needed 
to fill the empty houses and stores in this town sitting on the 
southern edge of the black hills where pinecovered mountains give 
way to rough grasslands covered with sagebrush and yucca plants 
everything just seemed to go haywire just little by 
little everything went wrong said former mayor matt brown 
ive been here all my life and so help me god i cant put my 
finger on anything that will salvage the town maybe we can be 
lucky 
a defense department survey of 100 communities that lost military 
bases from 1961 to 1977 reported that some towns prospered by 
converting the bases to other uses but edgemont is one of the 
places that has never recovered after the military left town 
the black hills army depot which stored ammunition in concrete 
bunkers at a place called igloo eight miles south of edgemont was 
opened in the 1940s and closed in 1967 brown said edgemont not only 
lost 500odd civilian jobs but also many longtime edgemont 
residents who were transferred to civilian jobs at other military 
bases 
four local businessmen bought the 15000acre base to prepare it 
for other uses but it still lies empty rows of concrete igloos sit 
like loaves of bread on the prairie near the base entrance houses 
and administrative buildings are falling apart 
edgemonts population grew to 1772 by 1960 but fell to less 
than 1200 within a few years of the bases closing 
the towns economy and population recovered in the 1970s with 
the uranium mill and a burlington northern railroad crewshift 
station both busy ziemet estimates edgemont now has only 1130 
people a drop of about 20 percent since 1980 
the mayor said 70 houses out of several hundred in town are 
empty and 27 should be razed because theyre falling apart people 
trying to sell homes will be lucky to get 50 cents on the dollar he 
said 
the railroad is still a bright spot in the local economy 
burlington northern switches crews at edgemont and provides a good 
national connection ziemet said 
the uranium operation closed due to lack of demand and the 110 
people now cleaning up uranium tailings will be out of work when the 
cleanup is completed next year he said 
city and state officials have provided financing to help reopen 
a factory that makes wooden bowls and other items from walnut and 
the plant should employ up to 30 people 
but the town has yet to find an industrial use for the abandoned 
ammunition depot 
cattle are grazed on the base but an operation that raised hogs 
in the concrete igloos has been stopped at least temporarily a plan 
to use the igloos for grain storage also washed out ziemet said 
in 1983 chemnuclear systems inc proposed burying up to 
onethird of the nations lowlevel nuclear waste at the base the 
plan was scrapped after geological tests showed the site was 
unsuitable and state voters rejected a proposed multistate compact 
that would have allowed the dump 
consolidated management corp of reno nev last year hauled 
almost 300000 tons of incinerated sewage from st paul minn to 
the old base where the company planned to build a plant to extract 
gold and other precious metals from the ash the company missed 
several deadlines to start the plant however and the state now is 
searching for a way to dispose of the ash 
honeywell inc wanted to set up a munitions testing operation in 
a canyon near edgemont but abandoned the plan after a coalition of 
indians and others opposed it 
edgemont now is working with south dakota disposal systems inc 
headquartered in colorado on a plan to bury 1 million tons of 
municipal garbage a year edgemont could get more than 1 million a 
year from the plan which also would create up to 50 jobs company 
officials have said 
the succession of proposals dealing with hazardous materials has 
angered some local residents and environmental groups across south 
dakota 
ruth kern who lives on a ranch south of town and opposes all the 
waste disposal ideas said edgemont is gaining a reputation as a 
place willing to become the nations dumping ground 
kern said residents are partly responsible for the base closing 
20 years ago because they complained all the time and didnt want 
the riffraff from the base in town she criticized edgemont 
officials for seeking hazardous dumps that she said wouldnt provide 
enough jobs to save the town in any event 
i dont want to see it go under but neither can i support it 
when they want to do something to pollute my environment kern 
said im tired of having everybody in the united states look at 
us as someplace they can bring in stuff to dump 
kerns stance has drawn criticism from townspeople who want jobs 
whatever the industry brown is upset that environmental groups have 
been able to block virtually all the towns industrial proposals 
for some reason we cant seem to whip it he said id 
like to win one for a change 
ziemet whos been mayor for the past decade said he wouldnt 
support any industry that would contaminate ground air or water 
but he believes state and federal officials can make sure the 
proposed garbage dump is operated safely 
some of the national publicity has upset ziemet and others 
a recent wall street journal story said the state and town acted 
too hastily when they allowed the minnesota sewage ash to be hauled 
to the abandoned base ziemet said no one could know the company 
would run out of money before it built the processing plant which 
he said would have been an environmentalists dream had it succeeded 
in tranforming sewage into worthwhile products 
he compared the towns situation to someone without a job no one 
would criticize the person for taking a job on a garbage truck he 
said 
all we want is a job he repeated i believe something is 
going to come

with the roar of cars from interstate 87 behind 
him richard desimone had 25 city sixthgraders bend over to look in 
the mud for traffic of a quieter kind 
a muskrats been here he told them pointing out a pawprint 
with a line through it evidence of a muskrat dragging its tail 
desimone then showed them footprints made by a raccoon the children 
jockeyed for views 
in van cortlandt park an oasis in the bronx that has been home 
to animals ranging from snapping turtles to two whitetailed deer 
spotted last year desimone taught the children to be nature 
detectives and park stewards 
he is one of new york citys 68 urban park rangers a group of 
goodwill ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of city 
dwellers about the nature around them 
the program in the nations largest city now in its 10th year 
has become a model park ranger programs have started in about 15 
cities including seattle philadelphia boston and cleveland the 
programs are independent from the national park service which 
oversees federal wilderness areas 
park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in any 
park said mary kimmitt deputy director of the philadelphia 
ranger corps which started a year ago 
in some areas the presence of rangers helps keep down the crime 
rate in new yorks central park for instance the number of 
felonies dropped 28 percent in the last four years robberies alone 
fell 40 percent 
were trying to get people back in the parks said therese 
braddick director of new yorks urban rangers some people 
believe theyre not safe and at night many areas arent 
still while law enforcement in new yorks parks is handled by 
police and a 180member park patrol squad ms braddick said we 
provide a sense of security for people 
besides rangers show new yorkers that their backyard is not all 
concrete last year 84000 people attended 2618 educational 
programs held by the rangers 
when you think of manhattan the picture of beautiful park land 
doesnt come to mind ms braddick said 
and yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26000 acres 
of parks 
there are 30 species of ducks 10 species of owls 15 types of 
hawks and falcons red foxes snapping turtles raccoons skunks 
and occasionally deer from westchester county to the north the 
areas have about 30 types of endangered plants including the winged 
monkey flower 
new yorks first park bowling green was created in 1733 the 
city set aside land for central park in the mid1850s created the 
department of parks in 1870 and during commissioner robert moses 
tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park acreage 
there is little left to put aside now the city has filled its 
borders said park historian jonathan kuhn 
the end of major park expansion makes the current public land 
that much more important rangers say 
one place braddick loves to visit is pelham bay park in the 
bronx with its salt marsh mud flats 13 miles of rocky shoreline 
and 520 acres of forest 
herman barrocales 33 fished in brooklyns prospect park when he 
was a boy now he is a park ranger stationed there one of his jobs 
is to lead hawk watches 
on a crisp morning recently he passed around binoculars on a 
second story terrace in prospect parks boathouse he told the dozen 
people who came by that new york was a choice location to see hawks 
as it is on their fly path from canada to warmer spots 
in an hour five birds of prey were sighted including the rare 
peregrine falcon the falcon took its time in passing barrocales 
normally talkative barely said a word as he watched 
the children from ps 122 who visited van cortlandt park also 
were impressed by the wildlife around them 
after listening to desimones message that they should take care 
of the parks underscored as he picked up a plastic sixpack holder 
and broke its rings which can strangle ducks 11 yearold lanette 
romero said she had learned a lesson 
you should keep your eyes open make sure you dont harm 
animals and look for clues like footprints 
after school she was going to the library she said im going 
to find more out about muskrats

walt disneys animated features and grated 
movies were always a sure thing for parents they didnt have to 
worry about what their children would see 
but hal willners record of disney songs should probably carry 
the label parental guidance advised 
willner has produced stay awake an album featuring 
arrangements of tunes from disney movies by such musicians and song 
stylists as ringo starr james taylor sinead oconnor los lobos 
and yma sumac 
your memories of disney films are usually very wholesome 
said willner you remember the sweetness but these are very 
dramatic movies bambi has every element birth death happiness 
fear its amazing 
these films do show the dark side of life 
and just to prove his point the 32yearold willner has given 
stay awake a generous mix of happy and sad songs along with 
aaron nevilles upbeat mickey mouse march and garth hudsons 
sunny feed the birds mary poppins are tom waits eerie 
heigh ho the dwarfs marching song and a chilling version by 
oconnor of someday my prince will come both from snow white 
and the seven dwarfs 
i have heard other disney tributes willner said but no 
one was exploring that other stuff 
stay awake is willners fourth compilation record his others 
include amarcord nino rota which paid tribute to the man who 
scored many of federico fellinis films thats the way i feel 
now a collection of thelonius monk songs and lost in the 
stars the music of kurt weill 
he did not intend to make a series of compilation lps but his 
inspiration seemed to run in that direction attending a concert of 
monks music at carnegie hall he was so bored by how the great 
jazzmans songs were being played he decided to put together a 
tribute of his own 
willners decision to make the stay awake record also came 
about spontaneously he had purchased an anthology back in the 
mid1970s played it for about a week and then put it away 
but the album remained on his shelf and when he started thumbing 
through his collection in search of another project angel voices 
sang he said as he came upon the disney record 
finding artists wasnt a problem since he had made broad 
contacts through his previous records the trick was fitting them 
together in a coherent album so opening with ken nordines hi 
diddle dee dee pinocchio and finishing up with ringo starr 
crooning when you wish upon a star pinocchio willner 
takes his listeners through a bumpy ride on the wonderful world of 
disney 
the performers were selected from around the world from los 
angeles came bonnie raitt who sings baby mine dumbo with 
the funk group was not was 
don was son had the copy of the dumbo soundtrack willner 
said we sat around his house one night and kicked around the 
names of singers we liked a great deal and bonnie was one of them 
willner got van dyke parks and harry nilsson to visit starr in 
england and persuade the exbeatle to sing on the record 
one of the first guys i thought of was ringo willner said 
i remembered goodnight from the beatles white album its 
not a conventional singing voice but it works 
oconnors appearance on stay awake mary poppins came 
about when willner visited dublin at the end of 1987 
i saw her on television and i went aaaah i thought boy 
would that be great if she could do prince will come 
and to willners surprise oconnor readily agreed completing an 
acoustic version of the song in one take 
back in the united states he recruited the minnesotabased rock 
group the replacements who performed a stomping version of 
cruella de ville 101 dalmatians 
we got in touch with them they were on and off the record 
three times but at the last minute they decided it was a cool 
project 
in new york willner got suzanne vega through aampm records which 
issued stay awake and met james taylor at a party 
he got up and sang this old ballad and it was so beautiful and 
i talked to him and told him about the record i always did like 
james taylors voice 
taylor sang second star to the right peter pan and the 
list goes on and on jazz singer betty carter covering im 
wishing snow white rems michael stipe 10000 maniacs 
natalie merchant and the roches combining on little april shower 
bambi nilsson singing zipadeedoodah song of the 
south 
i had to stop the record sometime willner said you cant 
keep recording forever 
but willner can keep making records next might be a tribute to 
the late composer pianist and orchestra leader duke ellington but 
fans will have to be patient 
producing leaves you open to ulcers because you have to get the 
best performance possible the producer said i love the final 
product but the process is very hard emotionally its an average 
of one every two years

ignore the wheelchair and arthritis 
her 80 years weigh lightly upon the mind and wit of mfk fisher 
whose gifts to the world of food and literature are still mounting 
but shed a tear for the grand dame of gastronomy mary frances 
kennedy fisher denies herself the pleasure she gives her army of 
admirers in the 17 books and scores of magazine pieces that for 50 
years set a lean and spicy standard few can match 
i never read anything ive written she snapped i dont 
care to go back i never read a word of print about me or by me 
she wouldnt argue with going back to being able to use her hands 
for typing fate has ruled that she must dictate into a tape 
recorder theres no question of her not doing it writing is as 
important to her as air 
i am compulsive about it admitted the michiganborn author 
who wrote such tasty morsels as how to cook a wolf the 
gastronomical me consider the oyster and her pungent 
alphabet for gourmets 
chafing among cushions in her little winecountry house she 
added but its like pulling teeth its just awful i cant 
dictate to a person so i dictate secretly i dont make many 
mistakes you know its my newspaper training i dont have any 
errors once i get it down on paper thank god 
in 1937 the worlds food writers discovered a tough new kid on 
the block when they eyed this paragraph leaping from the pages of 
serve it forth mary frances first book 
the quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates 
and the rabbit stew steaming aromatic is made just as tempting 
with an onion or two pepper freshly ground a little bacon and a 
dash of cheap pure wine 
a somewhat less literate reporter observed its a shame you 
dont get to read your good stuff like that she was not 
impressed others are it was once said of her crisp prose 
she writes about food as others do about love but rather 
better fisher writes not as a specialist but as a whole human 
being spiky with prejudices charming shorttempered 
welltraveled and cosmopolitan she is a person not a gourmet 
masked as a writer her passion comes from inside her 
that was 35 years ago except for such indignities as two hip 
replacements a corneal implant and the arthritis nothing has 
changed and she remembers everything between times three 
husbands magazine pieces the books that never made me any 
money the travels in europe 
of all her mates said mary frances my real husband was jimmy 
parrish dillwyn parrish they lived in a stone house surrounded 
by a vineyard and garden in vevey switzerland 
it was there she said that she learned from her italian swiss 
neighbors to cook vegetables in their own juices with sweet butter 
or thick olive oil to encourage them a little tomatoes and onions 
and sweet peppers and all the summer things 
she credits her start in foodwriting on an episode during 
prohibition when she was living in whittier calif and her 
newspaperman father rex kennedy was teaching at a nearby college 
she was working in a postcard shop one afternoon she had a halfday 
off and decided to go the public library where she found an 
elizabethan cookbook on a table 
it smelled so good the binding i started writing she 
said 
she showed her writing to alfred fisher the man who became her 
first husband she had just turned 21 when they married and 11 days 
later they set off to france and three years in dijon where he got 
his doctorate and she earned a degree at the university of dijon 
back in the states her writing started making the rounds at 26 
she sold her first magazine story the standing and the waiting 
and it conjured visions full of verbs and wide swaths of color the 
most scholarly of her work is her translation of legendary 
gastronomer jean anthelme brillatsavarins the physiology of 
taste her favorite work 
smoothing her red polkadot dress she peered out the window of 
the small busy house she has lived in for 18 years craning to see 
who was coming to visit her next they come all day long for a few 
moments in her youthful presence they come professionally or as 
friends for interviews a publishers conference a chat advice or 
perhaps to drop off a particularly nice piece of cheese or share a 
plateful of the chincoteague oysters she loves so much 
she calls her visitors strays and wayfarers they sit with 
her near a large picture window in her sonoma county house on the 
edge of the old bouverie ranch in jack london country 
but in her eighth decade mary frances is not overwhelmed with 
the way things have gone with the world 
were suicidal declared the mother of two daughters our 
doom is sealed i take a very dim view of us as a human race the 
only one that kills itself and everything around it weve 
poisoned the earth and the land and the water what else is there to 
poison i dont have any hope for us at all 
we looked out on her green meadow rolling to the trees 
peaceful and the harsh pronouncement seemed a long way away

other labor leaders shun eric hammond and 
he rivals margaret thatcher as a hate figure for the left but many 
see the maverick union boss as a natural product of the prime 
ministers age of enterprise 
hammond is the polecat of organized labor particularly since his 
electricians union was expelled from the national labor federation 
and he appears to enjoy the role 
his eyes twinkle as he lauds laws that have emasculated the 
oncemighty labor movement since mrs thatcher and her conservative 
party won power in 1979 
im only halfjoking when i say well be erecting statues to 
the tories before the end of the century he said why because 
they will have saved the trade union movement from itself 
labor legislation in the thatcher decade has outlawed sympathy 
walkouts forced secretballot membership votes before strikes are 
called and empowered employers to sue unions for damages resulting 
from illegal strikes 
a revolution was wrought in british working practices and 
hammonds 360000member electrical electronic telecommunication 
and plumbing union joined it 
in his office at the unions elegant headquarters a converted 
mansion in commuter country 10 miles from london hammond continues 
the unionbaiting that got him banished from the trades union 
congress the 9 millionmember british labor federation 
he is accused of splitting organized labor making cozy nostrike 
deals with employers invading the territory of other unions and 
through a 1986 deal with publisher rupert murdoch to run his 
hightechnology presses breaking the power of newspaper production 
unions 
hammond 59 is a sharp contrast and constant provocation to 
leftwing leaders of old traditional unions arthur scargill and 
his national union of mineworkers for instance and the huge 
transport and general workers union with its 1250000 members 
hard times have been forced upon the unions and the way eric 
hammond has tried to solve this is through sweetheart deals with 
employers said andrew murray an official of the transport union 
a strike is always a weapon of last resort the question is 
whether union officials have the right to surrender that resort 
in september the trades union congress expelled hammonds 
electricians for refusing to abandon singleunion nostrike deals 
with a japanese electronics company in wales and a british food 
chain 
hammond unrepentant delivered his credo in a final speech to 
the federations annual conference and walked out before the 
expulsion vote was taken 
our members he thundered reveal an enthusiasm for the 
market system and its values and infuriate the sherryparty 
revolutionaries with their model resolutions and conferencehall 
rhetoric 
he is negotiating a merger with the amalgamated engineering 
union which has 800000 members and is the nations second largest 
after the transport workers 
if that goes through next year the trades union congress must 
either take the electricians back in their new form or risk the 
emergence of a rival federation of the highestskilled workers 
although hammond is isolated at least for now he sees himself 
as the smart kid on the block the adapter to modern realities in a 
bleak time for organized labor 
membership in unions belonging to the trades union congress has 
declined from nearly 13 million to under 9 million since 1979 
nearly 50 percent of british workers belonged to unions then but 
only 35 percent do now 
hammonds background is impeccably working class he is the son 
of a papermill timekeeper grew up in a modest home at gravesend 
20 miles east of london and became an apprentice electrician at 16 
he began as a leftist he said but moved right 
communists took over the union but were kicked out in a 1962 
ballotrigging scandal and the right has controlled it since frank 
chapple hammonds cockney predecessor was the scourge of the left 
in the socialist labor party which unions founded and finance 
chapple now a life peer sitting in the nonelected house of 
lords warned his many enemies in the tredes union congress when he 
retired four years ago you think im rightwing wait till you 
see eric 
experience bore him out 
hammond has excoriated the london labor party for as he put it 
consorting with terrorists lesbians and other queer folk 
he has pushed singleunion deals with or without nostrike 
clauses that stipulate binding arbritration 
unions have made more than 30 such arrangements mainly with 
japanese electronic companies often after several unions vie to 
offer managers the most attractive package 
hammonds alliance with murdoch revolutionized the newspaper 
industry in less than two years when murdoch fired 5000 production 
workers in january 1986 for striking against new hightech 
machinery hammond and his electricians moved in to run the presses 
with the production unions vanquished the rest of the national 
newspaper industry quickly followed suit 
the other unions were demanding jobs for life and murdoch 
said get lost hammond said in the interview i dont see how 
we could have acted any differently 
these deals are what our members want and thats what its all 
about membership were operating in a tough environment

milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine new york is 
showing what welldressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and 
dozens of other american cities are planning hundreds of events to 
celebrate the bicentennial of the french revolution 
americans love a party they love a bicentennial and they love 
france the french revolution is a natural said christopher 
henze cultural attache at the us embassy in paris henze is 
keeping track of more than 300 concerts exhibits symposiums 
festivals film series and tv shows taking place across the united 
states in 1989 
birmingham ala alone has an events list nine pages long that 
includes marcel proust at the university of alabama lectures 
wine tastings productions of molieres tartuffe and cooking 
classes by a chef from paris famed le cordon bleu 
the french are enthusiastic about the american revolutionary 
fervor and have decided to send the original declaration of the 
rights of man and citizen to an exhibit at the smithsonian 
institution in washington next spring it will be the first time 
frances most precious document has been on display anywhere since 
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to 
the french constitution 
the declaration was drafted in 1789 by emmanuel sieyes the 
french statesman and clergyman and mirrored the ideas of the 
liberal enlightenment it spoke of the equality of men and the 
inalienable rights to security liberty and property 
the founding document of the french republic will be flown across 
the atlantic on april 18 on another source of french pride the 
supersonic concorde which will be on view for a short while at the 
smithsonians aerospace museum 
that a single small country like france can have itself 
represented by a beautiful jet like the concorde and a document like 
the declaration of the rights of man is incredible said sir 
valentine abdy the smithsonians representative in europe he has 
arranged for a concorde plane to be given to the smithsonian when it 
goes out of service 
french musicians and americans of french ancestry will play on 
the washington mall june 30july 4 at about the time the 
smithsonians new york branch the cooperhewitt museum is 
displaying the best objects from two centuries of french decorative 
art and design 
the 25 million cost of the lart de vivre exhibit is being 
paid by the french comite colbert a group of luxury goods companies 
such as krug champagne and hermes 
cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in new orleans san diego 
and elsewhere the metropolitan museum of art in new york will show 
fashions from the age of napolean costume from revolution to 
empire artist gustave corbet will be reconsidered at the brooklyn 
museum in an exhibit that will later travel to minneapolis and for 
lovers of the printed word the new york public library will offer 
the revolution in print a collection of books broadsides 
prints posters manuscripts and periodicals many on loan from the 
bibliotheque nationale 
french dancers from the paris opera ballet and other companies 
will pirouette across stages from north carolina to massachusetts 
daniel barenboim will lead the orchestre de paris on a sevencity 
tour including stops in chicago and at new yorks carnegie hall and

washingon dc 
keyboardist ray charles and saxophonist dexter gordon will swing 
with french jazzmen claude bolling and claude nougaro at carnegie 
hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at 
washingtons kennedy center for the arts chicagos orchestra hall 
and the los angeles universal amphitheatre 
what does jazz have to do with the french revolution 
nothing but its a chance to celebrate the role of the french 
over several decades in giving black american musicians the right to 
work the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated 
audiences said edward tuck who will produce a television show 
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived 
and worked in paris such artists have have included the late 
composers and pianists thelonius monk and bud powell 
tuck who is also president of the frenchamerican foundation 
said the number and variety of us celebrations reflect americas 
awareness that the french revolution was the basis not only for the 
declaration of human rights adopted aug 26 1789 but also for the 
us bill of rights adopted 30 days later 
and that is no coincidence he said ideas ricocheted 
between the great thinkers of our two countries it is the 
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a 
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual 
is born with 
celebrations will crescendo on bastille day july 14 when 200 
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven 
prisoners instead the day marked the beginning of lowerclass 
participation in the revolution which had been led by the 
bourgeoisie middle class against the aristocrats and the clergy 
in milwaukee more than 200000 people are expected to attend a 
fourday festival where food vendors will cook crepes and froglegs 
kabobs to be washed down with champagne or rather american bubbly 
white wine because its cheaper said betsy kohler who is 
coordinating the event 
there will be a mock arc de triomphe constructed as the finish 
line for a midnight run not to mention the everpopular guillotine 
we had one last year and everyone liked it kohler said 
its the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and 
someone else takes their picture also its very nicely painted and 
has the history of the revolution printed on it 
a lot of people are going to learn about the french revolution 
this year

1950 graduate of unc who lined up in the same backfield as charlie 
choo choo justice on the tar heel football team we dont want 
to be secondrate 
rizzo was impressed with the faculty when he took the job in 
september 1987 at the same time he understood why some had left 
with all of the problems of a state university including the 
bureaucracy and underfunding we have still managed to build a high 
quality faculty he said in a recent telephone interview from his 
office in chapel hill were in danger of losing them 
rizzo said money was only one reason why talented professors were 
leaving the school for other opportunities thats why he is the 
chief proponent of a plan to construct a new home for the business 
school at a cost of between 20 million and 30 million 
weve got a majorleague faculty with a bushleague facility 
he said a new building would be practically and symbolically very 
important 
just like a good medical school a business school cant be 
successful without significant clinical activity he said other 
business schools may be too lavish but if were going to conduct 
programs with the corporate world we need adequate facilities 
despite those obstacles the business school recently was ranked 
no 8 in the country in a poll of 3000 mbas conducted by 
businessweek magazine 
rizzo has put his stamp on the schools curriculum giving it 
what he described as a global perspective 
a globalization of the curriculum is not unique to this 
business school he said explaining that any reputable business 
school could not ignore the study of international business in the 
late 1980s 
the school also has introduced the international executive 
series a program which brings in business leaders from such 
countries as japan and the soviet union as well as prominent 
american corporate executives who have worked overseas 
the first lecture last month was given by kenichi ohmae 
management director of mckinsey amp co of tokyo the subject do 
trade deficits really matter in a global economy 
other speakers include vf lishchenko of the academy of sciences 
of the ussr in moscow s parker gilbert chairman of morgan stanley 
group inc johnson amp johnson chief executive officer james burke 
ibm corp chairman and ceo john akers and john welch chairman of 
general electric 
rizzo wants to encourage more faculty and stdents from the 
business school to work and study abroad and he wants to bring in 
more foreigners to teach and study at the school 
the impact of culture on business is important he said 
just learning the language is not enough we need to develop an 
appreciation for the things we dont understand because we lack the 
cultural background 
for example he said the conversation at a business lunch in 
some european countries may focus on music or literature not the 
latest leveraged buyout or stock tip 
its easy to pick up the phone and do business in this country 
because we speak the same language rizzo said building 
relationships in other countries can be difficult we need people 
groping and struggling to do business effectively in the foreign 
marketplace 
the schools reputation seems to be improving as evidenced by 
its move up in the businessweek rankings from the top 15 last year 
to the top 10 in addition a washington dc public relations 
firm peabody fitzpatrick communications inc is hard at work 
promoting the international lecture series among other projects 
to be this good given all the drawbacks we have is 
remarkable rizzo said

rate of 418 trillion following a jump of 17 percent in october 
the biggest in a year 
however the october figure was distorted by surges in farm 
subsidies and auto workers bonuses the agency said excluding 
those factors personal income rose 06 percent in november and 08 
percent in october both significantly stronger than the inflation 
rate 
the department also said personal consumption spending which 
includes everything except interest payments on debt rose 06 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 332 trillion last 
month after a robust 10 percent gain in october 
the numbers were in line with expectations and had little effect 
on financial markets on wall street the dow jones industrial 
average down 661 on tuesday slipped another 143 points to 
216464 
bond prices and interest rates were little changed 
it looks like 1988 is going out with a bang said robert 
brusca an economist with nikko securities co international inc in 
reference to the income and spending report 
but brusca said the new statistics were likely to displease the 
federal reserve board which has been raising interest rates in an 
attempt to slow the economy 
the feds goals are to slow inflation and to cool domestic 
consumer demand so manufacturers can produce enough exports to 
whittle the us trade deficit 
with spending rising faster than income in november the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income dipped 
to 43 percent from 52 percent in october economists say one way 
to curb the trade deficit is to increase americans savings 
disposable or aftertax income declined 03 percent in november 
following a 17 percent gain a month earlier it was the first 
decline since april 
wages and salaries key components of personal income were up 
04 percent to a 252 trillion annual rate in november following a 
large 15 percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers 
manufacturing salaries edged down 05 percent after a 22 percent 
increase in october 
the biggest increase in spending last month was for durable 
goods big ticket items expected to last three or more years 
the category rose 15 percent followed by a 06 percent increase 
for nondurable goods and a 03 percent rise in spending for 
services

grade of us crude rose 15 cents wednesday to settle at 1630 a

platinum refining giant johnson matthey plc says 
it wasnt improper that it didnt disclose its knowledge of ford 
motor cos plans to develop platinumfree catalytic converters 
last weeks announcement by ford that the converter was being 
tested sent platinum futures tumbling in a market that had been made 
bullish up to that point by the british refiners forecasts of 
strong platinum demand 
johnson matthey the worlds largest platinum refiner on 
wednesday reiterated its bullish forecasts and top company officials 
shrugged off suggestions that the company acted improperly in not 
disclosing its advance knowledge of the device 
johnson matthey not only supplies ford with platinum but also 
said it had collaborated on the development of the device 
some market analysts believed johnson matthey had a moral 
obligation to disclose its knowledge of fords plan 
but three officials of the british company who rushed from 
london to new york to give a press briefing rebuffed suggestions of 
impropriety 
we dont believe thats an issue said kevin gibbons general 
manager of international marketing for johnson matthey 
gibbons said the company wants to be a responsible supplier 
to its customers 
johnson matthey also sells platinum to general motors corp 
chrysler corp volkswagen of west germany britains jaguar and 
other big automakers 
but one metals analyst said johnson mattheys failure to disclose 
it knew of the project was over the line of what was proper and 
moral 
gibbons and the other two officials expressed surprise that the 
platinum market reacted so strongly to fords sketchy announcement 
about the experimental device for controlling auto pollution 
platinum for current delivery closed last thursday at 53190 a 
troy ounce on the new york mercantile exchange down 70 an ounce 
from wednesdays close the heavily traded contract for january 
delivery dropped the daily limit of 25 during that session there 
is no limit on the spot contract 
on wednesday platinum settled 660 to 810 higher on the new 
york mercantile exchange with the spot december contract at 54240 
a troy ounce and the more active contract for delivery in january at 
53840 a troy ounce 
analysts linked wednesdays rally to buying by bargain hunters 
whose confidence was bolstered by johnson mattheys statements 
in a statement johnson matthey called the markets negative 
reaction last week exaggerated and inconsistent with the 
technical possibilities of fords new catalyst the feasibility of 
the catalyst for wide use has yet to be proven the company said 
ford has said it plans to test the device on 40000 to 50000 new 
ford thunderbirds and mercury cougars sold in california a state 
with the toughest air quality standards in the nation 
the johnson matthey officials reiterated their bullish forecast 
for platinum which first was published nov 15 in a 24page review 
in that report the company predicted a supply shortfall for 
platinum for the next five years including a record 465000ounce 
shortfall this year 
platinum is an essential element in automobile pollutioncontrol 
systems the metal in conjunction with certain other metals acts 
as a catalyst in chemical reactions that convert harmful exhaust 
pollutants into harmless carbon dioxide and water this process 
occurs inside metal boxes called catalytic converters that have been 
required since 1975 on all cars sold in the united states 
johnson matthey said it expected the use of platinum in catalytic 
converters in 1988 to account for nearly 75 percent of platinum 
demand in north america and for more than a third of world demand 
for the metal 
the refiner also said new pollution standards in europe would 
contribute to a steady increase in global platinum demand for the 
next six years 
platinum is and will remain overwhelmingly the prime metal for 
use in cleaning up automobile exhaust gases the company said in 
the statement issued wednesday

the final car made at the kenosha auto plant 
has rolled off the chrysler corp assembly line followed by the 
layoffs of another 700 chrysler workers as automaking neared its end 
here after 86 years 
united auto workers local 72 president ed steagall said the final 
car a maroon omni subcompact rolled out about 230 pm wednesday 
there are some who are sad and other people were crying and 
still others were relieved to know that the stress was ending the 
awaited plant closing was here said steagall who spent the 
morning with workers in the final assembly division 
the workers laid off wednesday were among nearly 4000 to lose 
jobs since friday steagall said he said only 300 to 500 more 
remained in the plant to close down operations and strip equipment 
in preparation for fridays formal closing 
chrysler which bought the plant from the former american motors 
corp in 1987 announced in january it would end car production 
here eliminating 5300 jobs the company will continue operating a 
kenosha engine plant with about 1000 employees 
those who worked on the final car began emerging from the gate 6 
plant exit at midafternoon many went straight to gather with 
friends at local taverns 
it just got quieter and quieter as the jobs closed down along 
the line and people were allowed to leave said barbara schneider 
a worker in final assembly and 14year veteran at the plant by 
the time the car was ready it was so quiet it was almost 
depressing 
she said workers no longer were bitter but were sad about having 
to leave their expanded family 
the impact of the plant closing would be more noticeable as she 
and other dislocated workers begin looking for new jobs she said 
i raised my kids working here and now theyve grown up and now 
im going to be looking for a new job in the same market that my 
kids are entering schneider said im going to be competing 
against my kids to get a job 
kitty koski a 10year employee said leaving behind the memories 
of working in the same plant that her parents did would be more 
difficult than finding a new job 
e solidarity the friendship and tut youre not going to find 
the solidarity the friendship and the pride that workers have 
here she said 
her husband wayne a 15year plant employee was one of the last 
people to work on the final omni 
we just jacked up the engine put it in the car and we left 
he said 
chrysler officials did not allow reporters or photographers into 
the plant to watch the final cars processed but steagall said many 
workers brought their own cameras and video cameras to photograph 
the work on the last cars 
automaking in kenosha began when thomas p jeffrey co built its 
onecylinder rambler in 1902 the jeffrey co became nash motors 
corp in 1918 then nashkelvinator in 1937 and american motors in 
1954 
citing the age and inefficiency of its kenosha plant chrysler 
told state officials jan 27 that it would shut down the operation 
state officials threatened to sue chrysler saying the no 3 
automaker had promised verbally to keep the plant open through 1992 
in exchange for 5 million in state job training money 
chrysler later reached an outofcourt settlement taht included 
250 million in aid to workers the community and the state

takeover speculator paul a bilzerian claims his 
federal indictment on charges stemming from the governments 
sweeping investigation of wall street corruption is the result of 
overzealous prosecution 
bilzerian who acquired the defense contractor singer co earlier 
this year following a hostile battle has been indicted on federal 
charges of lying to the government and illegally hiding stock in 
connection with four multimilliondollar transactions in 1985 and 
1986 
the 12count indictment announced wednesday against the 
38yearold st petersburg fla resident was the latest outgrowth 
of investigations indirectly linked to the ivan boesky insider 
trading scandal 
manhattan us attorney rudolph giuliani revealed the indictment 
hours before he announced a tentative settlement of criminal charges 
with the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc that also 
stemmed from the boesky case 
giuliani said the probe of bilzerians activities was continuing 
but the prosecutor declined to identify anyone else who might be 
involved 
bilzerian immediately denied wrongdoing in a statement issued 
through his lawyer arthur mathews and blamed the indictment on what 
he called prosecutors seizing on the growing public concern about 
corporate takeovers 
i believe this indictment is the price i am paying for having 
become publicly identified with takeovers a business activity 
concerning which the prosecutors in new york appear to have lost all 
perspective he said 
a onetime real estate investor who has made runs on several big 
companies bilzerian took control of singer in february after a 
106 billion takeover struggle he has since been busy selling 
pieces of singer which is based in stamford conn 
singer was not among the transactions mentioned in the 
indictment which concerned bilzerians attempted takeover of 
cluett peabody co alleged ownership of 58000 shares of hh 
robertson co attempted takeover of hammermill paper co and 
alleged ownership of 306600 shares of armco steel 
in the cluett transaction the indictment said bilzerian lied in 
claiming he used 20 million of his own money to finance his 
purchase of cluett stock when in fact he primarily used money 
that he had raised from a small group of wealthy businessmen he 
made a 7 million profit by later selling the stock 
the indictment further alleged bilzerian illegally hid ownership 
of 58000 shares of hh robertson by selling it to the los 
angelesbased brokerage jefferies amp co with the understanding that 
he would buy it back later 
this activity commonly known as stock parking can be used 
to avoid securities and exchange commission reporting requirements 
and acquire stock positions in companies without disclosing them 
publicly 
stock parking conspiracy and filing fraudulent statements were 
further alleged in bilzerians accumulation of stock in hammermill 
paper and armco also done in concert with jefferies the indictment 
said bilzerian made a 58 million profit by later selling his 
hammermill stake 
each count carries a maximum five years in prison and 250000 in 
fines upon conviction he is scheduled to be arraigned at federal 
court in manhattan dec 29 
there had been persistent speculation prior to the indictment 
that bilzerian was under investigation for his role in some of these 
transactions based on evidence supplied partly by boyd l 
jefferies founder of the brokerage that bears his name 
jefferies has been cooperating with government investigators 
since he was implicated in securities fraud by boesky the 
nowimprisoned speculator who turned states evidence after paying 
the government a record 100 million fine for insider trading two 
years ago 
jefferiess cooperation also has played a major role in at least 
two other securities fraud indictments this year 
last july a manhattan grand jury indicted gaf corp its vice 
chairman and two subsidiaries on stock manipulation charges after a 
failed attempt to acquire the company last month a federal grand 
jury indicted salim b lewis a wellknown takeover speculator on 
stock manipulation charges

wednesday in new york on securities fraud charges he immediately 
blamed the indictment on what he called overzealous prosecutors and 
vowed to vindicate himself in court 
in an era of financial predators and insider trading bilzerian 
became a big player in the bigmoney game while staying somewhat 
apart from it 
hes not a flashy wellcoiffed hustler in a slick suit he has 
long sideburns and a thick mustache his aversion to suits and ties 
has become a trademark 
while professing that the goal of his takeover battles is to 
finally win control of a company which he did with singer he has 
made a fortune from his string of apparent nearmisses 
four times in the last two years bilzerian has tried to purchase 
companies only to lose either because he was outbid or 
outmaneuvered yet in losing bilzerian has done well for himself 
and his investors 
in failed attempts to buy cluett peabody amp co hammermill paper 
co allied stores corp and pay n pak bilzerian has reaped 
profits of about 50 million accounts of those takeover forays show 
by selling his pay n pak shares which he bought in april he 
and a partner reportedly earned about 8 million in profits for 
three months work

the worcester mass native has accomplished much in a short 
period he collected a degree from stanford and an mba from harvard 
after a radiostation failure here he began investing in florida 
shopping centers with the financial help of his fatherinlaw

the time the strongest bull market in history was about to get under 
way then he started his takeover business

drexel burnham lambert incs proposed settlement 
is the most stunning achievement of an insidertrading probe by the 
government that reached the public eye 19 months ago 
from the start the governments tactic was to give a break to 
each person it caught in return for his help in bringing down others 
it was may 12 1986 when the securities and exchange commission 
charged drexels dennis levine with making 126 million in profits 
from illegal trading on inside information 
levine was arrested and agreed to surrender the money plead 
guilty to criminal charges and cooperate with the government 
from levine the government progressed to ivan boesky the stock 
speculator agreed on nov 14 1986 to pay a record 100 million 
penalty to settle charges of trading on inside information supplied 
by levine in 1985 and 1986 
boeskys testimony helped the government extract penalties from a 
variety of lesser wall street figures on feb 13 1987 martin a 
siegel resigned as a managing director of drexel and pleaded guilty 
to illegal stock trading and tax evasion 
along the way levine was sentenced to two years in prison and 
boesky to three boesky remains incarcerated levine got out early 
but attention shifted to drexel and whether the firm itself not 
just individual executives would be prosecuted 
on sept 7 of this year the sec formally accused drexel of a 
range of securities fraud violations in a civil suit that asserted 
the firm had conspired with boesky the case was stalled by pretrial 
arguments over the impartiality of the presiding judge milton 
pollack 
on wednesday the other shoe dropped as drexel agreed to a 
proposed settlement in which it would plead guilty to six federal 
felony counts and pay a record 650 million fine to settle the 
biggest securities fraud case in history the agreement requires 
approval of senior justice department officials and the sec 
overshadowed by the drexel deal was the indictment wednesday of 
paul a bilzerian a takeover speculator who was accused of lying to 
the government and illegally hiding stock bilzerian too was an 
indirect victim of boeskys disclosures

frederick harold joseph fought tenaciously to 
spare drexel burnham lambert inc from criminal charges and then 
when it appeared the investment firm couldnt avoid them the chief 
executive fought just as hard to fashion a deal that would protect 
his companys reputation and bottom line 
drexel said wednesday it would plead guilty to six felony counts 
and pay a fine of 650 million to end a twoyear investigation of 
the company by federal prosecutors the deal must be approved by the 
securities and exchange commission and senior justice department 
officials 
only monday it appeared that joseph 51 a 14year drexel 
veteran would refuse to give in to the governments demands he 
told drexel employees via the companys publicaddress system that a 
settlement with the government did not make sense at that point 
on wednesday joseph told employees the settlement makes sense 
from a business and human point of view 
it leaves the firm in a very strong financial position and 
allows us to refocus our energies on running the business 
successfully he said 
joseph a softspoken boston native and harvard graduate joined 
drexel in 1974 after spending seven years with ef hutton amp co and 
four with shearson hamill co 
he worked his way up to the head of corporate underwriting at 
drexel it was in that position that he and michael milken who 
heads drexels junk bond department led the firm to a near monopoly 
in the mushrooming junk bond market 
josephs success catapulted him to the chief executives job in 
1985 
when stock speculator ivan boesky settled insider trading charges 
with the federal government two years ago he implicated drexel in 
his plea agreement joseph steadfastly maintained the firms 
innocence and said it would fight any charges 
he reiterated that position over and over even after the 
securities and exchange commission filed civil charges against 
drexel in september 
it was only in recent weeks that it became apparent that drexels 
and perhaps josephs resolve had weakened 
he likely was influenced by several key drexel executives who had 
been pushing for a settlement on grounds the continuing barrage of 
publicity and negative speculation was eroding the firms ability to 
maintain its business 
joseph also was likely swayed by the investigations toll on its 
bottom line in a memo to employees last month the chairman said 
the governments investigation had cost the firm an estimated 15 
billion in revenue 
if drexel had been indicted that amount would have soared and 
the firm might have lost financing from major banks and it could 
have taken years for the charges to be resolved 
but even with those obstacles joseph fought hard reportedly 
letting pass several deadlines set by the government for a 
settlement 
the investigation has cast doubt on josephs future with drexel 
although he reportedly has said he expects to outlast the firms 
problems drexel has talked recently to former white house chief of 
staff howard baker about bakers becoming chairman of the firm

the socalled junk bonds pioneered by drexel 
burnham lambert inc are corporate securities that pay a high 
interest rate because they carry a higher risk of repayment than do 
conventional bonds 
the bonds are designed to allow companies without a track record 
of earnings to borrow money based on whether they have sufficient 
cash flow to pay off their debts 
junk bonds pay higher interest rates than conventional 
investment grade bonds because they are viewed as riskier 
investments often because they are used in transactions that saddle 
a company with large amounts of debt the bigger debt load increases 
the risk that a company might default on its debt payments 
junk bonds came into prominence during the 1980s as a means of 
financing corporate buyouts especially debtdependent leveraged 
buyouts 
in the last 10 years the junk bond market has grown explosively 
from less than 25 billion in bonds issued in 1977 to around 160 
billion last year or 25 percent of the 650 billion corporate debt 
market 
the average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old has 
around 1 billion in assets and employs more than 4000 people 
according to drexels calculations

when margaret thatcher told the house of commons 
the other day that shed eaten a scrambled egg for lunch she was 
doing much more than making small talk 
the prime minister was trying to calm a salmonella panic that has 
forced a government minister to resign hurt the poultry industry 
cost taxpayers more than 35 million and left the public bewildered 
about whether britains eggs are safe 
the crisis began dec 3 when edwina currie then the junior 
health minister told a television interviewer that most of the 
egg production in this country sadly is now infected with 
salmonella 
coming from anyone else it might have passed unnoticed but mrs 
currie 42 is no ordinary politician she is colorful outspoken 
and ambitious and her words command attention 
ever since she brandished handcuffs during a lawandorder debate 
at the conservative partys 1981 convention her welltimed 
headlinegrabbers have made her famous 
elected to parliament in 1983 she became a deputy health 
minister in 1986 arriving at work in a tshirt that said never 
underestimate the power of this woman 
mrs thatcher was known to be fond of the woman who had once said 
of a defeated election rival i eat people like peter kent for 
breakfast 
reveling in the role of national nanny mrs currie crusaded 
against smoking and drinking exhorted pensioners to knit themselves 
winter garments told families to forgo holidays and spend the money 
on their teeth denounced northerners fondness for junk food and 
advised traveling businessmen to avoid aids by taking their wives 
along 
so when she made her salmonella remark the knives were drawn 
she should really think before she opens her mouth 
editorialized the tabloid sun writer auberon waugh called her a 
bossy garrulous and foolish woman 
on dec 4 as egg producers said sales were falling rapidly mrs 
thatcher sought to calm the waters by saying she ate scrambled eggs 
for lunch but despite opposition ridicule and the anger of tory 
lawmakers from farming constituencies the government refused to 
give eggs a clean bill of health 
the gist of official statements was that while mrs currie may 
have overstated the problem it was real salmonella a strain of 
food poison that causes severe vomiting fever and diarrhea can be 
fatal and 26 people who died this year were carrying 
poultryrelated salmonella the health department said 
it launched a 900000 advertising campaign that said eggs posed 
very little risk for the healthy but that the elderly sick and 
pregnant should cook them thoroughly 
the ads also said 49 salmonella outbreaks affecting 1000 people 
this year were traced to eggs and that this underestimates the 
numbers 
furious egg producers said the ad only made things worse they 
said sales were down 60 percent 400 million unsold eggs had 
accumulated and many of britains 39 million egglaying hens would 
have to be slaughtered 
as newspapers reached for outrageous puns on ruffled feathers and 
curried eggs poultry farmers appeared on tv talking of bankruptcy 
the egg producers filed a dozen damage suits against mrs currie 
the press ridicule mounted and on dec 16 after meeting with mrs 
thatcher mrs currie resigned 
but at this point her image began to shift to that of a 
scapegoat brought down by the powerful farming industry and its 
friends in government 
asked frank dobson an opposition labor party lawmaker if she 
was right why did she have to resign if she was wrong why was she 
not corrected all in all no one any longer knows what the 
truth is 
on monday when the government announced a 34 million bailout 
for the farmers the daily express was one of several newspapers 
that denounced the government for paying off the very industry that 
had unleashed the disease the egg industry has behaved 
appallingly in the hounding of mrs currie it editorialized 
even the venerable violin virtuoso yehudi menuhin weighed in 
writing to the times to say mrs currie shared the classical fate 
of all bearers of bad tidings the scapegoat is sacrificed thus 
delaying diverting and betraying the remedy 
helen morris of london whose husband contracted salmonella from 
eggs and was sick for 10 weeks said if the producers sued mrs 
currie she might countersue the producers 
many praised mrs currie for using her publicity skills to raise 
health consciousness while former lawmaker tom benyon said the 
affair would help britons understand better now they have seen it 
in action the brute power of the lobby

they stand up they sing they flicker on and off 
ingenuity and high technology have led to some unusual christmas 
cards which retailers say are a big hit with japanese holiday 
shoppers this year 
take for example the card that unfolds into an upright 
christmas tree complete with blinking red lights and a twotune 
repertoire of rudolph the rednosed reindeer and santa claus 
is coming to town 
its very big with 18 to 25yearold women this year said 
takehiro ushishima of the sales promotion department at tokyu hands 
a popular store for hobby goods 
the songs are stored in a tiny integrated circuit that is 
activated by a light sensor when the card is opened the cost is 
about 15 
tokyu hands has already sold out of cards made with real gold 
costing upwards of 3 
the most popular new cards this year are those that come with 
compact discs ushishima said the discs feature one or two 
christmas tunes and are often decorated to match the cards they are 
sold with 
hightech cards are decidedly upscale averaging over 8 each or 
more than four times the price of the conventional printed card 
but this year card makers in general have been more 
elaborate bringing up the average price ushishima said 
christians are a 1 percent minority in japan where buddhism and 
the indigenous shinto faiths are most common and christmas is not a 
national holiday however many japanese nonchristians celebrate 
christmas by having parties exchanging gifts or eating special 
foods 
sales of christmas cards are now at their peak said ichiro 
saito public relations director of itoya a major stationery store 
in the swank ginza district 
its been a good year for christmas cards because of the 
emperors illness saito said 
emperor hirohito 87 has been seriously ill since sept 19 
causing a mood of selfrestraint in the public including a slump in 
the sale of new years greeting cards 
it appears that christmas cards are more popular because their 
neutral message of seasons greetings is more appropriate than 
happy new year saito said

michael milken the man at the center of the 
drexel burnham lambert inc trading scandal built the modern market 
in junk bonds the favored financing tool of ambitious 
entrepreneurs and corporate raiders 
the milkencontrolled network of investors who buy and sell the 
highyield highrisk bonds is so pervasive that drexel reportedly 
has been pressed to rework terms of its settlement to protect its 
prime trader 
drexel agreed wednesday to plead guilty to six felony counts and 
pay a record 650 million fine to settle a criminal case filed by 
the us attorneys office in new york the deal requires approval 
by the securities and exchange commission and senior justice 
department officials 
milken wasnt involved in the tentative settlement but is named 
in a parallel civil case filed by the sec against drexel 
a new york public relations firm milken hired to represent him 
issued a statement saying there is no change in his position and 
his attorneys are continuing to prepare to defend him against any 
charges that might be brought 
milken a boyish evangelist of free enterprise is credited with 
broadening the market for junk bonds once spurned by many 
investors under milkens leadership drexel transformed the 
securities into a handy tool for corporate raiders and small 
businesses to raise cash either to buy companies or to expand those 
that werent big enough to swing big bank loans or attract 
conservative bond investors 
milken became central to the junk bond markets operation 
presiding over a network of investors from an office he persuaded 
drexel to set up in beverly hills 
though many other firms now deal in the bonds drexel remains a 
leader and milken a prime mover when it comes time for a junk bond 
issue milken can line up buyers from among those who have 
previously benefited by selling their own junk bonds 
milken works long hours and lives unobtrusively in a home in 
suburban encino that once was owned by clark gable he is rarely 
available for media interviews and only on his own terms 
said to be a devoted family man he also is a philanthropist on a 
grand scale he has contributed nearly 263 million to three 
endowments over the last six years those organizations capital 
fund foundation the milken family foundation and the mampl milken 
foundation have paid out 17 million to more than 200 charities and 
community groups 
but that part of milkens life too has come under the cloud of 
the wall street scandal 
capital fund is named in the secs civil complaint against drexel 
as one of the organizations that took part in illegal trades 
after a los angeles times story detailed the foundations 
activities the california attorney generals office began a probe 
rep john dingell dmich demanded last month that the internal 
revenue service investigate to see if the organization had violated 
rules for taxexempt charitable trusts 
the state audit will focus on possible selfdealing by officers 
of the foundations said assistant attorney general carole ritts 
kornblum 
capital fund foundation spokesman lance morgan has denied any 
wrondgoing by the foundation 
a los angeles businessman who has dealt with milkens charities 
described them as wellrun ventures that have supported innovative 
projects to improve public and private education among other 
causes richard riordan an attorney and philanthropist disputed 
critics of milkens charity work 
here the guy gave away 263 million riordan said wednesday 
the guy could have bought a yacht bigger than financier donald 
trumps and more planes than adnan kashoggis 
he gives money in a brilliant way he doesnt just throw it 
around riordan said he has a good staff and they rifle in on 
whats needed

following meetings with corporate takeover 
specialist henry kravis japanese banking officials said thursday 
they remained undecided about their role in his firms record 2453 
billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc 
kravis a partner in kohlberg kravis roberts amp co met wednesday 
and thursday with more than a dozen leading japanese banks to urge 
them to participate in financing the purchase 
japanese banks are expected to provide a significant portion of 
the 14 billion in bank financing needed for the rjr takeover 
representatives of drexel burnham lambert inc one of kkrs main 
financial brokers also met wednesday in tokyo with about 250 
japanese bankers and institutional investors to pitch the sale of 
35 billion in highyield highrisk junk bonds that will help 
finance the purchase company officials said 
officials at leading japanese banks said they were not given 
enough information about the buyout plan to decide on participation 
which a sanwa bank official said would require a careful weighing 
of the high risks against the high profits 
were still deciding whether to become involved said a 
official at mitsubishi bank who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity the meetings with kravis and drexel were just a 
general presentation of the purchase not a request for a specific 
amount of funds 
an official at daiichi kangyo bank the worlds largest bank 
said it had not received a detailed analysis of the transaction or 
of plans to sell off certain rjr assets a common way to finance 
corporate takeovers 
were very interested but arent able to make a decision 
without the full materials he said 
some newspapers have speculated that kkr will attempt to sell off 
some portions of nabisco a food producer to japanese firms 
kravis said in an interview with the nationally circulated 
newspaper asahi shimbun that japanese banks responded very 
positively to his contacts but that he still was unsure how much 
they would provide he said he was considering approaching other 
japanese banks early next year in a bid to increase the number of 
participants 
asked about estimates that he hopes to raise as much as onethird 
of the total bank loan in japan or about 5 billion kravis said 
kkr had not decided on a division of financing 
in recent weeks japanese newspapers have reported that the 
finance ministry was frowning on japanese participation in the 
buyout plan because of potential risks and concern that such 
leveraged buyouts might spread to japan where they remain very rare 
a senior ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said thursday the ministry had concern about the issue but 
the decision whether to participate is up to each bank 
bank officials said they had not received any direct 
communication from the ministry regarding participation 
in a leveraged buyout a purchaser uses a portion of the assets 
and future earnings of a company to pay for its purchase junk 
bonds which are issued by companies whose credit ratings are below 
normal investment grade often are used to help finance such a 
transaction

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower 
in early trading today on the chicago board of trade due mainly to 
profittaking following strong rallies wednesday in the corn and 
soybean markets 
soybean futures opened slightly higher contrary to expectations 
on technically inspired speculative buying but those gains were 
quickly trimmed 
the soybean complex also was pressured by the agriculture 
departments announcement late wednesday that the soviet union had 
canceled a purchase of 102500 metric tons of us soybean meal 
analysts said 
wheat futures were expected to open higher on the usdas 
announcement that it had targeted morocco for sales of 1 million 
metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices 
but with several wheat contracts trading at lifetime highs the 
wheat market is probably keeping its powder dry and looking to the 
outside mkts with people tending to be cautious said arthur 
parrish an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
youve got a fair amount of profittaking at these levels he 
said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 2 cents lower with march at 283 a bushel oats were cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 232 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 2 cents lower with january at 793 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange with frozen porkbelly prices down 
sharply in reaction to wednesdays usda monthly coldstorage report 
showing supplies of frozen bellies as of nov 30 at a recordhigh 
level for that date 
live cattle were 07 cent to 25 cent lower with february at

after asserting innocence for more than two 
years wall street powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc has 
reversed itself by agreeing to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 
a record 650 million fine to settle the biggest securities fraud 
case in history 
the plea bargain announced wednesday by us attorney rudolph w 
giuliani is the most stunning break in a criminal probe of the 
nations fifthlargest investment firm which bankrolled some of the 
biggest corporate takeovers of the decade through its pioneering use 
of highyield junk bond securities 
the probe already has cost drexel nearly 2 billion in lost 
business and legal expenses sapped morale of its 10000 employees 
and seriously undermined what many consider wall streets most 
aggressive and able financier 
sources familiar with drexels decision who spoke on condition 
they not be identified said its board of directors agonized 
wednesday afternoon before approving the settlement which would 
brand drexel as a felon but spare it a potentially ruinous 
drawnout trial 
other sources said the agreement also increased the chances that 
former senate majority leader howard baker whose tennessee law 
partnership has been hired by drexel as a corporate governance 
consultant would join the firm most likely as chairman baker was 
in new york on tuesday and met with drexel officials during 
deliberations on the case 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said baker a 
former white house chief of staff was not interested in assuming a 
major role at the firm if it meant presiding over a lengthy trial 
the settlement would mark a complete turnaround in drexels 
claims of innocence it also does not protect michael milken 
drexels senior highyield bond executive and another key target of 
the criminal probe milken has asserted hes done nothing wrong 
the deal with giuliani still requires approval by the securities 
and exchange commission and senior justice department officials 
by admitting guilt in the settlement drexel exposes itself to 
numerous lawsuits by investors who claim they were victimized by the 
firms admittedly illegal acts 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on how the 
board voted or its specific reasons but said directors had 
concluded that this settlement is in the best interest of our firm 
and our employees 
milkens public relations agent the new york firm robinson 
lake lerer amp montgomery said in a statement there is no change 
in his position and his attorneys are continuing to prepare to 
defend him against any charges that might be brought 
sec enforcement director gary lynch did not return telephone 
calls for comment about the agreement between drexel and giuliani 
the agreement is the highwater mark in a federal crackdown on 
securities fraud that resulted in the arrest two years ago of ivan 
boesky the nowimprisoned inside trader who turned states evidence 
and was a key source of information in the case against drexel 
the 650 million fine more than four times as large as the 
secs annual budget is by far the biggest penalty ever assessed 
for securities fraud it easily surpasses the previous record of 
100 million levied against boesky in november 1986 
the settlement also marks a major victory for giuliani who had 
been pressuring the firm for weeks to settle the case or face a much 
broader and potentially crippling racketeering and fraud indictment 
there are contingencies giuliani told reporters at a hastily 
called news conference everybody is proceeding in good faith i 
hope 
giuliani said the felonies cover mail wire and securities fraud 
violations but would not be more specific he also declined to 
elaborate on the components of the 650 million fine except to say 
it would cover criminal fines civil penalties and future damage 
claims against the investment firm 
asked why he chose to press for a settlement instead of proceed 
with an indictment giuliani said when a corporation is involved 
the best result you can get after any trial is a financial result 
theres no point of prolonging this getting involved in 
criminal litigation to get a result that would not be any better 
than this 
several key drexel executives themselves had been pushing for a 
settlement saying the continuing barrage of publicity and negative 
speculation was eroding the firms ability to maintain its business 
anreder alluded to the internal pressure for a settlement in his 
statement saying for the past two years our employees have 
endured extraordinary hardship and this unprecedented and complex 
case might have taken several more years to resolve 
he also said after the settlement we will continue to have 
one of the strongest financial positions of any firm in our 
industry the settlement will allow us to concentrate all our 
energies once again on serving our clients and building our 
business 
the us attorneys probe of drexel closely resembled the 
investigation by the sec which filed a wideranging civil suit 
against drexel milken and three other key employees three months 
ago the suit which has been stalled in federal court accuses them 
of conspiring with boesky to commit a litany of frauds ranging from 
insider trading to phony recordkeeping

the eec commission on thursday proposed 
legislation to harmonize the widely differing rules on corporate 
takeovers in the 12 european economic community nations 
under the legislation a company offering to buy more than a 
third of another firms shares must offer to buy all shares 
also a company initiating a takeover would have to state its 
intentions about a target companys future activities the fate of 
its work force and indebtedness 
the requirement on indebtedness would be important in cases 
involving a leveraged buyout in which the purchase is financed by 
the future debt of the target company 
the proposed legislation would also forbid company management 
from carrying out exceptional operations or share sales to block 
a takeover without the permission of their shareholders 
the legislation was proposed after months of intense debate on 
the issue at the eec head office it now goes to the 12 eec member 
states which may amend the proposed legislation 
one commission expert said the proposed legislation reflected a 
golden mean between the extensive takeover legislation in force 
in some eec nations and the lack of major guidelines in others 
britain has the eecs most developed takeover rules whereas 
corporate takeovers and legislation governing these are 
virtually nonexistent in denmark and greece 
the approach to takeover legislation varies considerably from one 
eec nation to the next 
france spain and portugal have a great deal of binding 
legislation while many guidelines in britain west germany italy 
the netherlands and ireland are voluntary codes the law in belgium 
and luxembourg is largely the product of accumulated precedents 
the commissions proposed uniform takeover regulations are part 
of its bid to create a singlemarket eec as of dec 31 1992 
it said unfiform guidelines are important as the number of 
takeovers is likely to rise in advance of 1992 and crossborder 
corporate relationships develop and intensify 
another commission proposal on merger and takeover policy which 
was discussed by eec trade ministers on wednesday is a separate 
move to prevent such actions from harming industrial competition

control data corp facing a breakeven 
year in 1988 says it told its 27000 us employees they must take 
five days off without pay in the first quarter of 1989 
that equates to a 78 percent pay cut in the first quarter or 
about 2 percent for the year frank ryan a spokesman for the 
computer company said wednesday executives will take an 
additional 5 percent pay cut over the first six months of 1989 he 
said 
in addition merit pay raises have been delayed three months and 
the company has canceled for the first six months of 1989 its policy 
of matching a portion of employee contributions to a company pretax 
savings plan the company had matched 25 percent of the first 2 
percent of an employees cash compensation ryan said the company 
wont say how much money these measures will save he said 
in a letter to employees notifying them of the cutbacks control 
data chairman robert price said they were necessary to regain our 
momentum by showing a profit in each quarter of 1989 ryan said 
if control datas financial position improves by the third quarter 
of 1989 employees will be repaid with as many as five extra paid 
days off ryan said 
the companys 7000 employees in other countries will not be 
affected by the cutbacks 
countries around the world have a variety of labor relations 
laws that make it difficult to implement this ryan said

more than 5000 polaroid corp employees 
have signed a petition that sends a clear message to hostile suitor 
shamrock holdings inc and its president stanley p gold thanks 
but no thanks 
the petition which includes signatures from about 60 percent of 
polaroids worldwide work force also was designed as a protest 
message that corporate takeovers are potentially damaging to 
employees 
we dont believe his takeover of polaroid is in our best 
interests richard duffy a 30year polaroid employee and member 
of the steering committee for the petition drive said thursday 
the petition circulated at polaroid headquarters here and in 
plans around the world in the last 10 days says shamrock has no 
experience in managing a hightech company and has not yet explained 
to polaroid employees the method of paying the astronomical debt 
needed to acquire the company 
it also says polaroid workers have no comfort or confidence 
that the acquisition would benefit the company its shareholders or 
the community 
shamrock a burbank califbased television and radio concern 
wholly owned by the roy e disney family has offered 42 a share in 
a bid that values the instant camera pioneer at about 26 billion 
polaroid has called the bid too low and asked stockholders to reject 
it 
the takeover hinges on the pending outcome of a trial in delaware 
chancery court where shamrock is seeking to have polaroids 
10millionshare 300million employee stock ownership plan 
overturned shamrock claims it was enacted to forestall a takeover 
the plan would all but block a takeover because it puts 14 
percent of polaroid stock in the hands of employees under delaware 
takeover law a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of 
a targets outstanding shares for control polaroid is incorporated 
in delaware 
the employee petition opposing the takeover has no bearing on the 
court case 
the petition was the idea of employees who want to form an 
independent group of supervisors and hourly workers at polaroid 
plants in eastern massachusetts and around the country 
the petition was signed by salaried and nonsalaried workers it 
represents a clear majority of polaroids 8300 employees 
it focuses specifically on employee rights duffy said our 
belief is what is happening to employees in the takeover arena is an 
afterthought if a thought at all 
to some extent we felt we were sitting on the sidelines 
observing and hearing whats going on it was disempowering he

government prosecutors have humbled drexel 
burnham lambert inc but by deciding to settle with the junkbond 
kingpin without a trial they missed the opportunity to clarify just 
which kind of dealings are legal and which are illegal 
us attorney rudolph giuliani took a pragmatic approach in the 
case against drexel he got the fifthlargest firm on wall street to 
agree to fork over 650 million in fines and restitution plead 
guilty to six felony counts and cooperate with government 
investigators 
worst of all for drexel the settlement could result in the early 
departure of its most valuable employee junkbond wizard michael 
milken who now could be indicted and face trial by himself 
but by settling giuliani gave up the chance to clear up two 
muddy but critical questions about insider trading 
how many people must know a valuable piece of information before 
it can be considered public knowledge so that people can trade on 
it legally 
how definite must a deal be before public disclosure of inside 
information is required 
because such questions remain open the line that separates the 
illegal from the wellconnected is a blurry one 
i think its really too bad that we didnt get a trial on these 
issues both to find whether drexel really did what it was charged 
with doing and whether those things were illegal said alan 
bromberg a securities law expert who teaches at southern methodist 
university 
exactly how pragmatic giuliani was will not be known until the 
six counts are made public there has been some speculation that 
giuliani in a compromise agreed not to indict drexel on some 
serious insidertrading charges in exchange for getting drexel to 
agree to a big fine and to cooperate with the ongoing investigation 
if it turns out that the charges are only for technical 
violations such as parking stocks in accounts to conceal their 
true ownership it would be harder for aggrieved stockholders to 
ride the governments coattails to recover damages 
also such limited charges would send the wrong message to others 
on wall street who are contemplating insider trading namely that 
if youre clever enough and sufficiently welldefended you can plead 
guilty to one of these more technical violations without admitting 
to serious fraud bromberg said 
still there is no question that the proposed settlement 
announced wednesday was a blow to drexel and the 650 million was 
not the worst of it 
in spite of all the assertions that personalities dont matter 
milken means more to drexel than michael jordan does to the chicago 
bulls 
if milken leaves his xshaped trading desk in beverly hills 
calif drexel could lose its preeminence in the business of 
raising money through the issue of highyielding highrisk junk 
bonds 
drexel requires that employees take a leave of absence if 
indicted milken has indicated that if he is indicted he would quit 
drexels junkbond business will not die but it could slowly 
wither particularly if a large part of milkens staff left with him 
it is sometimes not clear where the loyalties of drexels clients 
lie 
harold simmons a dallas billionaire takeover specialist who has 
used drexel in three junkbond financings predicted thursday that 
milken will beat any charges against him and stay with drexel but 
he has also said that he would follow milken if he set up his own 
firm 
i think mike milken is one of the nicest guys ive ever met 
simmons said 
william farley whose farley industries is counting on drexel for 
help in its pursuit of westpointpepperell inc indicated he has 
made contingency plans in case milkens departure makes it 
impossible for drexel to do its job something he said he considers 
highly unlikely 
drexel is likely to make out better than ef hutton amp co inc 
but worse than kidder peabody amp co to name two other firms that 
have been caught up in wall street scandals this decade 
hutton was caught in 1985 kiting checks that is circulating 
money between banks so it earned more interest than it deserved the 
scandal hurt huttons credibility especially with banks and 
municipalities it also made it hypersensitive to impropriety 
which hampered its dealmaking ability 
already hobbled hutton was crippled by the stock market crash of 
1987 and driven into the arms of shearson lehman brothers inc 
which acquired it late last year 
kidder in contrast survived allegations of insider trading 
against several top officials it agreed in june 1987 to pay 25 
million to settle civil charges of insider trading and an improper 
stock parking scheme with boesky it escaped any criminal 
charges and has suffered no lasting damage

coffee futures prices fell sharply thursday on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange ending a sixday rally amid preholiday 
profittaking on signs that a brazilian dockworkers strike was 
nearing an end 
on other exchanges precious metals futures continued to rise 
grains and soybeans were mixed livestock and meat futures were 
mixed energy futures rose and stockindex futures retreated 
trading activity on most markets was light with many independent 
traders starting the christmas weekend early most us futures 
markets will close at noon local time on friday and reopen tuesday 
morning 
futures prices for green unroasted coffee settled 5 cents to 
655 cents lower with the contract for delivery in march at 14939 
a pound 
exchange officials halted trading in coffee futures for 55 
minutes shortly after a chaotic opening in which the market was 
swamped with sell orders linked to reports that some dockworkers had 
returned to their jobs in the brazilian port of santos the busiest 
coffee port in the worlds largest coffeeproducing country 
the strike which began dec 13 has been a key factor in 
coffees dramatic price surge from less than 125 a pound on dec 1 
to the twoyear high of 159 a pound recorded wednesday 
other fundamental factors underpinning coffees gains include 
tight us warehouse stocks delayed shipments from central america 
a rainslowed harvest in colombia and a drought in the prime growing 
areas of brazil 
these bullish developments have been playing out against a 
backdrop of rising demand coffee consumption peaks each year during 
the winter months in the northern hemisphere 
today we reacted strongly to expectations that the port strike 
in brazil is close to a resolution said arthur stevenson a 
coffee analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
also he said the market has had almost a vertical advance 
over the last two weeks and you dont need a harvard phd to 
realize it was time for a correction 
prices of precious metals futures advanced for the third 
consecutive day in a continuing rebound from the steep selloff that 
occurred last week after ford motor co announced its development of 
a platinumfree catalytic converter 
the use of platinum in the automobile pollutioncontrol devices 
accounts for about onethird of world platinum consumption but 
analysts say fords experimental converter is unlikely to 
significantly reduce platinum demand for several years 
were seeing a natural very tentative gravitation toward the 
prices that we saw before the ford announcement said richard 
levine vice president of precious metals and foreign exchange 
trading with elders futures inc in new york 
platinum settled 180 to 830 higher on the new york mercantile 
exchange with the spot december contract at 54420 a troy ounce and 
the more actively traded january contract at 54070 a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 250 to 290 
higher with february at 42130 a troy ounce silver was 38 cents 
to 44 cents higher with march at 6268 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the chicago board of 
trade in light thin trading as players evened up their positions 
ahead of the long christmas weekend 
after the close the usda announced the soviet union had 
purchased 1 million metric tons of us corn and china had been 
awarded 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with march at 
438 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
march at 283 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with 
march at 232 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 8 cents 
higher with january at 792 a bushel 
frozen porkbelly futures prices fell steeply on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in reaction to wednesdays monthly usda 
coldstorage report showing supplies of frozen bellies as of nov 30 
at a record high level for that date 
livestock futures finished mixed in lackluster trading 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 10 cent higher with february 
at 7390 cents a pound feeder cattle were 27 cent lower to 08 
cent higher with january at 8390 cents a pound live hogs were 18 
cent lower to 17 cent higher with february at 4657 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 98 cent to 110 cents lower with february 
at 4407 cents a pound 
energy futures advanced in light preholiday trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange reflecting investor optimism that oil 
prices would move higher 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 25 cents 
higher at 1649 a barrel heating oil was 46 cent to 77 cent 
higher with january at 5248 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was

a group of 35 congressmen most of them from 
textile states has complained to top banking and security 
officials about farley incs unsolicited 14 billion bid for west 
pointpepperell inc claiming the proposed deal would weaken the 
nations battle against textile imports 
the letter to federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and 
securities and exchange commission chairman david ruder includes 
general worries about leveraged buyouts and also echoes pepperells 
specific charges that the bid is too heavily financed by debt 
among those who signed the letter sent this week are rep richard 
ray dga whose district includes pepperells headquarters in west 
point ga and rep henry gonzalez dtexas who will chair the 
house banking committee in the new congress 
meanwhile farley on thursday again extended its 48pershare 
offer until jan 4 the offer originally was made in october and 
has been extended past several expiration dates 
and pepperells board set a special shareholders meeting for feb 
25 at the meeting farley will attempt to replace current board 
members with its own nominees who would be expected to rescind 
pepperells antitakeover defenses 
leveraged buyouts in which acquisitions are financed with 
borrowed money secured by the targets cash flow or assets may be 
saddling corporations with a dangerous level of debt which will 
restrict their ability to modernize and to weather economic 
downturns the congressmens letter said 
the 1934 securities exchange act directed the federal reserve 
board to issue margin regulations to limit the excessive use of 
credit in securities transactions the letter said now more 
than ever congress expects the federal reserve board and the 
securities and exchange commission to assure that those margin 
regulations are enforced 
pepperell has filed suit trying to block farleys bid claiming 
among other things that the offer violates those regulations but a 
federal district judge ruled against the georgia company the case 
has been appealed to the 11th us circuit court of appeals which 
has set a jan 11 hearing date 
by any objective measure west pointpepperell is a growing and 
healthy company the letter says but farleys plans to break up 
the company after a takeover means we risk losing one of the 
strongest us competitors in the worlds textile market 
textile manufacturers long have complained about what they see as 
unfair foreign competition and the signers of the letter include 
some of the leaders in unsuccessful efforts to erect import quotas 
of the signers 21 of the congressmen are from north carolina 
south carolina georgia and alabama all of which have a 
concentration of the nations textile industry 
chicagobased farley a privately owned conglomerate that 
manufactures such items as fruit of the loom underwear and acme 
boots said thursday it had been tendered or already owns about 58 
percent of pepperells outstanding stock 
farley also has succeeded in forcing pepperell to call the 
special shareholders meeting getting holders of more than 25 
percent of the outstanding stock to call for the session 
pepperell the nations largest publicly owned textile company 
has about 294 million outstanding shares its products include gold 
toe socks arrow shirts and martex towels

macmillan inc said thursday the buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co had terminated its proposed purchase 
of four macmillan units for 400 million but the publisher said it 
still expected to find buyers for the properties 
macmillan which was acquired for 25 billion last month by 
britains maxwell communication corp said kohlberg kravis 
indicated it was dropping the deal due to rising interest rates and 
problems in arranging financing for the purchase 
but a kohlberg kravis spokesman said the firm backed out of the 
deal because of restrictions set by macmillan and maxwell 
earlier this month macmillan and maxwell announced they had 
agreed to sell kohlberg their macmillan books clubs inc an 
operator of several specialty book clubs specializing in the 
sciences gryphon editions which publishes reprints in medicine and 
law intertec publishing corp which publishes 14 specialty 
magazines and webb publishing which publishes agricultural 
magazines 
proceeds from the sale were to be used to help pay off some of 
the debt incurred in the maxwell buyout 
kohlberg kravis had backed senior macmillan managers who 
unsuccessfully competed against maxwell for macmillan 
kkr suspended moving ahead with this deal because macmillan and 
maxwell imposed certain structures and special requirements to 
complete the transaction by yearend because of tax reasons said 
thomas daly a spokesman for kohlberg kravis that could not be 
done 
daly also said that as negotiations proceeded the firm decided 
the values initially understood to be there were not there given 
the arrangements and structure placed on the transaction by maxwell 
and macmillan 
macmillan also said in a news release it was confident of getting 
buyers for the properties at similar prices and expected to make 
further announcements shortly 
dave jackson a spokesman for macmillan and maxwell north 
america said there were ongoing talks with possible buyers but 
declined to comment on when any deals might be announced 
macmillan has outlined a number of divestitures in the wake of 
the maxwell buyout including the planned sales of its gumps retail 
unit katharine gibbs schools technical schools and direct 
marketing group 
macmillan said its previously announced sale of michie co to the 
mead corp for 2265 million was proceeding smoothly michie 
publishes materials for the legal profession and mead is a paper 
forest products and electronic publishing concern 
macmillan also announced that the delaware chancery court had 
invalidated the socalled lockup agreement between macmillan 
and kohlberg kravis 
while battling to thwart maxwell macmillan had agreed to a 
buyout by kohlberg kravis and granted the firm the option to acquire 
four of its prize properties for 865 million in the event their 
deal fell through such options generally are used to discourage 
competing suitors 
the delaware supreme court enjoined the lockup clearing the way 
for maxwell to win the bidding fight and the chancery court removed 
the restriction entirely 
properties in the lockup were macmillans directory direct 
marketing berlitz language school and michie businesses

federal regulators announced a plan thursday to 
merge 15 insolvent savings and loan institutions in texas in a 185 
billion bailout bringing to 175 the number of failed that rescued 
nationwide this year 
the 15 texas sampls will be acquired by cfsb corp inc a holding 
company headed by james m fail of phoenix ariz who agreed to put 
up 120 million to acquire the insolvent institutions 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which guarantees 
deposits at 3000 sampls will provide assistance amounting to 185 
billion 
the transaction was part of the southwest plan launched last may 
to clean up the problems of 109 failed sampls in texas a state where 
financial institutions have been hardhit by depressed conditions in 
real estate and oil 
the latest rescue package brings the total of failed institutions 
which have been closed or merged to 69 in texas and to 175 around 
the country 
we now have consolidated more than half of the 109 texas 
thrifts that were insolvent when we started the southwest plan and 
we are rapidly moving toward our goal of completing the work in 
texas by the end of the 1989 fiscal year next sept 30 said m 
danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board which 
oversees the fslic fund 
the institutions fail acquired will reopen friday as consolidated 
federal bank fsb consolidated will initially operate all 59 of the 
branches of the former institutions the bank board said 
fail is chairman of lifeshares service co and several other 
insurance companies which operate in 47 states 
the sampls involved in thursdays action include commodore savings 
association dallas mesquite savings and loan association

federal savings and loan association lamesa 
the bank boards contribution in the latest group of mergers 
brings to more than 24 billion the amount the agency has pledged to 
resolve the cases of 175 failed sampls this year up from 48 last year 
wall says he wants to do 200 by the end of the year the board is 
rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks for institutions 
getting government assistance will be reduced after jan 1 
more than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more are 
close to insolvency estimates of the cost of cleaning up the 
industry range from 50 billion the bank boards figure to 112 
billion the estimate of the general accounting office the auditing 
arm of congress 
the problem is getting worse by more than 1 billion a month 
industry losses in the first nine months totaled 94 billion 
already surpassing the postdepression record of 78 billion set in 
1987 
private analysts members of congress and the gao have criticized 
the bank board for resolving most of the cases through assistance to 
private merger partners the rescues rely heavily on promissory 
notes which pledge income the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp expects to receive over the next decade 
critics say most of the deals fail to attract enough money from 
institutions and investors taking over the failed thrifts the gao 
in a report earlier this month said it may be cheaper in the long 
run to give the fslic the money to close the institutions and pay 
off depositors 
congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout of 
fslic when it convenes in january

the final defendant in the giant washington public 
power supply system securitiesfraud trial has settled with 
classaction plaintiffs for 20 million an attorney said thursday 
the settlement by blyth eastman painewebber inc which had acted 
as a financial adviser to wppss was confirmed by blyth eastman 
attorney james hagan 
the end of the trial came nearly six years after the first 
lawsuit was filed in the giant legal action that grew from wppss 
default on 225 billion in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power 
plants the default was the biggest in the history of the municipal 
bond market and more than 25000 plaintiffs were involved 
thats the last defendant and thats the end of the trial 
hagan said by telephone from his new york office 
the securities fraud case was being heard by a federal judge in 
tucson ariz where it had been moved from washington state 
the settlement brought to about 700 million the total that more 
than 100 original defendants have agreed to pay plaintiffs in the 
trial another 50 million could be collected through contested 
insurance claims 
total claims by plaintiff bondholders were 16 billion though 
the default was on 225 billion worth of bonds 
the trial which started sept 7 before us district judge 
william browning was recessed dec 1 and had been scheduled to 
resume jan 9 however with the settlement browning was expected 
to dismiss the jurors 
the judge still must approve 16 separate settlements made over 
much of the past year four settlements agreed to as early as 
september 1987 have already been approved by browning 
attorneys said they hoped to get the notice of settlements to the 
class of plaintiffs by jan 16 and to get approval for all of them 
in a march hearing 
with several classes of plaintiffs as diverse as original bond 
buyers and those who purchased bonds at pennies on the dollar just 
weeks ago the judge must also decide how the money is to be 
divided those who have been close to the case have said it could 
still be a year or two before final payments are made to plaintiffs 
still to be extracted from the 700 million in settlements are 
fees for dozens of attorneys many of whom have worked on the case 
for five years without being paid attorneys who have been paid have 
collected more than 100 million separate from the settlements 
tens of millions of dollars have also been spent on everything 
from computerized systems to keep track of the massive amounts on 
data to remodeling the courtroom for the aborted trial 
defendants in the lawsuit which incorporated dozens of separate 
suits filed as early as feb 22 1983 in federal court in seattle 
included the supply system the 88 utilities that contracted with 
wppss to build the two plants engineering firms wall street bond 
underwriters utility and wppss directors and the advisory firm of 
blyth eastman 
the default was on bonds wppss sold to finance construction 
starting in the late 1970s on its plants no 4 at the hanford 
nuclear reservation and no 5 at satsop west of olympia 
wppss abandoned the plants in 1982 and default occurred in july 
1983 after the washington state supreme court ruled that utilities 
participating in construction of the plants lacked authority to sign 
contracts with wppss guaranteeing payment even if no electricity was 
generated

presidentelect bush named louis sullivan to be 
secretary of health and human services thursday pushing aside a 
controversy over sullivans abortion views he also announced three 
other cabinet choices and an environmental chief as he neared 
completion of his administrations top ranks 
the selection of sullivan the first black in bushs cabinet had 
been opposed by antiabortion groups especially after an interview 
last weekend in which he said women should have a right to choose 
abortion he has taken a strongly antiabortion stance in comments 
since then 
bush characterized sullivan as a man with great credentials 
and said the 55yearold medical educator shared most of his own 
beliefs on abortion were going to opt on the side of life the 
vice president said 
sullivan president of the morehouse school of medicine in 
atlanta made a point of saying at the announcement that his 
position was the same as that of presidentelect bushs against 
abortion except in cases of rape incest or danger to the mothers 
life 
in his other announcements bush named 
samuel skinner a chicago transit official and former federal 
prosecutor as secretary of transportation 
manuel lujan jr the outgoing veteran congressman from new 
mexico as secretary of interior 
edward j derwinski a state department lawyer and former 
illinois congressman as head of the newly created veterans affairs 
department 
william reilly head of the world wildlife fund to head the 
environmental protection agency 
facing reporters after making his announcements bush was asked 
about a state department statement that us embassies had been 
informed of a terrorist threat against pan am more than two weeks 
before a pan am plane en route to new york exploded and crashed in 
scotland on wednesday 
bush citing experience as cia director said most threats 
never materialize 
if there were hard evidence that a specific flight was going to 
be threatened or that the threat could not be contained clearly you 
would want to serve the public good by notifying people he added 
bush made his cabinet announcements after meeting privately with 
ousted panamanian president eric arturo delalle the vice president 
said the policy of his new administratrion would be to continue to 
press for the ouster of panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
he sidestepped a question on whether he would be more or less 
likely to use force against noriega than president reagan had been 
i am as determined as president reagan is that noriega not 
continue in his dictatorial ways im just going to have to not 
respond more directly to what the united states might or might not 
do he said 
on anther topic bush was asked whether he would consider 
military action to destroy a libyan chemical weapon factory an 
option that reagan in a television interview had suggested was under 
consideration 
i think the answer is to discuss that in considerable detail 
at a jan 711 conference of more than 100 nations in paris to 
review international conventions against the use of poison gas and 
chemical weapons he said 
if there is a direct refusal by libya to comply with any 
international consensus that develops from that conference then we 
will consider options at that time bush said 
the presidentelect has now named heads of the 12 cabinet 
departments with labor and energy to go 
as has been his custom he appeared thursday with his new 
appointees each of whom spoke briefly when it was noted that some 
of the appointments had come as a surprise and appeared to be 
lastminute decisions bush joked its surprising to what lengths 
a person will go to fool you all 
the nomination of skinner 50 chairman of the regional 
transportation authority of northeastern illinois had been expected 
for more than a week he is a former federal prosecutor a former 
executive with the ibm corp a pilot and a longtime political 
supporter of bushs 
both he and bush mentioned his job would include supervision of 
the coast guard and they promised to improve its drugintercepting 
efforts skinner said he was ready to roll up my sleeves and go to 
work 
lujan 60 has served the albuquerque area in congress since 
1968 he becomes the second hispanic named to bushs cabinet 
joining education secretary lauro cavazos addressing his new duties 
at the interior department he said with apparent emotion if one 
little piece of our public trust is desecrated we all suffer for 
it 
lujans brother ed said he had been in washington the day 
before to attend a meeting with bush and hispanic leaders and that 
bush took him aside and asked him where he could find manuel 
right then i gave him the numbers i had and he called and asked 
manuel to meet with him last night at his home 
derwinski 62 a world war ii veteran had not figured in 
speculation about the veterans affairs post and he said the offer 
from bush came only a few hours before the formal announcement the 
old veterans administration becomes a fullfledged cabinet agency in 
march and he said he would spend the weeks before then putting 
together an efficient bureaucracy 
earlier transition aides had suggested that retired threestar 
army general julius w becton jr who now heads the federal 
emergency planning agency had been in line for the veterans job 
asked what happened to becton who would have been the cabinets 
second black man bush said what happened to him hes doing very 
well hes doing a superb job in that fema 
reilly 48 said he believed he was the first head of a 
conservation organization chosen to run the epa and he said that 
reflected how the presidentelect views the work ahead of us 
the storm over sullivans abortion views presented the sharpest 
political challenge bush has faced thus far in filling his cabinet 
the outcry arose after sullivan said in an interview in sundays 
atlanta journal and constitution that he privately supported a 
womans right to choose abortion though he opposed federal funding 
for the procedure 
under sharp criticism from the republican right sullivan later 
told conservative lawmakers that he shared bushs antiabortion 
views including a proposed human life amendment to the 
constitution 
asked on thursday whether like bush he would favor criminal 
sanctions against doctors who perform abortions if the procedure 
were made illegal but not against the pregnant woman sullivan 
retorted questions on prosecution are best left to prosecuting 
authorities 
bush was asked whether his own position didnt constitute a 
double standard it might appear to be a double standard to some 
but thats exactly how i feel he said 
john c willke president of th national right to life committee 
said in a statement thursday that there are still many unanswered 
questions about dr sullivans position 
friends have described sullivan as a political independent but 
with close personal ties to both bush and to his wife barbara bush 
has been a member of the medical schools board of trustees since 
1983 
bush has not yet named a woman to head any of the governments 14 
cabinet agencies however transition sources said federal 
communications commissioner patricia diaz dennis is on a short list 
of contenders for the post of labor secretary

electronic data systems corp has beat out 
its former chairman h ross perot for a lucrative contract to run 
the texas medicaid program state officials said thursday 
national heritage insurance co an eds subsidiary that has run 
and maintained the texas medicaid program since 1977 was competing 
against perot systems corp for the contract which involves the 
processing of 11 billion a year in medicaid claims 
under the contract eds will get 25 million a year for 
administration and up to 5 percent of that could be retained as 
profit the previous contract allowed up to 10 percent for profit 
george newstrom an nhi senior vice president said the 
dallasbased company could earn up to another 49 million a year if 
it saves the state money in medicaid claims however because it 
shares in the risk of the program it also could lose up to 49 
million annually he said 
the contract is for four years and it has two twoyear 
extensions at the states option 
h ross perot founded the computer company eds in 1962 and sold 
it to general motors in 1986 joining the gm board in the process 
he formed perot systems after breaking with gm in a dispute over 
management of the automaker 
the state department of human services staff said the bid 
submitted by perot systems did not meet technical requirements said 
steve svadlenak associate commissioner for budget and economic 
analysis 
when representatives of the companies submitted their bids the 
offer by eds included 11 boxes of documents perots was in two 
manila envelopes 
when informed of omissions in the proposed bid svadlenak said 
perot systems said it could not meet the requirements because it did 
not have access to the existing computer system used by eds 
the department staff found eds complied with state requirements 
regarding access to potential bidders 
the bid by perot systems marked the companys first formal effort 
to compete with eds since a virginia judge ruled in october perot 
could go after the same data processing business as his old company 
as long as he does not enter into contracts that provide for profits 
until after next december 
the current eds contract expires aug 31 1989

a federal judge has ordered texaco inc a texaco 
subsidiary and chevron usa inc to pay 29 million in back 
royalties for an oil concession in ecuador to an albany ga oil 
and mining company 
the order filed by us district judge william hoeveler last week 
concludes a 12yearold lawsuit filed by norsul oil amp mining co 
ltd against texaco inc and a texaco subsidiary and against gulf 
oil corp now chevron usa inc 
the lawsuit claimed a contract between norsul and the defendants 
provided for the transfer of an oil concession in ecuador from 
norsul in exchange for the payment of royalties to norsul the 
royalties were to have been based on the production of oil within 
the property in consideration 
norsuls attorneys have contended the defendants used an 
unreliable and unapplicable survey to show improperly that an oil 
well known as shushufindi no 1 in ecuador the greatest producer 
within the area transferred was exempt from royalty payments 
hoeveler ruled as valid norsuls claims that the defendants were 
guilty of breach of contract he ordered the defendants to pay 293 
million to norsul in back royalties and that royalties continue to 
be paid until termination of the contract 
the rate of royalty payment amounts to about 1 percent of the 
rate of production of shushufindi no 1 which in february was 
measured at about 3500 barrels per day by early 1988 shushufindi 
no 1 had produced an estimated 17 million barrels of oil since its 
production began in 1972 
norsul oil amp mining is a canadian corporation with its principal 
office in albany ga
