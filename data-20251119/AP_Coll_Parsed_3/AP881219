a federal study to determine whether a drug can 
fight the onset of aids in people who carry the aids virus may be 
delayed because of a failure to attract enough volunteers in new 
york city according to a published report 
six new york medical centers participating in the study have 
attracted only 257 volunteers the new york times reported sunday 
recruitment may be suffering because carriers of the aids virus do 
not want to risk being among the volunteers given a placebo and not 
the drug it said 
the study was designed to see whether azt or azidothymidine can 
prevent or delay the onset of aids in people who carry the virus but 
have not developed symptoms of the disease the antiviral agent has 
already been shown to prolong the lives of seriously ill aids 
patients 
some volunteers in the study are given azt while others are given 
a placebo 
clinics in other cities participating in the study have not 
experienced serious recruitment difficulties the university of 
minnesota had 166 patients enrolled in the study while cornell 
medical center in new york city had just nine volunteers after five 
months of recruitment through newspaper advertisements doctors who 
have large aids practices and gay organizations 
the recruitment problems in new york which has more aids 
patients than any other city could slow down the entire study the 
times said 
some new york city study participants also may be cheating by 
taking steps to find out if they are getting azt or the placebo and 
then dropping out of the study or getting azt from other doctors 
the newspaper reported some volunteers in the study also are said 
to be taking antiaids drugs that have not been approved for use it 
said 
act up an aids organization has charged that other tests for 
experimental drugs at three city medical schools have excluded the 
poor minorities and women by drawing their volunteers from private 
hospitals where most aids patients are white middleclass men 
rather than from municipal hospitals the times said

the spirit of polygamist john singer 
gunned down by lawmen nearly a decade ago is a constant presence at 
the murder trial of three young men who took up arms for his cause 
it lives in his son john timothy singer who has spoken with 
anguish of his fathers death and in the testimony of addam swapp 
husband of two of singers daughters and his fatherinlaws 
spiritual heir 
and it is felt in the german immigrants handmade buckskin coat 
worn by addams brother jonathan and in the volumes of mormon 
scripture the three defendants have brought each day to a courtroom 
where closing arguments were scheduled today and the jury after 
nine days of testimony was expected to begin deliberating 
singer and the swapp brothers are charged with murdering a state 
officer during a gunfight that ended the clans 13day standoff with 
police at their marion homestead last winter 
the confrontation began after singer and the swapp brothers 
bombed a nearby mormon chapel on jan 16 the ninth anniversary of 
the elder singers death and retreated to the family compound 
clan leader addam swapp 27 said the bombing was prompted by a 
divine revelation 
it has to do with the injustices perpetrated against our 
family he testified john singer was shot in the back and 
nobody cared 
the truth has been trampled on more than once and we took a 
stand swapp said we knew we had to do it we knew we had to 
take one day at a time and trust in our god 
corrections lt fred house who had joined an fbi team in an 
attempt to arrest the swapps on jan 28 was ordering a reluctant 
police dog to subdue the pair when he was shot in a volley of rifle 
fire from the wheelchairbound singer 
singer 22 admitted firing the fatal shot but contended he was 
aiming at the dogs 
swapp an excommunicated mormon married heidi singer in 1980 and 
her sister charlotte a few years later the father of seven he has 
said he believed the bombing would trigger john singers 
resurrection and the collapse of a wicked and corrupt church and 
state 
singers widow vickie says her husbands death was the result 
of a conspiracy between state authorities and church officials angry 
at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send his children to 
public schools the mormon church officially abandoned polygamy in 
1890 
the singers also excommunicated mormons taught their children 
at home to shield them from a system they believed was tainted by 
sexual promiscuity drug abuse and racial mixing 
finally fearing the state would place his children in foster 
homes singer 48 holed up in the compound for 18 days before being 
shot by officers in 1979 police said he pointed a gun at officers 
trying to arrest him 
in an interview taped by federal agents and played for the jury 
john timothy singer said that his father was shot as he walked to a 
mailbox 
all these men zoomed in on him on snowmobiles 10 men what 
ive heard he said and he pulled out his gun and he you know 
said back off i dont want any trouble now and he turned 
around to run home my sister saw this through binoculars and as he 
turned around to run home they shot him two to three times in the 
back 
the younger singer a thin quiet man left a paraplegic by a 
logging accident four years ago told of his mothers wrongful death 
lawsuit which was dismissed by a federal judge for insufficient 
evidence 
i mean we couldnt get justice he said i mean my dads 
been killed and shot and it wouldnt even be tried 
if convicted singer and the swapp brothers face five years to 
life in prison 
addam swapp already has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on 
federal charges related to the bombing and standoff singer and 
jonathan swapp were given 10year sentences in the case while 
vickie singer was sentenced to five years

the columns of tanks are gone from 
city streets and hundreds of soldiers who staged an abortive 
rebellion earlier this month have returned to the barracks 
but argentinas military remains restive and no one is 
predicting that the third insurrection in 20 months against the 
civilian government of president raul alfonsin will be the last 
the military crisis was resolved not the military question 
says antonio berhongaray chairman of the senate defense committee 
there could be another insurrection 
government officials have worked since the fourday revolt ended 
dec 4 to assess the loyalty of army units some of which openly 
sided with the rebels and others which refused to confront them 
and to meet some of the rebel demands 
a general who publicly sympathized with rebel commander col 
mohamed ali seineldin was retired and the government hastily put 
together funds to give soldiers a 20 percent pay increase and a 
christmas bonus 
that may reduce tensions in the ranks but it doesnt address the 
root of the problem say some prominent argentines many in the 
military want an end to human rights trials of officers for their 
roles in a campaign of repression during the 197683 military 
dictatorship 
they want a better role in society for the military which lost 
the 1982 falklands war and led argentina into economic chaos during 
its rule 
but argentinas military has toppled six civilian leaders since 
1930 and some say it has never learned its place in society 
the point is the central point is the military does not 
respond to civilian political power says adolfo perez esquivel 
director of the human rights group peace and justice service and 
winner of the 1980 nobel peace prize 
in an interview at his sparsely furnished office perez esquivel 
referred to one of the last incidents of the rebellion and said 
right in front of loyal troops rebels fired tear gas and shot 
at civilians 
there arent loyal troops theyre all accomplices of the 
rebels he said his voice devoid of stridency or anger they 
share the same ideology they only differ in method some were 
against the insurrection some wanted to work through the political 
system 
on dec 12 the commander of the 5th army corps gen humberto 
ferrucci confirmed the suspicions of many when he said the 
insurrection ended with an agreement between army chief lt gen 
jose dante caridi and seineldin 
there is widespread doubt that loyal troops suffocated the 
rebellion as alfonsin ordered them to do but instead reached an 
agreement with the rebels the terms of which have yet to be 
disclosed 
that prospect unsettles among others elias robert salazar 
president of the 8000member buenos aires lawyers association 
asked if the end of the rebellion meant democracy in argentina 
was strengthened or the institution of the presidency was 
fortified salazar shook his head from side to side and said 
i think the situation of civilian political power is worse 
because the armed forces demonstrated that they are loyal to 
themselves and not to the president and commanderinchief 
alfonsin 
the conclusion i draw is that the military doesnt want power 
right now because the situation is not favorable they would be 
repudiated by the people and economically they would be taking over 
a situation that would not allow them to govern they dont want 
power but they want to give the orders 
their demand for a recuperation of military honor and dignity 
which had widespread resonance through the ranks was a 
reaffirmation of the military view that the battle to curtail the 
kidnappings bombings and assassinations of the 1970s was a civil 
war 
a speech saturday by defense minister horacio jaunarena supported 
that view jaunarena said the campaign through brutal was 
necessary 
the view of human rights groups and others is that the arrest 
disappearance and presumed execution of 9000 argentines was a 
brutal repression of society 
alfonsin has portrayed the end of the rebellion as a clearcut 
victory in which organized labor big business foreign governments 
and tens of thousands of argentines who gathered in plazas to 
protest the insurrection forced the rebels to give in 
but the opposition peronist party with an eye to may 1989 
national elections is criticizing alfonsin for his handling of the 
revolt and demanding he develop a policy toward the military that 
reduces the risk of another revolt 
asked what effect the insurrection might have in the election 
pollster manuel mora y araujo said were asking ourselves that 
but so far we dont know it hasnt ended

seventeenyearold arnel galang still 
wakes up screaming haunted by the faces of the 23 relatives he lost 
a year ago when the ferry dona paz sank with more than 3000 people 
aboard 
arnel then a high school senior was one of only 26 passengers 
and crew who survived after the 2215ton dona paz collided with the 
629ton oil tanker vector and exploded off mindoro island the night 
of dec 20 1987 
a presidential commission said at least 3563 people were aboard 
the two ships but the precise figure may never be known only 108 
bodies were recovered after the disaster which the coast guard 
blamed on the vector 
for arnel the year has been one of bitterness and pain he feels 
abandoned by a government that he says has done little to help him 
family members blame arnel for not saving his relatives 
including cousins aunts and an infant niece who perished on the 
dona paz 
everything that happened is still clear to me he said his 
hands trembling sometimes i cant sleep sometimes i get 
nightmares i shout and cry then i stay awake all night in my 
dreams they tell me they have not died only wandered off to an 
unknown place but i have to face reality i just pray for them 
arnel and his relatives boarded the dona paz to go to manila to 
visit his sister rose whom he hadnt seen since childhood it was 
his first time on a ship 
suddenly about 10 pm he felt a strong thud 
he ran for a wall and squeezed himself through a porthole 
i struggled free and fell into the water he recalled i 
couldnt hear anything anymore there was just silence the sea was 
on fire my face was scalded the water was very hot as if it were 
boiling water i swam so fast i dont know how i did it 
arnel and the other survivors were rescued by a passing ship and 
brought to manila there he saw rose burned and bandaged he raced 
to embrace her 
but the joy of reunion soon gave way to resentment relatives 
blamed him for not saving other family members 
they ask me arnel why did you not save your cousins he 
said fighting back tears i tell themthere was nothing i could 
do it was difficult enough saving myself maybe if i tried to save 
them we would all have died 
since the disaster arnel said he has shunned other relatives 
including his parents who live in manila 
arnel is also bitter at the government which he says abandoned 
him he received 5000 pesos or 250 which president corazon 
aquino allocated for each survivor but he said there has been no 
psychological counseling or rehabilitation for the survivors 
mrs aquino recommended arnel for a job in a pharmacy but the 
company refused to hire him his family is too poor to afford fees 
to complete his final year of high school he works as an unpaid 
volunteer for an association of relatives of dona paz victims and 
survives on charity 
arnel said he and some relatives of victims have refused to 
accept a 1500 lump sum payment from the shipowners sulpicio 
shipping lines because the company insists they sign a waiver 
promising no further claims 
in april a group of survivors and relatives filed a class action 
suit seeking more compensation the case was dismissed and an appeal 
is pending before the supreme court 
in the meantime arnel is considering becoming a priest 
when i think about the things ive gone through and am going 
through i think that maybe god wants me to be a priest and serve 
him he said at this point i have nothing else to lose and i 
am ready to offer my life 
the sense of loneliness and abandonment is all the more painful 
at christmas 
last christmas five days after the tragedy arnel spent the day 
crying in a corner of his parents home gazing out the window this 
year he plans to spend the holiday alone 
i cant bear to face them again he said

the scantily dressed dancers are long 
gone the last liquor store was blown up six years ago this ancient 
roman city now is the capital in lebanon of shiite moslem 
fundamentalism 
public drinking and dancing are forbidden now but brief 
malefemale unions called pleasure marriages are condoned 
on the surface at least life in baalbek is governed by the 
dictates of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis stern brand of islamic 
fundamentalism in iran which to western eyes appears joyless and 
forbidding 
wearing makeup or jewelery in public is taboo so is singing and 
dancing at mixed gatherings because as one woman noted it causes 
psychological imbalance and tempts men 
but when the sun goes down and the doors are locked the black 
robelike chadors shiite women have to wear in public are discarded 
in favor of shorts and strapless tops along with makeup and 
perfume 
people think were made of stone just because we cover 
ourselves with chadors but were not were ready to do anything to 
please our husbands said selma a housewife 
before lebanons civil war erupted in 1975 baalbek was a 
cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in 
the breathtaking roman amphitheaters 
now the ruins echo to islamic slogans as the fundamentalists 
stage political rallies there chanting ritual denunciations of 
death to america death to israel the amphitheaters have also 
been used as mortar positions in lebanons sectarian fighting 
the shiites strict lifestyle has drawn bitter criticism from 
many lebanese moslems and christians alike who say that the 
fundamentalists double standards has brought islam into 
disrepute 
most shiites in baalbek belong to hezbollah party of god which 
is believed to be an umbrella for shiite kidnappers holding most of 
the 15 foreigners missing in lebanon its made up of zealots 
blindly loyal to khomeini 
we follow whatever khomeini decrees whatever he rejects we 
reject said zeinab nasser an administrator at the womens 
haouzeh or religious center in baalbek 
the practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs 
frowned on by other lebanese especially moderate shiites and sunnis 
in a pleasure marriage a young woman who would not dare expose a 
curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited 
number of lovers in the name of religion 
but most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are 
considered respectable and far from promiscuous 
the practice is widespread in iran where overwhelming majority 
of the 54 million population is shiite 
nasser said the prophet mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage 
making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period 
which could last for an hour two days a month or as long as 
they desire 
its all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child 
born after the marriage contract expires she explained 
she said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid lebanons 
economic crisis because men cannot afford a regular marriage and 
lets face it they have physical needs 
if these cannot be met within a permanent marriage pleasure 
marriage provides the outlet she added its much better than 
doing it illicitly 
no cleric is required to perform the cermony the woman who 
should preferably be either divorced or widowed tells the man i 
give myself to you in pleasure 
he responds i accept and thats it 
virgins need the consent of their parents but they often do not 
seek it 
as for forms of entertainment the fundamentalists permit 
classical music because it does not have any negative 
psychological effects nasser said 
she observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is 
bad for the nerves and the blood circulation 
like other factions in lebanon where the government has 
collapsed the shiites have established their own medical and 
welfare systems amply funded by iran 
abbas mousavi a hezbollah leader told the associated press 
social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of 
the catastrophes that have befallen lebanon 
weve founded the imam khomeini hospital here which provides 
free medical treatment there are similar centers in other shiite 
areas 
he noted weve also founded pharmacies that make a very small 
profit as well as schools which we hope will accommodate 6000 
students in the near future 
weve given money to needy families and bought deepbore drills 
to provide wells in remote villages especially those we consider 
have military or political importance 
asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and night 
clubs mousavi noted were not imposing islamic values on people 
no one can say weve raided houses where people gamble or drink 
asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs he conceded 
there were incidents where young men acted out of islamic zeal 
after witnessing aberrant behavior but hezbollah is against that

the citys population is a little more than 40 percent white 40 
percent black 15 percent hispanic and less than 5 percent of other

the government is looking for a dozen men 
who wouldnt mind feasting on a diet of king salmon for 100 days 
theyd even get paid a 2300 salary 
but theres a catch for those who participate in the us 
department of agriculture study 
were talking about salmon with dill weed broiled salmon 
baked salmon just like the fine restaurant food said gary 
nelson project coordinator for the departments western human 
nutrition research center at the presidio 
he said the study should begin in january and cautioned that it 
might not be quite as tantalizing as it sounds because it entails 
confinement lots of physical tests and no conjugal visits 
participants will sleep eat and drink at the centers hotellike 
facility that has a pool table compact disc player and television 
there will be daily walks and some organized activities but no 
monkey business allowed 
we dont want anyone to sneak a candy bar or a beer said 
nelson 
the agriculture department originally wanted women for its study 
but couldnt find any takers 
the study is intended to gauge the effect that a steady diet of 
fish has on keeping arteries free of blood clots

not far from where marine lance 
cpl jason rother ended his heroic march through the scorching 
mojave desert lies the shimmering ribbon of old route 66 
he nearly made it 
assigned to traffic duties during night desert maneuvers on aug 
31 rother was to have been picked up by 1 pm 
a communications foulup left him stranded with three canteens of 
water some dry rations and a poncho to protect him from the mojave 
desert where temperatures soar beyond 110 degrees 
nearly two days passed before a search for the 19yearold marine 
began 
the marine corps is investigating the delay and why rother was 
stranded by his unit of the 2nd marine division based at camp 
lejeune nc those matters as well as why rother was posted alone 
will be raised during courtmartial proceedings against rothers 
superiors 
the real issue is why it was 40 hours before we started 
looking says marine corps lt col fred peck from washington 
the mistake of rothers superiors cost him his life two officers 
have been relieved of their commands as a result another officer 
and two sergeants face special courtsmartial for charges of 
dereliction of duty 
meanwhile the commandant of the marine corps ordered his own 
inquiry to prevent a future tragedy 
at some point during his ordeal rother set out marking an arrow 
with stones to point his direction as he marched south out of a 
canyon 
leaving two additional arrows he turned north and began walking 
toward the highway that was once us route 66 the crosscountry 
road of hope and despair described in john steinbecks novel the 
grapes of wrath 
who knows how long he waited said san bernardino county 
sheriffs deputy chief jerome ringhofer 
ringhofer led the 160member team that ultimately discovered 
rothers skeletal remains dec 4 two earlier marineled searches 
yielded some of rothers equipment a helmet pack and flak jacket 
he abandoned on his way 
we always advise that anyone in the desert or mountains stay 
put but once he decided to move he moved with direction and 
purpose said ringhofer 
rothers bones a wallet his poncho his clothing and an m203 
riflegrenade launcher were found near the community of bagdad less 
than a mile from old highway 66 and just north of the boundary of 
the sprawling twentynine palms marine training base about 125 miles 
east of los angeles 
he covered approximately 17 miles ringhofer said he made 
a heroic effort and he almost succeeded 
he had to see the highway you cant miss it 
at the last suffering from heat exhaustion and dehydration 
rother took off his clothes and neatly folded them he neatly folded 
his poncho he was probably delirious 
he removed all his clothing all his gear he walked away and 
wandered ringhofer said at that point it was over 
the case is an unwanted first in an arm of the services that 
prides itself on taking care of its own of the tens of thousands of 
marines who train every year at the twentynine palms marine corps 
air ground combat center rother was the first lost to the 
blistering wasteland 
it is beautiful and unforgiving country ringhofer said 
peck defended the marines initial failed search for rother 
citing the use of about 1700 people aided by aircraft thermal 
heat imaging devices and the expertise of desert survival experts 
the real issue in the case he said was how rother was left 
unaccounted for for nearly two days 
the commandants investigation is to try and determine how 
did all this happen peck said it has never happened before and 
we dont want it to happen again 
last week rother was buried with full military honors at fort 
snelling national cemetery near his hometown minneapolis 
he was proud of being a marine said his mother cecelia king 
of minneapolis every time he came home he presented himself to 
his friends in uniform

presidentelect bush will take over next month 
during a period of unusual international harmony with both the 
soviet union and the palestine liberation organization sounding 
increasingly moderate 
foreign forces are likely to begin withdrawing from southern 
africa and soviet troops should be about to conclude their scheduled 
departure from afghanistan 
these are good portents for bush but history shows how ephemeral 
peaceful interludes can be just ask jimmy carter 
it was just 10 years ago in december 1978 that carter could 
look out at the world with an air of confidence able to boast three 
foreign policy breakthroughs that won him widespread albeit 
temporary admiration 
over a period of a few months carter successfully guided the 
panama canal treaties past a skeptical senate reached agreement 
with china on the establishment of diplomatic relations and his 
most shining achievement spurred the camp david breakthrough 
between egypt and israel 
at the end of 1978 carters standing in the polls had risen to 
50 per cent high by standards of the time and he seemed destined 
for a second term in the white house 
then came 1979 a year which ranks among the most disastrous 
endured by any president the year began with the ouster of the 
prowestern monarchy in iran and its replacement by an avowedly 
antiamerican islamic fundamentalist regime it ended with the 
seizure of american hostages in tehran and their detention for 444 
days 
indeed the takeover of the american embassy there was part of a 
pattern of antiamerican turmoil in islamic countries in the fall of 
1979 in the space of one month the us embassies in iran libya 
and pakistan were attacked by mobs 
before the year was out the soviet union had invaded 
afghanistan starting a downward spiral in superpower relations that 
wasnt reversed for years 
the invasion induced carter to slap a grain embargo on the 
soviets to withdraw from the 1980 summer olympics in moscow and to 
shelve the salt ii treaty which had been the centerpiece of a june 
summit meeting between carter and soviet president leonid brezhnev 
it seemed a new development buffeted the carter administration 
every month vietnamese troops occupied neighboring cambodia 
leftists took control in nicaragua paving the way for perhaps the 
most divisive foreign policy issue of the reagan presidency us 
backing for the nicaraguan contras 
almost unnoticed at the time of the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan was the collapse of a coalition government in el 
salvador which in turn laid the groundwork for a civil war that 
claimed the lives of an average of 800 civilians a month in 1980 
on the domestic front the news for carter was no better by 
years end inflation reached 12 per cent the result in large 
measure of a hefty midyear price increase decreed by the oil export 
cartel 
there also was the widespread perception that carter looked 
foolish when his subordinates claimed to have discovered in the 
late summer of 1979 the presence of a soviet brigade in cuba only 
to concede later that the brigade had been there for years 
carters showing in the polls dipped to 32 per cent in october 
after the brigade fiasco reviving somewhat by years end because of 
initial public support for his handling of the hostage crisis 
but restiveness within the democratic party over carters 
performance was such that sen edward kennedy dmass decided in 
november 1979 to challenge him for the partys 1980 presidential 
nomination carter survived that challenge but lost 44 states in his 
reelection bid he never recovered from the 1979 debacle 
in contrast to that dismal era the world nowadays seems 
downright tame being president seems easier than it did in 1979 or 
was ronald reagan just more fortunate than his hardluck predecessor

presidentelect bush has an opportunity to pull 
the defense department from the quagmire of purchasing scandals by 
appointing strong managers to monitor the weapons buying process 
more closely analysts say 
its the best opportunity weve ever had said lawrence korb 
a former pentagon official now with the brookings institution a 
liberal think tank if someone goes in there with the right team 
and the right attitude you can do more good for this country in my 
view than any secretary of defense 
bush has indicated a desire to reverse the trend that has made 
household names of such scandalridden contractors as wedtech and 
has made the practice of defrauding the defense department almost 
commonplace 
the presidentelect on friday announced the appointment of former 
senate armed services committee chairman john tower as defense 
secretary although tower earned a reputation as a friend of 
military contractors during his years in the senate and has worked 
for some of them in recent years he bowed to bushs oftstated 
commitment to reform 
the bottom line is that we must provide at least as much if 
not more defense for less money and to meet that challenge we 
must do several things we must rationalize our force structure we 
must refine and reform our management and procurement procedures we 
must have biennial budgeting tower said 
during the campaign bush embraced the recommendations of the 
packard commission a panel appointed by president reagan to study 
ways to reform the defense department 
in its 1986 report the commission proposed creation of an 
undersecretary of defense for acquisition strengthening the role of 
the joint chiefs of staff and having the president submit a twoyear 
military budget for congressional approval 
the panel was headed by former deputy defense secretary david 
packard 
i favor the packard commission reforms bush told employees 
of a martin marietta corp plant in denver colo last october 
the head of that commission dave packard supports me for a 
good reason he knows that im going to put his reforms into effect 
because i understand that those reforms cant be carried out 
piecemeal the vice president said 
during the reagan administration the defense department 
relinquished control of the acquisition process to the various armed 
services according to korb who served as assistant secretary for 
manpower installation logistics from 1981 to 1985 
congress already has acted on the commission recommendation to 
create the undersecretary position for acquisition robert costello 
currently holds the post although bush likely will name his own 
person to the job a critical selection analysts said 
for the administration to run a more effective bidding process 
they must have top quality personnel said jay koswinsky of the 
heritage foundation a conservative think tank 
congress also approved reorganization legislation sponsored by 
former sen barry goldwater rariz and the late bill nichols a 
democratic congressman from alabama 
the law overhauled the upper echelons of the pentagon 
strengthening the defense department and designating the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff as the principal adviser to the president 
and the secretary of defense 
up until 19851986 congress traditionally had prevented 
secretaries of defense from running that department because it was 
an alliance between services and these uniformed guys and these old 
barons on the hill korb said with the passage of 
goldwaternichols they gave the secretary of defense and the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the power to run it 
the department tower will run has been rocked by one scandal 
after another culminating with a federal investigation this year 
into allegations of purchasing fraud and bribery involving 
government officials military contractors and consultants 
targets of the twoyear probe include melvyn paisley a former 
assistant navy secretary who became a consultant to several 
aerospace contractors immediately upon leaving the pentagon 
some of the largest defense contractors including mcdonnell 
douglas corp united technologies corp and unisys corp had 
their offices searched as did victor cohen a top air force 
acquisitions official 
among the other scandals 
in december 1983 the sperry corp pleaded guilty to falsifying 
payment requests for defense contracts and paid a 1 million fine 
reports circulated in 1984 that the pentagon paid 7622 for a 
10cup coffeemaker used on the air forces c5a cargo plane and 600 
for a toilet seat cover 
in 1985 general dynamics withdrew its request for 491840 from 
the pentagon for the 76 trips david s lewis the companys 
chairman made from st louis to albany ga where he owned a farm 
the company later withdrew 23 million in bills 
in 1987 us prosecutors revealed that four former wedtech 
officials pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe federal state and 
city officials 
the four also pleaded guilty to grand larceny and bribery 
charges conspiring to submit 5 million in phony government 
invoices and fraudulently passing off the bronx nybased wedtech 
as a minorityowned business 
in 1988 sundstrand a rockford ill manufacturer of 
electronic mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft pleaded 
guilty to four counts of defrauding the defense department by 
overbilling on aircraft parts the company also pleaded guilty in 
seattle to mischarging on government contracts 
the company was fined 115 million for the illinois crimes and 
123 million for its sundstrand data control operation in seattle 
the largest fines paid for government contract fraud

the reagan administration says its new budget 
will contain enough money to run the nations nuclear weapons plants 
safely despite energy secretary john herringtons warning of a 360 
million shortfall that could lead to shutdowns 
reagans chief of staff kenneth n duberstein said sunday that 
unobligated balances found within the department will make it 
possible to bring the facilities into compliance with safety and 
environmental laws 
mr herrington suggested that he wanted some additional 
spending rather than going into the energy department resources and 
looking for some money which we have done duberstein said in an 
appearance on nbcs meet the press 
the president has said consistently we wont operate any of 
these plants unless we can operate them in a safe manner he said 
herrington suggested in a dec 9 letter to duberstein that the 
department might have to shut some of its plants unless the 
administration proposes more than the 129 billion planned for 
fiscal 1989 
i must in good conscience advise you that the system will 
in all likelihood be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable 
risk he wrote details of the letter were published in sunday 
editions of the washington post 
if the department gives priority to production rather than 
upgrading safety at the plants herrington said in the letter 
then unresolved environmental and safety issues are likely to lead 
to further shutdowns in the weapons complex he said a 
significant increase in resources is needed over the next five 
years or the government will risk compromising the countrys ability 
to produce and maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile 
herrington told duberstein in his letter that the department 
would use the last of an emergency contingency fund to pay for 200 
million in improvements at its savannah river plant in south 
carolina which has been plagued with safety and environmental 
problems 
he also cited unforeseen expenses at rocky flats a denver area 
plutonium processing facility with hazardous waste problems that are 
jeopardizing its operation in explaining the expected 360 million 
shortfall 
duberstein said he had sent a response to herrington he did not 
indicate on the television program whether the unobligated money to 
which he referred was in the contingency fund or elsewhere and did 
not say how much money had been found within the department 
duberstein said the department is in line for a 900 million 
budget increase next year up from its current budget of 12 billion 
the energy department operates 17 weapons plants it has proposed 
spending 50 billion in the next 20 years to build new facilities 
and correct the most pressing environmental problems

outgoing defense secretary frank c carlucci 
served in the job little more than a year but he has some advice 
for his successor work with congress but dont stop fighting for 
an increase in military spending 
carlucci also says former sen john tower shouldnt turn the 
pentagon on its head in the name of reforming the weaponsbuying 
process despite a string of scandals under the reagan 
administration carlucci says the us defense industry needs 
stability and without it the industrial base could collapse 
he has called for a 2 percent increase in the pentagons budget 
while presidentelect bush faced with a huge federal deficit has 
talked of zerogrowth 
its not a question of we cant afford it carlucci said 
if you look at the domestic programs they continue to go up at 
a rate of about 8 percent therefore using that yardstick i see 
nothing wrong with 2 percent in defense he said 
asked if he thought a democratic congress would go along with an 
increase carlucci replied if you dont try its not politically 
doable 
the defense secretary said he thought tower a veteran armed 
service committee chairman in the senate could make the case the 
world is coming our way in part because of a stronger military 
carlucci was interviewed last week in his pentagon office as he 
awaited bushs announcement of the man who would replace him 
there is no question tower will have problems managing pentagon 
contracting carlucci said indictments could be returned any day in 
the longrunning justice department investigation into pentagon 
fraud 
but the last thing the defense department needs is somebody to 
come in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and 
say were going to reform it or change it carlucci said 
the best reform for the procurement system is stability 
predictability the blueprint is laid out weve made a large 
number of changes in the procurement system real changes are taking 
place in the procurement system and i am proud of them 
he said he had instituted a total quality management program 
to impress on contractors the need for quality products as well as 
ethical conduct 
the 58yearold defense chief said he was looking forward to 
finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so 
he listed among his accomplishments establishing a good 
rapport with his soviet counterparts protecting usflagged 
kuwaiti tankers in the persian gulf and convincing congress it was 
time to close unneeded bases 
he said in addition to the pentagon purchasing problems tower 
will have to help develop armscontrol strategy and strengthen the 
north atlantic treaty organization while convincing european allies 
to resist the seductive appeal of soviet armscontrol proposals 
carlucci who replaced caspar w weinberger as defense secretary 
for the last 14 months of the reagan administration said he had 
enjoyed the position but found it truly was a fulltime job 
on a perhour basis i make about as much as my babysitter 
he joked adding the secretarys salary of 99500 is lousy

the united states decision to open talks 
with the palestine liberation organization is merely a first step 
into a baffling maze toward middle east peace 
myriad thorny obstacles lie ahead and centuries of enmity must be 
surmounted the competing claims of arabs and jews to the same lands 
are rooted in thousands of years of history 
many israelis and palestinians harbor the often justified fear 
that their foes would like them to forcibly disappear it is a fear 
that makes every compromise a national trauma seemingly a step 
toward national doom 
every israeli recalls the vow of former plo chairman ahmad 
shukairy to drive israel into the sea 
every palestinian recalls the contention of israels late prime 
minister golda meir that the palestinian people do not exist 
both sides cherish the memories of thousands of heroes who died 
in the name of nationalism 
plo chairman yasser arafat has now met us criteria for 
negotiation and washington has begun talking with plo 
representatives 
but israels leaders despite nearly universal acknowledgement 
that the plo represents the palestinians still refuse to deal with 
what they call a terrorist organization 
before any kind of peace talks can start israels objections 
must be overcome or a way found to sugarcoat the plos bitter 
presence 
the reagan adminstration has favored submerging the plo in a 
jordanian delegation to talks it has also toyed with the idea of 
having the plo represented in talks by outside negotiators the plo 
rejects both plans 
israeli leaders have suggested staging limited elections to 
choose palestinian negotiators from in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip but the last elections there produced a clutch of plo 
supporters most of whom were deposed or deported by israel 
due in part to their yearlong uprising in the occupied lands 
the palestinians have won wide international acceptance of their 
call for a unsponsored peace conference 
but the ground rules remain a major point of contention even 
beyond the invitation list 
israel and the united states reject the arab idea that a 
conference could force a solution if the parties themselves reach a 
deadlock 
the palestinians also say a conference should be based on israeli 
withdrawal from the west bank gaza strip and golan heights which 
it seized in the 1967 arabisraeli war as well as creation of a 
palestinian state 
but even foreign minister shimon peres a moderate israeli leader 
who favors some form of international conference refuses to 
consider a total withdrawal from the occupied lands 
and no israeli leader would even consider the key arab demand 
that jerusalem be capital of the palestinian state the israelis 
annexed the citys eastern arab sector after seizing it in 1967 
and what of a palestinian state 
the palestinians accept at least a period in which it would be 
demilitarized a nod to israels security fears and they call for 
confederation with moderate jordan an attempt to assuage israeli 
worries about a radical independent actor on their flanks 
israelis and americans however have tended to speak of such an 
entity as a province of jordan or a substate whose police are 
overseen by israel itself 
such an entity would be located in the west bank and gaza strip 
but roughly 70000 jewish settlers now live there and half the 
land has been confiscated or bought by israel 
much of the areas water a commodity as precious as gold in the 
region is already used by israel which would be hardpressed to 
forfeit it the palestinians would find it difficult to thrive 
without it 
more than 3 million palestinians live in diaspora and most claim 
legal rights to homes and lands in what is now israel or 
israelicontrolled lands 
the right of return they claim would cause shattering trauma in 
israel while many might remain in the countries that have sheltered 
them for 40 years compensation would cost billions of dollars 
and many would not accept 
while the plo itself has agreed to live in peace with israel a 
handful of splinter groups regard acceptance of israel as tantamount 
to treason some israelis who believe all of palestine was promised 
to them by god would also object 
any peace settlement would almost certainly unleash terrorism by 
people desperate to sabotage it 
some leftist israelis and some palestinians see the answer in a 
confederation between the two feuding peoples themselves 
and many palestinians still cling to the hope that israel one 
day will peacefully decide to merge with a palestinian state 
i cant even visit the family tombs in the yard of my house 
in haifa said khalid alhassan a senior plo official who said he 
still hopes for such a peaceful road to a democratic secular 
state 
we cant have a democracy via violence he said 
for many israelis however even a peaceful end to their state 
would be unthinkable

energy secretary john herrington is leaving 
office firm in his conviction that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries is doomed 
in the long run the opec cartel cannot survive herrington 
said in a recent interview marking the end of his nearly fouryear 
tenure cartels do not work they have never worked in history 
several of opecs larger members have new incentives to produce 
oil rather than comply with last months decision by the cartel to 
limit production to 185 million barrels a day 
herrington cited the following examples 
venezuela has a major stake in the citgo chain of service 
stations and despite previous support of opec the south american 
nations future is here not with opec 
saudi arabia is buying service stations and a refinery from 
texaco and thats a major change 
weve got two countries who have been at war for eight years 
iran and iraq with 40 to 50 billion dollars in war debt and a 
reconstruction budget that is going to be horrendous with one thing 
to sell oil 
herrington contends that ownership of us distribution 
facilities by overseas producers should be welcomed because of the 
incentives it gives producers to bring oil to market 
its good for the united states and its good for saudi arabia 
no 1 its a guaranteed market for saudi arabia and no 2 its a 
guaranteed supply for us herrington said 
those who fear a resumption of the oil shocks of the 1970s dont 
realize we live in a fundamentally different world he said 
in the first half of 1986 the oil industry was devastated by the 
collapse of crude oil from above 27 a barrel to less than 12 
measured by average refiner cost half the 1980 exploration rigs 
active in 1985 were idled and 120000 out of 585000 exploration and 
production jobs vanished 
crude oil now sells for about 15 a barrel imports have risen 
from less than 30 percent of us consumption in 1985 to more than 
40 percent now at the same time us production has fallen by a 
million barrels of crude a day to a little more than 8 million 
barrels 
while us producers of crude oil have pleaded for trade 
protection herrington and president reagan maintained that quotas 
or tariffs would harm the us economy more than they would help the 
oil industry 
a tariff might be politically impossible anyway because of the 
demands for exemptions by northeast consumers mexico and the 
petrochemical industry plus the mandatory exemption for canada under 
the freetrade agreement herrington said 
herrington said cooperation with opec is not the solution 
although he said he understood why texas alaska and louisiana sent 
observers to the opec meeting 
this is not an industry we can allow to go by the boards 
herrington said he said he did not know just how big an industry 
the nation should try to preserve but i think it should be a 
lean mean efficient industrial part of our economy which i think 
it is today 
on other issues herrington said the us economy has to become 
more energyefficient 
the nation has made big gains in efficiency the economy in 1987 
was 40 percent larger than it was in 1973 but it used only 2 
percent more energy 
however the gains are slowing down west germany and japan use 
energy with twice the efficiency of the united states 
thats got to change now is that the federal governments 
job herrington said my position is a lot of these problems 
are tax policy questions that will yield to tried and true tax 
incentives 
advocacy groups have blasted herrington and his predecessors 
under reagan for sharply curtailing spending on conservation 
efficiency and renewable sources of energy herrington dismisses the 
criticisms 
are we spending enough money i think we are its true were 
not building the giant wind machines for 10 million any more like 
mod 2 and mod 3 that were reselling years later for 13000 
as for an environmentalist favorite higher taxes on gasoline to 
discourage consumption herrington admitted that a big increase 
would do the job but said i stand foursquare with the president 
against more taxes

salmon production is soaring at fish farms 
worldwide spurred in part by greater demand and buying power in 
japan an agriculture department report says 
worldwide salmon production is estimated up 75 percent from 
last year to over 300 million pounds the report said norway 
the top producer likely raised about 160 million pounds in 1988 
almost double 1987s output 
in the united states salmon farming or aquaculture is 
concentrated in washington oregon california and most recently 
maine last years production was around 85 million pounds but the 
us salmon figures for 1988 are not available yet 
large japanese demand and the strong value of the yen has boosted 
competition in world salmon markets the report said the heavy 
buying by japan has reduced the us supply of topquality salmon 
available to consumers forcing some restaurants to remove salmon 
from their menus 
a buying frenzy resulted from early reports of a small alaskan 
catch coupled with losses in the norwegian salmon crop because of a 
red tide infestation of a microorganism that reduces the oxygen 
level of the water so the fish suffocate the report said 
salmon farming makes up only a fraction of total us aquaculture 
production but some authorities believe the industry is poised for 
a major expansion perhaps doubling or tripling domestic output in a 
few years 
the report was prepared by economists mike dicks and david harvey 
of the departments economic research service who are the agencys 
chief aquaculture specialists 
harvey said in a telephone interview that the us salmon 
production figures are being studied and revised to get a more 
accurate picture of how much of the output goes into the commercial 
food supply 
also he said whether the current salmon boom continues will 
depend on many economic legal and consumer factors 
overall including food and nonfood fish shellfish and other 
aquatic products us aquacultural output rose by 20 percent in 
1987 to almost 750 million pounds worth 650 million 
the 1987 expansion was led by catfish crawfish and salmon with 
a combined production of more than 550 million pounds or about 73 
percent of the total catfish output was estimated at 370 million 
pounds crawfish 95 million pounds and salmon about 85 million 
pounds 
but the report said that expansion probably will slow to less 
than 10 percent a year in the next 10 years unless new technology 
and more resources become available 
a shortage of water supplies likely will impede expansion 
particularly in areas where production is already highly 
concentrated the report said where aquaculture is just 
beginning to develop limited management resources capital and 
industry infrastructure will constrain expansion 
with a slower growth and little increase expected in the 
commercial catch of wild fish americans probably will depend 
increasingly on imports which totaled 88 billion in 1987 
however the report added this could be modified by new technology 
growth of the commercial fishing fleet and shifts in consumer demand 
the report noted some of the new research and technology in the 
industry 
in maine research continues on lobster production and in 
canada scientists are working with the black cod a favorite in 
japan and the united states 
striped bass or rockfish were in short supply following a ban 
on their catch three years ago in the chesapeake bay the main 
production area the fish are now being produced in california and 
north carolina with production likely starting up next year in 
texas arizona mississippi and maryland 
oysters littleneck clams red fish and sturgeon are other 
species traditionally supplied from the wild catch that are now 
being farmed 
the development of genetically superior catfish and trout offers 
potential for expansion for example auburn university has crossed 
a commercial blue catfish with the channel catfish to produce a 
hybrid with a 40 percent greater growth rate and a high tolerance 
for lowoxygen water

nearly four years after mikhail gorbachev began 
his policy of greater openness westerners still search the soviet 
press for subtle hints about what is going on in the kremlin 
close reading of an article buried in the inside pages of sept 
16 editions of the main soviet military newspaper warned red army 
officers that civilians would be giving them more orders a strong 
hint that gorbachev soon would be announcing troop cuts 
two weeks later gorbachev consolidated his power in the kremlin 
and on dec 7 he announced a decision that had been opposed by the 
military a 10 percent reduction in the soviet armed forces 
including withdrawal of 50000 soldiers from eastern europe 
one kremlinwatcher is the former head of the us governments 
supersecret national security agency ret lt gen william odom 
he sees a strong link between the kremlin shakeup in which 
gorbachev demoted his conservative rival yegor ligachev and 
announcement of the troop cuts 
at the same time that gorbachev announced the troop cuts kremlin 
spokesmen confirmed the resignation of a leading military opponent 
of unilateral soviet reductions marshal sergei f akhromeyev the 
chief of the soviet general staff 
both ligachev and akhromeyev made the mistake of publicly 
contradicting gorbachev and they paid the price 
in july ligachev had reasserted the class basis of international 
relations undercutting gorbachevs bid to mend fences with the 
west and in that same month akhromeyev told a pentagon news 
conference that the soviets would not cut their forces unless the 
west did likewise 
both statements have assumed greater importance in retrospect 
than they were accorded at the time in the west 
odom who published an article on soviet military doctrine in 
the winter edition of foreign affairs magazine said in a telephone 
interview it is not yet clear whether gorbachev will be able to 
change the deployment of red army troops sufficiently to reduce 
western anxiety about soviet offensive military capability 
i am waiting with bated breath to see whether gorbachev can 
make it stick odom said in a telephone interview the situation 
as i see it is that the lines are drawn on the military issue 
between the general staff and gorbachevs reformers 
gorbachev and his civilian allies realize that the enormous sums 
the kremlin spends on defense are helping to cripple the rest of the 
economy 
todays soviet forces are so large that one must ask why they 
have been created and deployed wrote odom they overshadow not 
only us forces but also exceed the combined forces within the 
western alliance structure 
indications that soviet civilian reformers were prevailing came 
in the sept 16 article in red star the defense ministry 
newspaper the article set off alarm bells for several reasons 
among them the identity of the author a kokoshin a thinktank 
scholar who for more than a year has been leading a rhetorical 
assault against the preeminence of military officers in formulating 
national security policy 
although the red army is answerable to the kremlins ruling 
politburo lowerlevel civilians previously had not been allowed a 
say in national security policies the soviet defense minister and 
his aides have traditionally been uniformed military officers in 
contrast to the united states where the top defense department 
officials are civilians and national security issues are publicly 
debated in congress and the press 
in essence kokoshin said civilian scholars would be telling red 
army officers which weapons they needed and how to use them a 
domain that has always been firmly in the hands of uniformed 
officers 
so while gorbachevs theatrical announcement of the troop cut 
was seen as a diplomatic coup the substance if not the timing came 
as no great surprise to those who read between the lines of soviet 
newspapers 
western analysts began to pay serious attention to the military 
doctrine of reasonable sufficiency which gorbachev used as a 
rationale for the troop cuts after a nonmilitary russianlanguage 
journal called world peace and international relations published an 
august 1987 article reassessing an important soviet battle in world 
war ii 
the battle of kursk in 1943 was the largest tank engagement in 
history and ranks with the more famous battle of stalingrad as a 
decisive defeat for the nazi invasion of the soviet union in world 
war ii 
the article concluded that a sound defense can defeat a 
blitzkrieg and by implication that the soviets had no need to 
maintain a massive tank army of the kind now stationed in eastern 
europe

the third world debt crisis will drain another 
43 billion this year from nations that can least afford it up from 
the 381 billion loss last year the world bank says 
this years total is swollen by 311 billion leaving heavily 
indebted nations such as argentina and nigeria the bank said in an 
assessment issued sunday 
the outflow from third world countries consists largely of debt 
repayments to commercial banks the united states other industrial 
countries and intergovernment lenders such as the world bank 
in the past money in the form of loans and investments tended to 
flow from the wealthy countries to development of the poor ones 
the bank which is owned by 151 countries with the united states 
holding the largest number of shares said the report indicated that 
development and quality of life in many third world nations may be 
taking a back seat to debt reduction 
although both incomes and consumption have fallen incomes in 
most highly indebted countries are lower today than a decade ago 
the adjustment burden has fallen mainly on investment the report 
said 
stanley fischer vice president and top economist at the world 
bank said two messages emerged from the report 
the first is that despite remarkably rapid growth in the 
industrialized world in 1988 growth in the debtor nations has not 
resumed the second message is that the debt strategy is entering a 
new phase in which debt reduction is playing an increasingly 
important role fischer said 
the report raised the banks estimate of third world debt to 
132 trillion at the end of this year the total is expected to 
drop to 13 trillion in 1989 
debt has been growing more slowly because of changes in currency 
values some agreements to reduce debt and the continued reluctance 
of commercial banks to make new loans 
average annual income in argentina dropped to 1630 last year 
from 1990 in 1980 according to the bank in african nations south 
of the sahara the average annual income fell from 570 in 1980 to 
440 last year 
the world bank urged governments of the creditor countries to 
encourage imports from the debtor nations debtor countries 
meanwhile should change their policies to encourage loans and 
investments the bank said

at 13 sharanne au sees childhood passing by in 
a blur as she scrambles to excel in school and join what researchers 
call a cheerless overpressured and sometimes suicidal generation 
of asian scholars 
i am ordered by adults to hurry to go faster and faster to 
rush into adulthood while i am still a child 
we must be successful nothing else counts honesty 
compassion understanding are given lipservice but all that counts 
is to be the best in material things there is schoolwork 
extracurricular work homework holiday homework and work to 
enrich my life they have taken away time the schoolgirl wrote 
in a letter to a local newspaper 
in this island republic of 26 million and throughout asia 
youths are seeking psychiatric help in increasing numbers because 
parents relentlessly pressure them to achieve academic credits they 
hope will lead to the good life 
competition for university enrollment is hotter than in the west 
in part because asia has fewer colleges and in part because of the 
emphasis placed on education here 
according to one survey from singapores advisory committee on 
youth the number of new cases at the child psychiatric clinic 
jumped from 677 in 1983 to 1071 last year 
seven and 10yearolds talked of suicide because they could not 
cope with their studies 
to most of them education was stress and pressure said 
teacher geraldine loh chairman of the committee which recommended 
reducing the emphasis on tests widening curriculum and hiring 
fulltime counselors at schools 
another study described the typical 19 to 24yearold in 
singapore as out of shape unappreciative of the arts uninvolved 
with community service and obsessed with high grades 
all of them equated a degree with a wellpaying job and better 
standard of living said civil servant goh song how whose 
committee conducted the survey 
educators blame the parents and parents blame the system which 
begins separating children by academic levels at the age of nine 
tutoring has become a multimilliondollar business and some find 
work prepping kindergarten children there are no dropouts in 
singapore the official label is premature school leaver 
one teacher said some parents also suffer from neurotic anxiety 
when children do not excel it is not just the children losing the 
rat race it is a reflection on their heredity he said 
when college admission examination results are announced student 
suicides peak in japan and several other countries failure is 
regarded as a stunning loss of face 
about 9700 singaporeans study overseas mostly in the united 
states britain canada australia and new zealand compared to 
15000 at the national university of singapore some opt to go 
abroad to gain foreign credentials but most of those who can afford 
it have little choice after failing to gain admission to nus 
the international association for the evaluation of educational 
achievement said in an analysis issued in new york this year that 
students from japan hong kong south korea or singapore scored best 
in four out of five science tests it conducted in 17 countries in 
north america asia and europe 
this appears to be partly the result of streaming the 
phasing out of the less academically bright students in some 
countries have to choose between science and art when they reach 14 
those who pick science then concentrate almost exclusively on math 
physics chemistry biology and computers 
in singapore streaming starts at the end of third grade when 
students are about nine years old and further streaming takes place 
at the end of primary school 
education experts also ascribe the test results in part to 
parental pressure based on stronger motivation linked to the the 
emphasis their cultures traditionally placed on learning and the 
material and social rewards promised by a college degree 
families in china are pushing their children to learn too much 
too fast in their attempt to get their kids on the fast track an 
official newspaper said recently 
parents have stopped teaching their children values such as 
morality and the joys of labor because they are spending too much 
time cramming their heads with facts the paper said

the case of two fairskinned firefighters who were 
hired under a minority preference plan after saying they were black 
has spawned citywide investigations of minority hiring and sparked 
debate 
the strange case of 33yearold twins philip and paul malone was 
not challenged until this summer though the malones have been with 
the department for 10 years they were suspended from the department 
without pay in august for allegedly misrepresenting their race as a 
minority they are awaiting an appeal of their case in the state 
supreme judicial court 
as a result the racial backgrounds of 36 other firefighters have 
been investigated according to department officials eleven 
firefighters most who identified themselves as hispanic now face 
hearings but are still working 
the police department was investigated as well but no evidence 
of suspected minority misrepresentation was found a review of the 
city school department is ongoing 
the malones who live in suburban milton have refused to discuss 
their case publicly on the advice of their attorneys theporters 
it all comes down to who says who is black and how black do you 
have to be said marsha malone philip malones wife recently 
were trying to be optimistic because they the brothers want 
their jobs back 
the twins first applied to the fire department in 1975 
identifying themselves as white but their scores on the state civil 
service exam were too low on the grading curve for acceptance into 
the department 
they took the test again two years later and this time identified 
themselves as black they later explained that their mother told 
them in 1976 that their maternal greatgrandmother was black at the 
time documentation was not required to back up their claim 
by 1978 when the twins got their jobs there was a minority 
preference plan for hiring in effect and their scores apparently 
were sufficient for them to be hired as minorities 
the controversy over their claims to be black arose earlier this 
year when the twins took the lieutenants exam and scored well said 
fire department spokesman matthew corbett 
when state civil service officials returned the list of scores 
the brothers were identified as black 
corbett and fire commissioner leo stapleton who both worked with 
the malones in a station house have said they never knew the 
malones had been hired as minorities until they saw the indications 
on the lieutenants exams 
they look like 62 white guys irish guys maybe a little 
german because they have blond hair said corbett 
boston instituted a minority preference hiring plan after a 
federal judge ordered the fire department in 1974 to bring minority 
representation up to levels comparable to the citys population 
at that time just 19 of more than 2100 city firefighters were 
black or hispanic today the department is 21 percent black and 
hispanic compared to 29 percent for the citys population 
its a very serious situation said city councilman bruce c 
bolling who is black and who represents a predominantly black 
section of the city bolling had asked mayor raymond flynn to 
conduct a full investigation of minority hiring after the malone 
case was publicized 
the malone brothers characterized themselves as black and took 
two positions that should have gone to minorities he said 
corbett said the department changed its guidelines after the 
malone brothers were suspended with incoming firefighters now 
required to furnish more documentation about their racial background 
the state criteria for determining who should be designated as 
black for minority hiring purposes involves a threepart test 
visual identification documentary evidence and evidence that the 
individuals consider themselves minority in the community boston 
uses the first two parts 
part of the problem is that its never really been defined just 
what a minority is said corbett we need to determine just what 
is a minority

candidate of the united national party headed by president junius 
r jayewardene who is barred by law from seeking a third sixyear 
term premadasa campaigned as the champion of the common man unlike

nearly 200 vessels carrying vietnamese 
soldiers sailed past cambodias capital of phnom penh on their way 
home today as part of a major troop withdrawal the official 
cambodian news agency reported 
the spk agency said about 10000 people including cambodian 
communist party officials and military officers lined the banks of 
the mekong river to bid farewell to soldiers of division 339 
red banners expressing gratitude to the soldiers were flying and 
many people waved miniature vietnamese and cambodian flags as the 
fleet passed the agency said an army band played songs praising 
cambodiavietnam friendship and hundreds of schoolchildren and other 
people shouted slogans hailing the soldiers service 
the fleet then sailed southward for the 70mile journey to the 
border of southern vietnam a large group of foreign journalists 
invited to watch the pullout followed in helicopters 
the agency said cambodians bade farewell to other departing 
vietnamese soldiers in ceremonies in ratanakiri province in the 
northeast in kampot province south of phnom penh and in kompong 
cham province east of the capital 
the report monitored in bangkok did not say how many troops were 
involved in the movements 
the largest guerrilla group the khmer rouge called the 
movements mere troop rotations and said vietnam had sent in fresh 
units by land and sea 
the departing soldiers are among the 50000 troops that vietnam 
says are being sent home this year in its seventh annual partial 
withdrawal from cambodia vietnam claims to have pulled out 32000 
troops already this year and 18000 more are to leave by land and 
water in a weeklong transfer ending wednesday 
some western diplomats in bangkok say they believe only 15000 to 
20000 soldiers have left this year 
the soldiers have been fighting a largely stalemated war against 
cambodian guerrillas since massive vietnamese divisions invaded 
cambodia on christmas day 1978 and installed the provietnamese 
government of president heng samrin 
vietnam says it will withdraw by 1990 the 50000 troops that it 
says will remain after this weeks pullout leaving the fighting to 
heng samrins forces 
cambodias prime minister hun sen said friday that all vietnamese 
military and civilian advisers have already left his country 
this will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefield 
due to our cambodian troops who are in control of all areas from

that an aircraft was making lowlevel flights over the 15th and 16th 
districts of paris on the south and west side a series of similar 
calls were received by several police and security agencies

israeli foreign minister shimon peres indicated 
israel would not exclude palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat from future peace talks provided plo declarations 
renouncing terrorism prove true 
peres did not name arafat in a television interview sunday but 
said israel was prepared to talk with every palestinian no matter 
what his biography was if he is not shooting and killing 
he said israel will wait a month a couple of months to see 
if terrorism including uprisings in the occupied territories ends 
israeli officials have denounced the united states decision last 
week to hold a substantive dialogue with the plo strongly 
condemning a move that grants diplomatic credibility to a man 
israelis accuse of masterminding a campaign of terror against the 
jewish state 
terrorism played a large role in the first talks us and plo 
officials held in tunis last week the session took place after 
arafat last week met american conditions that included recognition 
of israels right to exist and renunciation of terrorism 
peres in the interview on cbstvs face the nation appeared 
to step back from israels refusal to take part in talks that 
include arafat 
he linked such negotiations however to an end to violence in 
the occupied territories arafat in speaking against terrorism has 
not included the stonethrowing and other acts carried out by 
palestinians under israeli rule 
so far 332 palestinians have died in the yearold clashes with 
israeli soldiers including three who were killed today 
and despite the movement towards peace talks statements from 
other plo officials indicated violence was far from a thing of the 
past 
salah khalaf second in command arafat in fatah the largest plo 
group meanwhile told an abu dhabi news conference that arafats 
denunciation of terrorism last week did not include military 
attacks against israel 
our struggle will continue until we raise the palestinian flag 
over jerusalem he said 
peres said in the television interview i shall say very 
clearly i am ready to sit with every palestinian who is not engaged 
in terror who is seeking peace and who wants to negotiate the 
peaceful solution with israel 
asked whether that included sitting down with arafat he said 
i am not ready to refer to a single person because i dont think 
thats the issue but i am saying in a very clear way with every 
palestinian no matter what his biography used to be 
peres added he has doubts about mr arafat but he said i 
am ready to sit with every palestinian no matter what his biography 
was 
if mr arafat says im going to stop violence and terror 
okay lets wait a month a couple of months and see if this is 
really going to happen peres said 
it was unclear from the comments whether that view would carry 
over into a new israeli government 
talks between peres labor alignment and prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs likud bloc over a new government have broken down leaving 
shamir aides talking about forming a new governing coalition with 
ultraorthodox jewish parties

<TEXT>
land sri lanka is an island of 25332 square miles about the 
size of west virginia off indias southern coast it was known as 
ceylon until 1972 and arab traders of long ago called it serendip 
or the land of pleasant surprises sri lanka means bountiful 
island in the sinhala language

75 percent sinhalese 18 percent tamil 7 percent moslem and a few 
descendants of european settlers the sinhalese who are 
predominantly buddhist and tamils most of whom are hindu came 
from india centuries ago across the narrow palk strait

history since ancient times the island was invaded by the 
armies of indian kings the portuguese colonized it in the 16th 
century the dutch ruled in the 17th century and the british were in 
control from about 1800 until independence in 1948 
battles between sinhalese and tamils are rooted in sri lankas 
history but the basis for the current civil war was laid by british 
encouragment of minority tamils in education and jobs under the 
divide and rule policy 
after independence the sinhalese tried to contain tamil 
influence a law passed in 1956 declared sinhala as the official 
language 
tamil riots began and resentment grew of sinhalese dominance in 
government the military and education the problem was excerbated 
by the religious difference the civil war began when tamil rebels 
killed 13 sri lankan soldiers in 1983 setting off riots in which 
more than 1000 tamil civilians were killed

a group of homosexual roman catholics and 
their supporters sang songs and prayed during a march to protest 
their eviction from the last parish church in a major us city in 
which they were allowed to meet 
holding hands singing traditional church hymns and carrying 
crosses and lighted candles about 500 people marched a mile from 
st boniface church after an exodus service to st marys 
cathedral on sunday night 
the church has been my father my family for much of my life 
particularly after my physical family rejected me for being gay 
said sobbing marcher jeff koerner 31 now im doubly an orphan 
leaders of dignity a 20yearold organization of homosexual 
catholics with 100 chapters and 5000 members nationwide portrayed 
their eviction as a gift from god it was brought about by their 
refusal to endorse church teaching that homosexuality is immoral 
jim lonergan of dignity told the congregation to stay would 
have meant for us to accept selfhatred and selfdoubt 
the local dignity branch had sponsored a mass at st boniface for 
15 years but archbishop john r quinn on dec 3 banned the group 
from all church property after sunday 
quinn said a special mass at st marys cathedral on sunday 
evenings would be offered as an alternative for the dignity branchs 
350 regular members 
catholic officials across the country have ousted dignity groups 
from parish churches in nearly 40 cities during the last two years 
because of the 1986 reaffirmation by the vatican that homosexuality 
is an intrinsic evil and is incompatible with catholic dogma 
at the final st boniface service the rev bob arpin who has 
aids said the ouster challenged the group to accept persecution as 
christ did 
to us god is giving the holy task for being in this world 
filled with hatred prejudice and death to teach the world to love 
again arpin said we whose love we are told is perverted 
to cheers and applause arpin told the crowd it was sending a 
clear message to the church in rome like us or not we are your 
sons and daughters your priests and nuns your faithful ones we 
are the church 
by sponsoring its own mass dignity was able to get priests to 
give talks reflecting its views not necessarily the churchs on 
homosexuality and other issues 
monsignor patrick j oshea a spokesman for quinn said san 
franciscos dignity was the groups last branch in a major american 
city that was still being allowed to use church facilities dignity 
services are being held in churches in a few small cities in united 
states but neither the church nor dignity would identify them

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and chinese 
leaders spent most of their time together today discussing their 
troubled border the main issue dividing the worlds most populous 
nations indian journalists said 
gandhi also discussed tibet and trade with his chinese hosts 
gandhi and chinas premier li peng met for two hours in the 
morning following gandhis arrival from new delhi they continued 
meetings after lunch said the journalists who attended a news 
briefing closed to nonindian reporters 
gandhis fiveday visit marks the first time an indian leader has 
come to china since 1954 when his grandfather jawalharlal nehru 
came to beijing 
the last time chinese and indian leaders met was in 1960 when 
premier chou enlai went to new delhi two years later india and 
china fought a war over the border and china occupied a large chunk 
of indian territory 
gandhi flew into beijing accompanied by about 100 top officials 
and the two nations were expected to sign agreements on civil 
aviation border trade and science and technology 
consular offices in shanghai and bombay may also be established 
little progress was expected on the 2400mile border 
chinas xinhua news agency and indian journalists said gandhi and 
li agreed that the two nations had to find a way of settling the 
border question peacefully 
we should work now toward resolution of the border issue while 
we work at the same time to expand and strengthen our bilateral 
relations the journalists quoted gandhi as saying 
li said the border problem was hindering the two countries 
relations xinhua reported 
xinhua also said li expressed admiration for indias position 
on tibet a chinese province bordering india 
india has reiterated that tibet is part of china and forbids 
tibetan refugees in india from engaging in political activities in 
1959 the dalai lama tibets leader and thousands of tibetan 
refugees fled to india after an abortive antichinese uprising 
on dec 10 at least one monk was killed in the tibetan capital 
of lhasa during a clash between chinese troops and tibetans who seek 
an end to 38 years of chinese rule it was the third bloody clash in 
lhasa in 14 months 
earlier monday at the great hall of the people in downtown 
beijing gandhi was given a 19gun salute and met by premier li 
indian and chinese flags lined tiananmen square colored flags 
lined the citys main boulevard changanjie 
india was one of the first nonsocialist countries to recognize 
communist china soon after beijings 1949 revolution in the early 
1960s relations deteriorated over the border question and personal 
and political disagreements between chinese leader mao tsetung and 
prime minister nehru 
china now claims 36000 square miles of indian land india 
rejects the claim and demands that china return the 15200 square 
miles it took in the war 
in the late 1970s relations improved slightly when china began 
emphasizing traditional statetostate relations instead of 
exporting socialist revolution 
direct trade resumed in 1977 but it amounted to just 150 million 
in 198687 with few prospects for growth 
the two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little 
progress in eight rounds 
interviews with chinese scholars over the weekend found them 
pessimistic about the possibility for good sinoindian ties for 
one they said the economies of the two countries are too similar 
to allow for much trade 
they export textiles and we export textiles they want high 
technology and we want high technology said zhang minqiu deputy 
director of the institute of south and southeast asian studies at 
beijing university were competitors so we lack cooperative 
spirit 
in addition chinese researchers said the border question appears 
intractable 
in some of the areas that we claim the indian government has 
made big investments and has registered good economic growth said 
ms zhang its very hard to see them giving it up

a teacher who disarmed a student 
accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought 
it was a prank when he first saw the teenager wielding a 
semiautomatic handgun 
i thought it might be one of those uzitype water pistols m 
hutchins matteson said then the glass was shot out and i knew it 
was a reality 
nicholas elliott 16 allegedly shot the window out of a locked 
classroom door at atlantic shores christian school in an effort to 
reach a student he wanted to kill 
my original thought was oh my god im going to be shot 
matteson said about the friday incident then i remembered i had 
38 students in there 
so matteson stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many 
students as possible while pleading with the teenager not to shoot 
i cried out to him no no dont do it this is no way 
please dont do this matteson said 
police say elliott fired two shots including one that narrowly 
missed matteson before his cabray m11 pistol jammed matteson 
tackled elliott and held him down while student mark mcnulty grabbed 
the gun a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon 
ive never been in a situation where i had to fight for my 
life said matteson 24 i thank god for giving me the presence 
of mind and the physical ability to get the job done 
police say that by the time elliott reached mattesons bible 
class he already had killed karen h farley 40 and wounded samuel 
m marino 37 marino was in stable condition at sentara norfolk 
general hospital 
investigators said elliott had gone to ms farleys and marinos 
classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him 
i think its a classic case of the school bully vs a meek and 
mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped 
a virginia beach detective told the virginianpilot and the 
ledgerstar 
the newspaper reported sunday that authorities were saying 
privately that racial insults may have ignited the boys anger 
elliott is one of four blacks in the student body of 510 
principal fred fuller said he was unaware of any racial friction 
but he could not rule it out lets face it were dealing with 
kids and sometimes they go at it fuller said 
police were at a loss to explain why the student shot ms farley 
who was alone in her portable classroom 
authorities said that moments after that shooting the youth went 
to marinos classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol 
marino told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to 
school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder 
elliott is being held on charges of firstdegree murder 
attempted murder malicious assault use of a firearm in a felony 
and firing into an occupied building 
relatives and friends have described elliott as a quiet loner 
with an affinity for guns he spent most of his time playing with 
his pet pigeon watching television and reading gun magazines

more than 100 activists from farmers to 
artists have joined forces to create a united voice for the 
mainstream opposition and say their first goal is legalization of 
solidarity 
lech walesa chairman of the free trade union movement convened 
the group sunday previously it had been an informal council that 
walesa had gathered five times since may 1987 to make broad policy 
statements on the behalf of the opposition 
the socalled citizens committee comprising 128 intellectuals 
solidarity supporters opposition activists farmers and artists is 
intended to bring together disparate elements in a united voice of 
opposition 
the participants have in common a willingness to negotiate with 
the government groups such as the confederation for an independent 
poland which urge independence and the removal of the communist 
system were not included 
governmentcontrolled radio and television reported the formation 
of the citizens committee signaling at least tacit acceptance of 
the organization 
in its first statement the group said solidaritys reinstatement 
is of crucial importance without such a decision a sufficient 
and credible structure for reform will not be created 
the committee will meet four times a year and establish 15 
commissions to examine specific social needs and suggest solutions 
leaders said after a daylong conference in warsaw incorporated into 
the structure are commissions of opposition experts who have been 
preparing at walesas request to take part in talks with the 
government 
still there are no new signs when those talks might take place 
said andrzej wielowieyski an adviser to walesa who spoke for the 
committee 
communist authorities promised negotiations with the opposition 
as a condition for walesas help in ending a wave of strikes in 
august but they have repeatedly delayed the talks 
wielowieyski said members of the group see the talks as only one 
means for beginning dialogue with the government he said the 
dialogue could take other forms through the commissions 
the commissions were organized for various topics among them 
political and economic reform education housing national 
minorities culture youth and ecology 
walesa has confirmed continuing lowlevel contacts between the 
opposition and authorities in recent weeks but would say nothing 
about the content of the discussions 
on the surface relations between walesa and the authorities have 
never been so cordial since solidarity was crushed in a 1981 
military crackdown and outlawed the following year 
in the past month walesa has been allowed to speak his mind 
without censorship in a national television debate was permitted 
his first foreign trip since solidaritys heyday and has seen his 
public statements and activities broadcast and even praised in the 
official media nearly every day 
on thursday walesa said recent remarks by government spokesman 
jerzy urban have come very close to solidaritys demand for a 
statement of intent to reinstate the organizaton 
solidarity has asked for such a declaration as a condition for 
starting formal talks with authorities on tackling polands daunting 
social and economic problems

a cracked pipe at one of the savannah river 
plants nuclear reactors will be replaced before the reactor is 
allowed to restart us energy department officials said 
len sjostrom the department of energys acting assistant manager 
for reactor operations said replacing the pipe would not delay the 
restart scheduled for this summer because we have the time to do 
it and especially because its a smaller pipe 
all three srp reactors have been shut down since summer for 
safety improvements and maintenance they are the nations only 
source of tritium a radioactive gas used to boost the power of 
nuclear weapons 
because tritium decays 55 percent annually some federal 
officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear 
weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon 
sjostrom said the crack in the 4inch pipe occurred in an area 
where two pipes join the augusta ga chronicle reported in 
sundays editions 
the pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods which are 
raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the fission 
process 
sjostrom said the crack was detected friday by ultrasonic tests 
during a routine check of the reactors piping 
in washington richard w starostecki the energy departments 
deputy assistant secretary for safety health and quality assurance 
said he was sending a team of experts to the weapons plant next week 
to assess the situation the new york times reported in sundays

the rev jesse jackson said today that soviet 
officials have agreed to his proposal for an international telethon 
to raise money for earthquake victims in soviet armenia including 
funds to rebuild churches 
it is significant that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has 
dispatched a minister of culture jackson said on cbs this 
morning 
and that is a significant breakthrough that they would allow 
us to rebuild churches the center of hope for armenia jackson 
added 
jackson also called for federal laws to help the homeless in the 
united states 
in a joint news conference sunday with soviet ambassador 
alexander belonogov jackson said the telethon would be broadcast on 
television in north america the soviet union and europe with 
tollfree telephone numbers provided in each country to accept 
donations it is tentatively planned for february

later in the day jackson attended a midtown manhattan rally

we must make denial of the right to a house a federal crime

to washington by the tens of thousands and put housing legislation 
on the books in the 1989 congress 
organizers bused in 2000 homeless people from shelters and 
welfare hotels around the city to join the protesters who marched in

action week the coalition that organized the rally and six days of 
events that preceded it

nearly 8000 people were evacuated from cities and 
towns shattered by armenias earthquake as authorities began trying 
to clear the area of all but workers involved in the cleanup effort 
pravda reported today 
another 4500 mothers and children were expected to leave today 
for anapa a soviet childrens resort in the crimea the official 
communist party newspaper said within two to three days only men 
involved in the reconstruction should remain it said 
mother teresa the 1979 nobel peace laureate today offered the 
soviets the assistance of her religious order the missionaries of 
charity which operates orphanages hospitals food centers and 
schools in more than 25 countries 
the roman catholic nun met in the armenian capital of yerevan 
with prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who warmly thanked her for 
the kind feelings compassion and the offered aid tass said 
tass did not say whether the soviets agreed to accept help from 
her order in the past churches and religious groups have been 
barred from engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals 
schools and other social services 
the soviets say they have received 100 million in earthquake aid 
from a total of 77 countries 
tass said the soviet union reached agreement with american 
telephone amp telegraph co to allow armenians to call collect to the 
united states where many have friends and relatives 
soviets usually cannot place collect calls 
the official news agency said saturday that since the quake 
telephone traffic between armenia and the united states has 
increased eightfold 
armenians whose senses have been dulled by grief still hope 
to find survivors under collapsed homes and apartment buildings 
staterun radio moscow said sunday 11 days after the earthquake 
that killed an estimated 55000 people 
we must hurry these words are now in the souls and on the 
lips of thousands of people who are helping liquidate the 
consequences of the tragedy the official tass news agency said in 
a report on sundays meeting of a special politburo commission 
overseeing the relief effort 
there were no reports of survivors being found sunday or today 
pravda said 15252 people were dug out alive from the rubble in 
the first 10 days after the dec 7 quake 
more than 23000 bodies have been recovered but that is less 
than half the total believed buried in piles of stone and concrete 
dust that were once the cities of spitak leninakan kirovakan and 
up to 100 villages 
the smell is becoming more and more pronounced every day in 
spitak where 15000 of the citys 25000 are believed dead said 
boris yurchenko a photographer for the associated press 
the first sign of the terrible threat of an epidemic dead 
dogs and swarming rats are forcing rescue teams to hurry since no 
leveling of the town can be done with corpses still remaining in 
their stone graves he said 
the city was nearly deserted with a few people searching for 
relatives remaining behind and taking shelter in garages yurchenko 
said 
snow and temperatures below freezing hampered relief efforts and 
posed additional hardships for thousands of people left homeless 
the first most acute phase of the rescue effort is coming to 
an end radio moscow said preparations have started for 
restoring the industries and housing 
there has been no official announcement of an end to the search 
for survivors a potentially explosive issue in armenia where some 
people have sat in front of bulldozers to prohibit clearing of 
rubble until it can be searched for victims 
hopes for saving them are slim the politburo commission 
concluded sunday but no matter how hard it is no one has the 
right to start fully clearing the grounds of factories and plants 
until that operation is complete 
armenian activists embittered by moscows refusal to grant their 
demands in a territorial dispute with neighboring azerbaijan have 
accused the central government of not doing enough to warn armenians 
of the danger of an impending earthquake and of bungling relief 
efforts 
soviet media continued to report on an official crackdown against 
armenian militants including members of the karabakh committee six 
of whose leaders have been arrested 
the committee has spearheaded the 11monthold campaign for 
annexation of nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave in 
azerbaijan 
radio moscow said members of the committee had mounted 
continuous onslaughts on authorities since the earthquake and 
handed out leaflets calling for strikes and demonstrations

president roh taewoo said today he 
believes south korea which has been staunchly anticommunist for 
four decades will establish formal diplomatic relations with most 
east bloc nations by the early 1990s 
we already have a permanent mission in hungary and i think 
during my tenure of office our relations with most other communist 
nations would develop into such a level roh told the south korean 
news agency yonhap 
roh whose term expires in february 1993 said south koreas 
trade and other nondiplomatic links with the soviet union china 
and other communist nations would continue to grow 
hungary in september became the first communist nation to open 
diplomatic relations with south korea and the two countries 
exchanged permanent missions this year 
hungarys chief of mission in seoul sandor etre told reporters 
this weekend that he is optimistic that diplomatic relations between 
the two nations will be upgraded to an ambassadorial level soon 
he said hungary an ally of communist north korea felt it could 
not ignore the splendid economic growth of more than 40 million 
south koreans 
south korea signed a contract last week to extend a 65 million 
commercial loan to hungary another contract will be signed later to 
provide hungary with 60 million in loans from a consortium of eight 
south korean banks government officials said 
south koreas links with other communist countries also have 
grown considerably in recent years the soviet union and several 
other east bloc coutries have either opened or agreed to open trade 
missions in south korea 
more than 1000 businessmen from south korea visited communist 
nations in the first half of this year yonhap said 
the governments economic planning board is seeking to change 
trade and investment regulations it views as obstructing effective 
economic cooperation with communist nations yonhap said quoting 
unidentified government sources yonhap said the government also 
will amend traderelated regulations including import procedures 
participation in international biddings and exhibitions 
the government now allows only one south korean business at a 
time to participate in biddings offered by communist nations a 
competitive bidding system among south korean firms will be 
considered the agency said 
the south korean diplomatic links with the east bloc represent a 
major setback for north korea the two koreas have been bitter 
rivals since 1945 when us and soviet troops ended the japanese 
occupation of the korean peninsula the two sides fought the bloody 
korean war in 195053 
the president said he would continue to seek summit talks with 
his north korean counterpart kim il sung the summit if held 
would be the first since the division of the peninsula

home due to threats of violence officials said 
hundreds of people have been killed in the weeks leading up to 
the elections in violence triggered by ethnic divisions and all 
three presidential candidates have vowed an end to the bloodshed 
at least 25 people were wounded today when the extremists who 
had threatened to kill anyone who cast ballots fired guns and 
hurled bombs at voting stations in the sinhalese heartland police 
and military officials said election officials said the threats and 
violence kept many sri lankans from the polls 
troops and police had been deployed throughout this indian ocean 
nation in an effort to assure calm balloting

minister ranasinghe premadasa 64 candidate of the governing united 
national party said after voting in colombo the bullet must not 
win

americans generosity is being tested this holiday season as they 
respond to both the tragic earthquake in soviet armenia and needs at 
home that appear greater than ever 
by at least one measure united ways projection for the year of 
6 percent to 7 percent growth donations nationwide appear to have 
increased 
charities in many communities say contributions of money 
clothing toys and food are at least keeping pace with last year and 
should pick up this week before christmas 
but in other cities contributions have dropped hampered by cold 
weather a shortage of bell ringers shopping malls that banish 
fundraisers from entrances weak local economies or even a drain 
on givers from campaign contributions earlier this year 
efforts to aid the victims of the earthquake in soviet armenia 
appear to be having an impact on domestic giving in some cities but 
not in others say spokesmen for the salvation army american red 
cross volunteers of america united way food banks and other 
charities 
in massachusetts with an armenian population estimated at more 
than 60000 most charity officials said it is too early to tell 
whether that has cut into local giving 
but at the american red cross the tragedy appears to have 
prompted an acrosstheboard increase in giving said philip 
schuyler manager of operations planning and development in boston 
the response has been the greatest ive ever seen in 18 
years he said theyre giving to both situations the homeless 
here the hungry in armenia 
among the nations biggest cities collections were reported up 
in new york chicago and atlanta but down in los angeles in the 
midwest indianapolis kansas city mo and st louis reported 
healthy donations while minneapolis detroit and iowas cities were 
having a more difficult time and in the west phoenix and tucson 
ariz showed drops while denver and salt lake city charities said 
their contributions were on target 
in dallas the dallas morning news charities reported its drive 
was ahead of last years pace but the salvation army said its cash 
donations are down part of the continuing impact of the oil bust 
money is tight in oillinked oklahoma city too maj ralph 
morrel of the salvation army said last week when collections were 
running about 50000 below what they were a year ago at the same 
time 
i understand from a lot of merchants that people arent 
spending as much money he said and when they spend money they 
give it away when the merchants have a good year we have a good 
year 
in detroit and newark nj the story is much the same giving 
is down by at least 60000 over last year for the salvation army in 
detroit and officials blame the election year a fluctuating stock 
market and a skepticism born of the television evangelist scandals 
in newark says thelma cloude director of the greater newark 
social services and correction bureau the problem is that many 
workers are falling further and further behind 
this year with the upsurgence of the working poor those who 
used to help us now need help themselves she said 
the society of st vincent depaul portland ore council took 
in 13000 pounds of canned food less than last years total of 
187000 pounds said executive director tim hornbecker i think 
people have not increased their earning power 
in minneapolis contributions to both catholic charities and the 
salvation army are flagging 
our suspicion is that theres a lot more competition for the 
charity dollar a lot of social service programs are going after 
money because of all the cutbacks for welfare said robert miller 
of catholic charities 
a manpower shortage has caused donations to drop in other areas 
iowas strong job market with unemployment at 35 percent has 
cut into volunteers 
you hate to think thats a bad sign for us in kettle season 
were struggling to find help said lt jesse collins of the 
salvation army in marshalltown where only half the usual 15 bell 
ringers could be mustered 
in new york the volunteers of america is pulling in more money 
from major donors and mail contributors but its sidewalk santa 
campaign is not doing as well as had been expected said john 
hartman the groups development director 
im not sure i know why we have a shortage of santas he 
said but it is a grueling job the santas are usually out on the 
sidewalk from 830 in the morning to 830 or 9 oclock at night in 
all kinds of weather 
the presidential campaign drain has been a problem said 
fundraisers in southern california where salvation army donations 
for the eightcounty region are running 15 percent behind their 1987 
rate 
the fact of the matter is that we usually suffer every four 
years when theres an election said russell prince the armys 
director of development in southern california we got hurt in 
84 but weve seen it this year more than ever theyve gotten more 
sophisticated in their direct mail fundraising techniques and its 
hurt us this year more than ever

a teacher who disarmed a student 
accused of killing one teacher and wounding another said he thought 
it was a prank when he first saw the teenager wielding a 
semiautomatic handgun 
i thought it might be one of those uzitype water pistols m 
hutchins matteson said then the glass was shot out and i knew it 
was a reality 
nicholas elliott 16 allegedly shot the window out of a locked 
classroom door at atlantic shores christian school in an effort to 
reach a student he wanted to kill 
my original thought was oh my god im going to be shot 
matteson said about the friday incident then i remembered i had 
38 students in there 
so matteson stretched his arms in an effort to shield as many 
students as possible while pleading with the teenager not to shoot 
i cried out to him no no dont do it this is no way 
please dont do this matteson said 
police say elliott fired two shots including one that narrowly 
missed matteson before his cobray m11 pistol jammed matteson 
tackled elliott and held him down while student mark mcnulty grabbed 
the gun a cheap imitation of a combat assault weapon 
ive never been in a situation where i had to fight for my 
life said matteson 24 i thank god for giving me the presence 
of mind and the physical ability to get the job done 
police say that by the time elliott reached mattesons bible 
class he already had killed karen h farley 40 and wounded samuel 
m marino 37 marino was in stable condition at sentara norfolk 
general hospital 
investigators said elliott had gone to ms farleys and marinos 
classrooms in search of a student who had been tormenting him 
i think its a classic case of the school bully vs a meek and 
mild kid and the boy finally got fed up with it and just snapped 
a virginia beach detective told the virginianpilot and the 
ledgerstar 
the newspaper reported sunday that authorities were saying 
privately that racial insults may have ignited the boys anger 
elliott is one of four blacks in the student body of 510 
principal fred fuller said he was unaware of any racial friction 
but he could not rule it out lets face it were dealing with 
kids and sometimes they go at it fuller said 
police were at a loss to explain why the student shot ms farley 
who was alone in her portable classroom 
authorities said that moments after that shooting the youth went 
to marinos classroom about 50 feet away and showed him the pistol 
marino told the boy it was against the rules to bring a gun to 
school and asked for the weapon before being shot in the shoulder 
elliott is being held on charges of firstdegree murder 
attempted murder malicious assault use of a firearm in a felony 
and firing into an occupied building 
relatives and friends have described elliott as a quiet loner 
with an affinity for guns he spent most of his time playing with 
his pet pigeon watching television and reading gun magazines

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his 
japanese counterpart sousuke uno met today to discuss a thorny 
border dispute that has disrupted their relations for the past four 
decades 
japan said it is prepared to step up economic cooperation with 
moscow a foreign ministry official said without elaborating 
shevardnadze also paid a courtesy call on the imperial palace 
where he signed a register with wishes for the recovery of emperor 
hirohito 87 who has been seriously ill for three months 
the soviet foreign minister and uno spent about 6 hours in talks 
that centered on the disputed sovietheld kiril islands which japan 
claims the issue has disrupted relations between the two nations 
for more than four decades 
the soviets have shown no basic change in their position 
said a japanese foreign ministry official who requested anonymity 
uno told his soviet counterpart that japan saw great potential 
to further economic relations the official said adding that 
shevardnadze agreed there were possible economic benefits 
observers say that moscow may be more willing than in the past to 
negotiate a compromise on the territorial issue because it needs 
japanese investment and economic cooperation to help develop the 
soviet far east 
the official quoted uno as saying one of the obstructions to 
developing bilateral trade was the soviet economic system including 
the inconvertibility of the soviet currency and shortage of skilled 
labor bilateral trade totaled 49 billion in 1987 and is expected 
to increase slightly this year to 498 billion 
the two ministers are to meet again on tuesday to discuss 
tensions on the korean peninsula and in cambodia and sinosoviet 
relations well as to continue discussions on the kiril islands 
foreign ministry officials said 
the kirils were occupied by soviet troops at the end of world war 
ii but japan claims it pioneered settlement of the islands from 
which the soviets ousted 17000 japanese residents 
in a 1956 japansoviet joint declaration moscow announced its 
willingness to return two of the islands after a peace treaty is 
signed but during his last visit to japan in january 1986 
shevardnadze refused to discuss the issue gorbachev told former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone in moscow in july that japans 
alliance with the west was blocking the return of the islands and 
said the dispute was delaying japansoviet rapprochement 
japansoviet political dialogue and mutual understanding is 
generally delayed while there are objective reasons for this 
it should be possible to relax or eliminate the reasons for this 
delay shevardnadze acknowledged after arriving at tokyos haneda 
international airport on sunday 
shevardnadze is to meet prime minister noboru takeshita tuesday 
officials said japan will renew an invitation for gorbachev to visit 
japan 
the two sides plan a joint communique on agreements for cultural 
exchanges and protection of migratory birds foreign ministry 
officials said the cultural pact includes a program for student 
exchanges for the first time they said 
shevardnadzes wife nanuli who is a journalist will attend 
various cultural activities including a tea ceremony during her 
stay she is to visit a pearl shop museum and library and meet 
hanae mori one of japans top fashion designers 
shevardnadze is to leave tokyo wednesday for the philippines and 
north korea

plo chief yasser arafat said today he 
wants un help in getting israel to join middle east peace efforts 
but he said palestinians will not stop their uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
his visit was seen as part of his campaign to drum up 
international backing for a mideast peace conference under un 
auspices 
arafat speaking to reporters at viennas schwechat airport 
sidestepped a question as to whether the palestine liberation 
organization would continue armed resistance against israeli 
authorities 
you mean resistance he said several times our people will 
definitely continue their intefadeh a reference to the 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
the austrian government expressed support for the plo but did not 
extend formal recognition to the recently proclaimed palestinian 
state 
after meetings with chancellor franz vranitzky and foreign 
minister alois mock arafat said he had named the head of the plo 
mission in vienna daud barakat as ambassador 
but vrantizky and mock made clear that barakat would not 
accredited they said austria does not recognize states without 
territory but pledged political and humanitarian support for the plo 
in separate letters to vranitzky and mock the jewish community 
and two other proisraeli organizations expressed displeasure over 
arafats reception in austria 
by receiving arafat austria puts itself in the service of plo 
propaganda said a joint letter from jewish leaders the 
austrianisraeli society and bnai brith 
arafats comments today came a day after salah khalaf the 
secondincommand in arafats fatah plo faction made clear the plo 
does not intend to abandon the use of force 
president reagan may stop his governments dialogue with the 
plo now if he thinks he will be able to stop our attacks against 
israeli military targets khalaf said sunday in abu dhabi united 
arab emirates 
it was an apparent reaction to the us statement friday that any 
plo terrorist acts would derail usplo talks in tunisia 
the plo serves as an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla 
factions which sometimes fight among themselves or launch 
independent attacks on israeli targets 
arafat said he came to austria for more support in the 
direction of peace for the process of peace in the middle east 
asked how he wants to bring the israelis in the process arafat 
said through the united nations and through the support of 
all people who are looking for real just peace in the middle east 
he said he had expected israel to reject his offer for direct 
talks with the plo made during a speech in geneva last week 
but sooner or later they will discover that peace is more 
important for them than anything else he added 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization and government 
officials have made clear they will not change their stance despite 
fridays first direct contacts between the united states and the plo 
in 13 years 
washington last week reversed its 13year ban on official 
contacts with the plo after arafat renounced terrorism and accepted 
israels right to exist 
us officials have indicated that a continuation of the talks 
will not continue until presidentelect george bush takes office 
jan 20 
arafat arrived from cairo where he conferred with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak on tuesday arafat was to visit yugoslavia 
the yugolav state news agency tanjug said 
on sunday a senior arafat adviser said bush has a better grasp 
of the arabisraeli conflict than any us leader since richard 
nixon and offers improved hopes for a peace settlement 
hassan a cofounder of the plos dominant fatah faction said in 
an interview in tunis that he expects bush or james baker the 
designated secretary of state to make a clear policy statement on 
the middle east peace process soon after the inauguration 
since nixon there has been no us policy for the middle 
east he said describing the ford carter and reagan 
adminstrations as having had to learn the palestinian question from 
scratch 
the us government needs a lot of work to prove its 
credibility hassan said i hope bush will do that

relatives of people who died in the august 
1987 crash of northwest airlines flight 255 decorated the crash site 
near metropolitan airport with holiday wreaths 
about 25 family members brought decorated wreaths sunday to the 
site along interstate 94 where 156 people died when the plane 
crashed on takeoff they prayed and joined hands to sing silent 
night holy night 
some relatives reacted angrily to northwests proposal last week 
that it would accept liability in the crash in cases where 
plaintiffs declined to seek punitive damages 
families who accept could receive money by early next year for 
compensatory damages the plan must be approved by northwest and 
lawyers for the victims 
if they tell us to accept now theres no way said frankie 
langton of carlton whose daughter hollins 26 was killed along 
with her fiance michael zanger 23 
betty polec of mount clemens who organized sundays service 
agreed her daughter and soninlaw lisa and donald klaft were 
killed in the crash 
it stinks polec said they dont want to admit liability 
and bring out all the things that were really wrong and thats 
wrong 
if you dont institute a lawsuit you are forgiving them 
patting them on the back when theyve completely turned our lives 
around i want them punished no deals for them absolutely not 
she said 
federal aviation administration investigators said pilot error 
was the chief cause of the crash which killed all aboard except a 
young girl a contributing factor was a failed warning system that 
should have alerted the pilots that the jets flaps were not set 
properly for takeoff

underprivileged youngsters from the inner city 
before i became adviser the person before me had kids bring 
gloves and mittens in for needy youngsters said betty carpenter 
of ridgely middle school i wanted to have more personal 
involvement our kids are mostly well off and just giving gloves 
and mittens just wasnt personal enough 
for the past 20 years the public school has held a christmas 
party this year 125 students volunteered as hosts and many more 
helped by donating money and old toys for gifts 
the 35 guests ranging in age from 4 to 11 were from st 
michaels catholic church in east baltimore each left with a large 
box of presents 
one of the hosts 11yearold damian salerno found giving during

an italian technician captured by 
ethiopian rebels last june has been released and may fly home today 
an italian embassy spokesman said 
the former hostage giuseppe micelli was turned over to the 
embassy sunday and was staying at the residence of the ambassador 
juan carlo farnilli the spokesman said 
a special plane has arrived from italy to take him there 
said the spokesman who refused to be identified by name 
a small littleknown marxistleninist group called the ethiopian 
peoples revolutionary army kidnapped micelli on june 27 in the 
gojjam district of northwestern ethiopia 
micelli had been working near lake tana on the italianfinanced 
tanabeles irrigation project designed to build a dike on the blue 
nile and construct roads in the area 
micellis capture like earlier abductions of several italians 
and ethiopians from the tanabeles work force apparently was 
intended to dramatize the rebels opposition to the marxist 
government of president mengistu haile mariam all previous hostages 
have been freed 
an italian embassy source said last week that the sudan 
government had played a major role in getting the rebels to agree to 
micellis release the technician was to have been freed in the 
first week of december the source said but this was delayed for 
unspecified technical reasons 
the same source also said that rebel conditions for micellis 
release were easily complied with they rebels only asked that 
the people in the tana area benefit more from the irrigation 
project 
the statement was taken as indicating the rebel request was 
relayed to the ethiopian government

parliament today vowed he would remain in office until the june

governing panhellenic socialist movement 
papandreou had said he considered sundays session a vote of 
confidence in his government and would resign if the budget was not 
approved 
the opposition led by the conservative new democracy and the 
communist party rejected the budget on grounds that this years 
deficit was 2 billion more than last years

and 10year resident of the morningside hotel the fire alarms are 
always going on and they turn it off 
fire chief luther taylor said sundays fire was apparently 
started by a discarded match in a thirdfloor apartment 
robert ziker the hotels owner identified the dead man as 
julius wood 49 a resident whose body was found in a fourthfloor 
apartment 
police identified the seriously injured man as philip scott 39 
he was being treated for burns at south bend memorial hospital he 
had been in critical condition but doctors upgraded him today to 
serious 
the hospital also admitted a resident for smoke inhalation and 
another for a broken ankle both were in stable condition st 
joseph medical center admitted a woman in serious condition from 
smoke inhalation three residents and two fire fighters were treated 
for minor injuries and released 
two residents who were unaccounted for sunday night contacted 
police early today they told police they were not at the hotel when 
the fire broke out 
the 105room fourstory hotel built in 1924 provided cheap 
housing for transients and some longterm residents many of whom 
depend on social security or other limited income authorities said 
ms telerado said she paid no heed to an alarm that rang for five 
minutes about 940 am sunday then went silent or initially to a 
maintenance man who pounded on hallway walls and yelled fire 
certainly there remains a possibility the information was not 
passed as quickly as it might have been said mayor joseph kernan 
he added that a fire alarm was ringing at midafternoon when he 
toured the third floor after firefighters controlled the blaze 
the blaze spread quickly through the lshaped brick building 
which also housed a music store and karate school the building was 
largely gutted and a wall collapsed taylor had no estimate of the 
damages 
once she realized the danger ms telerado said i didnt even 
have time to grab my boots and my boots were right there by the 
door 
many residents fled shoeless and in nightclothes and lost their 
few possessions said the rev steven newton director of a newly 
opened homeless center who took in 56 morningside residents 
they were in the last kind of housing you can get before the 
streets said newton were not talking about condominiums being 
burned out 
word of the fire brought an outpouring of food clothing gifts 
and money to the homeless center showing a check made out to the 
center for 1000 center volunteer david t link said somebody 
just walked in off the street with that

the army has taken disciplinary action against 
officers in northern israel for abuses during basic training such as 
denying water and medical treatment to recruits an army spokesman 
said today 
the hebrewlanguage daily maariv said the action followed 
complaints filed recently by parents of recruits to the prestigious 
golani brigade 
such charges often cause a scandal in israel where all men are 
required to serve three years in the army and all women serve two 
years most men also serve at least 42 days of reserve duty each 
year until age 55 
maariv detailed five of the complaints in a frontpage report 
recruits also were allowed only two or three hours sleep instead of 
the regulation six hours in at least two instances and were once 
denied water for an entire day the newspaper said 
the report said some soldiers were also denied visits to the 
doctor and were left limping from leg injuries others have required 
psychological treatment following the abuses the newspaper said 
maariv said a sergeant and a platoon commander were removed from 
their posts and a company commander was to be tried by an army 
tribunal the paper said unspecified action also was taken against a 
base commander 
the army spokesman would not give details of the actions taken 
against the four or of the alleged abuses 
as a result of the abuses most recruits dropped out of the unit 
where service is mostly on a voluntary basis and only 25 percent 
complete basic training maariv said 
an army spokesman said gen yossi peled the head of northern 
command personally investigated the matter and took disciplinary 
action against those involved 
the northern command looks very gravely upon such phenomena 
steps have been taken to ensure such phenomena dont recur the 
spokesman said 
maariv said peled had also appointed a team to further 
investigate the case

belonging to a gang that committed a series of robberies rapes and 
murders in south london and the neighboring surrey and kent 
countryside

the senate armed services committee will not 
play the old boy game with former sen john tower 
presidentelect bushs choice to head the defense department 
committee chairman sam nunn said today 
the committee will have a higher set of standards for the 
entire team from tower down through the pentagons top set of 
managers nunn dga told a group of reporters in a wideranging 
interview 
asked whether tower would receive kidglove treatment at his 
confirmation hearing next month before the panel he formerly 
chaired nunn said we are not going to play the oldboy game this 
goaround 
nunn said he and sen john warner of virginia the panels 
ranking republican would insist on seeing the full report on tower 
by the fbi which conducted an extensive background investigation 
following allegations of womanizing and drinking and reports about 
towers coziness with the defense industry 
defense analysts and congressional observers have predicted that 
tower chairman of the panel during the first half of the reagan 
administration would receive deferential treatment and breeze to 
confirmation 
but nunn said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of towers 
early tenure as chairman when former top pentagon official melvyn 
paisley was confirmed paisley now figures prominently in the 
governments defense procurement fraud case 
on other subjects nunn said 
the government should focus its attention on cleaning up 
nuclear messes at its aging nuclear weapons production facilities 
around the country and restoring safety to neglected reactors 
including those at the savannah river plant in south carolina 
southeast of augusta 
the united states will not run into a shortage of tritium for use 
in nuclear weapons for a year or two he said and that prospect 
poses no immediate threat to national security weve got to find 
the money to modernize and clean up he said adding that the 
energy department which runs the facilities should concentrate on 
getting one reactor restarted at savannah river rather than 
spreading its resources too thinly 
while the south african government has eased restrictions on 
some wellknown antiapartheid activists like nelson mandela it 
continues to imprison younger nonviolent protesters without 
apparent cause nunn returned friday from a twoweek trip to south 
africa kenya and zaire 
there is not the kind of communication necessary if south 
africas problems are going to be solved peacefully nunn said 
adding that congress will have to look closely in the coming year at 
possible new sanctions including american disinvestment 
it would be unrealistic to expect a new vote in congress 
any time soon on renewal of military aid to nicaraguas contra 
rebels the new bush administration should instead focus its first 
attention on working with neighboring countries in central america 
to make sure the leftist sandinista government lives up to promises 
made to its neighbors in a regional peace plan he said 
he will introduce early in the 101st congress legislation that 
would provide for a broad new program of voluntary national service 
for young americans beginning at age 18 the incoming senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine wants to make that one 
of the top priorities for the democratic majority nunn said 
adding he expects substantial republican support as well 
nunn said he hoped the idea which would include both military 
and civilian service and encompass expanded vista and peace corps 
programs could be enacted into law within two years

jack kemp the california football player 
turned new york congressman may bring strong new visibility to the 
department of housing and urban development and to the problems 
plaguing the nations cities 
kemp talked about progressive conservatism and sought to 
expand his partys appeal among blacks and other minorities as a 
candidate for the republican presidential nomination in 1988 
as a congressman he was an advocate of the supplyside economics 
and tax cuts that president reagan embraced he pushed for tax 
incentives to promote development in blighted urban neighborhoods 
and for a program enabling public housing tenants to buy their homes 
his presidential candidacy proved a flop he didnt win a 
primary and never scored better than 13 percent of the vote but 
kemp remained a leading figure among the republican partys most 
conservative wing at the end of the reagan era 
i know we didnt win but if you look at the republican 
platform today theres no one who can say were not winning in 
the republican party kemp told supporters in new orleans during 
the republican national convention 
kemp 53 was named today by presidentelect bush to join his 
cabinet as hud secretary 
he follows samuel pierce a black who survived in the job 
throughout all eight years of the reagan administration and who 
did so by keeping the lowest of profiles even his boss president 
reagan once failed to recognize his own cabinet member and mistook 
pierce for a mayor 
although kemps strongly conservative ideology is not shared by 
most of the mayors of the nations big cities his appointment 
immediately met bipartisan support 
urban advocates believe kemps forcefulness and vivid political 
profile will bring new attention to the miseries of inner cities 
drugs poverty violence and despair even if he does not become an 
advocate for the increased federal aid they seek 
while theres no question a lot of mayors were in the running 
we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues 
that hasnt been there before said tom cochran executive 
director of the us conference of mayors huds going to be on 
the front burner again 
the concern of urban advocates however is that kemps plans for 
urban enterprise zones based on tax incentives and for tenant 
ownership would supplement and not replace what remains of the 
federal urban aid programs that were cut or killed in the reagan 
years 
kemp dropped out of the presidential race in the aftermath of his 
final round of poor showings in the big super tuesday primaries in 
midmarch the last gasp of a candidacy that never met the 
expectations many republican leaders had set for it 
he has been a member of congress since winning election in 1970 
from the upstate new york district that includes buffalo a blue 
collarregion kemp decided not to seek reelection though he could 
have after dropping out of the presidential race 
he was born and educated in california growing up in los angeles 
and attending nearby occidental college where he played football 
and led the nations small colleges in passing statistics his 
father ran a small trucking firm and his mother was a social worker 
kemp got his start in pro football with the detroit lions of the 
national football league in 1957 but he bolted to the new american 
football league and the san diego chargers he was later traded to 
the buffalo bills where he built a reputation as a perfectionist 
who didnt mind playing hurt and led the team to two league 
championships and four division titles 
he was the leagues most valuable player in 1965 and that same 
year founded the afl players association 
he made his first mark in national politics by helping sell 
president reagan on supplyside economics the belief that cutting 
taxes would ultimately produce more tax revenues he had worked with 
reagan in california as a member of the govenors staff 
his call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was 
embraced by reagan and adopted in a modified form by congress at 
the same time it has been credited both with the longstanding 
economic recovery and the nations federal deficit that mushroomed 
in the reagan years 
kemp is the guy who persuaded reagan that supplyside economics 
was the way to move and one can argue these horrendous deficits are 
a direct result of kemps being wrong john deardourff a 
republican consultant once said 
kemp has always based his political appeal on economic growth 
and he was often criticized for a mindnumbing devotion to obscure 
economists language and laments for the abandoned gold standard 
he once described himself as less a candidate than a teacher 
he frequently surrounded himself at public appearances with black 
or hispanic republicans some of them former pro football colleagues 
while speaking conservative buzz words he would add his own 
concerns about inner cities minorities and civil rights 
weve got to have a party that is attractive to minority 
americans kemp said im going to predict that by 1992 
onequarter of our party if we do our job right will be black 
hispanic and asianamerican republicans

leaders of israels two main political blocs 
likud and labor agreed today to form a coalition government media 
reports said 
staterun israel radio and israel television both reported that 
the two parties reached agreement when likuds prime minister 
yitzhak shamir agreed to demands by the centerleft labor party that 
labor be given leadership of the powerful parliament finance 
committee 
avi pazner a top aide to shamir said agreement had been reached 
on major issues but that the prime minister was still trying to get 
smaller religious and nationalist parties to join a broad coalition 
we cannot drink lchaim yet he said referring to the 
traditional hebrew toast meaning to life 
israel army radio said the agreement seven weeks after 
parliamentary elections was reached in a meeting between 
negotiators dan meridor of the rightwing likud and moshe shahal of 
labor 
it said labor and likud also settled a dispute over how many 
jewish settlements would be built in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip agreeing on a figure of five to eight new settlements in the 
next year 
labor had been trying to hold down settlements because they could 
be an obstacle to the partys plan to trade land for peace with the 
palestinians likud had promised as many as 40 settlements to a 
nationalist party it was trying to lure into a coalition 
the army radio report said any settlements after the first year 
would have to be approved by the finance ministry which would be 
headed by labor leader shimon peres now the foreign minister 
peres agreed to the lesser post of finance minister in the new 
government on the condition his party could also chair the 
parliament finance committee giving labor virtual control over the 
countrys spending 
the tv report said that the agreement gave shamir the right to 
approve which labor member would head the committee 
roni milo deputy prime minister and an aide to shamir said 
meetings would be held tonight with religious parties 
earlier today both shamir and peres said a new government would 
be formed by tonight either with or without labor 
likud has been trying to form a broadbased coalition with labor 
to avoid having to make concessions on religious issues to the 
orthodox parties at the same time it has been negotiating with 
likely allies in a narrow government with the smaller parties 
within labor meanwhile a group of dovish members called on 
party leaders not to join a coalition government if that government 
rules out talks with the palestine liberation organization 
but most of the members of labors peace forum said at a 
meeting sunday that the plo would have to prove its verbal 
renunciation of terror with action before the organization becomes 
an acceptable partner for peace talks 
israeli law now bans contacts with the plo which the country 
views as a terrorist group last week the united states reversed a 
ban on contacts with the plo after the organizations chief yasser 
arafat made statements recognizing israel and renouncing terrorism 
this weekend a chief plo official said the plos renunciation of 
terror did not include atttacks on israeli military targets 
coalition negotiations have been under way since nov 1 elections 
gave neither likud nor labor a clear mandate likud won 40 seats in 
the 120member parliament and labor 39 with the rest split among 
small parties 
the latest impasse arose over likuds reported promise to the 
nationalistic tehiya party to build 40 new settlements in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip during the governments fouryear 
tenure 
labor said it would agreed to build five to seven jewish 
settlements labor minister chaim barlev told israel radio 
labor which has been pushing for an international conference on 
a middle east peace has resisted building more settlements in 
occupied land that might be given up in a peace agreement us 
officials have called the settlements an obstacle to peace 
negotiators for labor and likud have reportedly agreed shamir 
would lead the proposed government for its full tenure and would not 
rotate his position with peres as he did in the socalled unity 
government that both parties have led since 1984 
peres would serve as finance minister while rabin would retain 
the defense ministry likud member moshe arens a former defense 
minister would serve as foreign minister 
in the proposed joint government the two parties would have an 
equal number of ministers in the decisionmaking inner cabinet

bush names kemp as hud secretary to seek opportunity society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
presidentelect bush today named rep jack 
kemp once a combative campaign rival to head the department of 
housing and urban development in the new administration 
bush hailed kemp for his role in passing the income tax cuts of 
the reagan administration and said he was one of the premier 
architects of the opportunity society that we are trying to create 
kemp thanked bush for the appointment and said he would seek a 
publicprivate partnership to wage war on poverty he 
paraphrased the late civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
saying he has an audacious faith in the nations ability to 
restore hope to distressed inner cities and those who live in 
poverty and despair 
the new york congressman known for holding strong views and 
expressing them freely pledged to be a good team player and 
stick to his own portfolio im not going to speak on foreign 
policy during cabinet meetings he said 
aside from kemp transition sources said bush has decided on 
chicago masstransit official samuel skinner as transportation 
secretary and said that appointment may come as soon as tuesday the 
leading candidate for secretary of health and human services remains 
louis sullivan the morehouse medical school president who would 
become bushs first black cabinet appointment 
however kemps appointment was the only one announced by bush at 
a morning appearance before reporters 
remaining at the microphone to field questions on other topics 
the presidentelect said he would take an intolerant view of any 
acts of terrorism by the palestine liberation organization which 
has renounced such acts as the price for diplomatic discussions with 
the reagan administration 
we would not start off by showing any tolerance of plo terror 
and i dont care if it comes from a faction of the left or right or 
the center or whatever i am concerned about it i have been and 
will continue to be concerned about it bush said 
the presidentelect seemed at ease as he fielded questions even 
as he avoided giving answers to some when a reporter said he was 
dancing around the issue of how much to spend for homelessness bush 
replied yes i wouldnt have phrased it that way but thats 
exactly what ive been doing 
he added that he doesnt believe commitment to solving a problem 
is measured solely in terms of federal spending there are other 
ways to skin a cat he said 
bush shed little light on the appointments still to be made but 
said he wants an energy secretary knowledgeable about nuclear issues 
who can help increase the use of nuclear power 
kemps appointment was the eighth bush has made for his cabinet 
with six more to go the presidentelect has said he hopes to 
complete the task before the christmas holidays 
kemp was known as one of the most ardent adherents to the supply 
side theory of economics that president reagan pursued highlighted 
by the large income tax cuts of 1981 when the federal deficit 
ballooned kemp astounded fellow republicans by declaring the 
deficit didnt count 
bush said kemp was an idea man and said his innovative ideas 
were needed to solve problems in housing and other areas 
in their prepared remarks bush and kemp skipped over their 
onetime campaign rivalry kemp had sought the presidential 
nomination with an appeal to bedrock conservative issues and he had 
said often that bush would raise taxes despite bushs campaignlong 
pledge not to do so 
the presidentelect said it doesnt concern me at all that 
kemp might still have national political ambitions of his own he 
said kemp was a man of total honor and integrity 
asked if he had assurances that kemp would shed his critics 
role bush said i hope he hasnt shed it i want the 
objectivity of his judgment and knowing jack ill get it 
when asked about his own future political plans kemp said i 
havent ruled out seeking office some day nor have i ruled it in 
kemp said is is absolutely necessary and possible i believe 
to gain consensus on a publicprivate enterprise partnership to wage 
war on poverty kemp has called previously for programs allowing 
public housing tenants to own their own homes and has long been a 
champion of socalled urban enterprise zones in which 
governmentprivate programs would be developed to revitalize 
depressed cities 
kemp 53 a former professional football player served 18 years 
in congress from a buffalo ny district before seeking the 
republican presidential nomination earlier this year 
he faltered in the early contests and was gone from the race by 
spring but during his brief candidacy he did what he could to 
question bushs commitment to antitax policies kemp said 
frequently that if the voters wanted to raise taxes they should 
vote for either bush or another rival sen bob dole 
even so he hinted broadly in withdrawing from the presidential

friendly acquisitions of us companies by 
foreign investors are on the rise but hostile takeovers by 
foreigners are still rare a congressional report says 
the general accounting office the investigative and auditing 
agency of congress said foreign acquisitions as a share of all 
takeovers has increased from 6 percent in 1984 to 9 percent last 
year to 13 percent in the first half of this year 
however of the 1281 foreign takeovers during the 4year 
period only 17 were hostile or resisted by the target companys 
board of directors the gao said in a letter to rep byron l 
dorgan dnd 
dorgan a member of the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee who has proposed tax measures designed to curb hostile 
takeovers said in an interview monday that he is concerned by both 
the increase in hostile mergers generally and by increasing foreign 
investment in the united states 
the steady rise until last year of the us trade deficit has put 
more dollars in the hands of foreigners who have in turn spent them 
on investments in the united states 
much of the foreign investment has been in real estate and 
government securities but dorgan said the gaos figures indicate 
that foreigners also are buying up us corporations 
i think that raises some general policy questions that congress 
has to address if you have broad foreign ownership of american 
assets the question is who are americans working for where is the 
income stream from those assets directed dorgan said 
other economic observers among them federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan say foreign investment can be seen as a 
vote of confidence in the strength of the us economy they point 
out that foreign investment in american firms creates jobs for us 
citizens 
between 1984 and mid1988 there were 25 attempted hostile 
takeovers by foreigners and 17 of them were successful that 
compares with a total of 77 hostile takeovers out of 191 attempts 
dorgan said the relative success rates 68 percent for foreign 
hostile bids versus 40 percent for contested bids generally 
indicate that foreign tax laws or some difference in regulation may 
give foreign bidders an advantage over us bidders 
british firms accounted for eight of the 17 foreign unfriendly 
mergers three were by canadian companies two by french firms and 
one each by dutch japanese swedish and swiss investors

edward berlin a lawyer for rev randall gibson and another 
attorney for the civil liberties union of massachusetts had given 
the town a deadline of 5 pm sunday to remove the cross or be taken 
to court 
it was never put up there to offend anyone it was a cross 
to commemorate christmas said charles baker head of the town 
board of selectmen 
baker said the cross was replaced with a star because a star has 
no specific religious significance

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today 
denied reports that presidentelect bush discussed the possibility 
of an administration job with tv evangelist jim bakker during a 1985 
meeting 
he met with him i was there great meeting just like hundreds 
of other meetings he had with people who he was seeking their 
support said fitzwater who will serve bush in the white house 
spokesman capacity that he now holds under president reagan 
fitzwater initially told a white house briefing today that bush 
was seeking his support for the campaign absolutely you have 
hundreds of meetings like that when youre running for president 
but the spokesman subsequently said he had misspoken and that 
bush did not solicit campaign support from bakker 
fitzwater told reporters at the briefing 
i dont know what bakker thought there was no talk of jobs or 
payoffs or anything else it was a simple meeting as the vice 
president had with hundreds of other people and individuals asking 
their support asking his support for various policies and so 
forth 
they talked about their christian beliefs they talked about 
the robertson campaign it was just a friendly discussion 
at the time that bush met with bakker and his wife tammy faye in 
november 1985 fitzwater was bushs vice presidential press 
secretary bush was gearing up for his presidential run as was tv 
evangelist pat robertson whom bush ultimately defeated resoundingly 
in the republican primaries 
in march 1987 bakker stepped down from his ptl ministry 
admitting he had had a sexual involvement with former church 
secretary jessica hahn 
bushs ties to the fallen broadcast preacher through the 1985 
meeting and through three close bush associates who also were hired 
by bakker as consultants were the subject of a story in sundays 
opinion section of the washington post 
fitzwater characterized as mostly accurate the story which 
detailed the bakker employment of bushs former press secretary pete 
teeley and bush campaign religious liaison doug wead and dean 
burch former head of the federal communications commission and the 
republican national committee 
fitzwater said he had no quarrel with the story except the 
innuendo there was something wrong with it 
he said however there was no talk of bakker taking an 
administration job as was alleged by bakkers former personal 
bodyguard don hardister according to the post 
teeley told the associated press on sunday that after leaving 
bushs staff he had worked for bakker as a marketing consultant 
beginning in 1985 but that he had not set up the bushbakker 
meeting 
i have a very hard set rule i dont lobby bush because of 
their longtime personal relationship teeley said 
his work for bakker never had anything to do with bush said 
teeley whose association with bakker ended with bakkers troubles 
last year teeley also was bushs campaign press secretary for a 
time 
fitzwater said he knew nothing about allegations that political 
pressure caused the justice department in 1983 to drop a federal 
communications commissioninspired probe into bakkers fundraising 
practices

a man pleaded guilty today to the sexual 
torture and murder of five men and was sentenced to life in prison 
robert berdella already sentenced to life plus seven years for 
sexually torturing beating and injecting a man in a separate case 
described the killings during a 90minute court hearing 
berdella 39 pleaded guilty to firstdegree murder in the death 
of robert sheldon 23 of arleta calif testifying that he put a 
plastic trash bag over his head and tied it with a rope until 
sheldon suffocated 
berdella testified that todd stoops then 24 died of a loss of 
blood 
he said jerry howell walter ferris and mark wallace died because 
they could not breathe after he injected them with drugs and gagged 
them while they were tied to a bed in his midtown kansas city home 
berdella was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of 
parole on the first charge and life in prison for the other four 
counts of seconddegree murder 
berdella an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art 
objects and antiques became a household name in kansas city after 
his arrest in april after a man wearing only a dog collar ran 
screaming from his midtown house 
the man told authorities he had been sexually tortured beaten 
and injected with drugs by berdella 
i kept him bound to a bed with ropes tying his hands and 
feet berdella said when he pleaded guilty 
the arrest followed by days of digging in berdellas yard and 
searching his rambling house resulted in the discovery of two 
skulls on berdellas property and hundreds of photographs depicting 
nude and sometimes unconscious men 
sheldons skull was found buried on berdellas property no 
mention was made of where the rest of his remains or the bodies of 
the others were 
i tied his hands and feet on the bed berdella testified 
about the death of howell who was 19 when he disappeared in 1984 
i injected drugs into his body and gagged him apparently the 
combination of drugs and the gag made it impossible for him to 
breathe 
ferris was 25 when he was last seen in 1985 
relatives of some victims attended the hearing after private 
meetings with jackson county prosecutor albert riederer

a lawyer warned today that upholding 
dartmouth colleges suspension of two former student editors of a 
conservative newspaper would stifle freedom of expression on 
campuses nationwide 
but a lawyer for the ivy league college said the suspensions of 
the two white students for harassing a black professor is a simple 
case of student misconduct this is not a case which involves 
their right to publish 
the claims came in opening arguments on a bid by john sutter 22 
and christopher baldwin 21 for a court order reinstating the two 
grafton county superior court judge bruce mohl will decide 
whether they should be allowed to return to classes next month 
rather than in september when their 18month suspensions expire 
the hearing also will give a first reading of how the court will 
treat a lawsuit filed by the two and another dartmouth review 
staffer claiming the college discriminates against conservatives 
jack middleton dartmouths lawyer argued that freedom of 
expression exists on the dartmouth campus for all members of the 
community not just the dartmouth review a studentrun 
offcampus weekly 
but harvey myerson lawyer for the ousted students called the 
case a signal unmistakable to the student body and those connected 
with it and the student bodies across the country that you will do 
as we wish or you will not do it at all 
sutter of st louis and baldwin of hinsdale ill were 
suspended in march by a campuswide disciplinary panel for harassing 
william cole a third student got a shorter suspension and fourth 
probation for a classroom clash in february with cole one of whose 
music courses was panned by the review as one of dartmouths most 
academically deficient

the aids education program conducted by the 
federal centers for disease control has been marred by delays in 
mass mailings and by limited broadcasts of public service ads a 
congressional report said monday 
the report from the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress also said callers may find it difficult to get 
through to an aids telephone hotline 
the gao said that even though the cdcs aids education budget 
increased from about 17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly 210 
million in 1988 its efforts to focus national attention on aids 
prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key 
activities aimed at the general public 
rep barbara boxer dcalif who requested the gao 
investigation said she would forward a copy of the report to 
presidentelect bush for use as a guide on how not to implement 
health education programs 
gao found several problems associated with aids awareness and 
prevention month in october 1987 the center in may 1987 chose 
that month for its big push but was unable to get clearance from the 
white house domestic policy council for the centerpiece of the 
campaign a national aids information mailing to all households 
plans for the mailing which had been explicitly sought but not 
required by congress were dropped in july 1987 the gao report 
said the following year congress made the mailing mandatory and 
the pamphlet understanding aids was mailed last june 
cdc produced 38 public service announcements on aids and 
distributed them to the major television networks on sept 30 1987 
the report said but there was only one airing by a network during 
the following aids awareness month the three networks did air 
cdc public service announcements six times in november 1987 
when ads did air they were not likely to be seen by many people 
between december 1987 and february 1988 gao reported nearly 90 
percent of all networkaired aids public service announcements were 
shown during nonprimetime viewing hours nearly 60 percent were 
shown between 11 pm and 7 am gao said 
the report also cited problems largely corrected by last summer 
of getting through to an aids hotline cdc expanded the hotline from 
17 lines to 68 lines in october 1987 as part of its awareness 
month activities but the monthly busy signal percentage was far 
higher than the 3 percent maximum specified in its contract 
between october and december 1987 gao said the average busy 
signal rates on operatorassisted lines ranged from 38 percent to 65 
percent by last summer however the rate was down to 7 percent 
busy signals are still a problem immediately after public service 
announcements are aired and cdc is working to correct the situation 
gao said 
the watchdog agency said it also found that the aids information 
clearinghouse a cdc contractor was taking twice as long as it 
should have to send out copies of a pamphlet called what you 
should know about aids when investigators sought them last january 
and feburary but another order in march arrived within the sixday 
period required by contract 
boxer criticized the reagan administration for failing to provide 
leadership in the aids crisis particularly in educating americans 
and also said she was disturbed by this poor response by the media 
to provide frequent aids education messages 
boxer chairs the aids task force of the house budget committee 
last year she urged the tv networks to reconsider their refusal to 
air the cdcs education messages which discussed condoms as a means 
of preventing the spread of aids

members of the electoral college which 
includes george bushs son neil and brother prescott voted today to 
formally elect bush president fulfilling an antiquated but 
surviving constitutional ritual 
it was a nice honor to get to cast a vote for my dad neil 
bush a denver oilman said before performing his duty in colorado 
as one of the nations 538 electors itll be nice to be a small 
footnote in history 
prescott bush and seven other electors voted for the republican 
ticket in connecticut 
in state capitals across the nation designated electors were 
meeting to carry out their constitutional obligation and cast their 
electoral ballots 
some states had brief ceremonies steeped in history while others 
made a party of the event 
there were no surprises among electors in the first group of 
states to conduct the balloting 
in minnesota electors went to a long brunch before casting their 
ballots in illinois the 24 electors cast their votes for the 
republicans as expected and placed their ballots in a wooden 
ballot box used by abraham lincoln when he voted in the election of 
1860 
without doubt its one of the most misunderstood things in all 
of government and politics said illinois elector ray lahood 
electors cast separate votes for president and vice president 
among the first to vote was indiana where all 12 electors cast 
their votes for bush and for native son dan quayle as vice president 
its certainly appropriate said david l daugherty the 
elector from the same huntington county indiana where quayle is 
from ive known him for about 20 years 
the voting today sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint 
session of congress on jan 4 when vice president bush as 
president of the senate will open the ballots and announce the 
results and formally declare himself the presidentelect 
supervising the state electoral voting are officials at the 
national archives in washington although officials do not monitor 
the outcome of the voting attorney mike white said his office had 
received phone calls from secretaries of state in two states asking 
about procedures to name substitute electors 
we probably will only have a few states having problems 
white said 
the ritual is something of an anticlimax to the long presidential 
year 
bush defeated democrat michael dukakis in the general election 
with 53 percent of the more than 91 million votes cast and carrying 
enough states to win 426 electoral votes to dukakis 112 
that should be the vote after todays meetings give or take a 
faithless elector or two should there be any 
the electors were selected by the parties in each state one for 
each congressman and senator the state has votes cast for president 
in each state in fact were votes for the republican or democratic 
slate of electors 
by law the states must hold their electoral meetings today 
though the time and setting is up to each state many hold it in 
state capitol buildings 
among others with the duty were bushs designated white house 
chief of staff new hampshire gov john sununu penn state football 
coach joe paterno who seconded bushs nomination at the republican 
national convention was a pennsylvania elector 
but most were state party workers or insiders rewarded for their 
labors and state officeholders such as california gov george 
deukmejian and alabama gov guy hunt 
electors are expected to vote for their partys presidential 
nominee and vice presidential nominee but in this unique american 
system the constitution doesnt require it 
about half the states have laws that require electors to vote as 
pledged but constitutional experts question whether those laws 
could be enforced 
before today eight electors over the years have broken their 
pledges and voted for someone else 
a minnesota elector bill davis treasurer of the state 
democraticfarmlabor party had said he might cast a symbolic vote 
this year for jesse jackson for vice president instead of democratic 
sen lloyd bentsen the partys nominee 
with the furor over dan quayles selection as bushs republican 
vice presidential running mate still fresh in memory some electors 
have been getting letters urging them to dump quayle and cast 
vice presidential ballots for someone else 
but republicans said they werent worried 
theyre going to do their duty as the people instructed 
said republican national committee press secretary albert maruggi

the defense department is about to launch a new 
research effort to improve the definition or clarity of 
television screen pictures and in the process hopefully bolster the 
american tv manufacturing industry 
the department in a brief statement said its defense advanced 
research projects agency hoped in the next two to three weeks to 
solicit contract proposals in the areas of highdefinition 
lowcost display technology 
the pentagons primary goal is the development of an advanced 
but small tvtype screen or monitor that can display text 
characters or video signals with great clarity said spokeswoman jan 
bodanyi 
the monitors would be used inside new helicopters and airplanes 
training simulators and other types of vehicles and command centers 
the defense department also hopes however that by providing 
seed money for new research it can enlist electronic and 
semiconductor companies to fight japan for the lead in developing 
the next generation of tv sets for commercial use 
highdefinition television or hdtv offers the promise of 
sharper brighter and wider pictures that could match the quality of 
motion picture films japanese industry has developed an hdtv system 
and plans to begin marketing it in 1990 
a consortium of european firms also is thought to be ahead of 
american industry in exploring the new technology 
pentagon officials say they hope that by prodding research in the 
field of highdefinition monitors the government also can 
ultimately spur domestic manufacturing of semiconductors the 
electronic chips at the heart of computers 
the hdtv technology will require extensive use of semiconductors 
and that could provide the incentive needed by domestic companies to 
reenter the semiconductor market said one official who asked not 
to be identified 
the source added the zenith electronics corp which remains 
usowned is almost sure to be included in the darpa effort 
zenith already has asked for a 15 million contract to develop what 
it calls flat tension mask technology 
the flat tension mask resembles a conventional tv picture tube 
but has a flat face that is sharper and much more rugged which 
would make it attractive for battlefield use 
but this wont be a onecompany effort added the source 
the pentagon in its statement said darpa had been working in 
the arena of highdefinition monitors for years and where 
practical will conform to evolving commercial hdtv standards 
a technology base common to defense and commercial needs 
benefits dod as lower unit prices result from largescale 
production the statement added 
hdtv and computers share a common dependence on 
semiconductors dod has an interest in maintaining a robust us 
semiconductor industry so as to assure a domestic source of the most 
advanced microelectronic products

monday editions

president reagan is preparing to leave office 
taking credit for progress in areas ranging from nuclear arms 
reduction to deregulation of business as for things that went 
wrong well they were somebody elses fault 
after eight years as governor of california and eight as 
president reagans speeches still ring with attacks on governmental 
meddling and warnings of the dangers of communist aggression just 
as they did when he was a speaker on behalf of general electric co 
before he entered politics 
in a speech summing up his administrations record on domestic 
policy last week he denounced the carter administration for saying 
as he phrased it that the nations problems were too complicated 
to manage 
well we said of course they are so government should stop 
trying to manage them stop putting its faith in the false god of 
bureaucracy and trust the genius of the american people instead 
he told an audience of political appointees 
two days later in a speech at the university of virginia he 
blamed the onagain offagain record of congress for the 
failure of his policy of supporting anticommunist rebels in 
nicaragua 
and on saturday he told listeners to his weekly radio address 
since congress changed the budget law in 1974 federal spending 
has in fact quadrupled and it has come right out of your pocket 
in his domestic policy speech on wednesday the president said a 
washington colony operating through an iron triangle of 
members of congress the news media and special interest groups was 
stifling efforts to wipe out the budget deficit 
to some the iron triangle phrase was reminiscent of the 
speech in 1961 in which dwight eisenhower the last president before 
reagan to complete eight years in office inveighed against the 
power of the militaryindustrial complex 
he is raising a flag to a system that we are a part of and that 
we participate in because thats the way business is done these 
days said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater adding that the 
president was sharing some of the lessons hes learned from his 
eight years 
the president acknowledged that he was borrowing the iron 
triangle phrase from others who had used it before him what he 
didnt acknowledge was that they used it differently in the 
original version it described the relationship between 
congressional committees the bureaucracy and interest groups 
reagan skipped the part that suggested agencies that were part of 
his administration might have helped fuel the deficit 
he also did not say what he meant by a special interest group 
although its a term he often uses to describe people who are for 
things hes against 
the next event on reagans schedule after his iron triangle 
speech was a friendly gettogether with members of the business 
government relations council a group of corporate lobbyists 
or some might say a special interest group 
in charlottesville the president attacked the notion that 
judgeships should be used to further privately held beliefs not yet 
approved by the people 
the remark was a new twist reagan ran for the white house in 
1980 and 1984 on platforms calling for the appointment of judges who 
would overturn the supreme courts ruling that legalized abortion 
polls repeatedly have shown that most americans support that 
decision 
in 1986 the president crisscrossed the country arguing for the 
election of a republican senate that he said would among other 
things confirm the kind of federal judges he favors but when his 
nomination of conservative jurist robert bork to the supreme court 
ran into a buzzsaw of opposition he charged that his opponents 
were politicizing the judicial selection process 
as for foreign policy the president told the university of 
virginia students its precisely where congress and the president 
have worked together as in afghanistan and cambodia or resolved 
differences as in angola the persian gulf and many aspects of 
ussoviet relations precisely there our policies have succeeded 
and we see progress 
but where congress and the president have engaged each other as 
adversaries as over central america us policies have faltered 
and our common purposes have not been achieved he said 
the president did not mention lebanon where in 1982 the 
republicancontrolled senate and democraticcontrolled house joined 
in placing limits on the presidents policy of using us marines to 
oversee the withdrawal of palestinian guerrillas and invading 
israeli troops from beirut the marines were withdrawn after a 
suicide car bomber killed 241 of them in 1983 
fitzwater asked about the bombing at his daily news briefing 
monday said the president has publicly talked about the bombing 
as one of his most discouraging and sad moments in office as 
president but i dont believe there is any new information on the 
perpetrators

missouri prison officials today halted 
plans to execute an inmate tuesday in anticipation that a federal 
court would block the execution now that he has ordered his appeals 
continued 
an attorney also filed new legal motions with the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals in st louis seeking to block the 
execution which would have been missouris first since 1965 
c john pleban requested a stay of execution for gerald smith 
saying smith who previously had abandoned his appeals wants to 
continue his legal challenges 
included with the request for a stay was a letter smith wrote to 
the federal appeals court 
i had decided to forego any further review of my cases because 
i had lost faith in a judicial system that had failed me for eight 
years smith wrote 
however due to recent developments on my case this travesty 
can no longer be ignored and thus it would be an act of suicide for 
me to follow through with my execution without having these matters 
reviewed smith wrote 
the recent developments were apparently a reference to a recent 
newspaper article that raised doubts about smiths guilt 
smith faces two separate death warrants one for the 1980 
bludgeoning death of karen roberts and another for the 1985 murder 
of fellow inmate robert baker

a judge ruled monday that amish people must 
display slowmoving vehicle signs on their horsedrawn buggies but 
lawyers said the religiousfreedom issue could go all the way to the 
us supreme court 
state law requiring the signs does not violate the amishs first 
amendment right to freedom of religion fillmore county district 
judge clement snyder said in his ruling 
phillip villaume an attorney representing the amish said the 
case will be appealed to the state court of appeals 
villaume and fillmore county assistant attorney matt opat said 
the case likely will go to the minnesota supreme court and may end 
up in the us supreme court 
fifteen amish people appeared before snyder in october after they 
had been ticketed for violating the state regulations they were 
cited for failing to obey a minnesota law requiring them to display 
triangular slowmoving vehicle signs on the rear of their buggies 
during the day the signs can be black with white reflective tape 
when it is dark or foggy the signs must be orange 
opat argued that prosecuting the amish for not complying with the 
state law was a case of public safety not religious prosecution he 
said public safety issues significantly outweigh any infringement 
the law may have on the amishs constitutional right of religious 
freedom 
villaume of st paul said it was ironic that the amish who 
settled in the united states in the 1700s to avoid religious 
persecution were still fighting battles to protect their religion 
a witness for the amish said they oppose displaying the signs 
because they feel the signs are worldly representations of man 
not god and they hope to keep their religious practices separate 
from the modern world 
but opat said the amish willingly displayed the signs for years 
but then quit displaying them within the past year or two there 
also has been no uniformity among the amish in fillmore county he 
said noting that some display the orange signs some the black and 
white signs and others no signs at all 
the amish have regularly used the color red on their barns 
leading the prosecutor to question whether the dispute was really 
over religious beliefs as a result he said in october the amish 
have a pickandchoose society

as christmas approaches jens bernhardt starts 
thinking of home on the other side of the dangerous berlin wall 
but the former east german border guard knows theres no going 
back after his dramatic july 1987 escape to the west 
everything everyone in my family is back there it was tough 
last christmas this year its also going to be hard really 
hard bernhardt says 
while hundreds of east germans flee to west germany and west 
berlin over border barriers each year only a small number return to 
their communist homeland west german officials say 
for those fearing possible punishment if they return there are 
often pangs of homesickness especially during the christmas season 
bernhardt who says he would be prosecuted as a deserter if he 
dared to return home described what its like to be an east german 
escapee unable to be with his family for christmas 
last year i decided to do volunteer work during christmas at 
checkpoint charlie to keep occupied bernhardt said in an 
interview in west berlin 
just sitting around alone he said shaking his head 
without finishing the sentence as he reflected on another christmas 
away from home 
checkpoint charlie a crossing between east berlin and west 
berlin is tightly controlled by communist troops 
bernhardt works fulltime on the west berlin side of the 
checkpoint giving guided tours at a museum devoted to escapees from 
east germany and lecturing student groups on conditions in his 
homeland 
while bernhardt admits it is hard making contacts in the west as 
an outsider he says hes happy he took the chance 
even now after more than a year i wake up some mornings and 
break out laughing just at the thought of being here bernhardt 
says 
bernhardt was a 19yearold east german border guard when he 
climbed down from a guard tower and scrambled over a steelmesh 
fence separating west berlins spandau district from east german 
territory near potsdam 
bernhardt said he decided to flee after he was assigned duty as a 
border guard and he was faced with shoottokill orders along the 
east germanconstructed barriers 
there are so many who try to flee and every ddr german 
democratic republic soldier is afraid they may someday have to 
shoot someone escaping i couldnt come to terms with that 
bernhardt said 
at least 77 people have been killed trying to escape over 
communistbuilt barriers blocking off west berlin according to the 
working group august 13 the human rights organization took its name 
from the day east germany began building the berlin wall on aug 13 
1961 
bernhardt gave a gripping account of his escape to the west 
there were always two guards but your partner and guard tower 
were changed regularly so you didnt get to know each other well 
enough to build up trust bernhardt recalled 
so after planning for two weeks i knew i had to do it i 
waited until my partner fell asleep at 3 am he said 
after hiding his colleagues ammunition bernhardt said he 
climbed down from the tower his knees weak with fright bernhardt 
crossed the strip of land separating the tower from the 10 foothigh 
steelmesh fence blocking his way to west berlin 
i was so afraid i would be spotted and shot at from another 
tower my knees were like rubber and i couldnt run i staggered 
like a drunk to that fence and pulled myself over it with metal 
hooks i stuck in the holes of the panels bernhardt said 
now 17 months after his escape bernhardt says hes sorry he 
worried his parents by fleeing 
i know i caused them anguish but now they know im safe and 
im sure theyre happy for me he said asking that the names of 
his parents and two younger brothers not be used he said his home 
was in the karl marxstadt area of east germany about 25 miles 
north of the czechoslovak border 
asked what he would like most for christmas if he had a choice 
bernhardt said that no ddr soldier ever again has to shoot 
someone going over the border that the day comes when we can pass 
freely through that wall

infantry armor and artillery units 
returned home monday in a partial vietnamese withdrawal from 
occupied cambodia where insurgents are fighting a jungle war 
against the hanoisupported government 
vietnam said the soldiers were leaving western cambodia on four 
land routes and by boat down the mekong river and claimed only 
50000 troops would remain to support the client government 
established after its december 1978 invasion 
the khmer rouge rulers whose murderous regime vietnam overthrew a 
decade ago have the strongest force in the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition fighting the occupation army 
villagers and children waving vietnamese and cambodian flags 
lined the red dirt road on which soldiers of the 5th and 309th 
divisions approached and crossed the frontier monday at sa mat 
included in columns were sovietmade trucks towing us 
howitzers and armored personnel carriers captured at the end of the 
vietnam war in 1975 at least one vehicle still carried the horse 
emblem of the us 11th armored cavalry 
vietnam and the client government it supports in phnom penh say 
18000 soldiers will have left cambodia in a weeklong withdrawal 
scheduled to end wednesday 
western analysts sometimes said earlier partial withdrawals 
which began in 1982 were only troop rotations americans and 
others acknowledge however that hanoi has reduced its strength in 
cambodia substantially from a high of 200000 soldiers 
while vehicles moved along the dusty roads the official 
cambodian news agency spk said a fleet of nearly 200 vessels 
carrying vietnamese soldiers sailed past phnom penh on their way 
home 
it said about 10000 people including cambodian communist party 
officials and military officers lined the banks in the early 
morning to bid farewell to the soldiers 
division commander col nguyen minh chau came ashore to shake 
hands and the fleet then sailed southward on the 70mile journey to 
the border the agency said 
at sa mat an officer commanding three vehicles told reporters 
his unit had seen little action in two years against khmer rouge 
guerrillas they may attack some of our small units but when they 
hear armor coming they disappear nguyen van vinh said 
other soldiers also said they had met few guerrillas during a 
prolonged lull which has been confirmed by western analysts and 
interpreted either as the end of the guerrillas or a calm before 
the storm 
some say the khmer rouge whose strength usually is given as 
3000040000 are concentrating on organization propaganda and 
stockpiling weapons as the vietnamese proceed with a promised 
pullout of all forces by 1990 
earlier monday elements of the two divisions joined in a 
farewell ceremony at kompong cham a provincial capital on the 
mekong about 45 miles from the border a rock band played thousands 
of children lined the roads and commanders laid wreaths at a 
monument to the hundreds of thousands of people killed during the 
khmer rouges reign of terror in 197579 
children held up placards reading we will think of you always 
as the vietnamese column rolled through the warscarred town toward 
steel ferries that took them across the river 
kompong cham once a thriving resort and center of the rubber 
trade was largely destroyed in 1973 when the khmer rouge nearly 
seized it from the usbacked government of president lon nol it 
became a ghost town during khmer rouge rule 
at this border post the vietnamese soldiers completed a fiveday 
trek across cambodia from bases in battambang a province on the 
cambodian border with thailand 
lt gen nguyen van thai a vietnamese army spokesman said about 
6000 soldiers and 300 vehicles were involved 
about 150 foreign journalists were in cambodia for the withdrawal

rep jack kemp named to head george bushs 
department of housing and urban development will now have a forum 
to keep his own political profile in the public eye 
kemp who fought unsuccessfully for the republican presidential 
nomination said after bush introduced him as the hud choice monday 
i havent ruled out seeking office some day nor have i ruled it 
in 
for now though kemp will have a chance to test some longheld 
theories for reviving inner cities and will also bring new 
visibility to the problems of housing and poverty that plague the 
nations cities 
a nineterm republican congressman from a district that includes 
part of buffalo ny kemp is still just 53 and the former pro 
football quarterback presents a youthful energetic appearance 
bush said he had extracted no promises that his former rival 
would not pursue his own political agenda but it doesnt concern 
me at all 
jack has shifted gears here to be part of our team the 
presidentelect said 
kemp himself said he would keep silent on issues outside his new 
assignment im not going to speak on foreign policy im 
going to be a good team player he said 
as hud secretary kemp will succeed samuel pierce who survived 
all eight years of the reagan administration while keeping the 
lowest of profiles even president reagan once mistook pierce for a 
mayor a mistake bush wont make about a widely known politician who 
is especially popular among conservatives 
he is best known for his advocacy of supplyside econonics 
including the taxcutting bill bearing his name that was the heart 
of reaganomics but his legislative interests were broad 
he and liberal bronx democratic rep robert garcia formed an 
unlikely alliance to push for urban enterprise zones a program 
of tax breaks to promote development of blighted urban areas as a 
congressman kemp couldnt get the bill passed but could try again 
in his new position 
kemp also introduced legislation to enable residents of federal 
lowincome housing to buy their homes at belowmarket prices 
although his strongly conservative ideology is not shared by most 
of the mayors of the nations big cities his appointment was 
generally praised 
while theres no question a lot of mayors were in the running 
we do have an elected official who will bring a visibility to issues 
that hasnt been there before said tom cochran executive 
director of the us conference of mayors huds going to be on 
the front burner again 
jack french kemp was born in california grew up in los angeles 
and attended nearby occidental college where he played football and 
led the nations small colleges in passing 
his father ran a small trucking firm and his mother was a social 
worker 
kemp got his start in pro football with the detroit lions of the 
national football league in 1957 but he bolted to the new american 
football league and the san diego chargers he was later traded to 
the buffalo bills for 100 where he built a reputation as a 
perfectionist who would play hurt he led the team to two league 
championships and four division titles 
he was the leagues most valuable player in 1965 and that same 
year founded the afl players association 
kemp made his first mark in national politics by helping sell 
reagan on supplyside economics the belief that cutting taxes would 
ultimately produce more tax revenues he had worked with reagan in 
california as a member of the govenors staff 
his call for cutting taxes 10 percent a year for three years was 
embraced by reagan and adopted in a modified form by congress it 
has been credited with bringing about economic recovery but also has 
been blamed for pushing the federal budget deficit to record levels 
in the reagan years 
kemp dropped out of the presidential race in midmarch after 
poor showings in the big super tuesday primaries he had decided 
earlier not to seek reelection to his congressional seat in order 
to pursue the presidency 
in recent months kemp appeared to be angling for an 
administration job that would keep him in the political arena and 
public eye 
at the republican convention in august he let it be known he 
would like to be selected as bushs vice presidential nominee he 
wasnt 
kemp also suggested back then that hed like to be secretary of 
state or defense or treasury but said he didnt think hed be 
offered any of those jobs he was right 
in september the heritage foundation a conservative washington 
research organization announced kemp would become one of its 
fellows lecturing and writing about economics and foreign policy 
but kemp appararently was not content with the prospect of an 
ivorytower future he said monday this is far more attractive 
with all due respect

one of three judges who said they would 
bar aidsinfected defendants from their courtroom has changed his 
mind saying he is putting his professional concerns ahead of his 
personal beliefs 
if they just want to be there for a fair trial they got it 
jack montgomery a jefferson county district judge said of 
defendants who test positive for the aids virus 
montgomery and two other jefferson county district judges ol 
pete johnson and mike mccormick announced last week that they 
had barred aidsinfected defendants from their courtrooms to enter 
pleas or to be sentenced 
instead the judges said they would conduct the procedures by 
telephone a practice each judge carried out once 
montgomery said he did not want himself or the people in his 
courtroom exposed to defendants harboring the acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome virus johnson and mccormick said their bailiffs 
did not want to handle aidsinfected defendants 
the judges policy sparked complaints from lawyers and civil 
libertarians that the defendants constitutional rights were being 
violated others were concerned about the image the judges action 
gave birmingham 
weve been fighting that bigoted image for a long time we 
dont need to fight it again with our judges said charles 
collins a board member of birmingham aids outreach 
montgomery said he changed his mind after talking with several 
people including his wife 
my wife called me a big stupid jerk montgomery told the 
birmingham postherald in a story published monday 
im putting my professional thoughts above my personal 
thoughts by allowing aidspositive defendants into the courtroom 
he said 
but montgomery said that under certain circumstances such as if 
an aidsinfected defendant is known to be violent he may hold a 
hearing at the jail intead of in court 
johnson and mccormick also altered their views somewhat saying 
they will look at each case individually 
if theres evidence that the defendant has a history of 
violence theyll be treated differently than one who doesnt 
johnson said but someone wont be necessarily banned from the 
courtroom just because he has aids 
the judges had asked the birmingham bar association and the 
american bar association for guidelines for dealing with 
aidsinfected defendants neither organization had any available

john gordon and his crew spent four days 
renovating a housing project apartment only to have each days work 
undone by thieves who took everything from wiring to the toilet 
then the maintenance crew gave up 
the apartment is one of more than 1100 vacant apartments in the 
citys 10 public housing projects more than 600 people remain on a 
waiting list for subsidized housing as new orleans housing authority 
officials battle what they say is a wave of drugrelated thefts 
the problem erupted early this year when cocaine began to 
flourish in new orleans at the same time the price of aluminum began 
to rise at recycling centers according to housing authority 
officials 
aluminum has become a major source of income for drug users 
according to gordon a maintenance supervisor for the st thomas 
project window sashes mail boxes mail slots faucet handles 
anything made of aluminum brings between 40 cents and 80 cents a 
pound 
housing authority workers say apathetic tenants and unresponsive 
police share part of the blame for the ransacking of vacant units 
theres no involvement by our residents here said nathaniel 
johnson manager of the st bernard housing project for somebody 
to go on a second floor and tote a refrigerator out and put it on a 
truck someone should become somewhat suspicious but apparently 
they dont 
when the thefts are reported to police johnson said all we 
get is an item number and good luck getting your item back 
new orleans police lt yvonne bechet said there is a threeman 
unit assigned to the housing authority and police respond whenever 
they are called but she said calls to police from the authority are 
infrequent 
she also said residents may be afraid to call police because they 
fear retaliation 
they live in a very dense area very close to those parties 
that are committing those acts she said 
don england authority deputy executive officer for management 
said public housing vacancy rates have been reduced from more than 
13 percent in july to just under 10 percent in early december but 
vandals make the work slower and more expensive 
meanwhile the homeless the unemployed and the poor are forced 
to wait for public housing 
in st thomas for example there are 170 vacant apartments and a 
waiting list of 60 renters in all new orleans public housing 
developments have 1124 vacancies and a waiting list of 634 
applicants based on december figures

the national institutes of health will slip 
from worldclass player to alsoran in biomedical research unless 
its leaders are given more freedom from the federal bureauracy a 
government panel said monday 
part of that freedom should translate to higher salaries for top 
researchers even if it means fewer employees doing lowerlevel work 
said harold t shapiro president of princeton university and 
chairman of the institute of medicine study 
shapiro emphasized at a news conference that the committees two 
major recommendations a call for a 25 million discretionary fund 
for the nih to use to react quickly to unanticipated research 
developments and higher pay at top levels could be accomplished 
without an overall budget increase 
while the institutes could use more money he said the panel 
felt strongly that its suggestions were so important they should be 
implemented even if meant shifting funds around including fewer 
people better paid 
its not easy to do and will take more time without budget 
increases said shapiro 
robert g petersdorf president of the association of american 
medical colleges and a committee member agreed that you can do a 
lot more with the same amount of money if administrators are not 
bound by congressional directives to maintain a certain number of 
fulltime employees 
if we dont do this or something similar we will end up 
effectively undermining the effectiveness of nih and it will 
no longer be a major force in biomedical research said shapiro 
it will not be able to be saved if we wake up 15 years down the 
line and find that has happened 
shapiro said the panel was not concerned about any quality 
decline that has occurred up to now we in some sense wept because 
we said more could have been accomplished he said the 
domination is not what it once was 
the report by the institute of medicine which is a branch of the 
national academy of science said research at nih makes invaluable 
contributions to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological 
process and their dysfunction in disease 
the report was prompted by a recommendation from the reagan 
administrations office of management and budget that nih research 
be taken from the government and turned over to private companies 
the committee of scientists said privatization in the sense of 
making the intramural nih research program freestanding and 
selfsupporting is undesirable and impractical 
none of the common forms of privatization would be as likely to 
sustain the vitality of the research effort as would a more modest 
restructuring the report said 
nih based in bethesda md is a confederation of 12 research 
institutes each dedicated to different diseases types of disorders 
or speciality areas basic discoveries made by nih scientists are 
made available to anyone and often form the basis of subsequent 
applications developed by researchers at universities and in private 
industry 
among the reports recommendations were 
an increase in salaries for senior researchers who are actively 
recruited by universities hospitals and biotechnology companies 
which pay much higher wages the report said 42 senior scientists in 
the highest nih salary range of between 77000 and 99500 were 
lured away between 1983 and 1988 by salary increases ranging from 50 
to 300 percent 
that congress charter a foundation to allow private support of 
up to 10 endowed positions for senior researchers 
that nih be given more authority independent of its parent 
agency the department of health and human services the report said 
attempts by hhs to micromanage nih are counterproductive and 
cause nih to be inefficient in carrying out its mission 
that the nih director receive a 25 million discretionary fund 
to be used to respond quickly to research needs without the current 
requirement of review by hhs 
that a personnel demonstration project be authorized by 
congress to give nih flexibility in salaries benefits and hiring 
practices this would include a limit on personnel costs instead of 
a ceiling on the number of positions so nih would have more control 
over how its personnel dollars are spent

here is the text of president reagans annual 
christmas message 
the themes of christmas and of coming home for the holidays have 
long been intertwined in song and story there is a profound irony 
and lesson in this because christmas celebrates the coming of a 
savior who was born without a home 
there was no room at the inn for the holy family weary of 
travel a young mary close to childbirth and her carpenter husband 
joseph found but the rude shelter of a stable there was born the 
king of kings the prince of peace an event on which all history 
would turn jesus would again be without a home and more than once 
on the flight to egypt and during his public ministry when he said 
the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the 
son of man hath not where to lay his head 
from his very infancy on our redeemer was reminding us that from 
then on we would never lack a home in him like the shepherds to 
whom the angel of the lord appeared on the first christmas day we 
could always say let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this 
thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto 
us 
as we come home with gladness of family and friends this 
christmas let us also remember our neighbors who cannot go home 
themselves our compassion and concern this christmas and all year 
long will mean much to the hospitalized the homeless the 
convalescent the orphaned and will surely lead us on our way to 
the joy and peace of bethlehem and the christ child who bids us 
come for it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning of 
the nativity that we can be truly happy truly at peace truly home 
merry christmas and god bless you

a guidebook published by the citys nonprofit 
tourism bureau is telling visitors to boston how to get lost 
the 144page book produced by the greater boston convention and 
visitors bureau gives the wrong location for many downtown 
landmarks 
even the prudential center where the book is sold for 2 from 
the tourism bureaus office is identified on the guides map as 
being several blocks from its actual location 
unfortunately errors like this happen said robert cumings 
president of the bureau which receives 1 million of its 3 million 
budget from the state 
the bureau was formed to promote tourism but visitors using the 
198889 official guidebook to get around bostons back bay will find 
nearly every major landmark incorrectly located 
for example the map places the ritzcarlton hotel three blocks 
from its actual location at newbury and arlington streets tourists 
are told that the four seasons hotel on boylston street across from 
the public garden is on newbury street 
cumings whose salary has risen 72 percent to 105000 over the 
past three years told the boston sunday globe that the errors have 
been corrected although the book was still on sale last week

aids is now the ninth leading cause of death 
among children 1 to 4 years old and the seventh leading cause of 
deaths among young people age 15 to 24 a federal official said 
monday 
if present trends continue said dr antonia novello the disease 
soon will be the no 5 killer of americans from birth to their 24th 
birthday 
in a report to health and human services secretary otis r bowen 
novello said present statistics however tragic sorely 
underestimate the true scope of pediatric aids 
as of dec 12 1291 cases of aids had been reported among 
infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the 
13to19year group of those 717 who were under 13 at the time of 
their diagnosis have already died along with 174 who were 
adolescents when diagnosed 
the official figures include only those children whose 
condition was reported to the centers for disease control she 
said probably for every child who meets the cdc definition of 
aids another two to 10 are infected with hiv it is estimated that 
by 1991 there will be at least 10000 to 20000 hivinfected 
children in the united states 
hiv is the virus that causes aids and health officials are 
growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those 
infected eventually will develop aids and die 
novello deputy director of the national institute of child 
health and human development headed an hhs working group on aids 
among children 
her report to bowen said the problem of hiv infection among 
adolescents is enormously greater than the official count suggests 
in view of the lengthy latency period between infection and 
symptomatic disease many of the more than 14000 cases of aids 
reported in persons in their 20s must surely have been contracted 
when these people were teenagers she wrote the repercussions 
of hiv infection in adolescents are magnified by the potential of 
these sexually active young people to become parents themselves 
transmitting the virus to yet another generation 
citing demographic data that the current us population of 
people between 11 and 24 years of age is unusually small to begin 
with she said if aids were to make serious inroads in this 
group the longterm consequences could be disastrous for the 
nations economy

an excited young andean condor flapped her 
wings and took off on her first flight as biologists freed three of 
the birds into the wild to pave the way for the eventual release of 
endangered california condors 
the three birds were the first of up to 17 andean condors 
donated by various zoos where they were born that will be freed by 
late 1989 so scientists can test the techniques they hope to use 
when they release california condors which are north americas 
largest birds with 9foot wingspans 
only 28 endangered california condors remain alive all in zoos 
in los angeles and san diego officials are trying to get the 
carrioneating vultures to breed in captivity in hopes of starting 
to reintroduce them into the wild in five to 10 years 
the release of the first three andean birds started last friday 
night in a wet and snowy hopper mountain national wildlife refuge 
about 50 miles northwest of downtown los angeles the three birds 
living in a netcovered enclosure set into rocks were placed in a 
roost box while scientists removed the netting us fish and 
wildlife service biologist teresa nichols said monday by phone from 
ventura 
on saturday morning we opened the door and the birds walked 
out single file nichols said at first they stopped where the 
net had been then did their morning behavior stretching their 
wings and trying to find sun to warm up she added 
then 8monthold condor y1 born at san diego wild animal park 
and the oldest of the trio seemed to get very excited nichols 
said 
she started flapping her wings jumping up and down and turning 
in circles extending her wings and flapping she turned her 
head into the breeze jumped into the air and took her first flight 
she spiraled down trying to soar awkwardly she landed on some 
rocks on a side hill beneath the release site 
the bird spent the rest of the day making short flights between 
various rocks while 6monthold condor y3 born at patuxent 
wildlife research center in maryland made some very short flights 
among the rocks nichols said 
meanwhile 6monthold condor y2 born at the buffalo ny 
zoo roosted on rocks without making a first flight 
theyre doing as we expected them to be doing nichols said 
were very pleased with how things are going 
four more condors kept in an enclosure in the nearby sespe 
condor sanctuary will be released in late january or february she 
added 
efforts to save california condors have cost more than 20 
million to date the andean condor release experiment will cost 
about 440000 officials have said 
some 1000 to 2000 andean condors remain in the wilds of south 
america thousands of california condors once flew free but their 
numbers dwindled to the point that four of the last five breeding 
pairs vanished in 198485 the fish and wildlife service made a 
controversial decision to round up the last six wild birds in 1986 
to prevent their demise 
their path toward extinction has been blamed on development of 
condor habitat and lead poisoning from eating carcasses of animals 
shot by hunters

drought floods and hurricanes wreaked havoc on world 
food supplies in 1988 and experts are worried about the outlook for 
next year a un official said monday 
the outcome of next years harvest will be crucial un food 
and agriculture organization directorgeneral edouard saouma said in 
his yearend statement in 1989 global cereal output must 
increase by an unprecedented 225 million tons or 13 percent to 
meet food needs and rebuild stocks to acceptable levels 
during 1988 he said the world drew heavily from onceabundant 
food reserves depleting stocks to the lowest levels since the food 
crisis of the early 1970s 
for the first time since world war ii global cereal production 
has declined in two successive years saouma said 
better harvests in asia africa and western europe were unable to 
offset crop losses in the americas eastern europe and the soviet 
union he said 
saouma also noted a severe drought in north america the 
traditional breadbasket of the world reduced cereal output by 
almost a third 
two successive hurricanes took a toll on harvest in some central 
american and caribbean countries and floods battered crops 
elsewhere particularly bangladesh and sudan he said 
saouma said the locust invasion in africa and the middle east was 
the most extensive in history but concerted action has limited the 
potentially enormous damage from the invasion which is expected to 
last two or three more years 
food production he said has not kept pace with population 
growth in twothirds of the countries in africa about half in latin 
american the caribbean and near east and a third of those in the 
far east 
angola benin bangladesh cambodia haiti laos lebanon 
malawi mozambique nicaragua somalia sri lanka sudan vietnam 
and ethiopia are facing unusual food shortages and require 
exceptional food aid he said 
our main multilateral food supply for use in times of 
disasters the international emergency food reserve is exhausted 
he said 
he repeated his proposal to make the voluntary reserve a legally 
binding convention and to augment the 500000ton a year reserve 
with a standby pledge of 15 million tons for emergencies 
saouma said a number of lowincome fooddeficit countries could 
have trouble meeting food needs in 1989 because the low stocks have 
pushed up cereal prices he also identified foreign indebtedness and 
agricultural trade barriers as major obstacles for the third world 
debt servicing alone absorbs more than 40 percent of the export 
earnings of many developing countries he said 
saouma also characterized 1988 as the worst financial year in 
faos 43year history he said 80 countries owe the agency 111 
million with the largest debtor the united states owing 78 
million 
the romebased fao coordinates agricultural projects in 
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the 
united nations

china has agreed to a series of restrictions 
concerning the terms under which chineseproduced rocket boosters 
will launch three americanmade communications satellites the state 
department said monday 
the restrictions basically are aimed at ensuring china will not 
be able to compete unfairly against private american launch 
companies 
the agreement was initialed saturday by us and chinese 
representatives it apparently sets the stage for asiasat a 
britishchinese consortium and aussat an australian satellite 
group to have the satellites they plan to purchase in the united 
states launched by chinese rockets 
as part of the agreement china said it would abide by market 
economy practices in pricing and insurance and would avoid other 
government inducements state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said 
she said china also agreed to launch no more than nine 
communications satellites during the next six years and to 
distribute launch commitments proportionately during the agreement 
mrs oakley said the agreement ensures that us national 
security interests will be fully safeguarded 
the agreement allows the chinese to enter the international 
commercial launch market in accordance with market principles and in 
a way that will not materially impair the smooth and effective 
functioning of that market she said 
martin marietta corp a major rocket manufacturer said in a 
statement monday it is hopeful that the agreement will mean that 
chinese participation in satellite launchings will be fair and 
nondisruptive 
whether the agreement serves that purpose depends on the 
specifics of how it is implemented said a company spokeswoman who 
asked not to be identified by name 
she also called for a broad international agreement on commercial 
launch services among the united states europe china and japan 
a level playing field is required if us industry is to 
compete and us access is to be assured she said 
no american satellites have ever been launched by a nonwestern 
or communist country 
in september when president reagan approved the plan us 
commercial launch companies expressed opposition on grounds they 
would not be able to compete with a country that has a staterun 
rocket program and does not have to make a profit 
the american launch market has picked up since the 1986 
challenger tragedy afterward reagan ordered that the space shuttle 
be used only for military and scientific payloads making private 
rocket companies the only alternative for commercial satellite 
producers

one in five high school students smoked marijuana 
in the last year and half took a drink according to a 24state 
survey by an atlantabased antidrug group

less than 2 percent of the students surveyed reported using alcohol 
or drugs on school premises 
students use drugs in their homes in the homes of friends and 
in cars primarily at night and on weekends said dr ronald d 
adams the author of the report we dont have a school drug 
problem we have a community drug problem 
the parents resource institute for drug education questioned 
students in grades 612 in 24 states during the 198788 school year 
more than 203000 students filled in the groups questionnaire 
which was distributed at 302 schools said pride spokesman doug 
hall although the survey is not a scientific sampling the group 
believes the results are very significant because of the large 
number of students surveyed from every region in the country hall 
said 
students did not sign their names to the questionnaries which 
were machinetabulated by the group to protect confidentiality hall 
said 
among high school students defined as grades 912 20 percent of 
those surveyed had used marijuana at least once in the previous 
year fiftyeight percent had drunk beer 56 percent had drunk wine 
coolers and 46 percent had drunk liquor among seniors 64 percent 
said they had drunk beer in the previous year

thirtyfive percent had smoked cigarettes 
among junior high students 31 percent had tried beer 30 
percent wine coolers 18 percent liquore 16 percent marijuana 1 
percent cocaine and 22 percent cigarettes 
more than half 51 percent of all students surveyed said they 
found beer and wine coolers were at least fairly easy to obtain 
twentysix percent said the same for marijuana and 12 percent said 
so for cocaine 
the questionnaires found some apparent ignorance about the 
effects of wine coolers sixtyfive percent of the students surveyed 
said they were uncertain about any detrimental effects from wine 
coolers compared with 56 percent for beer although wine coolers 
which contain 4 percent to 6 percent alcohol are more potent than 
beer which has an alcoholic content of 3 percent to 4 percent 
the students were most likely to drink or to smoke marijuana at 
home at a friends house or in a car the largest percentages said 
they had had beer wine coolers or marijuana at a friends house 
and liquor at home 
the survey was conducted among schools in alaska alabama

college graduates face a happy new year in the job 
market according to a leading report released monday 
there will be an an 8 percent increase in corporate demand for 
graduates with bachelors degrees and a 46 percent jump in 
starting salaries according to northwestern universitys 43rd 
annual lindquistendicott report 
the report also predicted new graduates with masters degrees 
will be sought at a rate 14 percent higher than last year and their 
starting salaries will increase 35 percent 
the 242 business and industrial firms surveyed nationwide for the 
report painted a rosy picture of the 1989 economy with 61 percent 
expecting an improvement over 1988 36 percent expecting no change 
and only 3 percent expecting a downturn said victor r lindquist 
director of placement at northwestern and author of the report 
corporate america is confident the economy will remain strong 
despite concerns by many socalled experts about the volatile stock 
market the deficit trade balance megamergers and the increased 
competition in the marketplace lindquist said at a news 
conference 
technical fields will remain the most lucrative for firsttime 
jobholders the survey indicates starting salaries in engineering 
fields for holders of bachelors degrees will increase an average 
25 percent from 29856 in 1988 to 30600 in 1989 
those with bachelors degrees who seek jobs in chemistryrelated 
fields can expect the secondhighest starting salaries 28488 
up 51 percent from from 27108 in 1988 the survey indicates 
but the biggest salary jump will be in sales and marketing with 
the 25560 predicted in 1989 up 88 percent from the 23484 
starting salary for graduates with a bachelors degree in 1988 
salary increases for new masters degree holders will be up 24 
percent to 58 percent over last spring he said 
the report is considered a leading indicator of job prospects for 
college graduates of about 500 companies that received surveys this 
year 242 sent in responses used in the report lindquist said 
the results have a margin of error of about 3 percentage points 
he said 
about 70 percent to 80 percent of jobs being created are in the 
service sector lindquist said but he also expects a resurgence in 
production 
five percent of firms surveyed reported difficulty meeting 
minority hiring goals and the number is expected to triple in five 
years 
the report also showed 47 percent of the employers surveyed use 
some drug testing and 7 percent more expect to implement such 
programs in the next year 
the drug user once on the payroll becomes a very very costly 
liability in time lost lindquist said 
when questioned about childcare services only 2 percent said 
they pay part of onsite day care for employees children 5 percent 
provide help paying for outside child care and 29 percent had some 
sort of referral service for employees 
i suspect therell be a tremendous change in the number by 
the time we make a report next year lindquist said 
companies surveyed include major employers in banking finance 
and insurance chemical electronics merchandising public 
utilities and other industries

austria said monday it will allow the plo 
to call its representative in vienna an ambassador but will not 
regard him as such and does not recognize the recently proclaimed 
palestinian state 
chancellor franz vranitzky told reporters however that his 
governments position comes close to recognition 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
said after separate meetings with vranitzky and foreign minister 
alois mock that he had chosen daud barakat as ambassador to head the 
plo mission 
vrantizky and mock said barakat would be ambassador in title only 
and austrias ambassador to tunisia would double as political 
representative to plo headquarters in tunis 
they said austria does not recognize governments without 
territory but pledged political and humanitarian support for the 
plo 
we will include mr barakat in the list of ambassadors but he 
is not accredited foreign ministry spokesman walter greinert said 
because austria has not extended formal recognition of the 
palestinian state proclaimed nov 15 in algiers barakat cannot 
present credentials to president kurt waldheim greinert said 
waldheim received arafat at his office in the former hofburg 
imperial palace opposite the chancellery 
arafat emerged an hour later flashing a v sign with his fingers 
but did not make a statement and was driven off in a police 
motorcade the plo chief has scheduled a news conference for tuesday 
before leaving for yugoslavia 
waldheim hailed the resumption of the uspalestinian dialogue 
in tunis last week and expressed his hope that an international 
conference on the middle east would be held in the near future under 
the un aegis the austria press agency said 
austrias jews and two other proisraeli groups wrote joint 
letters to vranitzky and mock expressing displeasure about the 
reception given arafat on his oneday visit 
mock told reporters the proclaimation of an independent state by 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo legislature 
and arafats significant speech in geneva to the un general 
assembly last ahad had revived prospects for peace in the middle 
east 
we appeal to israel to react positively to the plos move 
which was positively assessed virtually by the entire international 
community and to give peace a chance in the middle east mock 
said 
he praised the plos full commitment to un security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for solution of the middle east 
conflict the renunciation of terrorism and its commitment to the 
right of all countries in the region to exist within secure borders 
the foreign minister criticized israel for what he termed 
violations of international covenants and fundamental freedoms and 
rights in the occupied territories palestinians in the west bank 
and gaza strip began a rebellion against israeli rule more than a 
year ago 
in the last 1 years the fourth geneva agreement on the 
treatment of the civilian population by a military occupation power 
has repeatedly been violated by israel mock declared 
earlier monday vranitzky promised to support arafats campaign 
for an international conference the chancellor criticized israels 
misconduct toward civilians in the occupied lands and promised 
medical and agricultural aid through the united nations 
letters from the austrian jewish community austrianisraeli 
society and bnai brith said austria puts itself in the service 
of plo propaganda by receiving arafat 
the plo is conducting a hoodwinking tactic by talking peace and 
at the same time continuing to aim toward destruction of the state 
of israel they said 
at the airport arafat said of the israelis sooner or later 
they will discover that peace is more important for them than 
anything else 
israel considers the plo a terrorist group and refuses to deal 
with it the united states began direct contacts with the plo last 
week 
arafat said yes yes when asked whether he would visit other 
european capitals but would not say where he would go the official 
yugoslav news agency tanjug said he was expected in belgrade on 
tuesday

pentagon budgets should be approved for at 
least two years at a time as part of the effort to insulate defense 
spending from political pressures a private study said monday 
the defense department also should streamline its complicated 
procedures for buying weapons but shouldnt do that by creating an 
entirely new bureaucracy outside the four services the study 
concluded 
the review directed by a pair of former defense secretaries was 
prepared by the foreign policy institute and the center for 
strategic and international studies two washingtonbased 
nonpartisan groups that study policy issues 
cochairs of the study were harold brown and james schlesinger 
who each were secretary of defense in the 1970s 
the reports recommendations echoed reforms proposed by other 
studies in the past decade all of which have called for more 
stability in the defense budget as way of making more efficient use 
of taxpayers money 
defense spending has long been one of the most popular areas for 
legislators attention the study noted 
political agendas and pork barrel politics create serious 
problems for the effective management of defense resources yet 
there has been little change in this area to date it said 
the study called for twoyear budget cycles to replace the 
current system of annual appropriations such a move would add 
greatly to stability in defense programs and make possible more 
sound and realistic budget planning it said 
the report also called for unspecified changes in the way the 
defense department buys weapons 
creation of pentagon offices designed to streamline weapons 
purchasing hasnt done the job the study said although the new 
positions have been created they have been superimposed upon the 
old acquisition system without altering the real distribution of 
power 
the twoyear military budget cycle has been endorsed previously 
by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
nunn said monday that his committee will look carefully at the 
nomination of former sen john tower as secretary of defense in the 
bush administration 
tower was nunns predecessor as armed services chairman but that 
doesnt entitle him to any special consideration nunn said 
the committee will have a higher set of standards for the 
entire team from tower down through the pentagons top set of 
managers nunn told reporters 
asked if tower will receive kidglove treatment at his 
confirmation hearing nunn said we are not going to play the 
oldboy game this goaround 
nunn said he and sen john warner of virginia the panels 
ranking republican will insist on seeing the full fbi report on 
tower the agency conducted an extensive background investigation 
following allegations of womanizing and drinking and reports about 
towers coziness with the defense industry 
nunn said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of towers early 
tenure as chairman when former top pentagon official melvyn paisley 
was confirmed paisley now figures prominently in the governments 
defense procurement fraud case 
nunn also said he plans to introduce legislation early next year 
providing for a broad new program of voluntary national service for 
young americans beginning at age 18 
the incoming senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
wants to make that one of the top priorities for the democratic 
majority nunn said adding he expects substantial republican 
support as well 
nunn said he hoped the idea which would include both military 
and civilian service and encompass expanded vista and peace corps 
programs could be enacted into law within two years

a lawyer asked a judge monday to lift the 
suspensions of two white dartmouth college students for allegedly 
harassing a black professor saying the sanctions chilled free 
speech on campuses nationwide but a lawyer for the school said the 
real issue was student misconduct 
this is a case with national repercussions said harvey 
myerson a lawyer for the students both former editors of a 
conservative offcampus newspaper their cause has attracted 
support from several nationally known conservatives including 
william f buckley jr 
the students classroom confrontation with professor william cole 
erupted after the paper the dartmouth review called one of his 
courses one of dartmouths most academically deficient 
jack middleton a lawyer for the ivy league school defended the 
suspensions telling grafton county superior court judge bruce mohl 
that this is a simple case your honor of student misconduct 
this is not a case which involves their right to publish 
middleton said it involves a question of civility which is 
certainly a reasonable concern on the part of a college community 
dartmouth college is a private institution and the code of 
conduct under which it operates is a contract between the 
college and its students middleton said this court should 
exercise great restraint before it acts as a superdisciplinary 
board 
a dartmouth disciplinary panel in march suspended christopher 
baldwin 21 of hinsdale ill and john sutter 22 of st louis 
until september 1989 for the confrontation with cole a music 
professor 
a third student received a shorter suspension and a fourth got 
probation for the february classroom clash which heightened racial 
tensions on campus all four students are white 
baldwin and sutter are seeking a preliminary injunction to lift 
their suspensions testimony before mohl was expected to take a 
week said arthur ruegger another lawyer for the students 
review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from cole by 
telephone on the critical article but he declined calling them 
racist the staffers said that on advice of the papers lawyer they 
then went to coles classroom to give him a written statement 
offering him a chance to respond 
the students said cole cursed and threatened them myerson argued 
that cole should have been punished not the review staffers 
middleton later asserted that professor cole is not on trial 
here 
baldwin sutter the third suspended student and the review also 
filed a federal lawsuit charging they were targeted for their 
outspoken conservative views such as opposition to affirmative 
action and womens studies courses at dartmouth the case is pending 
the reviews supporters include such prominent conservatives as 
buckley and sens william armstrong rcolo and gordon humphrey 
rnh both senators attended a washington news conference in july 
to announce the state and federal lawsuits 
one critic of the paper dartmouth president james freedman has 
said that review staffers are ideological provocateurs posing as 
journalists though he also defended the reviews right to exist 
myerson said the paper has been a thorn in the side of 
dartmouth administrators and suggested that the staffers could not 
get a fair trial from administrators and faculty on the disciplinary 
panel who themselves have been the papers targets middleton 
dismissed the claim as demeaning to panel members 
myerson said freedman by denouncing the review during a campus 
rally shortly before the disciplinary hearing fostered a 
lynchmob atmosphere 
middleton replied this is great rhetoric but the evidence 
of this case simply does not support it he said the college 
disciplinary code overhauled after a 1986 incident in which review 
staffers took sledgehammers to symbolic antiapartheid shanties 
excludes the president from the disciplinary process so he can speak 
out on important matters 
myerson also argued that the suspensions were far stiffer than 
those meted out to other students found guilty of disorderly 
conduct middleton countered that the misconduct may be 
unprecedented in a dartmouth classroom 
saying the editors do not have clean hands middleton noted 
that they taped telephone conversations with cole as well as one of 
his classes and the confrontation itself without his consent in 
apparent violation of state law 
baldwin acknowledged the taping but called it common 
practice for journalists he said that in the recorded telephone 
conversation between sutter and cole cole began yelling before 
sutter could ask for permission to tape

the rightwing likud bloc and the leftleaning 
labor party settled their remaining differences monday and agreed to 
join in a coalition government officials from both parties said 
the agreement came after seven weeks of haggling following 
indecisive parliamentary elections nov 1 that gave neither likud 
nor labor israels two main political blocs a clear mandate to 
govern the country 
the agreement which has not yet been signed would severely 
reduce the influence in a new government of the small religious and 
rightwing parties who had been negotiating with likuds prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to form a coalition 
during the long negotiations the religious parties had wrested 
concessions from likud that disturbed many israelis who feared their 
lives would be too strictly governed by jewish law 
in addition jews from the united states were deeply disturbed by 
a promise shamir made to push for ammendment of the whoisajew 
law which would have narrowed the definition of a jew to exclude 
those converted by nonorthodox rabbis most us jews are not 
orthodox 
the religious and rightwing partie still could be part of the 
new government shamir was to meet with their leaders monday night 
to try to lure them into a broad coalition along with labor but 
leaders of the parties expressed the fear that likud might back out 
of commitments it made to them earlier 
avi pazner an aide to shamir said the agreement would not be 
signed for a day or two pending the negotiations with small 
parties we cannot drink lchaim yet he said referring to 
the traditional hebrew toast meaning to life 
the new government will be similar in many ways to the coalition 
that has governed israel for the last four years an important 
difference is that it will be headed throughout the fouryear term 
by shamir in the last government shamir and labor head shimon 
peres traded jobs after two years 
likud gained the upper hand when it won 40 seats in the 120seat 
parliament to labors 39 the remaining seats were split among small 
parties the majority of whom favor likud 
in the new government peres will be finance minister while 
likuds moshe arens is likely to be made foreign minister israel 
radio said labors yitzhak rabin will continue as defense minister 
officials said the two major parties resolved their last 
remaining difference in a late afternoon meeting when likud agreed 
to give labor the powerful chairmanship of the parliaments finance 
committee 
labor had insisted on controlling the position saying a likud 
nominee would tie peres hands in the finance ministry labor agreed 
to allow shamir final approval of its nomination to the post 
earlier likuds roni milo a deputy minister said his party 
gave in to labor and dropped its demand to build 40 new jewish 
settlements in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip labor 
agreed to between five and eight settlements he said 
officials said the broadbased government which enjoys popular 
support despite its shortcomings will enable israel to present a 
unified front against pressure to negotiate with the palestine 
liberation organization 
the united states last week reversed a longstanding ban on 
contacts with the plo shocking israeli officials who view the group 
as a terror organization 
it the government will strengthen israel against outside 
pressure pazner said monday because it will be a centrist 
government it will be able to launch diplomatic initiatives that 
enjoy the backing of a great majority of the people 
the small religious parties reacted with anger to reports of the 
agreement between likud and labor and the possibility that many of 
their earlier demands would not be met 
last week we met with shamir and he promised us with much 
festivity that we would get the education ministry we are 
incensed said yigal bibi of the national religious party his 
party now is unlikely to get the post 
with the new agreement chances for passage of the 
whoisajew ammendment appeared negligible labor opposes the 
law and likud has not asked labor to support it 
the political program of the new government has yet to be drawn 
up and some hardline likud members already were complaining monday 
about labors leftleaning policies 
likud strongly opposes labors landforpeace proposals as well 
as peres proposal for an international middle east peace conference 
both labor and likud oppose talks with the plo however dovish 
elements within labor have begun calling for changing the party 
platform to allow talks with the group

a man already convicted of one murder 
pleaded guilty monday to the torture slayings of five other men 
whose remains he dismembered and put in curbside trash bags to be 
hauled off to the city dump 
it would be an impossible task so no effort would be made to 
find the bodies of the victims of robert a berdella said albert 
riederer jackson county prosecutor following the court hearing 
berdella 39 pleaded guilty earlier to the murder of larry 
pearson of wichita kan and was sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of parole he pleaded guilty monday to another 
firstdegree murder charge in the death of robert sheldon and 
guilty to four other charges of seconddegree murder 
he was given another life term without chance of parole in 
sheldons death and life sentences in the other four cases 
berdella said during the 90minute hearing that he killed sheldon 
in april 1985 by putting a plastic trash bag over his head tying it 
with a rope and allowing him to suffocate pearson died the same way 
the other victims killed between 1984 and 1987 died after being 
bound to a bed gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers one 
of the victims bled to death berdella said 
the other victims were jerry howell 19 mark wallace 20 walter 
ferris 25 and todd stoops 25 all lived in the kansas city area 
or had kansas city ties 
he talked about having certain dark fantasies that came to 
life said riederer adding that no clearer motive emerged from 
three days of questioning of berdella last week that led to the plea 
bargain in which berdella avoided the death penalty 
he felt abused or misused by certain people including some of 
the victims riederer said there was revenge or getting 
control of these people 
berdella an art collector and operator of a shop that sold art 
objects and antiques became a household name in kansas city when he 
was arrested in april after a man wearing only a dog collar ran 
screaming from his midtown house 
the man told authorities he had been sexually tortured beaten 
and injected with drugs by berdella 
the arrest was followed by days of digging in berdellas yard and 
searching of his rambling house two skulls and a bag of teeth were 
found along with hundreds of photographs of nude and sometimes 
unconscious men 
riederer said that there were 26 or 27 different men in the 
pictures and that all had been accounted for except two 
no further charges were expected to be filed riederer said

a former prison official has been 
indicted on charges he sought political contributions from 
underlings during alabamas roughandtumble 1986 gubernatorial 
election 
charles bryan 60 former deputy prison commissioner was the 
last of four people indicted following a twoyear investigation 
montgomery county district attorney jimmy evans said all the 
indictments related to the campaigns of former lt gov bill baxley 
and exattorney general charlie graddick whose battle for the 
democratic nomination for governor went from the voting booth to the 
courtroom 
bryan who turned himself in saturday at the montgomery county 
jail is charged with illegally influencing the vote or political 
action of people 
he was released in less than an hour on 5000 bond jail 
officials said 
indicted on the same charges last week were birmingham private 
investigator andy yeomans mobile private investigator don bekurs 
and state prison warden jim morrison of elmore county each turned 
himself in thursday and was released on 5000 bond 
yeomans and bekurs were campaign aides to graddick and bekurs 
also worked in graddicks state office the indictments accused them 
of using stateowned electronic equipment to eavesdrop at state 
democratic party headquarters in birmingham 
morrison and bryan were accused of ordering subordinates to 
solicit contributions or make donations to the baxley campaign 
during the 1986 campaign morrison was director of external 
corrections for the state prison system and bryan was his boss hale 
said 
bryan resigned the department of corrections in early 1987 
baxley now a birmingham attorney and graddick a montgomery 
investment banker were out of their offices monday their 
secretaries said and they could not be reached for comment 
graddick led the 1986 democratic runoff by 8756 votes over 
baxley but a state democratic party subcommittee and the federal 
courts ruled graddicks lead came from illegal republican crossover 
votes and they gave baxley the partys nomination 
the resulting voter backlash helped guy hunt become alabamas 
first republican governor in 112 years

said the partys governing council expelled matiba and mugambi 
because of their unpatriotic and antinationalistic behavior in 
questioning the party elections

from parliament and a byelection must be held in his constituency

party members at a seminar in nairobi that matiba had insulted the 
presidency by sending supporters to the state house mois 
official residence to protest the election results

several positions in mois cabinet in the past five years 
moi on monday replaced matiba with a political rival joseph

the bodies of five americans killed in a 
missile attack on their plane by polisario guerrillas in the sahara 
desert have been returned to us authorities the state department 
said monday 
the bodies were handed over friday by the guerrillas to us 
officials in algiers where the sovietarmed group has its 
headquarters 
they were then flown to the us air force base in torrejon 
spain for a forensic examination and will be returned to their 
families as soon as the procedure is completed said a state 
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the five americans were working for t amp g aviation of chandler 
ariz which was under contract to the us agency for international 
development on a locustspraying operation over the sahara desert 
the polisario front which has been fighting morocco since 1975 
for control of the western sahara accepted responsibility for the 
downing of the dc7 aircraft dec 10 and the crippling of a 
companion plane that landed safely after the attack 
the polisario apologized for the attack which occurred over 
remote desert terrain on the border between morocco and mauritania 
saying it mistook the planes for moroccan military reconnaissance 
aircraft 
the united states said evidence gathered so far by an fbi 
investigating team had not turned up any reason to doubt the 
polisario explanation 
but the state department official said the team has not been able 
to get to the crash site because of concern for safety in the combat

ratepayers may have to absorb up to 45 
billion of the 55 billion cost of building the diablo canyon 
nuclear power plant under a plan that was approved monday by the 
state public utilties commission and immediately attacked by 
consumer groups 
the 28year plan agreed to by pacific gas amp electric co the 
commission staff and attorney general john van de kamp will base 
electric rates on how well the plant performs starting with a 5 
percent increase in january 
but opponents immediately announced they would challenge the plan 
in the state supreme court 
sylvia siegel executive director of the consumer group toward 
utility rate normalization said ratepayers had been victimized by a 
sellout by the puc and accused the commission of abdicating 
its responsibility to set just and reasonable rates 
diablo canyon began commercial operation in 1985 13 years behind 
schedule and at 17 times its originally planned cost design errors 
the discovery of the magnitude of the earthquake fault federal 
licening problems and legal challenges all contributed to the delay 
in its initial assessment the state commissions consumer staff 
recommended allowing only 11 billion of diablo canyon to be 
imposed on ratepayers 
in the settlement approved monday the commission decided for the 
first time in state history to base rates for a major power plant on 
the level of its performance the more electricity it produces the 
more customers will pay 
the commission staff estimates that under terms of the 
settlement customers will pay 35 billion and pgampe stockholders 2 
billion that would represent the largest amount a state regulatory 
commission has required stockholders to pay for the construction 
costs of an operating nuclear plant in the united states 
those figures are based however on the average lifetime 
performance of similar nuclear plants nationwide operating at 58 
percent of capacity the utility predicts that diablo canyon will 
operate at 65 to 70 percent of capacity which would add about 1 
billion to the customers share 
under the settlement electric rates are scheduled to rise about 
5 percent jan 1 and another 16 percent in each of the next three 
years with additional amounts in those years for inflation in the 
cost of fuel those percentages would be higher in the years after 
1989 if the plant operates as well as the utility is forecasting 
puc member donald vial called the plan reasonable consistent 
with the law and in the public interest he said the utility would 
have an incentive to operate the plant safely because the us 
nuclear regulatory commission would order a shutdown of an unsafe 
plant 
but the plan is opposed by a number of consumer and environmental 
groups who argued that mistakes and mismanagement by the utility 
in particular the failure to detect the magnitude of an earthquake 
fault near the san luis obispo site would justify saddling company 
stockholders rather than ratepayers with most of the construction 
cost 
mothers for peace the san luis obispo group that has led the 
opposition to diablo canyon said the plan connecting electric rates 
to performance would create a dangerous conflict between plant 
safety and company profits

a jolly benedictine monk and 21 affluent 
teenagers from the northeast are playing santa claus to hundreds of 
poor families in appalachia 
the group arrived during the weekend after a 14hour drive from 
morristown nj where the boys attend delbarton school 
led by former delbarton headmaster giles hayes or father 
giles as he is known they will spend five days helping 
distribute clothing and toys to more than 700 families in 
southeastern kentucky 
when the first caravan came here from new jersey in 1981 it 
consisted of a van with donations stuffed in the back seat this 
year there were two semis and two rental trucks fllled with such 
items as 350 pairs of tennis shoes from a store owner in morristown 
donations from the delbarton school make up half of the items 
going into the christmas basket program sponsored by the christian 
appalachian project contributions also are sent by families around 
the country and from individuals and businesses in the area said 
msgr ralph beiting who set up the nonprofit cap in 1957 
by saturday morning the four trucks had been unloaded into the 
cap warehouse in prestonsburg volunteers along with a group of 
students from creighton university in omaha neb and the boys from 
delbarton stuffed boxes full of food and presents 
poverty in america is off the beaten track hayes said before 
rushing off to wheelwright to deliver christmas baskets 
you drive the roads in kentucky which are some of the best in 
the country and you say poverty in america but you drive off 
the roads and over a hill and up a hollow and you get a different 
picture 
though hayes admits the schools contributions are only a bandage 
to the plight of the families he said that immersing the 
delbarton students in poverty will make them more sensitive when 
they are in a position to do something about it 
the only way for people to understand poverty is to have a 
total immersing experience in it to be present in it he said

a federal appeals court has reversed the last 
of three disciplinary suspensions against the presidents of federal 
employee unions for actively supporting democrat walter mondale in 
the 1984 presidential campaign 
the ruling by the second circuit us court of appeals in new 
york vacates charges brought in 1985 by the merit systems protection 
board against vincent r sombrotto president of the national 
association of letter carriers and moe biller president of the 
american postal workers union 
after a series of hearings the board in 1987 ordered sombrotto 
biller and kenneth blaylock former president of the american 
federation of government employees suspended from their government 
jobs for 60 days under the 1939 hatch act the three men already had 
been on leave from their jobs at the time of the boards ruling 
blaylocks suspension was overturned in august by the 11th 
circuit us court of appeals in atlanta 
the 1939 law aimed at protecting public employees from 
machine or coercion politics forbids government workers from 
taking an active part in political management or political 
campaigns 
the charges were brought after all three union presidents urged 
their members through union magazines and newspapers to support 
mondale and oppose president reagan in the 1984 election 
sombrotto and biller also urged the respective 310000 and 
350000 members of their organizations to contribute to union 
political action committees 
in the ruling issued last friday and made public monday a 
threejudge appeals court panel said the merit systems protection 
board failed to show that biller and sombrotto had acted in 
concert with the democratic party or the mondale campaign 
organization 
it is not enough that the federal employee and the candidate 
pursue the same political goals independently the court said in 
the 26page ruling the two must work in tandem or be linked 
together for there to be a violation of the hatch act 
biller and sombrotto while holding various union offices have 
been on leave from their jobs with the postal service since 1959 and 
1971 respectively

two historic row houses once targeted for 
demolition were turned over to lowincome families monday after a 
15 million renovation that officials said is helping to revitalize 
a depressed section of north philadelphia 
its like a christmas present to me because i was in a 
mustmove situation said tamara fletcher 26 who had been living 
with her two sons in a home that recently was condemned this 
couldnt have come at a better time 
eleven other families some living in shelters for the homeless 
also will be moving into the brightly lit bluecarpeted apartments 
which were refurbished through a public and private partnership 
organized by national temple nonprofit corp a north philadelphia 
community group 
north philadelphia is on its way back mayor w wilson goode 
said during ribboncutting ceremonies monday morning 
the city provided nointerest loans and tax breaks and funding 
came from the cigna corp ford foundation national trust for 
historic preservation william penn foundation and mellon bank 
east 
the two houses that once belonged to wealthy 19thcentury 
philadelphians were renamed the waller house after doors were carved 
through the common wall during renovation 
the residents all of whom earn less than 50 percent of the 
philadelphiaarea median income which totals 17400 for a family 
of four will pay a maximum of 30 percent of their income for rent 
and utilities 
they had to apply through national temple and must abide by rules 
to keep up the apartments or face eviction said judy burrell 
property manager 
i am so excited ms fletcher said if i have to stay up 
day and night im going to try to get things together so i can set 
my christmas tree up 
just a few years ago the house into which she and her sons moved 
monday had been inhabitable 
the front steps of the building had been stolen said henry 
magaziner an architect who helped plan the renovation the doors 
were bashed in the windows were busted rain had been pouring into 
the building the roof was leaking 
a former owner social worker deborah roye morris said she saved 
the building from a wrecking ball in 1982 she drove by one day as a 
hole was punched in one wall and was able to stop the demolition 
she said 
city housing director edward a schwartz said he has noticed 
others taking action because of the renovation work 
a number of people whose houses had been condemned in north 
philadelphia recently asked for a reprieve offering to reinvest in 
the community schwartz said 
thats a sign that people are sitting up and taking notice 
he said 
the trend is also visible in some large mortgages that banks have 
approved during the past six months he said 
antidrug efforts job training improved schools and commercial 
development also figure into the picture he said 
so that gradually the elements that make a viable urban 
comunity are put into place and people have confidence that they can 
stay and move here and improve their quality of life

a sports publication says president reagan may 
become a member of the board of directors of the los angeles dodgers 
baseball team after he leaves office but the white house said 
monday it was too soon to consider such things 
he has not considered any postpresidential matters and will 
not until after january 20 said white house assistant press 
secretary mark weinberg who will be reagans press representative 
after his term ends 
the report in sports inc the sports business weekly quoted 
peter omalley president of the dodgers as saying there had been 
no formal discussions with reagan but quite frankly the idea does 
appeal to me 
federal law prohibits a white house occupant from making 
commitments to postpresidential jobs before leaving office 
reagans former director of communications thomas c griscom 
told the magazine the job sounded very much like something 
president reagan would enjoy 
reagans first job in radio involved broadcasting recreations of 
baseball games from wire reports as an actor he played the part of 
troubled baseball great grover cleveland alexander in the 1952 film 
the winning team 
first lady nancy reagan threw out the ceremonial first ball in 
october in los angeles as the dodgers opened their national league 
playoff series against the new york mets 
after the dodgers won the world series against the oakland as 
reagan invited the team to the white house and told them on oct 26 
in my job youre president of all the people and youre not 
supposed to play favorites but i must confess that after the world 
series began i just knew the winner was going to be a team from 
california

presidentelect bush said monday that us 
national security officials should take part in a review of third 
world debt because of enormous problems in the western 
hemisphere 
the world bank estimates third world debt as 132 trillion 
including 442 billion in latin america and the caribbean 
bush said there is concern that private banks have not been 
lending as much as they might 
and so i do think that should be subject to a major review 
which will include not just the treasury but our national security 
people because weve got enormous problems particularly in our own 
hemisphere on third world debt he said 
he did not point to any of the debtor countries some of which 
have long histories of military coups 
bush spoke of possible problems in forgiveness of debt 
european creditor governments have forgiven some debt especially 
in the poorest countries of africa debts owed to the us 
government could only be forgiven if congress voted to do it which 
is considered unliklely 
some forgiveness of debt by private banks has also been widely 
proposed 
i think you have to be very careful of forgiveness of debt if 
you want future loans bush said so i think weve got to find a 
more versatile answer than simply compelling private institutions to 
write off the debt 
us banks would be certain to question the legality of any 
attempt to force them into debt forgiveness 
bush said forgiveness would dry up the 20 billion in additional 
bank lending urged in 1985 by james a baker iii who was then 
treasury secretary baker will be secretary of state under bush 
sen bill bradley dnj who has urged some forgiveness 
quickly said the rest of the world has known for years that bakers 
ideas were unworkable 
i am happy that the presidentelect recognizes that we need a 
new approach he said in a statement if he is serious about 
encouraging and supporting economic reform in the developing world 
he will have to consider interest or debt reduction in many cases 
as i have argued for six years 
fifteen third world countries with the biggest debts have begun 
reducing them again the international monetary fund reports 
these countries singled out by baker in 1985 increased their 
debt last year by 2 billion after reductions in 1985 and 1986 but 
in the first six months of this year there was a 9 billion 
reduction 
the funds bureau of statistics did not give a total for the debt 
of the 15 countries in its study made available monday in the 
official imf survey dated dec 12 the world bank sister 
organization of the fund released figures on sunday that added up 
to 5193 billion for the 15

king fahd of saudi arabia praised us 
negotiations with the plo and the iraniraq truce as he led his five 
gulf cooperation council allies into the oil giants first peacetime 
summit monday 
leaders resplendent in goldrimmed cloaks and white turbans heard 
an opening speech by the emir of bahrain sheik isa bin salman al 
khalifa before retiring behind closed doors to focus on 
accelerating iraniraq peace talks and supporting the quest for a 
palestinian homeland 
the summit coincides with the emergence of a climate of peace 
in the gulf the end of the war between iraq and iran said isa 
we hope this will contribute to normal relations and balanced 
policies that in turn will return confidence and restore the 
warshattered bridges so that peace may be revived 
all gulf council states supported iraq in the eightyear war that 
ended in august with a unnegotiated ceasefire 
the council was formed at the beginning of that war it binds 
saudi arabia kuwait oman the united arab emirates bahrain and 
qatar in an economic and military pact to strengthen security 
because of the iraniraq war and ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
threats to export irans islamic revolution 
isa praised palestinians waging a yearold uprising against 
israel in the occupied west bank and gaza strip he also pledged the 
councils unwavering support for the state declared in the 
occupied lands by the palestine liberation organization 
he promised the gulf states would help contain lebanons 
protracted civil war and salvage the lebanese people 
earlier fahd lauded the united states for beginning last week a 
dialogue with the plo toward a genuine and just peace for the 
palestinian people the gulf news agency reported 
washington reversed a 13year ban on talks with what it called a 
terrorist organization after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
it is perhaps a good omen that the ninth gcc summit is convened 
in an atmosphere of blissful breakthroughs namely the end of the 
war between two moslem neighbors iran and iraq and the 
commencement of direct negotiations between them 
officials said the gulf leaders will discuss economic integration 
during fourday talks and ways of mustering a united front within 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries to help 
stabilize production and prices gulf council states account for 40 
percent of the worlds proven oil supplies 
their charter calls for a gulf common market patterned after the 
european community but critics say progress in that direction has 
been painfully slow

the government announced monday it will help 
farmers weather a national scare over food poisoning with payments 
of more than 34 million to destroy millions of young hens and 
surplus eggs 
one british newspaper called the crisis the storm in an 
eggcup it already has cost a deputy health minister her job 
government officials have reported 49 outbreaks of salmonella 
from eggs affecting 1000 people but they say many more cases are 
unreported 
the scare burst into the open dec 3 when edwina currie an 
outspoken deputy health minister said most british eggs were 
tainted by salmonella bacteria a form of food poisoning that can be 
fatal in rare cases egg sales plummeted by up to 60 percent and 
mrs currie was forced to resign friday 
the same day the government launched a 925000 advertising 
campaign to try to make britons buy eggs again 
under mondays 346million package to bail out producers the 
government over the next four weeks will buy 400 million eggs to 
burn the equivalent of two weeks normal consumption now unwanted 
by wary consumers 
in addition 4 million hens will be destroyed mostly by gassing 
that number equals about a tenth of the national laying flock 
the bailout will allow farmers to trim their flocks and lower 
their costs 
opposition legislators and media commentators complained that 
farmers had no right to a subsidy from the conservative government 
of prime minister margaret thatcher 
opposition labor party legislator clare short said the government 
had bowed to farming interests without making it conditional on 
cleaning up their act 
the farmers are a big powerful lobby so the government 
responded to them and shows no concern for members of the public 
ms short said 
the storm in an eggcup is a good indication of the 
conservatives instincts commented the independent a british 
national newspaper they decided to protect producers at the 
expense of consumers and taxpayers 
some critics complained that agriculture minister john macgregor 
who announced the payment in the house of commons did nothing to 
clear up confusion over the extent of the danger 
macgregor said that if people boil eggs until they are hard and 
avoid foods made with raw eggs then the risks are very very small 
indeed 
farming organizations said the money to be given in a single 
payment was not enough

employees of a federally owned 
uraniumprocessing plant who still want safety improvements ended a 
10week strike and returned to work monday for reorientation 
sessions 
the plants operator westinghouse materials co of ohio said 
the safety and refresher orientations will take much of the week 
westinghouse spokesman bob walker said production of uranium used 
in other energy department plants nationwide for the governments 
production of nuclear weapons will resume after the sessions 
its basically a reorientation safety sessions safety 
training before we can restart production were going to have to 
recertify people on a lot of equipment so its going to be several 
days before were going to start producing walker said 
operations at the plant 18 miles northwest of here formally 
known as the feed materials production center will return to normal 
after holiday vacations end at the beginning of january walker said 
i think getting back to work is the beginning of the 
solution said david day president of the fernald atomic trades 
and labor council a 14union coalition at the plant we had to 
get back into the plant to help make things safe and to address some 
of the other problems 
westinghouse officials said as many as 400 employees returned to 
work monday an additional 250 striking employees were laid off two 
weeks ago because of declining demands from other energy department 
operations for the fernald plants uranium 
in order to return to work the unions agreed to separate pending 
safety grievances with westinghouse from the threeyear contract 
which union members approved saturday by a 3to1 ratio the strike 
began oct 7 halting production 
for mondays reorientation union workers were bused from the 
plants 1050acre site to a suburban cincinnati movie theater to 
see a film they returned monday afternoon to the plant for 
classroom sessions 
union workers are concerned about exposure to radioactive 
materials including uranium and plutonium a weaponsgrade 
substance to which plant workers occasionally have been exposed in 
handling wastes accepted for temporary storage from other plants 
the unions plan to continue negotiations on a separate agreement 
covering health and environmental issues the contract approved 
saturday includes a new health insurance program and no pay 
increase under the agreement workers may pursue up to 4000 safety 
and health grievances against westinghouse which initially offered 
to pay workers 150 each to drop their grievances 
officials at the 37yearold plant are under pressure from the 
state and a lawsuit filed in us district court by plant 
neighbors to clean up thousands of pounds and barrels of toxic and 
radioactive wastes stored on site 
the energy department has pledged itself to a cleanup at the 
plant that is estimated to cost 1 billion and has begun some 
cleanup work and studies but political leaders employees and 
neighbors are concerned that a longterm report issued last week by 
the energy department recommends closing fernald in a few years 
sen john glenn dohio has said he thinks the cleanup will get a 
higher priority if the plant remains open

fitzwater who attended the meeting initially told a white house 
press briefing monday that it was to seek support for bushs 
forthcoming presidential race but later he said he had misspoken 
and that the meeting was not political but rather was in bushs 
capacity as vice president a standard meeting of the kind that 
we had hundreds of the vice president didnt ask for anything or 
promise anything 
fitzwater who was bushs vice presidential press secretary and 
will be white house press secretary when bush takes office in 
january made the comments at his daily briefing at the white house 
where he is currently president reagans spokesman 
his account conflicted with that of teeley who at the time of 
the bushbakker meeting was working as a marketing consultant for 
bakkers ptl ministry 
teeley said monday that bushs meeting with bakker was part of 
coalition building for the future presidential race and that the 
vice president met with many evangelical leaders for the same 
purpose including the rev billy graham the rev jerry falwell and 
the rev robert schuler 
those things were done every day it didnt matter where 
you were pittsburgh charlotte or miami if you could meet with 
some people who were active politically you tried to sit down and 
talk with them teeley said in telephone interview 
fitzwater answering questions at mondays briefing initially 
had said bush was seeking his support for the campaign 
absolutely you have hundreds of meetings like that when youre 
running for president 
later fitzwater said that was not the correct characterization 
that the only support bush sought was for the reagan 
administrations policies 
in march 1987 bakker stepped down from his ptl ministry as his 
sexual involvement with former church secretary jessica hahn created 
headlines at the time bush met him there had been no disclosure of 
such activity by bakker 
a report sunday in the washington post contained an allegation by 
former bakker bodyguard don hardister that bush and bakker talked 
about a possible admihistration job for bakker 
asked about that report fitzwater told reporters i dont know 
what bakker thought there was no talk of jobs or payoffs or 
anything else it was a simple meeting as the vice president had 
with hundreds of other people and individuals asking their support 
asking his support for various policies and so forth 
they talked about their christian beliefs they talked about 
the robertson campaign it was just a friendly discussion 
fitzwater told the briefing 
bush met with bakker and his wife tammy faye in november 1985 
as he was looking ahead to his race for the gop presidential 
nomination eventually he defeated robertson host of the popular 
700 club christian television show in the primaries the bush 
forces had been concerned about robertsons unknown potential to 
pull votes from the religious right 
besides bushs own meeting with bakker the vice president had 
three close associates whom bakker hired as consultants teeley 
doug weed a sometime guest host on the 700 club who worked as a 
liaison for bushs campaign with religious groups and dean burch 
former head of the federal communications commission and the 
republican national committee 
weed currently works for the bush presidential transition staff 
as a liaison with religious groups 
teeley who acknowledged earning 120000 for his ptl work said 
his work for bakker pertained to marketing and had no relation to 
bush or politics

the widow of assassinated prime minister 
olof palme picked out of a police lineup a 41yearold swede 
suspected of his murder swedish tv reported monday 
the channel 2 news program rapport quoted an unidentified 
wellconnected source close to the investigation as saying that 
mrs lisbet palme identified christer petterson as the killer 
palme was shot from behind on feb 28 1986 on a central 
stockholm street as he and his wife were walking home unguarded from 
a movie after saying good night to their son marten who saw the 
movie with them 
according to the broadcast the source said both mrs palme and 
her son identified the suspect with varying degrees of certainty 
but it gave no details 
after the murder the son reported having seen a man who appeared 
to be following his parents 
pettersons lawyer arne liljeros the prosecutor and police 
heading the investigation said they had no comment on the tv report 
rapport did not say when the lineup took place but it 
apparently would have been either sunday or monday 
petterson who has a long criminal record including a 
manslaughter conviction was arrested on wednesday he pleaded 
innocent but a district court judge found the prosecution had shown 
reasonable grounds to suspect him of palmes murder and ordered him 
held for investigation 
both sides agreed however that publication of pettersons 
picture in the foreign press and the fact that nearly three years 
passed since the shooting assassination weakened the value of 
witness identification no reports emerged of any admissions made 
during interrogation or that the police uncovered more tangible 
evidence such as the revolver used in the shooting 
a scandal stemming from the murder investigation ended monday 
when the state awarded partial payment of a private investigators 
bill 
the amateur detective book publisher ebbe carlsson will get 
4107 of a 200875 expense account he submitted the national tt 
news agency reported 
the disclosure of carlssons private search and his attempt to 
smuggle illegal surveillance equipment into sweden triggered a 
political crisis for the governing social democratic government it 
forced the resignation last june of justice minister annagreta 
leijon who secretly backed the project

hairs that were yanked out of lisa steinbergs 
head were found entangled in clothing fibers of the man accused of 
beating her to death a police laboratory technician testified 
monday 
detective francis callery said he also found hair from joel 
steinbergs former livein companion hedda nussbaum on the 
exercise bar police confiscated during a search of the couples 
greenwich village apartment 
ms nussbaum 46 testified two weeks ago that steinberg beat her 
on her legs and head with the bar 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is charged with 
seconddegree murder in the fatal beating of lisa a child he and 
ms nussbaum illegally adopted shortly after her birth 
another prosecution witness a neighbor of the couple testified 
monday that she heard slapping and screaming at various times coming 
from the steinberg apartment before the night lisa was fatally 
injured 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated household attracted 
wide attention and raised the issue of the responsibility of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
callery said the hair found in steinbergs clothing in my 
opinion came from lisa steinberg he added that for hair to be 
entangled in clothing fibers there is usually some kind of 
struggle 
adrian diluzio one of steinbergs two lawyers said outside the 
courtroom after he crossexamined callery that the technicians 
testimony was irrelevant 
you cant put any times on when the hair came off the head or 
even the circumstances under which it came off diluzio said 
lisa was removed unconscious from steinbergs apartment the 
morning of nov 2 1987 and taken to a nearby hospital where she 
died three days later 
steinberg denies that he hit the girl but ms nussbaum 
steinbergs former livein companion said he told her the night 
lisa was fatally injured that he had knocked lisa down and she 
didnt want to get up 
the former neighbor who testified monday joan bonano said she 
called police three or four times after hearing yelling and sounds 
of violence coming from the steinberg apartment two floors above her 
groundfloor flat 
i heard noises like slapping screaming loud male voices like 
yelling she testified 
mrs bonano also testifed that ms nussbaum appeared increasingly 
battered in the years before lisa died and that by november 1987 
ms nussbaum was limping charges against ms nussbaum were dropped 
after prosecutors concluded she was too badly battered to have 
prevented lisas death

federal regulators said monday they are 
offering to make foreclosed properties from failed savings 
institutions available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities 
karl hoyle a spokesman for federal home loan bank board chairman 
m danny wall said the agency which regulates the nations 3000 
sampls is talking with six or seven cities in texas and in the north 
and midwest he declined to identify them 
hoyle said the bank board would lend the properties in some 
cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens to municipal 
governments which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary 
shelters 
that ball is in their court at this juncture they have to 
decide if they have the funds he said we would like to get it 
done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the 
homeless 
discussions with the cities started several months ago hoyle 
said another effort to persuade private groups to purchase 
foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor 
families began about a year ago he said 
wall disclosed the homeless initiative in a speech to a group 
called the national housing conference on the same day that 
presidentelect bush in announcing the appointment of rep jack 
kemp rny as secretary of housing and urban development said 
his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of 
homelessness 
on another topic hoyle said the bank board late monday forwarded 
to the treasury department the outline of a plan for a reinsurance 
agency that would serve as a mechanism for channeling funds to the 
ailing sampl industry 
the bank boards insurance fund the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp has been paying for a record number of sampl rescues 
this year through its normal income primarily an assessment on 
stilloperating institutions 
wall has argued previously that the fees paid by sampls to the 
fslic as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance 
funds were meant to cover a normal level of failures not the 
catastrophic level of the current thrift crisis 
through monday regulators said they have resolved the cases of 
159 insolvent thrifts this year more than 400 insolvent sampls remain 
open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency 
according to an administration source who declined to be named 
the treasury department estimates the cost of restoring the thrift 
industry to health at 60 billion to 75 billion if interest rates 
remain unchanged and as high as 105 billion if interest rates 
increase by 2 percentage points 
the reinsurance agency would have oversight over three insurance 
funds for banks sampls and credit unions it could collect premiums 
from all three agencies using it when one of the funds got in 
trouble it also could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing 
to pay for the thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money 
congress wanted to spend on the cleanup 
bank board member lawrence white in an interview said the 
proposal leaves open who will pay for the sampl cleanup and whether 
the new agencys expenditures would be counted toward the budget 
deficit 
i dont think it is intended to a back door way off getting 
them banks and credit unions to pay for the fslics current 
problems white said the concept is both a funding mechanism 
and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs in 
the future 
meanwhile the new york times reported in weekend editions that 
the reagan administration in its 1990 budget will acknowledge for 
the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the problem

a member of the plos executive committee 
said monday that plo leader yasser arafats statements which led to 
plous talks were only arafats personal opinion 
the statement could represent a serious policy split within the 
ranks of the governing body of the palestine liberation organization 
in jerusalem israeli premier yitzhak shamir told a conference on 
the nazi holocaust on monday that the latest plo statements about 
peace were a trick and said worldwide support for israel was needed 
to prevent a future holocaust 
shamir said the united states and west europe were deluded into 
accepting the plo and vowed that israel would never negotiate with 
the plo an umbrella organization which includes arafats mainstream 
fatah group shamir says the plo is made up of terrorists bent on 
driving israel into the sea 
mustafa elzibri a member of the plo executive committee said 
arafats statements in geneva explicitly recognizing israels right 
to exist and renouncing all forms of terrorism were incompatible 
with the resolutions of the latest palestine national council 
meeting 
he signed the statement with his guerrilla name abu ali mustafa 
the statement was telefaxed from damascus syria to the associated 
press office in nicosia the office of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine in damascus confirmed that he issued the 
statement 
the statement could represent serious dissent because of zibris 
seat on the plos 15member governing body which includes 
representatives of six palestinian guerrilla groups as well as 
independents fatah has three seats 
zibri is the sole committee representative of the popular front 
a marxist group headed by george habash it was not known 
immediately whether habash endorsed his statement 
the palestine national council the plos legislative arm met in 
algeria last month to declare an independent palestinian state it 
implicitly recognized israels existence and renounced terrorism 
but it said it would continue attacking israeli military targets in 
the occupied territories 
habash later told arafat were backing your efforts because 
this is what the majority wants but we dont believe moderation 
will pay 
arafat said wednesday that the plo recognizes the right of all 
parties to the middle east conflict to exist in peace and security 
including the state of palestine israel and other neighbors 
he also said we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of 
terrorism including individual terrorism group and state 
terrorism he uses the term state terrorism to refer to 
activities by the israeli defense forces 
his statements led to a us announcement that the plo met us 
conditions for direct contact and to the opening of usplo talks 
in tunisia on friday 
habash said thursday the us decision was only taken to end 
american isolation and said we urge our masses to keep up the 
struggle to force israel and the united states to recognize the 
state of palestine 
zibrys statement monday said the statements made by 
arafat in geneva were incompatible with the resolutions of the 
latest pnc meeting and he arafat expressed only his personal 
opinion 
his statements only whetted the us appetite to extort 
concessions from the palestinian revolution and the plo the 
united states is still seeking to scuttle the intefadeh he said 
using the arabic word for the yearold uprising of palestinians in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
we shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights in 
struggling against the occupation with all means available 
including armed struggle until establishment of the independent 
palestinian state on soil of the homeland

has been restored to chile

first trip back to her homeland after 13 years of selfimposed exile 
the author of the bestselling house of the spirits also said 
pinochet is a dictator like others who have ruled latin american 
countries 
im not really interested in talking about him personally 
because hes no different from other cases and is not a particularly 
interesting person 
however she said she wept when she learned in october that 
chileans rejected by 39 million to 31 million a proposal that gen 
pinochet remain in power until 1997 
i believe the silent decision that every chilean made on oct 5 
is an historic moment in the return of democracy she said 
she was in venezuela at the time and telephoned santiago to 
discuss the results with hortensia allende widow of ousted civilian 
president salvador allende we couldnt talk we just cried she 
said 
mrs allendes father was a cousin of salvador allende the 
marxist who died when pinochet toppled his elected government in a 
bloody 1973 coup 
pinochets referendum defeat obliged him to call elections for 
next december he is to hand over power in march 1990 
mrs allende 46 has written three novels since she left chile 
in 1975 for selfexile in venezuela where she remained for 13 
years this year she moved to san francisco 
she returned to chile on saturday for a twoweek visit with 
family and said of her homeland it feels the same like not a day 
has passed 
but she said she had no plans to reestablish residence in the 
country 
she said that while abroad every time ive had a chance to talk 
publicly about chile and condemn the dictatorship ive done so 
i believe my mission ends with the arrival of democracy in 
chile she said adding i believe it has arrived 
mrs allende said she now is preparing a book of short stories 
including material culled from her third and latest novel eva 
luna the book describes the experiences of an uneducated but 
savvy peasant girl who seeks her fortune in a venezuelan city 
house of the spirits which was published in more than a 
dozen languages is the saga of several generations of a chilean 
family living in santiago 
asked to comment on critics who compare her work with that of 
renowned colombian author gabriel garcia marquez she quipped 
this must make garcia marquez unhappy 
she said she is influenced by garcia marquez and pablo neruda 
the late nobel prizewinning chilean poet she said her work and 
garcia marquez share only a style known as magical realism 
which mixes fantasy with reality

libya is capable of producing chemical weapons 
and is on the verge of fullscale production the state 
department said monday 
registering concern spokeswoman phyllis oakley urged all nations 
to deny technology to libya and also iran and iraq she said japan 
had severed its connection with libyas chemical weapons facility 
meanwhile l paul bremer director of the departments 
counterterrorism office cited two reasons for concern about libya 
this is a country which has a longstanding close relationship 
with some of the worlds most murderous terrorist groups the irish 
republican army palestinian radical abu nidal and the japanese 
red army he said 
second libya has been willing in the past to provide very 
destructive weapons to those groups without apparent concern how 
much damage they could do 
bremer in an associated press interview cited the supply of 
sa7 surfacetoair missiles and plastic explosives manufactured in 
czechoslovakia to the ira 
there is no evidence that the libyans have exercised any 
selfrestraint on themselves he said the fact youve got the 
libyans with a chemical weapons capability the historic ties and 
the propensity to turn heavyduty stuff over to terrorists makes it 
a concernraising situation 
bremer said there was no evidence yet that libya had provided 
chemical agents to terrorists it just isnt there he said 
but he added you have to be concerned they either would turn it 
over or use it themselves against another state 
published reports place the chemical facility in the recesses of 
a mountain chain 35 miles from libyas mediterranean coast us 
concern is heightened by libyan leader moammar gadhafis antiisrael 
stance and the countrys alleged record of terrorist activities 
american warplanes bombed tripoli the libyan capital in april 
1986 in retaliation a daughter of gadhafi died in the air raid 
mrs oakley gave no indication the united states is contemplating 
the use of force or would support others if they tried to disable 
the facility she noted that an international conference would be 
held in paris on jan 7 to discuss the proliferation of chemical 
weapons technology and that a disarmament conference would take up 
the problem in geneva in february 
we continue to call upon all nations to halt any contribution 
they might be making to the libyan chemical weapons capability and 
to take vigorous actions to curb the illicit use of chemical weapons 
and their further proliferation the spokeswoman said 
the united states seeking to isolate and weaken gadhafi has 
barred export of american technology to the north african country 
it has also tried to persuade other nations to deny chemical weapons 
equipment to iraq and iraq which were accused by the reagan 
administration of using chemical weapons against each others forces 
in the persian gulf war 
the washington post in a story monday quoted unidentified us 
and israeli analysts as fearing gadhafi may be planning to provide 
radical palestinian or japanese terrorists with the wherewithal to 
launch the first chemical attack on israel or israeli interests 
somewhere in the world 
mrs oakleys statement did not deal with specific us concerns 
but she stressed that the united states is very concerned about 
the spread of chemical weapons and the capability of spreading 
chemical weapons in the middle east she also registered concern 
about a proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region 
the us believes that libya has established a cw chemical 
weapons production capability and its on the verge of fullscale 
production of these weapons mrs oakley said 
she said japan had given assurances that its nationals were not 
working at the libyan facility and that tokyo planned no further 
involvement with a metallurgical plant that may have been connected 
to the chemical weapons program she said japan was fulfilling its 
pledge 
after cia director william h webster charged libya two months 
ago with developing the capability for chemical warfare gadhafi 
sent a memorandum to the united nations denying the allegation

cagnessurmer france ap two explosions wrecked a home for 
immigrant workers monday on the french riviera killing one resident 
and injuring 12 police said authorities said they found evidence 
that may link the blasts to jewish extremists 
they said the first predawn blast demolished a car parked at the 
entrance of the building which housed 97 people mostly north 
african immigrants residents were rushing outside when a second 
explosion minutes later ripped through a stairwell killing a 
romanian immigrant 
the victim was identified as georghe yordachescu 50 a delivery 
driver who had lived there about four years 
firemen said they found written tracts in the rubble from an 
extreme rightwing jewish group called masada the writings 
contained the words islam must be beaten 
tracts from masada named after a mountaintop fortress in israel 
held by jews against roman legions were found last june outside 
another immigrants residence in nearby nice when a bomb was 
defused police said

organization for mondays explosions 
the first blast hurled chunks of the parked car up to 300 feet 
away destroyed four other cars and damaged numerous vehicles the 
concussion broke windows in nearby buildings 
president francois mitterrand condemned the attack saying 
once again the cowardice of a few struck immigrant workers this 
violence must be denounced and fought with the greatest firmness 
foreign immigrants especially those from north africa have 
often been made targets of resentment and prejudice in france 
an employee of a transportation company next door to the 
residence reported we were drinking coffee with a colleague when 
the explosion blew out the door and all of the windows we ran 
outside and we saw that terrified residents of the center wanted to 
jump from the windows 
we shouted to them to remain in the building and we approached 
it to help them it was at that moment that the second explosion 
happened i was thrown 10 meters about 33 feet and my colleague 
was hit full in the head by a piece of flying metal

destroyed and enormous pieces of concrete were sent flying 
some of those hurt suffered broken bones and cuts some had

a reward of nearly 7000 was announced 
monday in hopes of finding out who is responsible for the deaths of 
three cougars that were part of a program to reestablish endangered 
florida panthers 
us rep bill grant said that he and state and private game 
officials hope to raise more money to get the reward up to 10000 
three of five cougars caught in texas and released into the 
osceola national forest in june have died threatening the 
statefederal program aimed at finding a new habitat for florida 
panthers 
hunters have been blamed in two of the cougar deaths while the 
cause of the third death could not be determined said tom logan 
chief of wildlife research for the game and fish commission 
the two remaining cougars are believed to be in good health 
fewer than 30 panthers are believed to be remaining in the swamps 
and scrubland of central and southern florida as their natural 
habitat is chipped away by development 
that is why wildlife authorities are attempting to establish 
panthers in the osceola forest in northcentral florida they 
brought the five cougars which have habits similar to those of the 
endangered panthers to the forest to see how well they adapt 
state officials have no firm leads in the deaths but expect the 
reward money may help said woody darden spokesman for the florida 
game and fresh water fish commission 
we think at this point the only real possibility of getting a 
conviction is if somebody comes forward said darden most of 
the time when people do something like this theyre going to talk 
about it 
conviction of killing one of the cougars carries a possible 
prison sentence of five years and fine of up to 5000

groups wants to abandon armed rebellion and become a political 
party a bogota newspaper reported on monday 
the report in the daily el siglo follows president virgilio 
barcos sept 1 offer of freedom of political activity to leftist 
rebel bands who give up armed revolt 
el siglo quoted sen ricardo villa salcedo as saying the april 19 
movement or m19 has proposed immediate talks with the government 
and that the group wants to disband and organize a party within six 
months 
the conditions are right for achieving an agreement between the 
government and the m19 in the next three months villa salcedo 
was quoted as saying 
the associated press tried to call villa salcedo at his office 
but there was no answer parliament adjourned last week 
in the last two months el siglo has been the medium for several 
announcements by leftist guerrilla groups proposing peace talks with 
the government 
earlier this year m19 kidnapped alvaro gomez hurtado 
colombias leading member of the conservative party and owner of el 
siglo who ran against barco for president two years ago 
he was released after two weeks with a message from m19 that it 
was interested in peace talks with the government 
last week barco told the final session of parliament that 
members of his cabinet have been in direct contact with m19 
m19 made its proposal during such contacts this month el siglo 
quoted villa salcedo as saying 
the senator and barco both belong to the governing liberal party 
rightwing death squads have ravaged the ranks of a political 
party that was organized three years ago with the help of rebels 
from the colombian revolutionary armed forces the squads killed 800 
members of that party the patriotic union including its president

up trying to overthrow the government 
those two groups launched a major offensive last january 
there are an estimated 10000 leftist guerrillas in colombia 
m19 has been inactive for the last six months it takes its name 
from the date of a 1970 presidential election that dissidents say 
was fraudulent 
m19s bloodiest operation was seizing the supreme court building 
in bogota in 1985 the army retook the building but 11 supreme 
court justices and 85 other people were killed

to wear ties to work and that all teachers were prohibited from 
wearing denim

a woman described by prosecutors as a 
golddigger who helped bury businessman stephen small alive in hopes 
of sharing a 1 million ransom was sentenced monday to life in 
prison without parole 
nancy rish was convicted nov 2 of murder and kidnapping for her 
role in the 1987 abduction of small member of a prominent 
publishing family who suffocated in a homemade wooden box before 
the money could be collected 
ms rish 26 cried and hugged her mother when circuit judge john 
michela pronounced the sentence after a hearing in kankakee county 
circuit court 
her boyfriend daniel edwards was convicted of murder and 
kidnapping in may and sentenced to die but prosecutors said ms 
rish was not eligible for the death penalty 
there was not one grain of remorse not one grain of salt in 
the tears of this woman for stephen small and his family 
prosecutor michael ficaro an assistant illinois attorney general 
told the judge 
ms rish told michela that witnesses against her lied and her 
conviction was unfair i just want to say im not guilty of those 
charges and i never was she said 
small 40 was kidnapped sept 2 1987 and buried in the box in a 
remote area between kankakee and the indiana border his body was 
unearthed two days later 
smalls late father was head of midamerica media group whose 
broadcasting properties included 11 radio stations and his uncle 
was head of small newspapers inc and editor and publisher of the 
kankakee daily journal 
ficaro contended that edwards and ms rish wanted a lot of money 
the big score and decided kidnapping small was the way to get 
it however the defense maintained that edwards real accomplices 
never were apprehended 
during the trial the jury saw photos of smalls body inside the 
box and heard chilling tapes of a kidnapper warning that small 
would die if the ransom was not paid the ransom was never paid 
because smalls wife could not understand the delivery instructions 
on the muffled tape recording played to her over the telephone

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
on monday asked the security council to approve a 70member 
peacekeeping force to monitor the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops 
from angola 
the council is expected to give its approval by thursday for the 
un angola verification mission which a report by the 
secretarygeneral said would cost about 204 million during the 
31month phased pullout 
cuba and angola are expected to sign on thursday a final pact to 
cooperate with the force and a final agreement with south africa on 
the southern africa peace plan 
under the plan south africa is to allow independence to 
southwest africa the former german colony known as namibia cuban 
troops are to withdraw from angola and south african troops from 
angola and namibia south africa has controlled namibia in defiance 
of a 1966 un resolution demanding the territorys independence 
the 70member un force perez de cuellar asked for is separate 
and officially unrelated to a much larger force of 7500 
peacekeepers and 2000 military police and civilian administrators 
planned to monitor namibian independence 
perez de cuellars report did not suggest which nations would 
provide military observers for the unarmed force 
but foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez of spain was 
quoted by a madrid newspaper as saying his country has agreed to 
send troops to angola and namibia 
us spy satellites are expected to provide much of the 
intelligence data that south africa insists on during the cuban 
withdrawal 
angolas state news agency quoted president jose eduardo dos 
santos as saying that perez de cuellar is trying to create a fund to 
finance the cuban withdrawal 
in a meeting in havana with cuban leader fidel castro dos santos 
said it would cost about 800 million the agency said 
cuban troops went to angola in 1975 to help the marxist 
government fight attacks by south african forces and usbacked 
rebels of the national union for the total independence of angola 
in a statement issued from their lisbon headquarters monday the 
rebels claimed they killed 13 angolan soldiers and captured the 
northwestern angola town of ucua in luanda province last week 
the rebels said they killed eight government soldiers thursday 
when they attacked a military column in the southern huila province 
and destroyed 12 tons of arms 
one rebel died and seven were injured in the clashes they said 
there was no way to immediately verify claims of the rebels who 
are not party to the ussponsored peace agreement

seven democrats and 11 republicans are now seeking 
the mayors office in chicago but the rumored candidacy of former 
mayor jane byrne did not materialize before the monday deadline for 
filing nomination petitions 
mrs byrne a democrat who was the citys mayor from 1979 to 
1983 had been reported in recent days to be a potential republican 
candidate but her daughter kathy showed up at the board of 
election commissioners minutes before the deadline monday with a 
denial 
jane byrne is not a candidate merry christmas kathy byrne 
told reporters then departed 
edward vrdolyak a former democratic powerhouse turned republican 
who was also said to be thinking about running sent an aide to tell 
reporters minutes before the filing deadline that he too wasnt 
interested 
leaders in the republican party urged me to consider a 
candidacy and i did so as a courtesy to my party vrdolyak said in 
a statement instead i will concentrate my time and energy on my 
law practice and on assisting to build the republican party in 
chicago and cook county 
that left the republicans without a bigname candidate for the 
feb 28 primary 
on the democratic side mayor eugene sawyer named to the post by 
the city council after harold washington died in november 1987 
squared off against a field that included cook county states 
attorney richard m daley son of the legendary mayor richard j 
daley and alderman timothy evans 
though the deadline for primary candidates ended monday 
independent candidates have until midjanuary to file for the 
remaining two years in washingtons second term 
other democratic candidates are aldermen lawrence bloom and juan 
soliz former state sen james taylor and sheila a jones a 
follower of political extremist lyndon larouche 
republican candidates include herbert sohn a physicianlawyer 
who ran unsuccessfully three times against veteran us rep sidney 
yates kenneth r hurst who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to try to 
get the election put off until 1989 and john j holowinski a 
former democrat employed by the citys department of economic 
development 
winning the democratic primary has been tantamount to winning the 
general election in chicagos recent history although a white 
republican made a strong showing against washington the citys 
first black mayor 
mrs byrne was derailed in a 1983 reelection bid when she and 
daley split the white vote making washington the democratic 
candidate he went on to win the general election and become the 
citys first black mayor 
the racial issue remains alive in the 1988 campaign sawyer and 
evans who are black are battling to represent the black community 
although daley has begun campaigning hard for the black vote evans 
has criticized sawyer and said he is washingtons true political 
heir 
the citys population is a little more than 40 percent white 40 
percent black 15 percent hispanic and less than 5 percent of other 
races

the state department which last week opened 
talks with the palestine liberation organization said monday it 
would judge plo chairman yasser arafats renunciation of terrorism 
on a casebycase basis 
terrorism has been renounced in words spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said we shall see what happens now 
mrs oakley declined to comment directly on an assertion by salah 
khalaf of the plo that arafats renunciation of terrorism in all 
forms did not include military attacks against israel 
our struggle will continue until we raise the plo flag over 
jerusalem khalaf known also as abu iyad said sunday he is 
secondincommand to arafat in fatah the mainstream body of the plo 
a member of the plo executive committee mustafa elzibri said 
in a statement monday that arafats statements explicitly 
recognizing israels right to exist and renouncing all forms of 
terrorism were incompatible with the resolutions of the latest 
palestine national council meeting and they were just arafats 
personal opinion 
zibris statement could represent a serious policy split within 
the ranks of the 15member governing body of the palestine 
liberation organization which includes representatives of six 
palestinian guerrilla groups as well as independents 
meanwhile presidentelect bush said monday in a brief exchange 
with reporters that we would not start off by showing any 
tolerance of plo terror and i dont care if it comes from a faction 
of the left or right or the center or whatever i am concerned 
about it i have been and will continue to be concerned about it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater declined comment on 
khalafs remarks saying i dont need to tell you of the 
commotion that this development has made in middle eastern affairs 
and we just arent going to prejudice the process in any way at this 
point 
arafats renunciation of terrorism at a news conference wednesday 
in geneva was one of the reasons cited by secretary of state george 
p shultz for deciding to hold us talks with the plo 
this reversed a 13year ban and dismayed prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and other israeli officials as a regrettable move that would 
not advance prospects for peace in the area 
the first us session with the plo was held friday in carthage 
an ancient city near tunis founded by the phoenicians mrs oakley 
said we have no further meetings planned at this point 
on saturday assistant secretary of state richard w murphy said 
the dialogue with the plo would be suspended in the event of 
terrorism incidents that were traceable to the group 
we would look at all this on a casebycase basis mrs 
oakley said and i am not going to get into the area of 
speculation about what specific views we might have 
at the same time she said the reagan administration was deeply 
concerned about an upsurge of violence on the israeliheld west 
bank troops killed three palestinian arabs on sunday raising to 
eight the death toll over a bloody weekend authorities said arabs 
stoned three jewish residents including a 9monthold girl and 
4yearold boy 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin said the us move toward 
the plo had given legitimization to the uprising in the 
territories 
mrs oakley said there was no way to determine if the increased 
violence was linked to the us decision to meet with the plo which 
israel contends is behind the attacks on israeli troops and settlers 
however the us official admonished israel not to engage in 
excessive use of force on the west bank and in gaza 
zibris statement issued from damascus syria said arafats 
statements in geneva expressed only his personal opinion he 
signed the statement with his guerrilla name abu ali mustafa 
his statements only whetted the us appetite to extort 
concessions from the palestinian revolution and the plo zibri 
said we shall continue to exercise our legitimate rights in 
struggling against the occupation with all means available 
including armed struggle until establishment of the independent 
palestinian state on soil of the homeland 
zibri is the sole representative on the executive committee from 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine a marxist group 
headed by george habash it was not known immediately whether habash 
endorsed his statement 
state department spokeswoman nancy beck declined comment monday 
night on zibris statement

an accountant for a carpetcleaning company 
that bilked investors out of millions of dollars was convicted 
monday after jurors determined he accepted a bribe from company 
founder barry minkow 
norman rothberg 52 was convicted of one count of conspiracy 
taking a bribe to cover up zzzz bests frauds and four counts of 
mail fraud 
the 22yearold minkow who was 16 when he created the zzzz best 
carpet cleaning company in his parents garage was convicted by the 
same jury last week of 57 counts of fraud 
ten other defendants pleaded guilty to various charges 
jurors deliberated heard four months of testimony about the 25 
million swindle that snared wall street brokerages major banks and 
small investors before his downfall minkow gained wide publicity 
as an apparent boy genius in business 
convicting young minkow wasnt something that was easy said 
jury foreman mel tiedemann 32 after the trial ended i had to 
separate my emotions from my decision 
he noted that minkow was just a kid and said i wanted to 
let him go but i felt in my bones the guy was guilty 
the securities and exchange commission a federal grand jury and 
the police department remained involved monday in investigations 
centered on the minkow case 
last year police chief daryl gates described zzzz best as one of 
several local companies linked to money laundering and drug 
trafficking by east coast crime families 
police department spokesman cmdr william booth said the 
17monthold statements are still valid and the investigation is 
continuing 
federal prosecutors say their work on the case now involves the 
more complex securities fraud side exploring such issues as whether 
insider information was illegally used to profit from trading in 
zzzz best stock 
during the trial minkow claimed that he was exploited by 
mobsters who infiltrated his business 
sentencing for minkow was set for february and sentencing for 
rothberg was set for march 
prosecutors said rothberg told a friend at the ernst and whinney 
accounting firm that something was amiss at zzzz best later he 
accepted 25000 from minkow to retract that statement prosecutors 
said

the head of a polygamist clan declared 
war on the outside world when he began the confrontation that 
ended in the death of a law officer a prosecutor said monday as the 
case went to the jury 
a jury retired for the evening after starting deliberations in 
the trial of three clan members charged with seconddegree murder in 
the death of utah corrections lt fred house killed jan 28 during 
a shootout that climaxed a 13day standoff 
in closing arguments prosecutor creighton horton told state 
district court jurors that clan patriarch addam swapp 27 his 
brother jonathan swapp 21 and brotherinlaw john timothy 
singer 22 deliberately chose a course of confrontation that led to 
bloodshed 
house was killed and addam swapp seriously wounded when the 
shootout ended the police standoff at the clans marion farm the 
standoff began jan 16 when addam swapp bombed a mormon chapel 
addam swapp basically declared war on the church state and 
nation when he bombed the chapel horton said swapp contended he 
was divinely inspired to commit the bombing but horton dismissed 
the clan leaders claims 
god didnt place those weapons in their hands he didnt place 
them around the house he didnt load them he didnt take the 
safeties off he didnt put his finger on the trigger and he didnt 
fire horton said 
addam swapps attorney john bucher countered that just because 
clan members were wellarmed did not mean they intended to use their 
weapons 
singer has acknowleged firing the fatal bullet from his bedroom 
window but he maintains he was firing at the police dogs that house 
was directing not at the officer himself 
bill morrison swapps other lawyer said his client has a 
deeply held religious belief in the sanctity of human life and 
cried oh tim why did you do it after singer fired the shot 
but prosecutor dave schwendiman said singer and the swapp 
brothers had willfully and knowingly prolonged the confrontation and 
could have accepted a peaceful compromise at any time during the 
siege 
the confrontation at the farm began after singer and the swapp 
brothers bombed a nearby mormon chapel on jan 16 the ninth 
anniversary of the death of singers father john singer 
john singers widow vickie says her husbands death was the 
result of a conspiracy between state authorities and church 
officials angry at his open practice of polygamy and refusal to send 
his children to public schools the mormon church officially 
abandoned polygamy in 1890

a law allowing political parties will be 
adopted before parliamentary elections in 1990 but until then no 
new parties will be permitted in hungary a junior minister said 
monday 
geza kilenyi the deputy justice minister told reporters an 
11member constitutional court will be set up next year and will be 
the only state organ competent to rule whether a political party is 
constitutional or not 
parliament begins a winter session tuesday that reportedly could 
extend beyond the christmas holidays extremely unusual in a 
communist country 
hungarys parliament has grown increasingly lively this year 
with many deputies questioning the legislatures traditional 
rubberstamp role 
government spokesman gyoergy marosan said parliaments 15point 
agenda includes the 1989 budget and longawaited laws on assembly 
and association that will recognize in principle the right of 
citizens to form political parties 
kilenyi said the law may not be considered until january because 
of the large agenda 
it is part of the governments package plan for democracy 
including laws for a new constitution presented to parliament last 
month by minister of state imre pozsgay a leading reformer 
the law on associations was a step forward kilenyi said 
that is needed to clear up legal uncertainties plaguing the 
government and dozens of independent interest groups associations 
and trade unions that have mushroomed this year 
although these groups are legal as their establishment does not 
run counter to the constitution there are no laws defining how an 
organization can be established what body is empowered to register 
it or who is to exercise control over its operation he said 
a separate law would regulate the actual establishment 
registration and legal control of political parties 
referring to objections expressed by independent groups who feel 
the associations laws should also apply to parties kilenyi 
explained the party law would be directly linked to the new 
constitution likely to be adopted in 1990 
the new constitution will not be committed to either a single or 
multiparty system but also will not declare the leading role of 
any party kilenyi said referring to the traditional role of the 
governing communist party 
still it would leave no doubt that hungary is a socialist 
society he said 
a first draft of the party law is to be completed by feb 15 
kilenyi said but it would not be passed before the new constitution 
is adopted that is expected only by mid1990 when elections are 
scheduled 
among the communist states hungary always has been comparatively 
tolerant of cultural freedoms and small enterprise

presidentelect bush chose jack kemp on monday 
to be his secretary of housing and urban development calling the 
quarterbackturnedpolitician the idea man to lead a republican 
war on poverty 
rep kemp the former pro football star whose advocacy of 
supply side tax cuts helped shape president reagans economic 
policies promised to be outspoken on urban issues as part of the 
bush administration 
i plan to be audacious in my approach to these innercity 
problems of poverty and homelessness and joblessness said kemp 
the new york congressman who unsuccessfully fought bush for the 
republican presidential nomination earlier this year 
bush called his former rival one of the premier architects of 
the opportunity society that we are trying to create 
bush who has now named eight of his 14 cabinet officers was 
ready to add to the list on tuesday congressional sources 
commenting on condition they not be named said the presidentelect 
would announce samuel skinner a chicago mass transit official as 
his transportation secretary 
the sources also said bush was likely to name the first black 
member of his cabinet on tuesday 
that could be louis sullivan a medical educator from atlanta who 
has been the frontrunner for secretary of health and human 
services a congressional source said bush was also near an 
announcement on another black julius w becton jr to be secretary 
of veterans affairs a new cabinet post 
becton is a retired threestar army general who now heads the 
federal emergency management agency 
transition sources said there appeared to be a snag with the 
sullivan nomination that developed after quotations from him that 
appeared in sunday editions of the atlanta constitution suggested he 
had prochoice views on abortion earlier transition officials had 
said sullivan had assured bush during their meeting last week that 
he shared the presidentelects antiabortion views officials said 
the remarks reported on sunday were being looked into but they 
didnt know if the statements would disqualify sullivan from the job 
around the country meanwhile 538 members of the electoral 
college including bushs brother prescott in connecticut and his 
son neil in colorado were casting the votes monday confirming 
bushs nov 8 election victory 
bush asked if he thought he would win replied simply with a 
straight face yes 
his selection of kemp won quick praise from outside as well as 
inside the gop 
i believe he will be aggressive about supporting the housing 
agenda hes not the kind of person who would accept the mission and 
then try and destroy it said new york gov mario cuomo a 
democrat 
alan beals executive director of the national league of cities 
called kemp an energetic activist who has showed a readiness 
to press aggressively for new approaches 
action is needed after two reagan terms bush was told in a 
meeting later with city county and state officials 
its commonly known that housing programs have been cut up to 
80 percent over the last eight years trenton nj mayor arthur 
holland said after the meeting 
thats the reason that youll see whole families as in our 
city showing up in shelters and soup lines so thats got to be 
addressed 
he said bush was listening and receiving everything we said 
well and really wants to help 
kemp who has long advocated creation of urban enterprise zones 
to spur investment in inner cities and has proposed the sale of 
public housing units to tenants should give the hud job new 
visibility 
the current hud secretary samuel pierce who has held the job 
since the beginning of the reagan administration worked quietly on 
reagan proposals to scale back housing programs 
meanwhile congressional officials said transition aides were 
searching for candidates for the interior department beyond the four 
names backed by western republican lawmakers one source speaking 
on condition of anonymity said former louisiana gov david treen 
had been mentioned 
western republicans signaled bush several days ago they could 
support any of four contenders rep barbara vucanovich of nevada 
richard richards of utah former house republican leader john rhodes 
of arizona and wyoming oil and gas executive warren morton 
bush also met monday with lane kirkland president of the 
aflcio bush still must fill the posts of labor secretary energy 
secretaryinterior secretary and secretary of veterans affairs 
asked about energy secretary bush said he was leaning toward a 
candidate with experience in the nuclear energy field because of 
some of the problems weve been reading about concerning 
deteriorating nuclear plants and because of the needs to diversify 
our own energy base 
he did not elaborate 
kemp 53 told reporters he would not speak out publicly on 
foreign affairs but expected to have a voice in the cabinet on 
domestic economic issues beyond housing 
im going to be a good team player vowed kemp who did not 
seek reelection to the buffalo ny district he has represented

about a future presidential run kemp said i havent ruled out 
seeking office some day nor have i ruled it in

their numbers win spots in the emerging bush presidency

of the establishment too wedded to government to resist raising 
taxes said monday he took bush at his word of not supporting a tax 
increase 
i did read his lips he said 
kemp is an original sponsor of the 1981 legislation that resulted 
in the tax cut embraced by president reagan a role for which bush 
hailed him on monday

vision of opportunity to americas housing and urban development 
needs bush said 
kemp said he was thrilled with the appointment to what in the 
past has been viewed as a secondstring cabinet post and said he 
would seek a publicprivate partnership to wage war on poverty 
answering questions on other topics bush said he would take an 
intolerant view of any acts of terrorism by the palestine liberation 
organization which has renounced such acts as the price for 
diplomatic discussions with the reagan administration

world debt although he voiced skepticism about any plan under which 
banks would be asked to forgive loans 
later in an afternoon talk to people working on his 
inauguration he said that as we approach christmas i think it is 
important to note that there is peace on earth certainly between 
the major powers

amnesty international on tuesday called on 
malaysian authorities to release 16 people held without trial since 
mass arrests a year ago under security regulations 
malaysian laws are seriously inadequate to safeguard against 
arbitrary arrest detention without trial torture or other 
degrading treatment said the 32page report on conditions under 
malaysias internal security act 
the londonbased human rights organization focused on the arrest 
and detention of 106 people in october and november 1987 and the 
governments claim they had threatened national security 
four former detainees provided testimony amnesty said of 
torture or other forms of illtreatment reporting that 
interrogators forced some detainees to strip naked crawl on the 
floor or stand in front of overcooled airconditioning ducts while 
they were subjected to humiliating verbal abuse 
others were beaten deprived of sleep pulled by the hair and 
subjected to mock sexual assaults the organization said 
the detainees included prominent politicians trade unionists 
religious and community workers and environmentalists it said 
they were held without charge or access to lawyers and in 
solitary confinement for 60 days after which at least 40 were 
served twoyear detention orders said amnesty 
it said the government alleged in march that the detainees had 
exploited sensitive issues and threatened the stability and welfare 
of the people but that government officials acknowledged during 
october meetings with its representatives that the 40 detainees had 
not used or advocated violence 
all but 16 were released during 1988 amnesty said it considers 
the 16 prisoners of conscience 
the internal security act empowers authorities to order 
preventive detention without trial for activities deemed extremely 
and imminently dangerous to the state and the public while failing 
to give clear criteria for identifying such activities amnesty said 
it said the authorities had failed to distinguish between violent 
activities that threaten national security and nonviolent 
activities that do not involve such a threat 
the organization added that the courts uphold detention orders 
solely on the basis of officials assertions that they have such 
grounds 
amnesty listed what it called pressing reasons for review of the 
security act to ensure fundamental civil liberties granted by the 
malaysian constitution 
it also urged the government to take immediate steps to prevent 
torture and illtreatment

indian prime minister rajiv gandhi put aside the 
affairs of state for some sightseeing tuesday a day after talks 
with chinese leaders on a border dispute and other issues that have 
divided the worlds two most populous nations 
no breakthroughs were reported on the border issue which led to 
war in 1962 
gandhi also discussed tibet trade and the cambodian conflict in 
the monday talks which his official spokesman described as warm 
cordial and very friendly he spoke on condition of anonymity 
chinese premier li peng and gandhi met most of monday following 
gandhis arrival from new delhi for a fiveday visit to beijing 
xian and shanghai gandhi and his wife sonia were later treated to 
a state banquet at which li acted as host 
gandhis grandfather jawaharlal nehru was the last indian 
leader to travel to china going to beijing in 1954 chinese and 
indian leaders last met in 1960 when thenpremier chou enlai went 
to new delhi 
on tuesday gandhi toured the temple of heaven a 15th century 
structure where chinas emperors once prayed for good harvests and 
performed sacrificial rituals 
in the afternoon he was to travel 40 miles northwest of beijing 
the capital to the badaling section of the great wall the 
3720milelong barrier was built over 2000 years to keep out 
invaders from the north 
gandhis only scheduled meeting tuesday was with 81yearold 
president yang shangkun a former senior army leader who took over 
the largely ceremonial state post last april 
on wednesday gandhi is to meet 84yearold senior leader deng 
xiaoping and communist party general secretary zhao ziyang 
china and india are expected to sign agreements on civil 
aviation border trade and science and technology consular offices 
in shanghai and bombay may also be established 
in comments throughout monday gandhi and li said chineseindian 
relations should follow a twotrack policy of solving the border 
dispute and improving other areas of their relationship 
it is now time to look beyond the past gandhi said at the 
banquet it is now time to look forward to the future it is now 
time to restore the relationship between our two countries 
the pronouncements appeared to signal a change in indian policy 
bringing it more in line with that of the chinese india said in the 
past it would improve indianchinese ties only after progress was 
made on the border 
western diplomats said last week that gandhis political worries 
and indias external problems could have sparked the change 
china is improving its relations with the soviet union and 
maintains strong relations with pakistan indias traditional enemy 
on its northeastern border 
chinas strong international position may have convinced new 
delhi to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to beijing the 
diplomats said speaking on condition of anonymity 
at home gandhi faces an election year next year in which victory 
is by no means assured 
li also praised indias position on the restive region of tibet 
which india recognizes as part of china 
the indian spokesman also said gandhi and li discussed cambodia 
but he refused to elaborate india recognizes the current government 
of cambodia which was installed by vietnam after the hanoi 
government invaded the country in december 1978 china supports 
cambodian resistance groups 
india was one of the first nonsocialist countries to recognize 
communist china soon after beijings 1949 revolution in the early 
1960s relations deteriorated over the border question and political 
disagreements the border remains heavily guarded despite eight 
rounds of indianchinese talks on the question since 1981 the last 
of which took place in november 1987 
india says china should return 15200 square miles of territory 
it took in the 1962 war

at least 650000 children died needlessly 
last year partly as a result of the economic crisis in africa latin 
america and the caribbean the united nations childrens fund said 
in its annual report 
crushing debt has forced many developing nations to cut social 
spending overshadowing the progress most nations made in the last 
decade in fostering better health and education for children and 
their parents said unicef executive director james p grant in his 
annual report the state of the worlds children 
by far the heaviest consequences are being borne by children 
said grant 
throughout most of africa and much of latin america average 
incomes have fallen by 1025 percent in the 1980s he said 
in the 37 poorest nations spending per head on health has been 
reduced by 50 percent and on education by 25 percent over the last 
few years he added 
in many of the countries for which figures are available child 
malnutrition is on the increase the report says 
ten deeply indebted latin american and caribbean nations and six 
in africa have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of 
mortality in children under age 5 in 198087 compared with results 
in 197080 
the nations are argentina brazil chile costa rica cuba 
ecuador haiti jamaica mexico panama benin botswana liberia 
madagascar nigeria and togo according to tony hewett the deputy 
director of unicefs information division 
for these 16 countries alone the number of child deaths in the 
last 12 months is approximately 650000 more than would have been 
the case if the 197080 rate of decline in underfive mortality had 
continued said grant 
the majority of these deaths approximately 400000 in africa 
and the remainder in latin america could therefore be said to be 
related to the slowing down or reversal of the development process 
during the 1980s which is a result of unprecedented borrowing 
rising interest rates falling commodity prices inadequate 
investment of borrowed funds and the demoestic and international 
management of the resulting debt crisis said grant 
grant did not include nations convulsed by war or civil strife 
such as angola chad ethiopia and mozambique in order to limit his 
estimate of 650000 annual deaths to strictly economic problems 
the unicef report notes the developing world is now 
transferring 20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it 
receives in new aid and loans 
unicef joins the general assembly and the un conference on 
trade and development in calling for an economic marshall plan 
providing more development aid to the developing world and writing 
off the debts of some of the most deeply indebted nations 
the impact of the economic crisis tends to cloud the achievements 
of governments and unicef which are saving the lives of at least 
25 million children yearly the report says 
vaccines are now saving the lives of about 15 million children 
each year in the developing world grant notes 
at the beginning of the 1980s less than 5 percent of the third 
worlds children were immunized and diseases such as whooping 
cough measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually 
his report says 
now more than half the developing worlds children are immunized 
and many nations are approaching unicefs goal of 85 percent 
immunization by 1990 
china with onesixth of the worlds children is believed to 
have just achieved 85 percent immunization india home of 20 
percent of the worlds infants is now past the 60 percent mark the 
report says 
botswana cuba egypt gambia iraq jordan oman rwanda saudi 
arabia and tanzania have almost reached the 85 percent immunization 
target and algeria brazil kenya mexico morocco pakistan and 
turkey are on track to reach 8090 percent coverage by 1990 it says 
a new goal is the immunization of pregnant women against tetanus 
which extends protection to their newborns said the report only 25 
percent of pregnant woman are now immunized and tetanus kills over 
800000 infants yearly 
in 1980 the world health organization launched a campaign to 
reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea then 
claiming 4 million children annually 
by promoting the use of inexpensive oral rehydration salts a 
simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths 112 
nations now are saving the lives of 750000 to 1 million children 
annually the report says 
an expanded education campaign is now needed to teach more 
parents in developing nations about the technique the report says 
currently onefourth of afflicted children receive rehydration 
therapy and 60 percent of the worlds children under age 5 have 
access to a source of oral rehydration therapy

cold sufferers will get more relief from chicken 
soup than from a heavily advertized gadget that blows hot air or a 
fine spray of medication into the nasal passages according to 
consumer reports 
the viralizer is being marketed in fullpage newspaper 
advertisements as the hottest thing in cold and allergy 
treatments but consumer reports charged in its january issue that 
the device does not relieve cold symptoms and may be harmful to 
delicate nasal tissues which it said could be dried out and damaged 
by excessive heat from the machine 
robert krauser president of viral response systems inc of 
greenwich conn which manufactures the device countered the 
only thing in the story thats true is that they quote the ad 
properly where we say its the most effective relief you will ever 
receive or your money back 
other than that it was malicious defamatory and inaccurate 
krauser said in a telephone interview monday 
he cited a study by the james n gamble institute of medical 
research in cincinnati that strongly suggests the viralizer 
relieves headaches runny noses and congestion and helps prevent ear 
infections stemming from colds 
but consumer reports said the study which was paid for by viral 
systems tested the device on only 22 people and would not merit 
publication in a medical journal 
krauser said the study used 37 people and confirmed earlier 
studies involving more than 150 people 
consumer reports also cited a june letter from the us food and 
drug administration charging viral response systems with making 
claims that were false and misleading or otherwise contrary to 
fact 
krauser said those charges referred to claims made for the 
medication in the spray used in the viralizer and said labeling and 
packaging for the product was changed in response to the complaint 
krauser said the viralizer which sells for about 35 has been 
sold since january 1987 and that the companys 1988 sales will be 
about 25 million 
he said 70000 viralizers were sold in 1987 and of 2000 
consumer response cards returned to the company 250 were from 
customers who said they were not helped by the device refunds were 
offered to all 250 customers and 89 of them accepted the offer he 
said

premier noboru takeshita tried his hand on tuesday 
at coaxing the soviet foreign minister into some movement on a 
longstanding territorial dispute that blocks accord on a peace 
treaty a foreign ministry official said 
earlier japan for the first time indicated a willingness to 
upgrade economic ties with moscow despite the impasse 
rival claims over the tiny kuril islands off japans northern 
hokkaido island has kept moscow and tokyo from signing a treaty to 
formally end world war ii hostilities this has stalled 
sovietjapanese relations and hampered economic cooperation between 
the two countries 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze heading into a 
second day of talks with foreign minister sousuke uno and other 
officials met with takeshita on tuesday to deliver a letter from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
on monday shevardnadze and uno failed to iron out disagreements 
on the dispute during about 6 hours of talks 
the ministry official who briefed reporters on the condition of 
anonymity quoted takeshita as telling shevardnadze that resolution 
of the land dispute would be the basis for permanent and stable 
relations the premier hoped the soviet side would give serious 
consideration to the issue he quoted takeshita as saying 
the official said shevardnadze without proposing a specific 
date said gorbachev has put a trip to japan on his political 
schedule and that takeshita was welcome to visit moscow 
soviet and japanese officials labored on an agreement that might 
boost economic ties despite the row over the kurils which moscow 
has held since the end of world war ii and which tokyo wants back 
the soviets ousted 17000 japanese residents and later consolidated 
their occupation with 10000 troops 
shevardnadze asked takeshita what japans attitude would be if 
the dispute is not solved the japanese official said and takeshita 
replied that the problem should be tackled with eagerness 
the soviets have shown no basic change in their position on 
what japan calls the northern territories the official said 
but he saw hope in the continued meetings of the two foreign 
ministers and their aides on the issue 
until now japanese officials said they expected no progress in 
bilateral relations until the kremlin agreed to negotiate the return 
of the islands 
but in his monday meeting with shevardnadze uno said japan is 
prepared to develop economic relations with the soviet union 
a country he desribed as having great potential the foreign 
ministry official reported 
trade between the soviet union and japan has been hindered by 
sensitivity over the territorial dispute and by national security 
concerns 
twoway trade reached 49 billion in 1987 about 18 percent of 
japans trade and is expected to hit 498 billion this year 
gorbachev has ambitious plans to develop the vast siberian 
region a feat that would require input from foreign investors 
including the japanese 
before shevardnadzes arrival japanese officials hinted at a 
possible compromise on the territorial dispute but a senior foreign 
ministry official said japans demand for the islands return 
remains unchanged

for years priscilla presley has been a darling 
of the tabloids as fans followed her storybook romance with elvis 
and watched her square off with the ewings in dallas 
now in naked gun the latest production from airplane 
creators david zucker jim abrahams and jerry zucker zaz you 
can meet the real priscilla presley a charming alluring woman 
with an endearing tendency to not look where shes going 
its opened up a whole new world for me said presley whose 
clumsy character fits right into the upside down world of naked 
gun 
if someone had told me a couple of years ago id be doing 
naked gun with leslie nielsen i would have thought they were 
crazy 
in naked gun shes first seen at the top of a winding 
staircase a closeup affirming her status as one of the worlds most 
beautiful women she gazes down at an admiring nielsen and the two 
are in love she then proceeds to tumble down the stairs 
i have go to back and see it two or three more times for things 
that i missed in the script youre laughing so hard watching it 
you have to go back and see it again she said 
it might strike movie fans as unusual to cast presley in a 
slapstick role but her lack of comedic experience was exactly what 
zaz as they call themselves was looking for 
i loved the script and i wanted desperately to be in the 
film she said during the interview i was asked if i had ever 
done comedy and i said i never had done it i thought that was it 
for me 
but as presley learned zaz wanted actors who could play 
offthewall scenes with complete seriousness they said dont 
play funny you mean like it happens everyday i asked im always 
bumping into walls right 
naked gun based on the zaz tv series police squad stars 
nielsen as lt frank drebin a bumbling los angeles officer who must 
prevent a corrupt businessman ricardo montalban from assassinating 
queen elizabeth ii while she visits the city 
presley plays montalbans personal assistant who falls in love 
with drebin and helps foil the murder plot 
it was hard trying to get adjusted to all this funniness 
said the actress who played the very serious jenna wade in 
dallas 
in one scene leslie and i are having dinner hes making 
suggestive comments and im licking his fingers we must have done 
it about five times we were laughing so much 
presley the daughter of an air force officer was just 14 years 
old when she met elvis in west germany in 1960 and agreed to return 
with him to his graceland mansion in memphis tenn 
elvis and priscilla were married in 1967 news cameras 
faithfully recording the event and the following year a daughter 
lisa marie was born the marraige however could not withstand the 
pressures of elvis unprecedented fame and the presleys were 
divorced in 1973 
priscilla remains protective of elvis who died in 1977 in 
response to the succession of books written about the late rock n 
roll star she decided to come out with one of her own elvis and 
me 
my book showed a much more human side it gave him more 
understanding said presley who lives in california with 
writerdirector marco garibaldi and their 1yearold son navarone 
anthony 
she originally sought a quiet life after her divorce and she ran 
her own boutique before drifting into show business she appeared in 
commercials as a spokeswoman for wella balsam and made her 
television acting debut in 1979 as cohost of those amazing 
animals 
four years later she auditioned for dallas for the part of 
bobby ewings new girlfriend she was understandably nervous she 
had limited acting experience and knew little about the show 
i only knew about who shot jr she admitted i didnt 
think id get the part 
however she hit it off with patrick duffy who plays bobby ewing 
everyone told me if i passed the test with patrick i was in i 
was a little bit reserved at first i have a tendency of doing that 
but he just wants to have fun if you go in with an ego i think 
patrick will run over you 
she left dallas after five seasons and is anxious to pursue 
her career in movies 
id love to be in the position of a meryl streep or kathleen 
turner she said im getting good scripts but those people are 
out for those parts too at this point id take a part just for 
the experience i have some dues to pay 
and she enjoyed the opportunity to have fun at her own expense in 
naked gun 
all we did was laugh at ourselves she said i did come in 
uptight because i didnt know what had been written about me but 
this relaxed me a lot

bo yang a widely known chinese author 
says his first visit back to china in four decades has left him 
alarmed by what he called the erosion of traditional chinese values 
under communism 
that was one of several shocks bo said he received during a 
monthlong visit to his homeland in november but he added that he 
was pleased to find many people were influenced by his critical 
writings of chinese society in which he denounces authoritarianism 
they said you speak the truth and you can be the savior of 
the chinese people he told a reporter at his hillside apartment 
in suburban hsintien overlooking taipei 
bo 68 was born in henan province in eastern china but was among 
the 2 million people to flee to taiwan with the nationalist 
government that lost a civil war to mao tsetungs communist forces 
in 1949 
his provocative writing has since led to attacks by both the 
nationalist government on taiwan and communist government in beijing 
as a newspaper columnist in taiwan bo accused the nationalists 
of corruption and power abuse in 1968 he was sentenced to nine 
years in prison on charges of being a communist spy 
authorities in mainland china permitted the publication of bos 
works but last year temporarily banned his book the ugly chinese 
and several essay collections claiming they insulted the chinese 
people 
bo has remained surprisingly popular on both taiwan and the 
mainland even though his writings have told chinese that their 
culture a source of pride for centuries has many shortcomings 
he is known for his scathing criticism of the chinese people as 
being too loud too cruel too selfish and too willing to tolerate 
the abuse of power by authorities 
bo says the chinese have their virtues but fears they are 
crumpling under the communist regime 
under nationalization where everything belongs to the 
government people have lost many of the traditional chinese 
virtues such as modesty and politeness bo said in the interview 
with the associated press 
the communist system is more feudal than the traditional 
imperial chinese system the chinese communists have disrupted the 
good chinese values more completely and without feeling any shame 
the author said he was surprised that shop clerks in shanghai 
treated customers rudely and that quarrels frequently broke out on 
city streets he said when people would ask him for advice he would 
reply chinese please have a smile 
bo returned to his hometown of hui to visit two daughters left 
behind in the civil war he also traveled to beijing shanghai and 
xian where he met scholars writers and students 
bo said hundreds of high school and college students showed up to 
speak with him when he appeared at a promotional campaign sponsored 
by a publishing company in xian the capital of central shaanxi 
province 
so many young people seemed to have lost their hope in the 
country he said stroking a pet siamese cat curled up on his lap 
some even boldly asked how the communists could be driven away 
bo said other students traveled for hours by train and bus to 
visit him at hui 
they wanted to hear some frank talk he said they have 
lived too long in a closedup society where few people speak the 
truth 
bo said he met many people including university officials hotel 
clerks and street vendors who had read the ugly chinese which 
was published in 1985 and portrays chinese as selfish unconcerned 
about other peoples rights and unwilling to face their problems 
the author argues that those qualities hurt democracy and favor 
authoritarian regimes 
the book was clandestinely passed around and photocopied in 1987 
after it was banned on the mainland 
i never knew that the book had such an impact in china he 
said 
during the trip bo said he collected about 35000 of royalties 
from chinese firms for his 35 books published on the mainland but 
added that he had to scrap plans to set up awards for chinese poets 
and novelists with the money because the authorities disapproved 
bos most recent project which he began in 1983 and is about 
twothirds done is translating into modern chinese a 10thcentury 
sung dynasty classic that covers 1400 years of chinese history he 
works 12 hours a day on it

thailand is winning the war against 
the dreaded disease leprosy but that comes as little comfort to 
thousands of lepers who are likely to spend the rest of their days 
in colonies as objects of repulsion 
although contemporary medicine stresses leprosy is preventable 
curable and not particularly contagious the telltale patches of 
discolored skin cause marriage breakups clawed fingers turn friends 
into strangers the erosion of flesh means the exile of lepers to 
one of countrys 21 colonies and leprosariums 
but in these segregated worlds thailands poorest of the 
poor smile and press together their stubby fingerless hands in 
greeting profusely thanking outsiders for coming to visit them 
they talk without embarrassment about their condition 
here they are free to share their problems they can take care 
of each other and nobody looks down on them said the rev 
banchong chaiyara a 43yearold roman catholic priest who oversees 
projects to help some 1500 lepers in northeastern thailand 
banchong and others believe that after treatment lepers should be 
integrated into society but given existing prejudices this becomes 
virtually impossible 
in and around this provincial city are churchsupported enclaves 
and a large selfcontained leper community non somboon run by the 
thai government for 1200 lepers and their famlies it includes 
individual homes schools farmland even a jail begging on the 
outside appears to be the major offense 
the network of church projects some of them inside non somboon 
provides lifetime care a kindergarten for children of lepers 
stresses personal cleanliness and a nutritious diet as bulwarks 
against the nerve and skinravaging disease 
there are dormitories for those undergoing treatment and classes 
in shoemaking sewing and carpentry for lepers to learn a trade and 
earn income most residents are from poor rural families 
the oldest believed to be near 100 hardly ever stirs in a bed 
at the old age home her two children both lepers have died and 
nobody can remember when she first came 
one of the youngest is 14yearold phitsamai boorapha who 
arrived several months ago crying in pain and watching the gradual 
clawing of her little fingers 
the other children didnt want to talk or play with me the 
shy girl said 
i dont think i will be cured phitsamai said when asked 
about an occupation marriage and other plans for the future she 
replied i dont have any dreams 
public ignorance about the disease and the disfigurement it 
causes have traditionally tended to make lepers outcasts in many 
parts of the world 
in thailand some buddhists believe leprosy is punishment for 
sins committed in a previous life 
leprosy workers in thailand tell of a patient who returned from 
treatment to find he had been registered as dead by his parents in 
another case parents hired killers to dispose of their diseased 
child but the child was later found abandoned in a forest by the 
wouldbe killers 
banchong says a leper who turns out superb shoes at the 
churchrun workshop probably couldnt make it on the outside 
customers wouldnt buy his product if they knew about his disease 
nevertheless sister mercedes one of more than a dozen 
philippines nuns working with banchong notes progress since she 
first arrived in 1969 she recalls hospitals turning away lepers 
whom she calls the poorest of the poor 
now she says the government mounts impressive programs and more 
are seeking treatment at the early stage of the disease when cure 
is relatively simple rather than waiting in shame and secrecy as so 
often in the past 
i think the end is in sight she said reflecting government 
statistics that show a decline in registered leprosy cases from 
140000 in 1954 to about 25000 currently 
however the total number of lepers is conservatively estimated 
at more than double this figure 
by the time they found good medicine i had already lost my 
fingers said 70yearold naimak jiranai now both his legs are 
gone and his face is very disfigured he moves around on a crude 
wheelchair 
his wife had run away he says and his two children sold his 
house and fields when he left to seek treatment eventually 
naimaks leprosy was medically arrested but banchong said he has no 
other home now but the colony 
when i was a boy i broke the legs of frogs and was cruel to 
other animals of the field naimak said maybe thats why i 
became a leper

this longsuffering nation has 
embarked on a presidential campaign played out against a backdrop of 
surging political killing the winners prize in the balloting march 
19 is a stalemated civil war 
each passing week lengthens the list of dead maimed and 
displaced in the 9yearold guerrilla war without providing 
prospects for resolution of the insurgency either through 
negotiations or by force 
the result is a tiredness of spirit among the countrys 55 
million people especially the twothirds who eke out a living 
raising corn and beans on small plots 
the main contenders for the presidency are alfredo cristiani of 
the nationalist republican alliance the resurgent rightwing group 
known as arena and fidel chavez mena of the incumbent christian 
democratic party 
cristiani a useducated coffee grower and businessman has a 
narrow lead but far from a majority in the latest reliable poll 
arena trounced the flagging christian democrats in municipal and 
legislative elections in march winning an outright majority in the 
60seat unicameral legislature 
one new factor is the political left which is running candidates 
for the first time since the mid1970s leftist leaders acknowledge 
they have no chance of winning but say they hope to drum up support 
for negotiations 
arena citing its own polls says it has the election wrapped up 
but sigifredo ochoa a retired army colonel legislator and one 
of arenas top leaders charged recently that some sectors in 
washington intend to impose chavez mena as president 
arena claims the united states which has provided el salvador 
with more than 3 billion in aid this decade helped rig elections 
in 1984 and 1985 to ensure christian democratic victories 
if arena is deprived of its rightful victory well someone 
asked me if we did not win the election would we resort to 
nationalist guerrilla warfare and i say a frustrated people could 
do just that ochoa said 
the christian democrats as well as local and international human 
rights groups say arena was closely linked to death squads that 
killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s arena 
denies the charges 
the christian democrats popularity has been drastically eroded 
by nearly five years of unfulfilled promises economic stagnation 
and the widely held perception of official corruption 
they have not been able to make any progress towards ending the 
war which pits about 7000 marxistled guerrillas against the 
56000member usbacked armed forces 
president jose napoleon duarte a staunch us ally has been 
diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer chemotherapy appears to 
have arrested its spread and his most fervent hope is to be able to 
personally hand over power to his successor june 1 
duarte 63 contines to work but his prestige and influence are 
greatly diminished 
he is not only a lame duck he has no power to do anything 
said ignacio martin baro a roman catholic priest and vicerector of 
the central american university 
no one envisions peace negotiations with the leftist guerrillas 
before the next administration takes over 
three rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 proved 
fruitless the opposing positions have not changed significantly 
and there is little besides increased warweariness to foster hope 
of a breakthrough 
arena says it will talk with guerrillas but ochoa said that such 
discussions would not be negotiations he added that arena in 
power would propose a national plan drawn up with input from 
outside the party 
ochoa contends the armed forces have had their hands tied by 
human rights concerns and other factors he maintains that 
government troops could win in about two years without restraints 
but the guerrillas have been persistent and apparently have the 
moral and material support of many people in the countryside the 
campesinos even us military advisers here say the rebels are a 
thoroughly motivated fighting force 
the wars stalemate apparently has contributed to this years 
steep rise in politically motivated killings summary executions by 
the army death squads and the guerrillas 
the roman catholic churchs legal aid office has counted 169 such 
killings 90 by the army 46 by death squads and 33 by the rebels 
in the first nine months of 1988 that is a 70 percent increase over 
the same period in 1987 
there is growing frustration in the armed forces said martin 
baro of central american university how are they not going to be 
frustrated if theyve received from the united states all 
conceivable aid for eight years everything they wanted and more 
but still cant defeat the outnumbered and badly equipped guerrillas 
the guerrillas have condemned every previous election this decade 
as a farce designed to further what they say is a ussponsored 
counterinsurgency project 
radio venceremos their clandestine voice said recently 
organized and combative struggle is the alternative to the 
electoral maneuver 
but they have not overrun a significant military post in 18 
months and army officers say the rebels are concentrating on 
soft targets 
the officers say that indicates rebel weakness relative to a year 
or so ago

west germany and france bound by a new 
defense agreement and headed toward creation of joint embassies are 
providing some of the greatest impetus for european unity 
as the european economic community moves toward the removal of 
internal barriers by the end of 1992 west germany and france have 
been pushing innovation in various key areas including the economic 
sphere 
the moves come as western europe jockeys to compete more 
effectively with the united states on world markets and some 
quarters call for a reduction of the 326000 american military 
personnel in europe 
its obvious for all europeans that the americans wont be in 
europe forever brig gen dominique pennacchioni the defense 
attache at the french embassy in bonn said in an interview 
we know that we have to prepare in advance for the future we 
the french and west germans are showing the way that should be 
taken 
he stressed however that west europeans view american troops as 
indispensable and the view is unlikely to change in the near future 
france and west germany which have worked for decades to put the 
bitter experience of the two world wars behind them have taken 
these joint steps recently 
approved a joint defense and security council it will meet at 
least twice a year starting in early 1989 to coordinate virtually 
all aspects of defense including disarmament and will include the 
heads of government as well as the foreign and defense ministers 
created a joint economics council of their finance and economics 
ministers as well as the central bank presidents the council will 
meet four times a year starting in 1989 to reach agreement on 
various economic issues including inflation currency rates as well 
as some foreign trade questions 
agreed to establish a 4200man joint frenchgerman military 
brigade that will be fully in operation in boeblingen outside 
stuttgart by october 1990 it will include infantry tanks and 
artillery as a preliminary move a joint frenchwest german staff 
of 52 soldiers already has been established in boeblingen with 
troops scheduled to start gathering next year 
made plans to open a joint embassy in mongolia by 1990 with 
another one in another country at a later date the embassies could 
be models for future such bilateral cooperation possibly including 
joint embassies with other countries 
the joint military work probably is the most ambitious project 
and the one that has raised eyebrows within the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
i have the impression that the other european countries have 
some apprehensions gen pennacchioni said in the interview 
they are afraid of a frenchgerman leadership 
said lt col joerg schweinsteiger of the west german defense 
ministry the americans british and italians reacted critically 
to the joint military brigade the italians reacted very 
critically perhaps that was a feeling that they were being excluded 
then we explained everything and the criticism went down 
schweinsteiger emphasized you cannot view this as the first 
step toward an initiative that would do without an american military 
engagement in europe the french and the germans view the american 
presence as indispensable 
the west german greens party took exception to the bilateral 
defense council 
a greens member of parliament thomas ebermann charged the 
agreement signals a step toward a germanfrench nuclear axis aimed 
at eastern europe 
bonn officials also have come up with another eurocentric 
defense idea a proposal for a multinational european military 
division of about 15000 troops within nato 
it is a german initiative for another european effort to 
improve defense gen wolfgang altenburg the west german chairman 
of natos military committee said during a recent highlevel nato 
meeting in brussels 
it would include forces from west germany britain the 
netherlands belgium and possibly luxembourg 
the proposal was taken seriously but not everyone applauded 
said josef janning an eastwest expert at the institute for 
political studies at the university of mainz 
the west germans have thrown two stones into the water and they 
want to see which one makes the bigger ripples said janning in 
reference to the joint brigade and possible european division 
janning also said he saw wideranging economic motives in 
frenchwest german economic cooperation 
the french see the west germans have the best contacts with the 
east bloc so the french see its best to work with the germans in 
that area 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany has called for even closer 
cooperation between west german and france in formulating a joint 
european policy toward the soviet union and its east european 
allies 
west germany and france also are developing major initiatives in 
diplomacy including the possibility of joint embassy receptions 
two french diplomats already are working in the west german 
foreign ministry and two west germans are serving in the french 
foreign ministry 
juergen pfeifer a spokesman for the west german foreign 
ministry said the joint frenchwest germany embassy in 
communistrun mongolia is to be open by 1990 with plans for a second 
in an as yet undisclosed country 
these integrated embassies could be a model for future 
cooperation with another country pfeifer said in an interview 
both countries are functioning as a driving force for further 
european cooperation 
the various measures come as a new poll indicates a rise in 
respect between french and west germans compared with five years 
ago 
a frenchgerman poll conducted by the independent polling firm 
sofres said that 54 percent of the french surveyed considered west 
germany their best friend while 67 percent of the west germans 
interviewed felt the same about france the united states came in 
second in both countries 
in a similar poll in 1983 48 percent of the french surveyed 
rated west germany at the top of their allies list while 53 percent 
of the west germans placed france at the top of their list

nick at nite the cable channel that has 
revived old sitcoms for prime time is getting its own new cartoon 
series 
but ralph bakshis tattertown will fit right in its about 
discarded objects that come to life 
bakshi said the concept of tattertown began as doodling in 
high school 
its been in development for 25 years bakshi declared 
its my monster it started in high school as a comic strip it 
was an excuse to make fun of who we are by the objects we throw 
away tattertown is a world where everything we once owned comes 
alive 
tattertown debuts wednesday on nick at night with a christmas 
special that introduces debbie and her stuffed doll muffit 
debbie is the only human in a world where inanimate objects come 
to life muffit becomes the evil ruler of this magical world while 
debbie struggles to bring her back to the real world 
thirtynine additional halfhour episodes will be shown on nick 
at nite in 1989 and 1990 
its nostalgic with cartoons and stuff from the 1920s and 
30s said bakshi who is best known for such adult animated 
features as fritz the cat heavy traffic coonskin 
the lord of the rings and american pop he also produces 
mighty mouse the new adventures for cbs 
tattertown he said has a kind of 1926 style to it this 
is my first truetolife thing for kids my other cartoons were more 
for adults its my first step into disneys world of wholesome 
stuff for kids still i think adults will like the nostalgia of it 
it wont be as satiric as mighty mouse i think kids will see 
those wonderful toys running around i think theyll get it you 
cant talk down to them well have three kinds of music paul 
whiteman whitebread music duke ellington sophisticated jazz and 
hot jazz like fats waller and fletcher henderson 
bakshi was in his cramped studios located in what looks like an 
old motel in van nuys drawings were pinned all over the walls and 
every inch of space was taken up with animators working on the 
celluloid frames 
one of his directors maurice noble worked on snow white for 
walt disney and on various cartoons at warner bros 
bakshi said he was approached by nick at nite after he completed 
work on mighty mouse 
about half the animation will be done at his studios and the rest 
overseas we do more animation here than most companies he 
said we do all the key posing and timing besides my motto is if 
you dont have animators around who can you yell at 
bakshi grew up wanting to become another al capp creator of the 
newspaper comic strip lil abner 
at the age of 21 he became the youngest animator in the business 
at terrytoons he was soon promoted to director and at 24 was the 
studios creative director 
on the side he drew fearless fosdick sequences for capps 
lil abner he made numerous attempts to start his own comic 
strip but he was turned down by all the syndicates 
i quit terrytoons and started my own studio when i was about 
27 he said i didnt know what i was doing the first thing i 
did was fritz the cat 
fritz got an x rating when it was released in 1972 it 
attracted a lot of attention and bakshi picked up a reputation as 
rebel 
im just an artist who runs a studio and tries to uphold the 
rights of artists he said im not a rebel ive had a lot of 
troubles i just want my freedom of speech i want to be able to 
express myself i just want to do my job fritz was a great 
cartoon heavy traffic was better 
he leaned back in his chair im not a rebel he said ive 
mellowed out 
bakshi will also produce and direct an animated special based on 
dr seuss the butter battle book ted geisel who writes under 
the name of dr seuss is writing the script and lyrics for the 
songs chuck jones who directed the peabody awardwinning seuss 
classic how the grinch stole christmas will be a consultant

ordinarily in the story of the first christmas 
the man of the family is subordinated as a secondary figure in 
actuality he carried out an essential and decisive role 
thats the anomaly of joseph husband of mary 
the generally scant attention given him is pointed out by 
episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning who suggests more 
appreciation is in order for josephs heroism 
he often is omitted from our recollection of events of 
jesuss birth or portrayed unobtrusively in the background 
leaning on his staff or leading a donkey browning says in his 
christmas message 
the spotlight meanwhile is focused on mary and the child 
yet joseph guided and protected that family through dangers which 
threatened it browning says noting that it was no easy placid 
affair but one beset with troubles 
the burdens laid on joseph began when he learned to his painful 
dismay that the young woman to whom he was betrothed mary had 
become pregnant by someone else 
being a just lawabiding jew yet not wanting to put her to 
shame by openly renouncing her the account says he 
brokenheartedly resolved to divorce her quietly 
distraught and sorrowing he then had a strange dream in which an 
angel reassured him that mary was pregnant by the holy spirit and 
would bear a special son who would save people from sin 
wild or imagined joseph seized it as real and sure claiming 
mary as his bride when ordered to bethlehem for a tax registration 
he took her with him though it wasnt required possibly to shield 
her from nazareth gossip 
after they had traveled the 90 miles of dusty road and nightly 
camps with her in the late stages of pregnancy they found the town 
jammed with no room in the inn 
joseph finally found a sheltering livestock cavern and there he 
helped mary to a pallet of straw and cared for her as the child was 
born 
later joseph had another strange dream and he again acted on 
it for the sake of that child the dream was that the king had 
ordered the child killed 
rise the angelic voice warned take the child and his 
mother and flee to egypt and remain there till i tell you for 
herod is about to search for the child to destroy him 
in the middle of the night joseph roused his wife and hastily 
assembling essential gear they left with the child heading south 
toward egypt 
for many months they were refugees sleeping wherever they 
could surviving on what he could earn on work gangs or otherwise 
but he somehow provided for his family 
eventually through another dream joseph decided they could 
safely return and they did so making that long trip back to 
nazareth 
there as jesus reached boyhood joseph took over teaching him 
prayers blessings scripture and the carpentry trade 
when a lad of l2 jesus showed an independent streak getting 
absorbed in conversing with temple scholars in jerusalem while his 
parents hunted him for three days before finding him 
joseph the patient carpenter was ever gods obedient 
servant browning says responding to each crisis to protect and 
shield mary and the child browning adds 
joseph was called by god to do what was socially unacceptable 
in taking a pregnant mary into his house he was unable to find a 
suitable place for her to give birth 
he led his family into exile he had to begin a new life 
joseph is an important part of our understanding of the incarnation 
because he helps remind us that god entered into the very core of 
humanity 
joseph reminds us that god often calls the most lowly and the 
most unlikely to be instruments of salvation joseph reminds us that 
our relationships may not always be troublefree or happy but they 
can be holy

christmas services provide an opportunity to draw 
alienated catholics back into regular worship but priests tend to 
ridicule and demean them for attending so infrequently says the 
rev andrew greeley 
writing in us catholic published by the claretian fathers the 
noted priestsociologistnovelist says 
one of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is 
the propensity to ridicule and demean the christmas catholics and 
even when priests are on their best behavior to patronize them 
greeley says christmas catholics who show up only on such 
holidays often are alienated from the church having been hurt or 
confused by it and they need to know theres room for them in the 
inn too 
he adds welcoming the alienated and inviting them to come home 
and stay home permanently is surely far more in the spirit of 
christmas than brutalizing them again

on a day when it should have been 
detecting drug smugglers the us customs services 20 million 
flying radar platform was towed to its hangar for repairs 
the radar dome atop the fourengine p3 orion had stopped spinning 
in flight for the third time in a week this month radar specialists 
inside couldnt produce those snazzy colorcoded displays on their 
computer screens designating friendly and suspect planes more than 
200 miles away 
as the plane inched down the flight line to customs spanking new 
45 million hangar the agencys war against airborne and seagoing 
drug smugglers also slowed down 
for the customs service air branch generally and the 
surveillance unit based here on the gulf of mexico this can be the 
best and worst of times 
less than a decade ago customs fliers felt like world war i 
aviators bouncing around in light singleengine planes using 
binoculars to spot the enemy 
but rep glenn english dokla and sen dennis deconcini 
dariz wanted a real customs air force and while many federal 
agencies retrenched the air interdiction program shot up like an 
adolescent child 
there are 88 customs airplanes now including detection aircraft 
trackers interceptors and helicopters carrying officers ready to 
swoop down and make an arrest 
the program that employed 153 people in 1981 and cost 273 
million now has a 165 million budget and 811 employees 
but expansion has brought severe growing pains as equipment has 
broken down sometimes because it is too old and sometimes because 
it is too new 
failures have plagued all seven airplanes here at corpus christi 
where the mission is the weakest link in stopping drug smuggling 
detecting smugglers planes and boats and sorting them from the pack 
were looking for one little guy among hundreds said stanley 
adams an air branch chief and pilot in corpus christi weve 
caught most of the idiots now were up against the smart ones they 
do have the edge now but its a start 
at the top of the detection pyramid is the new p3 airborne early 
warning flying radar platform lockheed which designed the plane 
for antisubmarine warfare and detection modified it to include the 
24foot spinning radar dome atop the fuselage 
tied to a general electric radar used by the military the plane 
has capabilities similar to an air force airborne warning and 
control awacs aircraft the p3 has done well when working adams 
said and in one crucial test near colombia it spotted virtually 
all aircraft taking off from a known drugproducing region 
but during a weeklong visit by a reporter the dome would stop 
spinning when the planes speed reached 200 knots and it had to be 
taken out of service while uneasy lockheed experts tried to find the 
problem 
they want to do dog and pony shows but the bugs are not worked 
out yet said one customs air crewman who insisted on anonymity 
they shoved it out of the factory too quick 
added another crewman it was a political move instead of 
working out all the bugs they put it on the market 
the early warning radar isnt the only problem plaguing the 
surveillance unit 
crewmen said the main radar in four p3s used for detection and 
longrange tracking of smugglers has failed often an event 
witnessed by a reporter 
the radar was built for an f15 air superiority plane an air 
force jet that stays in the air an average of one hour and 20 
minutes but during p3 flights of six and even 12 hours the radars 
guidance system goes haywire giving operators false readings of 
planes and boats traveling 800 miles an hour 
customs crews said that in an intense 10day mission in the 
caribbean earlier this year the guidance system on one p3 was not 
functioning about threequarters of the time even though the 
equipment was replaced twice during the operation 
a reporter also witnessed the radar fail in one of customs two 
twinengine e2c hawkeyes a surveillance plane built for aircraft 
carrier duty in the navy 
a dome radar aircraft with limited range the customs e2c 
experienced a failure of its detector processor the radars 
computer that tracks other airplanes 
the two hawkeyes given to customs by the navy have had so many 
carrier landings they are ready for the boneyard according to 
one crewman who flies in them often 
these failures are significant because customs commissioner 
william von raab estimated that only 5 percent of the drug smuggling 
planes flying over the southwestern border from texas to california 
are apprehended detection also is poor in the gulf of mexico but 
it is near 25 percent south of florida 
von raab predicted that when customs can apprehend onequarter of 
the smuggler aircraft drug pilots will think twice about the risk 
that has happened near florida many smugglers changed tactics 
dropping their loads to small boats rather than fly near the us 
mainland 
when all the equipment is working the surveillance planes here 
fly only about 12 hours a day giving smugglers a free ride half the 
time 
despite such problems customs officials crewmen and lawmakers 
believe the air detection system will be an effective weapon when 
its finally in place perhaps by 1991 
customs is scheduled to receive another airborne early warning p3 
next april and has proposed an eventual fleet of four

the airplanes will be supplemented by a system of tethered radar 
balloons in the southeast the gulf of mexico and all along the 
southwestern border called aerostats the balloons fly 10000 feet 
above the surface and provide coverage at lower altitudes where 
drug smugglers usually fly 
only four of 17 planned aerostats are now operational funds have 
so far been approved for only eight more 
once we reach 1991 if we have the aerostats in place and 
receive the kind of support we anticipate from the military we will 
have a very effective shield said english thats not to say 
this will be the answer to the war on drugs this does not mean 
drugs wont come in but it will be far more expensive dangerous 
and difficult 
once the aerostat radar shield is operating from florida to 
california the p3 flying detection platforms will come into their 
own these aircraft can see 360 degrees around and 200 miles away 
radar specialists at two computer terminals inside can bring up 
displays by simply touching their screens 
as airplanes appear as small squares the operator assesses their 
speed altitude course and other data and assigns them colors 
green for friendly yellow for unknown and red for hostile 
the surveillance branch in corpus christi says 75 arrests 
resulted from its detection program from july last year through 
september of 1988 
the single p3 aew has operated only since july and 15 of the 
arrests have been made since then 
in the 14month period 30 land vehicles or boats and 17 
airplanes were seized and five of the aircraft were taken since the 
p3 detection platform has been flying 
the entire air branch reported 438 arrests in fiscal 1988 up 
from 250 in 1987 and 167 in 1986 also in fiscal 1988 71 airplanes 
176 vehicles and 22 boats were seized 
the p3 detection platforms will eventually fly mostly defense 
in depth missions according to customs officials 
a concept already tested at least four times successfully 
customs aircraft would fly long hours off the coast of producer 
countries such as colombia and observe virtually every air departure 
from a known drug region this would make it far easier to sort 
suspicious from legitimate aircraft one of the most difficult jobs 
now facing the surveillance unit 
in the first such endurance test off colombia the detection rate 
was regarded as phenomenal and the deterrent was so strong that 
smugglers stopped flying once they realized something was amiss 
the best hunting ive had one radar operator said of the 
three customs service and one coast guard aircraft that flew in 
shifts for 16 hours a day 
adams the surveillance unit air branch chief said that without 
such operations the surveillance unit is reduced to playing a 
chess game in the air 
its really hard to be in the right place at the right time 
said radar operator buck benham as he scanned the skies on his 
radar scope in one of the four p3 trackers without the sophisticated 
dome 
instead of chasing airborne suspects benham was trying to take 
over the dome planes detection job which he likened to flying 
around with a flashlight 
customs can count on little help from countries south of the 
border only two countries provide timely assistance according to 
aircrews the dominican republic which will launch a military 
aircraft on request and the bahamas which places officers on 
usflown helicopters 
crewmen said it is difficult to gain cooperation from mexico 
calls for assistance in chasing boats and planes have to be routed 
through the federal government in washington and the process can 
take four hours in that time smugglers often dump their loads or 
land south of the border

editors note the future is for better or worse unknowable 
but thats never prevented enthusiastic prophets soothsayers and

a new year arrives thats only a short jump from a new millennium

think of the years as numbers changing in a speedometer and we 
can begin the countdown now 
yesterday the last day of 1988 flipped over to 1989 today and 
the last march of the nines began next year a nine will move over 
be replaced by a zero and the total will read 1990 
and before we know it in the steadily rising speed of subjective 
time there will be three nines and then the days will roll up and 
out and the weeks will roll up and out and the months will roll up 
and out and finally in a single moment of breathless magic a zero 
will come up for the year another zero for the decade a third zero 
for the century and with one to carry to be carried oh so 
carefully we will have a whole new millennium in the life of 
humankind 
there in the big roll of nines and zeros will come the ultimate 
for lovers of symmetrical milestones the first day of a new year a 
new decade a new century a new millennium it is a calendar 
combination prophets and prognosticators cant resist they are 
already busy 
in their latest crystal balls they see a century in which the 
deaf will hear and the lame will walk most americans will be 
descended from noneuropeans more than four million new jobs will 
have to be found for people replaced by robots that never tire eat 
get paid or join unions 
they see a time when the life span will be stretched to 150 years 
and the divorce rate will zoom because who can look at the same 
husband for more than 100 years a time when computer networks will 
match a liver donor in duluth with a patient in dusseldorf when 
businessmen conferring by television continents apart will be able 
to see each other talk sell argue exchange contracts and baby 
pictures when cars will be fully computerized and after centuries 
of frustration by horse camel and raft a man finally will be able 
to answer the eternal question daddy when will we be there 
a time of scary scientific discovery especially in genetic 
engineering when society will have to deal with the questions of 
whether man is ready to play god and is god ready to let him 
who will prevail among the soothsayers the prophets of a bright 
new world or the seers of doom and gloom in that trade history 
indicates that the optimists and the pessimists run about 
neckandneck 
so far the meek have not inherited the earth but neither has 
big brother the year 1984 came and went without 1984 the grim 
scenario of an ultratotalitarian state by george orwell freedom 
stirs in china mikhail gorbachev sits in stalins office in moscow 
the world has not exploded in a nuclear armageddon and the 
planet is alive if not well the 20th century has improved the 
health of humans more than all the previous centuries combined but 
it has not been kind to the planet unlike all the centuries that 
passed before the 21st will inherit tons of manmade nuclear wastes 
which will remain dangerously radioactive for 280000 years 
a hundred years ago the prophets were predicting that technology 
would cure most of societys ills now theyre wondering how society 
will survive technology 
in the hot summer of 1988 the experts warned that a severe 
greenhouse effect may be awaiting us in the next century that 
carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere from the vast burning of oil 
and coal below could heat the earth melt glaciers raise sea 
levels parch the middle of the globe and produce bumper crops in 
canada and siberia 
in the same hot summer of 1988 ronald reagan and mikhail 
gorbachev told us in moscow that their two governments and others 
would try to plan cooperatively for changes in climate could it 
come to pass that the cold war may one day end because the 
superpowers will fear the changing earth more than each other 
no area of human prophecy has produced worse batting averages 
than the question of war or peace the most recent to step up to the 
plate was edward c aldridge air force secretary unveiling the new 
stealth bomber he predicted we are ushering in a new age of 
strategic deterrence 
about 200 years ago thomas jefferson thought that submarines 
when invented would prove so devastating they would prevent wars 
victor hugo in 1842 predicted balloons would end war so by turn 
would the machine gun the tank the airplane and the atom bomb 
humans will live very differently but human nature is likely to 
remain as it has since the cave man unchanged and unevolving 
notes timothy willard editor of the futurist magazine human 
ability to solve problems has improved but human ingenuity will 
continue to embrace both the constructive and destructive

willard and others preoccupied with the future think that small 
wars are more likely than big wars in the next century they think 
that terrorists from the countless ranks of the havenots are more 
apt to create world tension than the major powers that hunger is 
more likely to bring war than ideology 
for most other people bursting technology will provide a new 
world in the new century according to marvin cetron arthur c 
clarke john diebold isaac asimov and other diviners of the future 
in fact and fiction we may expect 
homes and places of work will be computerized robotized and if 
were not careful completely homogenized automated housekeepers 
will heat cool ventilate dust vacuum wash and take out the 
garbage at the press of a button or voice command mood makers will 
provide music wind noises thunder cracks and filmed images on the 
wall of a crackling fire falling snow or pelting rain 
appliances will hear and unless choked talk at the moment 
though in this century talking machines are not selling buyer 
resistance 
my husband talks back to me said one shopper my kids talk 
back to me i dont want my dryer talking back to me 
designers however are not giving up they think the next 
generation of consumers now growing up with talking computers in 
school will be less intimidated by babbling machines 
with small highspeed computers for brains with tv cameras for 
eyes hydraulic manipulators for arms and grippers for hands robots 
will take over much of the heavy dangerous or dull work now 
performed by men and women they already hobnob with radioactive 
reactors visit the bottoms of deep mine shafts explore ocean 
bottoms and defuse explosives 
homo mechanicus also paints welds grinds mills cuts runs a 
lathe and drill press works on appliances autos and planes without 
a coffee break says cetron a robot now in the works will be able 
to return wrenches scattered on a workbench to a rack on the wall 
japan now leads the world in the production of robots one of the 
latest from nippon is called king kong lt picks up a hospital 
patient places him or her in the bathtub and then returns himher 
to bed freshly bathed 
it is hard to picture more national change than our century 
produced nations rose and fell disappeared and reappeared empires 
and ideologies spread and shrank 
but change there will be by 2100 the population of the world is 
expected to double from 49 billion to 104 billion the poorest 
nations will have the most people in africa asia and latin 
america and the richest will have a hard time enjoying their dinner 
the developed countries will drop from a quarter to a seventh 
share of the world population the united states will drop from 
fourth to seventh in population rank behind india china nigeria 
the soviet union indonesia and pakistan the us share of 
something called the gross world product will drop from 22 percent 
to 10 percent but at that the united states and japan will have 
the largest slices 
following cheaper labor not the sun the hong kong shirtmaker 
who took business away from the united states and europe will lose 
it to the mexicans and thais who will then lose it to the 
bangladeshi and egyptians so says marvin cetron 
economically the center of gravity of western civilization 
will shift from the united states and europe to the united states 
and the pacific us trade with asia will double that with europe 
stripped of empire europes share of world commerce has already 
shrunk to a fraction of what it was in 1900 
in the quickening march of medicine and science we are told the 
blind will see better paraplegics will step from their wheelchairs 
new drugs will dissolve blood clots and prevent or reduce heart 
disease ulcers cholesterol buildup hardening of the arteries 
hepatitis and some forms of cancer 
human tissue farms will provide everything from single cells 
to lungs and hearts and transplants will become as common as 
tonsillectomies unless stopped gene tinkerers will slow down the 
aging process and make possible blond blueeyed babies on demand 
ln that brave new world with controlled drugs and hormonal 
manipulation basketball players will be 6 inches taller and baskets 
will have to be raised baseball pitchers will throw harder batters 
will hit longer and outfield fences will have to be moved back 
maybe as much as 100 feet

editors note the island of madagascar split from the african 
mainland more than 150 million years ago and went on its own 
evolutionary course but the islands many animals and plants which 
are found no place else in the world are now threatened with 
extinction by the encroachment of man as smoke continues to rise 
from the dwindling forests environmental groups are digging in to 
do battle

this island off the east african coast 
is to todays naturalists what the galapagos islands off south 
america were to charles darwin a study in evolution 
but the islands unique and diverse plant and animal life is 
under grave threat as man continues to torch the forest to clear the 
land in what one newspaper calls a kind of national pyromania 
as a result heading off the destruction of madagascars fragile 
habitat has become the premier goal of many international 
environmental groups 
after madagascar split from the african mainland more than 150 
million years ago its plants and animals went on their own 
evolutionary course 
some became extinct like the pygmy hippopotamus elephant bird 
and giant lemurs 
there was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very 
very few ancestors says dr martin nicoll a zoologist who 
represents the world wildlife fund here madagascar lets you look 
at the limits of adaptability 
you can make really nice biological comparisons what do plants 
have to do for example to live in a desert 
madagascars terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to 
desert 
ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the 
226658square mile island are found nowhere else from the lovable 
lemurs to hundreds of species of orchids and more than 350 species 
of amphibians and reptiles 
there are 29 species of lemurs primates whose name comes from 
the latin word for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits 
the closest living descendants of the common ancestor of humans 
monkeys and apes lemurs were displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the 
world here they had a chance to survive in isolation 
madagascars equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an 
ayeaye it detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its 
sharp ears and then uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull 
them out 
the largest lemur is the indri a blackandwhite creature that 
weighs about 15 pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from 
treetop to treetop 
the indris whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds 
emitted by great whales are the main attraction for the small but 
growing number of tourists who visit this small reserve about 60 
miles east of the capital of antananarivo 
a short walk through a rain forest led by a guide inevitably 
turns up a family of the indris staring down with their teddy 
bearlike faces bemused but not much interested in their visitors 
the humans whose slashandburn agricultural methods now 
threaten wildlife and the nations watershed are late arrivals 
coming from africa and the malay archipelago only 1500 years ago 
fourteen species of lemurs have become extinct since humans arrived 
and ecologists fear others are in danger of joining them 
the islands population has more than doubled since 1950 and now 
exceeds 11 million farmers are so desperate for land they are 
felling trees on 70degree slopes fourfifths of the islands land 
is barren and its forests have been reduced by half in the past 
three decades 
the governments agriculture department long encouraged farmers 
to cut trees and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops 
the savanna is burned to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10 
million zebu cattle 
in the west and in the east not far from the capital the 
fires continue to burn says us ambassador patricia gates lynch 
sometimes you see the smoke trapped right here in the city 
the government and environmental organizations are working 
together now to discourage slashandburn land clearing though the 
education process is slow 
its primarily a human problem says prime minister victor 
ramahatra we must teach people that the natural environment is 
their principal source of wealth

the government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a 
1975 socialist revolution and now follows the advice of western 
donors on economic policy but a us embassy economic report says 
no economic reforms will work in the long run without corrective 
action against madagascars single greatest selfinflicted problem 
the destruction of its environment 
the government also has broken out of the virtual selfimposed 
isolation since president didier ratsiraka came to power in 1975 
nicoll says the government has cooperated with environmental 
groups since the end of 1985 it is our no 1 conservation 
priority he says 
a recent issue of the daily newspaper midi said an average of 37 
million acres of land was being burned each year midi an 
independent journal likened the the burning to national 
pyromania 
some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their 
displeasure with the steady decline in the nations economy since 
the revolution per capita income declined 24 percent between 1979 
and 1983 
the denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional 
cyclones great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion the 
indian ocean north of the island is red from the red clay soil 
washed out to sea 
the world bank is organizing an international effort to halt the 
degradation which it estimates will cost from 300 million to 400 
million over the next 15 to 20 years 
already 11 major projects aided by western environmental groups 
universities and governments are under way they include efforts to 
save existing reserves and plans to create new reserves or national 
parks 
nicoll whose wwf is managing projects covering 10 reserves says 
efforts have to take into consideration the needs of the people who 
live nearby 
the people dont want to cut down the forest just because its 
there says yale university anthropologist elearnor sterling who 
is studying the ayeaye they truly need the wood for firewood or 
for land for agriculture many of them understand the problems in 
the environment and would like to do something to help but they have 
to feed their children 
nicoll says the success of the perinet reserve proves people can 
be persuaded to change 
i was there in 1985 during my first longterm stay in 
madagascar he says when youd go into the reserve youd meet 
people walking along with an ax just about every day youd hear the 
chop chop of an ax you never hear that now tourism has done that 
tourism has put that place into a sort of protected status nobody 
would dare go in there now with an ax 
western organizations are pushing tourism which up to now only 
brings a few thousand people to the island many of them bird 
watchers or naturalists 
ambassador lynch whose government is a major backer of 
conservation projects says i think were on the right track but 
time is passing very quickly and the forests are burning fast

editors note he was deformed at birth and when he was 2 his 
legs were amputated up to the pelvis but kenny easterday 15 
thumbs his nose at his handicap and ignores the stares of strangers 
preferring to walk on his hands rather than ride in a wheelchair 
his spunk inspired a frenchcanadian filmmaker to make a movie about 
his life called kid brother 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fifteenyearold kenny easterday knows the 
sight of a 2foottall boy with half a body walking on his hands or 
zooming down the street on a skateboard causes heads to turn 
kennys been stared at for so long friends say he gets perturbed 
if people fail to notice him 
its part of his cockiness part of what has helped him to 
survive 
kenny calls it his style a tough spunky veneer to protect 
the kid inside him who has been poked prodded inspected and 
rejected all his life he insists by example more than words 
that hes no different from any other teenage boy 
i like tornup shirts jean jackets with holes in them long 
hair earrings and hardrock music and getting in trouble he 
says his straight brown hair hanging limply over the collar of his 
denim jacket 
kenny walks on long calloused hands instead of using a 
wheelchair as if to prove he can be faster and tougher than people 
without disabilities he refuses to wear a prosthesis insisting it 
hampers his mobility while only serving to make his appearance more 
acceptable to the public 
kenny was born dec 7 1973 with mangled legs and sacral 
agenesis a disease that left a gap between the upper part of his 
body and pelvis and legs 
his backbone incomplete at birth was reformed in an operation 
when he was 6 months old before he was 2 his legs were amputated 
up to his pelvis reducing him to a height of about 2 feet 
despite appearances there is little kenny cant do or at least 
doesnt think he can do 
he almost purposefully ignores questions focusing on the handicap 
but quickly answers those generic to teenagers 
ask him for instance about the two rhinestones in his left ear 
and hell proudly boast about how he pierced his ears himself 
ask him what kind of music he likes and hell proffer a host of 
rap and hardrock groups i like motley crue acdc black 
sabbath bon jovi def leppard led zeppelin and the list goes 
on 
ask him what he wants to be when he gets older 
id like to be a music teacher or i might be a gym teacher or 
president of the united states he says laughing like hes being 
tickled 
he switches it all the time taunts his 17yearold brother 
eddie first he wanted to be a lawyer then he wanted to be a 
doctor 
i might be all these things eddie kenny retorts 
it is that spirit that inspired frenchcanadian filmmaker claude 
gagnon to make a movie about kenny 
from the first moment i met him i knew i wanted to make the 
film with him says claude gagnon director of the movie kid 
brother which premiered in november in pittsburgh 
i really wanted to be close to that kid and work with him he 
can fool around and be childish but hes got a very serious side to 
his personality 
i think the thing that helped kenny the most is that his family 
never tried to overprotect him when kenny is around i never think 
of things he cant do 
as an example of kennys ability the director mentions a scene 
in the movie in which kenny swings with amazing agility from 
playground monkey bars 
kenny can do so many things ill never be able to do in my 
life and he knows it gagnon says hes very proud of it he 
wants to show the world here i am heres what i can do can you 
do it 
gagnon says kennys mother sharon didnt object to the film as 
long as the family was portrayed accurately not everything in 
pink and beautiful 
thats because kennys life hasnt been neat and pretty 
kenny grew up in a second floor apartment over a storefront 
with no elevator in nearby west aliquippa a rough ohio river 
steel town shadowed by the 7milelong ltv steel corp plant 
his father jesse is an unemployed maintenance worker who does 
odd jobs and his mother works evenings at a geriatric convalescent 
center 
his sister sharon 20 hasnt lived at home for many years and 
the two arent on speaking terms while eddie grew up resenting 
kenny for not being a normal brother 
in the midst of this have come a herd of reporters and 
photographers to document kennys life his parents usually decline 
to talk to reporters 
reporters can be rude when they dont like what they hear kenny 
says 
during an interview in october in seoul south korea where kenny 
carried the torch for the international paralympics this reporter 
got mad and walked out when we told him we dont go to church he 
says 
over the years kenny has gotten accustomed to rudeness and 
staring 
he knows he surprises people and hes not scared by that 
fact gagnon says he tries to get the best out of it 
prior to the movie and publicity about kenny however people 
would see him in the street and either cross or run away the 
director says 
today they ask to kiss him or shake his hand all of a sudden 
they appreciate him hes finally getting a lot of the love and 
tenderness he deserves

editors note they established their organic farm four decades 
ago shunning pesticides and chemical fertilizers at a time when 
agriculture was rushing pellmell in the opposite direction but 
paul keene and his late wife betty held to their convictions and 
today their chemicalfree food products have found markets around 
the world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the seed of the idea was planted in 1939 
when paul keene a young missionary to india met mohandas gandhi 
it eventually grew into walnut acres farm an oasis of natural 
food in a fastfood world a place frequented by people such as 
naturalist euell gibbons who lived 10 miles away until he died in 
1975 
the organic farm one of the oldest in the country has blossomed 
into a 5 millionayear business in the four decades since keene 
and his wife betty put down roots in central pennsylvania and 
began tending the land without pesticides or other manmade 
chemicals 
you dont see the birds that are going to steal your grain from 
you keene says they need food too 
the 108acre farm the keenes bought in 1946 is now nearly five 
times that large and yields about 300 organic products that are sold 
worldwide the top sellers include preservativefree peanut butter 
granolas and other sugarless cereals and freshly ground 
wholegrain flours 
the basic tenet at walnut acres according to keene is that 
food should be is the most important thing in life and one 
should be more concerned about what one eats than anything else 
all joys and all outreach can only be appreciated if youre 
healthy and dont have to worry about your insides and your 
outsides adds keene 78 
george devault editor and publisher of the new farm a magazine 
published by the regenerative agriculture association acknowledges 
walnut acres is a pioneer in organic farming 
i think that in the very near future thats going to be the 
conventional way of farming devault says the present 
chemicalintensive system we have now is not sustainable the 
economics the environment the health concerns the residue 
people like paul keene have helped pave the way for a healthier 
future for all of us 
keenes desire to enrich the earth and its people was nourished 
by gandhi whom he met nearly 50 years ago in britishruled india 
keene the yaleeducated son of a minister had gone there the year 
before as a missionary 
i said to him im teaching mathematics in a school in 
america im here and im learning a lot about india and im not 
satisfied with this work im doing what would you suggest 
he said well i cant advise you on the details but the 
first thing you should do when you get back is give away everything 
you have 
an inspired keene returned to the united states in 1940 with his 
wife a british missionarys daughter and taught one more year at 
new jerseys drew university before quitting 
the couple spent the next several years at organic farming 
schools that stressed the need to go back to the soil in 1946

editors note when she won a national competition for young 
musicians in her native germany at age 7 the government allowed her 
to drop out of regular school and be tutored at home so she could 
spend more time practicing the violin today at age 25 annesophie 
mutter is more than a child prodigy shes an international star in 
classical music 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
in her strapless dior gown with a stradivarius 
tucked under her chin annesophie mutter is the glamour girl among 
todays young classical violinists 
the germanborn musician is in the fast lane zipping around in a 
porsche 911 convertible at up to 100 mphplus on the autobahn 
vacationing in her apartment in monte carlo a fan club always 
greets her in japan 
but aside from fashion there is a practical reason for the 
strapless dior 
i discovered the violin sounds much better on bare skin and it 
is not so slippery she says 
the 25yearold miss mutter indeed is serious about her music 
and she has the ear of serious musicians such as herbert von 
karajan music director of the berlin philharmonic and mstislav 
rostropovich cellist and music director of the national symphony in 
washington dc 
miss mutters gifts include a consummate control of her 
instrument gleaming intonation ripe sound and an assured 
nerveless stage demeanor wrote time magazine 
last spring miss mutter made her sixth concert tour of the 
united states performing with major orchestras in december she 
made her first american recital tour playing solo in 12 cities all 
of the 14 appearances sold out 
in january she will marry a fellow german detlef wunderlich a 
lawyer after the honeymoon she will resume her schedule of 120 
concerts a year 
miss mutter started violin lessons at age 6 she won a national 
competition for 6 to 24yearold musicians at age 7 and the german 
government gave permission for her to drop out of regular school and 
be tutored at home in wehr near the southern tip of the black 
forest while she did play with her two older brothers and other 
children most of her time was spent with the violin 
i just loved to play the violin and i wanted to play well 
because i liked the sound she recalls so i practiced i grew 
up with music as something very precious and something very pure 
my father took care i did not have a child prodigy career what 
can you decide yourself at the age of 6 8 or 13 
today she has an agent in each country and her father a 
newspaper publisher coordinates them like most classical 
musicians she wont divulge her income 
miss mutter only played a few concerts a year until she started 
performing with karajan 
after that she says i didnt have to play with bad orchestras 
or audition for each conductor or go through competitions 
she had her first personal contact with karajan in 1976 at age 13 
after she performed at an international music festival in lucerne 
switzerland karajan heard about it and invited her to audition 
i didnt want to go she recalls for such a genius what 
could i do i pursuaded my parents to postpone we went on a holiday 
to spain 
in december i flew to berlin with my father and teacher both 
were really nervous i was not nervous i understood there was not 
the slightest bit of hope because i had nothing to lose that is 
why i survived this moment 
she played a bach chaconne and afterward karajan told her 
i will be happy to play with you next year in salzburg 
miss mutter made her first recording at 15 with karajan playing 
a mozart concerto in one take 
she made four recordings in 1988 for release early in 1989 
including tchaikovskys concerto for violin and orchestra in d 
major with karajan and the vienna philharmonic and witold 
lutoslawksis chain 2 and partita the latter dedicated to 
her by lutoslawski 
for the past three years miss mutter has been playing a 1710 lord 
dunraven strad i like the sound she says very silvery and 
quick responding very good projecting 
four years ago she says with a twinkle i made a very good 
step my parents were against my driving a sports car saying 
dont risk your life i decided i will ask maestro karajan in 
front of my father he said it was a great idea 
karajan helped her select and order the white 911 porsche with 
its red leather interior and black convertible top 
since 1985 miss mutter has played chamber music with 
rostropovich and violist bruno giuranna 
shortly after i made my debut in washington eight years ago 
with rostropovich conducting he said he wanted to return to chamber 
music she says he had stopped playing with a string trio 30 
years ago 
weve played everywhere in europe it was a dream to play this 
repertory apart from playing it with the greatest cellist and 
greatest viola player you can imagine what a lesson each concert 
is every phrase you hear from both of them pushes you forward 
krzystof penderecki is composing a concerto for the 
mutterguirannarostropovich trio 
the strapless stage dresses didnt begin as a trademark miss 
mutter says she started needing gowns at 14 to perform with 
karajan in salzburg but where at that age would she find them 
she tried bridemaids dresses but found that the sleeves got in the 
way so she bought peasant blouses with elastic necklines so she 
could pull the sleeves down on her arms 
i only was looking for comfort my neck is short which is 
perfect for violin playing without support under the instrument 
one day i felt grown up enough to buy real dresses not this 
child stuff 
so she went to paris and immediately found two dresses she liked 
at chanel 
after i discovered how comfortable it is to have dresses made 
for you everything fits i couldnt go back to a compromise 
after i got a taste of it i went to dior i prefer dior much 
more simple i have shoes made in different colors like the dress 
always the same style 
for her performances with the trio dior designers fashioned a 
womans tuxedo i want to look as my partners look she says 
i needed different sleeves and a lot of volume in the back of the 
jacket we worked on that outfit for days 
its comfortable but you cant compare it to the liberty you 
have in a dress and its so hot

it seems like such a short time ago that 
hayley mills snubnosed towheaded and blueeyed was spreading 
good cheer in a halfdozen pictures for walt disney 
her first movie pollyanna at the age of 14 brought her a 
special oscar in 1960 next came the parent trap that darn 
cat the moonspinners summer magic and in search of 
the castaways 
even as an adult it was difficult for her to stay away from 
disney her films appeared frequently on the disney channel and she 
got more mail than any other star 
she had left the disney studio at 19 but two years ago she 
returned for parent trap ii for the disney channel 
now 41 and the mother of two teenage sons attending school in 
england mills is back on the disney channel she stars as a junior 
high school teacher in a new comedy series good morning miss 
bliss the show made by nbc is the first network production for 
a cable channel 
mills plays carrie bliss a teacher who dedicates her life to her 
classroom yet mills herself never had a special teacher when she 
was growing up before coming to los angeles she attended boarding 
schools in england after that she went to school on the movie set 
i went to so many different schools i never had a normal 
education she says when i worked at disney i had three hours 
of schooling a day i usually did it 20 minutes here 15 minutes 
there just to collect time id march off to the little red school 
house to listen to some incomprehensible lecture on mesopotamia 
while they were lighting the next shot 
each halfhour episode of the new series focuses on the 
classroom although some scenes may take place at her home 
i only have 16 kids in my class but i appreciate what real 
teachers have to cope with mills says when you do a scene over 
and over again in rehearsal theres no surprise left it becomes 
difficult to control the kids they also have to spend four hours a 
day in real school 
her character she says is a very inventive teacher shes 
very committed to her profession she always wanted to be a teacher 
and she has great enthusiasm she really relates to the kids as 
individuals shes the kind of teacher who believes fervently in the 
vital importance of her role in their lives 
mills says she has modeled her character on christa mcauliffe 
the teacher killed aboard the shuttle challenger she was that 
kind of inspirational teacher she says 
dennis haskins plays the principal richard belding who insists 
the school and its classes be run exactly by the rules 
miss bliss wants to open up the world to the children and give 
them a sense of reality about history rather than just memorizing 
dates mills says which brings her into conflict with the 
principal who runs the school in a very conventional way with every 
guideline being the right and tested way 
mills had to swap her home outside of london for an apartment in 
hollywood hills to work on the series one of the joys of working 
in california is that every morning you can look out and see the 
mist rise she says im up high enough that i can look down on 
the city early in the morning the tall buildings are shrouded in 
the mist 
in england she lives in a little village along the thames river 
her older son commutes to college in london and the younger is in a 
private boarding school 
mills has spent much of her time in recent years working in the 
theater but she has done an occasional film she went to israel for 
appointment with death an agatha christie mystery also starring 
peter ustinov lauren bacall and carrie fisher she worked in the 
united states doing episodes of amazing stories and murder 
she wrote 
i came here in early 1988 to do the pilot for this show she 
says it was a surprise when the producer rang up and said it was 
on i was completely unaware they had been negotiating 
mills also has just had published a book called my god which 
is a compilation of how different famous people view god and life in 
the hereafter she cowrote the book with marcus mclaine her 
livein companion of the past 4 years 
it was marcus idea and i said lets do it mills says 
ive always been very interested in god and religion marcus had 
studied theology before he became a singer and songwriter we wrote 
to the heads of all the major religions and got a crosssection of 
opinions from a lot of wellknown people

richard greenberg a genial 30yearold 
playwright has written a comedy that includes such topics as 
yuppies aids and the homeless all set against a backdrop of new 
york in the late 1980s 
its a surprising mixture even more surprising it works 
the play eastern standard arrived on broadway after a 
soldout run at offbroadways manhattan theater club its cast 
consists mostly of unknown young actors the exception is anne 
meara who plays a foulmouthed bag lady almost redeemed by these 
upwardly mobile youngsters 
almost is the key word here because nothing these baby 
boomers learn is as easy or as blackandwhite as it seems 
stephen an architect loves phoebe a stockbroker drew an artist 
loves peter a television producer peter has aids ellen a 
waitress wants to help mae the bag lady and mae dupes them all 
ask greenberg to explain how he put together this unlikely 
combination of people and themes and he launches into an extended 
history of the play 
eastern standard was a collection of several different 
impulses says the author relaxing in his agents apartment 
the play grew out of greenbergs last fulllength work the 
maderati a stylized farce about the big apples young literary 
set greenberg thought it would be his farewell to new york as a 
playwright 
im constantly saying im never writing about new york 
again he says but when the maderati didnt quite come off 
i thought well all right one more and i wanted to write it in 
such a way that wasnt so brittle and artificial i decided that 
instead of inventing a world id sort of figure out what the 
strains and tensions of the real world were and bring them 
together 
putting such topics as aids or the homeless in a comedy has 
perplexed and even angered some audiences 
when you have a homeless person and a person with aids in a 
play and youre funny it really ruffles some feathers he says 
i think theres an idea that seriousness is the same thing as 
sentimentality and unless you show what a devastating thing aids is 
and dwell on that people get very wary 
the comedy also has an ambiguity about its characters that can be 
unsettling greenberg says 
the thing about this play is that every character at one point 
seems to be right and at another point seems to be wrong he adds 
you can really be in a quandary as to what you are supposed to 
feel about them theres a comfort in being told what you are 
supposed to think in eastern standard you constantly have to 
change your mind 
especially if most of the characters are yuppies the one group 
america loves to hate the most greenberg doesnt even like to use 
the word 
i call them the upper class or the uppermiddle class now he 
says 
some critics didnt even think they were worthy of a play 
i felt that some of the people who have launched these attacks 
are living exactly the same way and the only thing that separates 
them from the people they are attacking is that they are 
attacking the playwright says i think theres an element of 
hypocrisy in that 
greenberg who resembles a slightly disheveled preppie looks and 
talks a lot like the people he writes about 
i know a lot of people like those in the play he says but 
no character is directly based on anyone i know 
greenberg began working on eastern standard in march 1987 
the day after the maderati closed offbroadway writing 20 to 25 
pages a day he had a first draft ready in a few weeks 
ive worked harder on eastern standard than ive worked on 
any other play although it came very quickly in that first draft 
greenberg says the arch where it started and where it went to 
always has been the same but the journey there has changed a lot 
the journey took the playwright to the seattle repertory theater 
where the play had its first full production last spring audiences 
there were enthusiastic although local reviews were mixed 
eastern standard got to broadway through the persistence of 
producer jessica levy it was levy who first commissioned greenberg 
to write a play specifically for the commercial theater 
i was flabbergasted by the idea that this was a commercial 
commission and not for an institutional theater program the 
playwright recalls then i began thinking what makes plays 
commercial and ended up creating the most abstruse inaccessible 
unproducible thing id ever written 
he finally gave that play up and then started work on eastern 
standard which levy licensed to seattle rep before it came to the 
manhattan theater club and then broadway 
the playwright springs from the middle class the splitlevel 
suburbs of long islands nassau county where his father was a movie 
theater executive his education was decidedly upper crust 
greenberg went to princeton and then tried the phd program in 
english at harvard before ending up at the yale drama school to 
write plays 
when i finally became a playwright i thought oh this works 
i like it this puts things together nicely he recalls with a 
smile 
while in his third year at yale greenberg had two oneact plays 
accepted at ensemble studio theater a tiny but wellrespected new 
york theater company one was a big hit 
so i started being employed as a writer doing tv and film 
scripts right out of school he says i dont know what i 
thought i was going to do but somehow ive managed to support 
myself as a writer 
its the writing for tv and films that drains greenberg primarily 
because they involve so much collaboration 
plays excite me they wake me up he says although hes 
never thought of himself as a broadway playwright 
i think for playwrights of my generation broadway has never 
been a specific goal he says greenberg thought hed write plays 
and have them done at small institutional theaters in new york or 
beyond and maybe some of them would move offbroadway 
now there is all sorts of attention from all sorts of 
directions maybe because the play is controversial greenberg 
says the only way to have a play that isnt controversial is to 
write about nothing but its odd having everything so public the 
idea of reveling in all that attention is very weird to me

just who was that man whose birthday is 
celebrated today 
that theologians say is the main issue in regard to jesus was 
he just a man a prophet a great teacher or something more was he 
god mirrored in humanity 
a lot of questions were asked about him while he lived questions 
echoed ever since 
classic christianity concluded he was something of a paradox 
truly god and truly man 
hes certainly not considered all of god did it mean that he 
manifests god not in spite of but because of his being truly 
unreservedly human while all others fall short of it 
the mystifying assessment resonates with anomalies and further 
questions with which scholars have grappled through the centuries 
the child jesus took on a variety of names both at the start 
and through his robust roving adult ministry 
emanuel meaning god with us was an early appellation 
as recorded in matthew 123 
the magi from the east referred to him as king of the jews 
the same title pinned on him at his crucifixion by the roman 
governor pilate 
the names themselves weave a fascinating pattern of mystery in 
scripture son of god son of man son of david 
savior messiah the carpenters son 
opponents called him a winebibber a friend of sinners 
who has a demon 
many other names peculiar intriguing cropped up in his time 
and before it 
jewish scriptures seen by christians as referring to him say in 
isaiah 53 that he was a man of sorrows by whose stripes we are 
healed 
but isaiah 9 calls him wonderful counselor mighty god 
everlasting father prince of peace 
the opening of johns gospel calls him the word of god the 
true light that enlightens every man and the word became flesh 
and dwelt among us full of grace and truth 
the missionary apostle paul in 2nd corinthians 4 calls him the 
likeness of god a light that has shown in our hearts to give 
the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of 
christ 
john the baptist called him the lamb of god who takes away the 
sin of the world 
when jesus asked his apostles who they thought he was one of 
them peter exclaimed you are the christ the son of the living 
god 
he described himself variously in such graphic words as these 
i am the light of the world 
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life 
for the sheep 
i am the door if any one enters by me he will be saved and 
will go in and out and find pasture 
i am the vine you are the branches 
i am the resurrection and the life 
i am the way the truth and the life 
the father and i are one he said totally in accord yet the 
father is greater than i but is in me and i am in him 
jesus also puzzlingly described himself as identical with the 
poor the naked the sick the hungry and the imprisoned 
truly i say to you as you did it to one of the least of these 
my brethren you did it unto me he says in matthew 2540 
the closing book of revelation rev 216 pictures him as the 
alpha and the omega the beginning and the end 
the missionary apostle paul calls him the second adam the 
inception of a new unflawed and spiritquickening life within 
humanity 
paul summmed up the bafflement of it all in 1st corinthians 13 
for now we see in a mirror dimly but then face to face now i 
know in part then i shall understand fully even as i have been 
fully understood

sexual depravity among the french aristocracy was depicted in 
choderlos de laclos 1782 novel les liaisons dangereuses with 
such sordid detail that it has been the target of censors ever 
since in recent times it has been converted into a hit play by 
christopher hampton who has now written a film version with the 
anglicized title of dangerous liaisons 
directed with zest by stephen frears the movie marks a welcome 
return to the traditional storytelling of films playing dramatic 
events against the convincing backdrop of a historical era even the 
plot is pleasingly oldfashioned the wrongdoers receive their 
comeuppance at the curtain 
dangerous liaisons ignores the political ferment of late 
18thcentury france to concentrate on the bedroom games of jaded 
aristocrats the plotters of the intrigue are a pair wellmatched in 
cool evil the marquise de merteuil glenn close is brainy but 
sexobsessed eager to avenge rejection by a former lover her aim 
to assure deflowering of his 16yearold future bride uma thurman 
the notorious rake vicomte de valmont john malkovich greedily 
accepts the challenge but he decides that the conquest is too easy 
so he also proposes a greater achievement seducing madame de 
tourvel michelle pfeiffer a devout married woman valmonts 
prize if he succeeds a longpostponed night with his coplotter 
the scene moves to the country estate of valmonts indulgent aunt 
mildred natwick where he plots his campaign both missions 
completed he is thrown off his game by falling in love with the 
saintly de tourvel meanwhile the marquise has taken a young lover 
keanu reeves all this intrigue is resolved in a surprisingly 
moralistic manner 
dangerous liaisons is made more accessible by straightforward 
americanstyle acting and the language sounds contemporary despite 
an overflow of aphorisms vanity and happiness are 
incompatible glenn close is inspired casting displaying 
calculated mischief in contrast to her fatal attraction 
dramatics 
the valmont role might better have been played by tyrone power or 
errol flynn but what malkovich lacks in romantic dash he 
compensates with intense dramatic skill michelle pfeiffer delivers 
another of her splendid performances and newcomer uma thurman is 
impressive as she moves from virgin to wanton 
norma heyman and hank moonjean produced the warner bros film 
which is superbly mounted the rating is r for sexual content 
running time 120 minutes

peewee herman had a farm eieio 
and on this farm he had a talking pig named vance a pony who 
could make pancakes and an entire circusful of strange but 
goodhearted performers 
here is peewee practicing animal husbandry and agricultural 
science with smashing success but failing miserably at making 
friends with the local townsfolk a bunch of certified sourpusses 
who clearly would like to string up our hero by his red bowtie 
the one exception is winnie the local school marm who seems 
truly smitten with the androgynous peewee something is wrong 
though her blond tresses snarl painfully under peewees caress 
and she persists in making him detestable eggsalad sandwiches for 
their lunch dates 
the problem becomes clear when the circus led by kris 
kristofferson drops in his yard a la oz after a storm here is the 
girl of his dreams gina the trapeze artist played by the comely 
italian actress valeria golino peewees in love 
peewee who is already a manturnedboy doesnt exactly turn

the prospect of a date with the local bikeshop bimbo big top

casual sex mca home video vhs 8995 rated r 
 
casual sex was an ok idea for a movie two single women 
one frightened of sex because of aids her friend just plain 
frightened of sex go off to a spa for a vacation of freewheeling 
manhunting 
but casual sex is not an ok movie its silly predictable 
and rarely funny 
melissa victoria jackson and stacy lea thompson despair of 
finding men with whom they can develop meaningful relationships 
melissa nearly married the wrong man but otherwise has avoided much 
experience with men stacy counts off her former boyfriends though 
her sexual exploits came to a screeching halt with the aids scare 
so they talk about having sex for the fun of it stacy recalls 
the time when shed say to a lover wow that felt great whats 
your name again but what they really search for is romance and 
true love 
at the oasis spa melissa and stacy have the requisite number 
of runins with awful wrong men before true love strikes with the 
men they both had overlooked 
jackson has an endearing deadpan delivery and she and thompson 
hit it off as pals andrew dice clay brings comic relief playing an 
oafish pickup artist with a heart of gold 
directed by genevieve rovert casual sex does try to deal 
with the sexual mores of the 1980s and with aids in a mature and 
humorous manner it is probably an admirable effort but only 
occasionally a successful one

paramedics vestron video vhsbeta 7998 rated pg13 
 
dont even bother to read this review let alone buy or rent 
paramedics you will only be wasting your time unless you find 
sophomoric double entendres about bimbos and chicks amusing or 
tired ethnic jokes a big laugh 
using the police academy format this stuart margolin hybrid 
dabbles in every formula of the trade but where police academy 
had hilarity with its special breed of outrageous characters and 
situations paramedics just crawls along squeezing laughs from a 
dead storyline and lifeless characters 
it stars george newbern adventures in babysitting as uptown 
and christopher mcdonald grease 2 as mad mike two rowdy 
paramedics who use their custommade city van to cruise the street 
for women much to the horror of their dreadful boss he reassigns 
the undynamic duo from their run in the posh part of town to a 
rundown area where they stumble into a street gang war and get 
involved in a heart transplant caper in a fairly predictable 
sequence of events uptown and mad mike emerge as heroes 
but for all the action paramedics merely shuffles along 
also featured are lawrencehilton jacobs ray walston and the 
voice of sally kellerman as a dispatcher

its america week in newcastle and all thats tacky and 
distasteful about the united states has come to persuade this 
english industrial city to embrace the invasion 
a clever setting for a romantic thriller and stormy monday 
often is clever as well as sultry and stylish but it also can be 
too elusive and too violent there are beatings shootings 
bombings 
cosmo tommy lee jones leads the americans while finney sting 
is determined not to be pushed around and has brought the krakow 
jazz ensemble to mark america week at the nightclub he owns and the 
americans want to buy 
the musicians and the americans all end up at the same hotel as 
do the movies love interests brendan sean bean who works for 
finney and katie melanie griffith who had been involved with and 
seems to work for cosmo 
much of the goings on are shadier than the shady characters why 
does cosmo want control of newcastle at one point he explains 
we cant be shooting people around here we are supposed to 
improve the quality of life provide jobs and make a lot of money 
yes but 
much of the cleverness involves the polish musicians when the 
americans are about to hold a flagwaving reception cosmo learns 
his band is a noshow so the east bloc band performs a jimi 
hendrixlike star spangled banner 
writerdirector mike figgis gets impressive performances from his 
actors but makes too much of the violence and too little of the 
motives for the knockdown dragout fight over newcastle

christmas now is drawing near saydisc sneaks noyse 
thys yool nimbus the martin best ensemble 
christmas night collegium the cambridge singers and the 
city of london sinfonia john rutter conducting 
 
sneaks noyse a british early music group promises that its 
carol collection is done with original instruments rebecs 
pennywhistles citterns and such and at first it may sound as if 
the consort includes a cat doing its death rattle 
oh christmas now is drawing near the singers drone doing 
their best to sound like tipsy amateurs out yowling for drinks and 
mince pies 
patience however will be rewarded among the 28 tunes is a 
lovely version of sweet was the song the virgin sang a 
littleheard carol written down in the early 17th century theres 
an unfamiliar tune collected in 1952 for the holly and the 
ivy and some delightful instrumentals fy nay prithee john 
and the furry day carol 
if you must know what furry day is the brief notes are no help 
to get the most from the recording the listener ought to be reading 
along in the oxford book of carols the handiest source of 
seasonal musical lore the book explains that furry is from the 
latin feria which means holiday also the root of the word 
fair as in village fair 
lucie skeaping the soprano for sneaks noyse also appears on 
thys yool a more austere christmas recording from the martin best 
ensemble 
one of the jewels in this collection is a 14thcentury song as 
i lay on yoolis night in which the narrator imagines being 
present at the nativity sing now mother said the child 
about what shall befall me hereafter when i become old 
the mother responds with an eloquent shrug sweet son 
wherefore should i sing i never knew anymore about you but what 
gabriel told me in his greeting 
on the rollicking side theres the song tapster drynker 
which is simply an appeal for one more round 
after the austerities of authentic antiquity as presently 
understood john rutters polished collection of standards is balm 
for the ears rutter one of the rising stars in british choral 
music both as a composer and conductor serves up familiar favorites 
starting with in dulci jubilo and on through adam lay 
ybounden the cherry tree carol and even one dreads o 
tannenbaum 
wretched sentimentality is avoided however by the 
professionalism and the sincerity of the performances

everythings different now epic til tuesday 
 
no one wants to be happier more than i do aimee mann sings 
on everythings different now the third album by her band til 
tuesday 
its an awful thing to say but music fans have a vested interest 
in seeing she doesnt get her wish mann has built a pretty good 
career on romantic torment 
she recently broke up with boyfriend jules shear himself a 
songwriter with the band reckless sleepers providing her with a 
mother lode of new material 
side 1 is a fivesong suite that begins with the cautious 
optimism of the title tune cowritten with shear and ends with the 
angry mann adding an expletive to the line life could be great 
that concludes believed you were lucky 
the natural temptation is to run in panic when you hear one of 
the songs is titled j for jules and features a french horn 
somehow she makes it work mann is an imaginative writer able to 
give a new twist to an old subject and her mournful voice is 
brightened by strong pop melodies 
i was counting to forever and never even got to 10 she sings 
at one point when we found a rip in heaven we should have just 
ascended then 
side 2 strays slightly from the dominant theme limits to 
love is about a troubled girl who doesnt respond to the love of 
her friends on the other end of the telescope mann duets 
with another noted wordsmith elvis costello 
if you think mann has a tough life consider shear whose band 
released its debut album a few months ago not only is all his dirty 
laundry being aired in public but his exgirlfriends record far 
outshines his

the strangest hit of the holiday season is a 
gagpacked feature version of a television series that lasted only 
four weeks starring an actor better known for playing villains than 
getting laughs 
leslie nielsen who has a long record of evildoing in films and 
television is currently killing people with laughs in the naked 
gun from the files of police squad the paramount pictures 
release is the work of jerry zucker jim abrams and david zucker 
who previously made airplane and who specialize in titles and 
scripts with exclamation marks 
nielsen 62 repeats the role of lt frank drebin the incredibly 
incompetent detective who appeared in the brief lamented 1982 
series police squad the actor who had appeared in 
airplane recalled the inception of the show 
jerry and jim and david invited me to lunch and they even 
pitched me they didnt realize i was putty in their hands anything 
they wanted me to do i was willing 
they mentioned doing police squad on television can you 
imagine me doing lt drebin on tv under the auspices of the zuckers 
and abrams paradise 
sad to say abc yanked police squad after six chapters were 
made and four aired why 
it didnt belong on tv nielsen theorized it had the kind 
of humor you have to pay attention to when you have a screen that 
is bigger than life you can see what is going on in the background 
you dont have to search for it 
you can watch it at home and look around and say gee im 
going to get that door painted or leave the telephone alone 
there was no laugh track to bring the audiences attention back to 
the screen it belongs up there on the big screen in theaters 
where people have paid money to get in so theyre not liable to 
waste their money by not paying attention 
nielsen explained that zaz as the trio are called originally 
planned to make a feature of police squad but couldnt find a 
plot long enough so they fashioned miniplots for a tv series 
after years of trying they came up with a story that pitted drebin 
against vincent ludwig ricardo mantalban the los angeles 
businessman who is really a killer 
a large part of the appeal of naked gunpolice squad can be 
attributed to nielsens straightarrow playing of the outrageous 
events there is a certain madness in his method the more 
seriousness the more credibility you present in your demeanor when 
youre talking about insanity the funnier it becomes 
although he was something of a practical joker as a boy in fort 
norman saskatchewan we didnt know that water bombs would freeze 
on the way down from a secondstory window leslie nielsen was 
not considered much of a comedian in his early years one of three 
sons of a royal canadian mountie he served as a gunner in the royal 
canadian air force and later studied at lorne greenes radio academy 
in toronto 
winning a scholarship to new yorks neighborhood playhouse 
nielsen moved into live television appearing on 46 shows in one 
year his first movie was the title role in the vagabond king 
mgm signed him to a term contract but he never rose from playing 
leads in b pictures and secondleads in major films 
moving into television he specialized in heavies in episodic 
tv they always needed a guest star he said the star was always 
the good guy so the best part was the heavy the meaner and more 
ferocious you were the better the hero looked when he whipped you 
he also briefly starred in his own series 
i began with the new breed and we did 36 shows in one year 
then i did brackens world the bold ones and swamp fox at 
disney also shaping up and police squad none of them went over 
a year some had only six shows or less 
but maybe it worked out all right in the long run he said 
because now im doing the naked gun and i dont have any track 
record with any one character thats endured 
after 35 years in hollywood i finally realized that i had been 
cast against type ive finally found my home as lt frank 
drebin 
the success of naked gun will undoubtedly lead to a sequel 
already they were working on a script nielsen disclosed 
ill be meeting in the oval office with president bush who will 
send me to catch mr big in the drug trade i will be working 
directly with the mastermind of the antidrug campaign vice 
president quayle theyre thinking of asking pat sajak to play that 
part 
of course mr big will turn out to be ricardo mantalban he 
died in naked gun but his evil twin is out there lurking they 
may even call it the wrath of ludwig 
he could be serious

when gilbert kaplan a new york city publisher with 
minimal musical training told the experts he wanted to conduct 
gustav mahlers second symphony they told him it was possible but 
downright foolish 
and they were right the american magazine publisher says 
but what you dont know you dont know he says someone 
once told me that a bumblebee judged by aerodynamic principles is 
incapable of flying but the bumblebee doesnt know that so i kept 
going forward 
today the 47yearold has realized something of a fairy tale in 
musical annals an untrained rank outsider he has conducted 
mahlers second the resurrection 13 times around the world and 
has just released a recording 
the austrian composer wrote eight other symphonies but kaplan 
has no interest in conducting them hes sticking with the second 
symphony 
i certainly feel qualified to learn other things but i dont 
think of myself as a conductor he says 
kaplan who gave his first performance in 1982 with the american 
symphony orchestra cant read music and has memorized the score 
some critics have accused him of using his wealth to indulge 
himself while others have praised him 
married with four children he publishes the magazine 
institutional investor and conducts for free he hopes to perform 
the symphony next year in japan west germany denmark venezuela 
and jerusalem 
when kaplan conducted with the london symphony orchestra in 1986 
and sold out londons 6000seat royal albert hall michael kennedy 
of the daily telegraph called his interpretation revealing and 
moving 
this is no rich mans actedout fantasy he wrote the lso 
do not play with this kind of subtlety in the matter of dynamics nor 
with such careful instrumental balance unless the man with the stick 
has got his message across 
kaplan was in london in november for the release of his recording 
with the lso in cardiff wales he talked about his hobby as he 
sat in his savoy hotel suite overlooking the thames and the royal 
festival hall where he conducted in 1984 
i used to look across to the festival hall but i never thought 
i would ever conduct there he said 
kaplan studied music from age 7 to 10 like other american boys 
and i stopped as soon as i could 
in 1965 he was working on wall street when a friend took him to 
hear conductor leopold stokowski rehearsing mahlers second with the 
american symphony orchestra at carnegie hall 
kaplan was sufficiently intrigued to go to the concert i had 
never heard mahlers music before and when i walked out of the hall 
i was a different person he recalled 
the first time you hear mozarts music you think it is 
charming the first time you hear mahlers if mahler can reach you 
you are changed in a very fundamental way even poor performances 
produce enthusiastic audiences and when i turn around i can always 
spot the people who are hearing it for the first time 
mahler more than any other composer touches on very personal 
matters which as children we think about and then we tuck away and 
forget to get on with our lives 
then mahler pushes the buttons again and everything comes back 
life death hope despair purpose all those things grownups 
dont talk about 
over the next 15 years kaplan heard every performance of the 
second symphony in new york 
then i woke up one morning and somehow i knew that one day i 
was going to conduct a symphony i know it sounds preposterous he 
said 
i didnt know what it meant to conduct didnt know that 
mahlers second is one of the most difficult works to conduct i 
wasnt trying to prove anything i wasnt climbing mountains and it 
wasnt a midlife crisis i just knew i was going to conduct the 
symphony i was on a conveyor belt and no way of getting off 
as a member of the board of carnegie hall he was able to get 
advice from musicians and conductors he talked to more people read 
and got nowhere 
then kaplan found a young conductor charles bornstein of the 
juilliard school in new york took him to his long island home and 
worked nine hours a day for 30 days memorizing an 83minute 
symphony 
the rest is history the new york daily news rated kaplans 1983 
performance with the american symphony orchestra among the years 10 
best other orchestras invited him to conduct and critics have 
praised his performances from brazil to japan 
mahler who died in vienna in 1911 at age 50 was a zealous 
perfectionist whose musicians at the vienna opera called him the 
tyrant 
kaplan who owns mahlers original score says he was a great 
notationist and could write down what he really wanted from the 
musicians he tells you dont slow down here because he 
knows the music has a tendency to slow down there 
i try to conduct the music as closely as possible to what 
mahler wanted i want people to hear what mahler wrote not 
someones idea of what he wrote

twentyone years ago the chicago transit 
authority came to mean a rock band as well as elevated trains around 
the loop but the group had to shorten its name to chicago when sued 
by the windy citys mayor richard j daley 
now the sevenman chicago which numbers its record albums rather 
than names them has 19 in the top 100 on cashbox magazines 
bestselling chart a single from 19 look away moved 
into the top 10 the first single from the album i dont wanna 
live without your love charted in the top 10 in august 
chicago having survived the death of guitarist terry kath peter 
ceteras leaving for a solo career and a slump is going strong 
i think you have a sophisticated and educated listener said 
woodwinds player walt parazaider more people are musical than in 
the late 60s and 70s whether the crowd knows a b flat from a z 
diminished they know if youre not playing well 
chicago has had time to learn to play well as we sit here 21 
years later five of the six originals are still in the band six 
months after we began we added peter cetera as bassist and lead 
vocalist parazaider said 
the idea danny drummer danny seraphine and i had was lets 
put together a rock n roll band with horns wed incorporate horns 
as more than background licks i think weve kept up with that 
the group has had time to get jaded too but parazaider says 
that hasnt happened they say weve sold 80to100 million 
records and had something like 33 top 40 hit singles 
every time i hear about a hit record thats a thrill heres 
people buying your music something that you create theres no 
jaded part to chicago we are thoroughly pleased that people enjoy 
what were doing 
from their first album in 1969 chicago transit authority 
the group became a big underground success and became known as a 
touring band 
janis joplin and jimi hendrix took us on tour as opening act 
before we had a record parazaider said recalling that hendrix 
told him your horn section is like one set of lungs and your 
guitar player is better than me joplin told him when you get 
as famous as im going to be and you will dont take it too 
serious 
it meant a lot to me a link to people that are legends 
parazaider said that they respected us is great i feel fortunate 
we touched base with them at all we take it serious but this isnt 
brain surgery 
touring he said has always been one of chicagos strengths 
the music we play on stage is free but traveling they cant pay 
us enough for that we do tours of 130 shows in 150 days were 
always out there playing for whoever wants to hear us you get 
instant reviews 
of course album sales havent been constant for two decades 
glitter rock hit punk and new wave we stuck to the music we 
played and changed a little with the times around the 13th and 14th 
albums in the late 70s there was a lull the 13th was gold up to 
then theyd been multiplatinum the 14th wasnt gold 
after selling 50 or 60 million records for columbia they ran 
for cover when things went bad columbia dropped chicago in 1983 
it hurt my feelings parazaider said its like you can hit 
a grand slam last night and strike out tonight and theyre going to 
boo fame is a transient thing 
but he said he wasnt bitter it was a learning experience now 
im happy it happened we got a slap in the face of reality and 
we needed it 
at that time chicagos management company advised the band to 
produce its own album to be shopped around 
after we finished the 16th album the response at the different 
record companies was tepid at best parazaider said one label 
said well get rid of the horns and sign a rhythm section that 
hurts your feelings and makes you mad 
our manager howard kaufman said after the first single is a 
hit the rest of the companies are going to be banging their heads 
our next single was no 1 hard to say im sorry 16 was a 
gold album and 17 was platinum chicago records on the reprise 
label now 
parazaider whose trumpetplaying croatian father lives in 
chicago and whose mother was czech graduated from depaul university 
in 1968 in clarinet performance he was inspired at 9 by seeing 
benny goodman on television money wasnt abundant parazaider 
recalled but my father got me a teacher when i was 14 the 
teacher said i had surpassed him 
he put me under the tutelage of the clarinetist in the chicago 
symphony the relationship lasted until he died in the 70s he saw 
the first big wave the band had in the early 70s and was quite 
proud he played in carnegie hall the week before we first played 
there he left me a note backstage ok kid just play in tune and 
dont play too loud 
the clarinetist plays saxophone flute keyboards and guitar but 
not clarinet for chicago 
james pankow trombonist arranges lee trumpeter lee 
loughnane and i sightread the parts i think our musicianship has 
grown because of the stuff he has written that has challenged us 
he said other members are robert lamm jason scheff who replaced 
cetera and bill champlin

a bright shining lie neil sheehans profile of 
lt col john paul vann and his war in vietnam may turn out to be 
an enduring handbook for powers bent on foreign adventures 
the national book award in nonfiction conferred on the author 
nov 29 recognized literary merit and careful research however 
the book is more than a wellwritten biography it is a study of 
futility on a world scale 
vann a dedicated career officer spoke out early in the war 
against the brutality and ineffectiveness of us strategy in 
southeast asia he learned at the battle of ap bac in 1962 how hard 
it was to kill a man dug into a hole if that man was determined to 
stay there until his enemy ran out of bullets and will 
sheehan at the time united press internationals saigon bureau 
manager discovered it was scarcely easier for reporters to get 
across that simple reality in the face of prevailing wisdom back 
home 
a decade of escalating technology rising troop numbers and a 
burgeoning us commitment did not change those basic lessons but 
the elusive light at the end of the tunnel captivated even vann 
in 1972 a civilian with the rank of major general and head of an 
uphill program to win hearts and minds vann died still fighting a 
war he thought he might win he was director of the governments 
civilian development program and was killed in a helicopter crash 
returning from battlefield inspection 
sheehan who later reported for the new york times and who helped 
report on the pentagon papers in 1971 spent 16 years sifting the 
evidence and then reciting facts so readers in a calmer time could 
draw clear conclusions 
we had also to all the visitors who came over there been one 
of the bright shining lies vann remarked to a us army historian 
in mid1963 sheehan used those words as a frontispiece 
while the book is a finely etched portrait of a complex zealot 
it also catalogs the false assumptions selfdelusions and 
miscalculations that widened a hopeless war 
vann as a young adviser watched ragtag guerrillas humiliate 
large usbacked forces he could not convince superiors that south 
vietnams unmotivated army was in no shape to defeat the viet cong 
as a political analyst he argued in vain that corrupt autocratic 
leaders could not win over disaffected peasants however much 
material and moral support they got from washington 
in 800 pages of lively prose sheehan never outlines in concrete 
terms the underlying message but even the casual reader sees it 
exported ideology fares badly against a nationalist cause

singer kathy matteas heart will always 
belong to her native west virginia even though shes strayed far 
from home in the decade shes become a country music star 
mattea from cross lanes wva had one of country musics 
biggest hits in 1988 18 wheels amp a dozen roses 
i find traveling broadens the horizons she said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles where she was taping the tv 
show hollywood squares 
but the funny thing is ive developed a stronger sense of home 
thats a real comfort 
shes lived for 10 years in nashville tenn where she has been 
working on her fifth album scheduled to be in the stores next 
spring clearly happy with her thriving music career she regrets 
only being too busy to visit her family and friends as much as she 
would like my success hasnt made a difference with my friends 
ive only lost touch with the ones who would have drifted away 
anyway 
it took years of work and six failed nominations before the 
28yearold mattea made it in october with her recent country 
music association award for single of the year for 18 wheels amp a 
dozen roses 
the event was a thrilling culmination to a year of rising record 
sales growing concert audiences on a tour headlined by george 
strait and her personal favorite her valentines day wedding to 
songwriter jon vezner 
in 1978 she dropped out of west virginia university and headed 
for nashville after she found herself spending more time with a 
bluegrass band than on her studies one of my band members was 
moving there so i tagged along she said 
it eventually proved to have been the right choice it was a 
town where i could flourish i wasnt threatened by its size 
she had the usual round of jobs waitress and secretary then 
tour guide at the country music hall of fame she was singing 
demonstration tapes and advertising jingles when she signed with the 
mercury label in 1983 a year later her selftitled first album 
yielded three wellreceived singles and she was on her way 
mattea said she had always adored music and experimenting with 
it she sang at her local church and with a folk band in high 
school at the same time she listened to all the pop music she 
could and absorbed her elder brothers wideranging interests in 
rock n roll 
since the age of 2 ive known id be some kind of 
entertainer she said i had a gutlevel reaction to people like 
bob dylan and early james taylor they just made me want to cry 
a teenage passion for folk singer buffy st maries music led 
mattea to form an allgirl band buffy 
she also played acoustic guitar and later in nashville mixed 
all her influences until a sound emerged she calls it countryfolk 
and the sound came to fruition on her 1986 album walk the way the 
wind blows 
mattea is at a point in her career when thoughts of failure can 
be frightening success is a subjective thing and you find 
yourself wondering oh god can i really do this again 
coupled with that is anxiety about her image 
im getting more comfortable with changing my hair and 
makeup she said its real interesting because the traditional 
movement is so strong in country music 
she also hopes to challenge tradition with her next album which 
will include celtic and irish musical influences

miracle cures and cheaper healthier food are 
on the horizons of biotechnology but for companies able to cope 
with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the future 
holds huge earnings 
the industrial biotechnology association predicts that sales now 
estimated at 600 million will rise to between 25 billion and 30 
billion in the year 2000 and between 75 billion and 100 billion in 
2025 
the first impact is going to clearly be on the medical side 
said james mccamant editor of medical technology stock letter in 
berkeley calif 
genetically engineered products to cure aids and some cancers to 
make pork and beef leaner and healthier and to protect crops from 
insects weeds and the weather are just a few of the promises held 
out by the industry 
you will see biotechnology products all over the shelves in the 
next few years it will creep into your life and continue to 
accelerate fifteen years from now we cant even speculate 
mccamant said 
the united states remains the leader in all aspects of 
biotechnology diagnostics medicine forensics and agriculture 
analysts say but japan and western european nations are making 
inroads partly due to a strong government role in financing and in 
some cases looser regulations 
funding for the basic sciences has gone down in the last 10 
years were being hit pretty hard by the germans the english and 
the japanese said jim gramlich director of the american cyanamid 
co agriculture research center in princeton 
california massachusetts wisconsin north carolina and new 
jersey are the states having the most companies with biotech 
connections said iba spokeswoman sherrod shim states benefit in 
taxes and jobs by supporting biotechnology and can be good sources 
of startup funds say state biotech center officials 
however in the long run the new jersey center for advanced 
biotechnology and medicine hopes to attract federal support and 
backing from pharmaceutical companies said robert namovicz the 
centers executive director 
agencies like the national institutes of health and national 
science foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in 
recent years with more grants to universities and industry but not 
everyone sees that as an answer 
they are good to a certain point theyre more directed toward 
the research and what were really about is developing a commercial 
product said don reed chief financial officer of massachusetts 
cambridge bioscience corp 
us companies have not yet taken their business to countries 
with looser regulations such as france or italy said jeff gibbs 
one of three authors of biotechnology and the environment 
international regulation 
but it could happen gibbs said even though the european 
community is studying whether to establish uniform rules that would 
probably lean toward those in countries like denmark and west 
germany where the stronger influence of environmental groups has 
led to tougher regulation 
what companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of 
the us regulatory environment the patent and trademark office 
facing a backlog of more than 6000 biotech applications asked the 
industry association in early november to train more patent 
examiners to handle the caseload 
all over the country companies are racing to develop new 
products 
cetus corp of emeryville calif has worked to develop 
polymerase chain reaction which lets scientists magnify a single 
piece of dna the molecule that carries genetic information cetus 
president robert fildes said pcr simplifies diagnosticians task of 
finding viruses from infected cells it can determine in hours if a

turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide 
jurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantly 
changing science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece of 
the market said jan kurtz with the science advisory board for the

were trying to make a patchwork quilt ms kurtz said 
its not easy to promulgate new legislation the questions are all 
new 
faye peterson a food and drug administration spokeswoman said 
the regulatory process does not differ greatly from other products 
submitted to the agency regulation levels are appropriate and do 
not require further expansion an assessment shared by most company 
officials she said 
however mike cannell of the wisconsin family farm defense fund 
inc a group opposed to biotechnology in agriculture for economic 
and safety reasons said it doesnt take a black heart to imagine 
the worst when the chemical companies are supplying most of the 
regulatory data 
groups like cannells and the washington dcbased foundation 
on economic trends contend the dangers of biotechnology havent been 
sufficiently examined critics point to herbicides and pesticides 
that were once considered harmless and have been proven to pollute 
groundwater as reason to doubt the motives of any industry that is 
being regulated 
the industry says fears of genetically engineered bacteria 
running wild mislead the public and legislators into seeking to 
toughen the regulatory road 
the risks are sometimes greatly exaggerated of nature gone 
wild we all grew up on the same movies of giant spiders that 
escaped laboratories and ate chicago said hugh andrade 
executive vice president of scheringplough corp in madison and 
vice chairman of the industry association 
more plausible dangers involve weedcontrol experiments that 
could backfire with the wrong gene implanted letting the weed 
reproduce and even that would be highly improbable because 
researchers start experiments with some idea of which genes 
accomplish what ends dandrade said 
the specialized knowledge and costly equipment required will keep 
the technology out of the wrong hands and regulation coupled with 
companies wish not to damage their credibility will keep products 
from being rushed onto the market without proper safeguards he said 
lisa drake a spokeswoman for monsanto co in st louis said the 
company is used to regulatory mazes but its harder for smaller 
firms were used to working within those kinds of boundaries but 
a lot of smaller companies are bothered by regulations because its 
so expensive and takes so much time 
smaller companies living off initial investment capital all feel 
pressure in an uncertain market to put products on the shelves said 
american cyanamids gramlich they can only survive so long in 
savings and research contracts i dont think any company can put 50 
to 60 percent into research as some of these have and survive long 
smaller companies like epitope inc of beaverton ore can no 
longer ask investors to wait as in the early days of biotechnology 
said michael hubbard president theyre not satisfied with 
companies any more that say were going to lose money for six or 
seven years 
weve geared our work to very applicable things rather than 
heading into longterm things like cancer treatment 
the competition also could reduce the number of companies 
executives predict onethird of the industry will be acquired within 
five years and nearly half within 10 years according to biotech 
89 commercialization a report by arthur young co analysts have 
expected that to happen for some time 
the progress of commercial biotechnology is unfolding with 
remarkable logic said the report neither unexpected challenges 
the stock market collapse nor fully expected challenges 
regulatory issues patent disputes have stalled an industry that 
has begun to show its strength

a study of women with radically 
different sex lives prostitutes and totally monogamous indians 
found new evidence linking promiscuity to transmission of a virus 
that can cause cervical cancer 
dr jose azocar compared pap smear samples from the prostitutes 
with those of piaroa women part of a strictly monogamous group that 
lives in traditional villages scattered in this south american 
nations amazon jungle 
with this study the relation between the hpv virus and cervical 
cancer is strengthened as is the hypothesis that the mode of 
transmission is sexual said azocar a virologist with the 
venezuelan scientific research institute 
as early as the 1950s scientists observed that higher levels of 
cervical cancer seemed to be associated with promiscuity a solid 
link between the human papilloma virus hpv and cervical cancer 
wasnt made until the early 1980s by harald zur hausen of germany 
and ralph richart of columbia university using genetic engineering 
to manipulate infected dna they found that the viruses most related 
to cervical cancer were certain strains of hpv later research using 
genetic material from the viruses confirmed their results 
in 1985 azocar began a similar study using viral genetic 
material in cell samples from caracas hospitals and found that 
nearly 80 percent of cervical cancers in venezuela were associated 
with hpv cancer is the no 2 killer in venezuela and cervical 
cancer is the most common form in women 
it is widely accepted among scientists that hpv causes cervical 
cancer but it is thought that other factors are involved including 
many births early onset of sexual activity and promiscuity i 
wanted to see to what point these other factors were involved 
azocar said in a recent interview 
further study required control groups at the extremes of sexual 
activity 
its hard to find a control group of monogamous people and 
with the piaroa the girls are married off for life as soon as they 
get their first period azocar said the only thing they 
required was that all the examinations be done by women 
gynecologists 
getting to the piaroa who had participated in an earlier aids 
study was difficult the 7000member tribe lives in an area the 
size of austria roughly between the parguaza river in southwest 
bolivar state and the town of tamatama in amazonas federal 
territory 
most still live in villages of less than 100 they fish hunt 
small animals and birds and cultivate tubers and bananas as they 
have for hundreds of years those in less remote villages may have 
outboard motors for their canoes and wear westernstyle clothes but 
their limited exposure to modern society ensures that their 
monogamous lifestyle is intact 
men of status may have two wives but most have just one there 
is no one from outside the village to fool around with and tribal 
women are kicked out if they sleep with someone other than their 
husbands 
azocar and his colleagues were flown by army helicopter to three 
villages near the parguaza river 290 miles south of caracas where 
they took samples from 125 women no evidence of hpv or cervical 
cancer was found 
examining a promiscuous group was easier he conducted a 
twomonth campaign among prostitutes in several cities nearest 
piaroa territory for a cervical screening program and free 
treatment police helped spread the word 
a team of gynecologists took pap smears from 130 prostitutes 
between 25 percent and 40 percent depending on the city they lived 
in had hpv and among these there was a high incidence of different 
grades of precancerous tumors 
both the piaroa and prostitutes began having sex early had 
multiple births similar blood lines live in the same climate eat 
similar foods and are exposed to roughly the same frontierstyle 
living conditions 
sexually speaking the major difference was the frequency of sex 
azocar said we showed that women who had many children and who 
started sex at an early age didnt necessarily have hpv this 
provides solid data that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted 
disease that the virus is the most important factor causing it and 
that promiscuity is the form of infection

miracle cures and cheaper healthier food are 
on the horizons of biotechnology but for companies able to cope 
with the regulatory patchwork of the embryonic industry the future 
holds huge earnings 
the industrial biotechnology association predicts that sales now 
estimated at 600 million will rise to between 25 billion and 30 
billion in the year 2000 and between 75 billion and 100 billion in 
2025 
genetically engineered products to cure aids and some cancers to 
make pork and beef leaner and healthier and to protect crops from 
insects weeds and the weather are just a few of the promises held 
out by the industry 
the united states remains the leader in all aspects of 
biotechnology diagnostics medicine forensics and agriculture 
analysts say but japan and western european nations are making 
inroads partly due to a strong government role in financing and in 
some cases looser regulations 
agencies like the national institutes of health and national 
science foundation have responded to challenges from abroad in 
recent years with more grants to universities and industry but not 
everyone sees that as an answer 
they are good to a certain point theyre more directed toward 
the research and what were really about is developing a commercial 
product said don reed chief financial officer of massachusetts 
cambridge bioscience corp 
us companies have not yet taken their business to countries 
with looser regulations such as france or italy said jeff gibbs 
one of three authors of biotechnology and the environment 
international regulation but it could happen he said even 
though the european community is studying whether to establish 
uniform probably stronger rules 
what companies are doing is taking advantage of the newness of 
the us regulatory environment the patent and trademark office 
facing a backlog of more than 6000 biotech applications asked the 
industry association in early november to train more patent 
examiners to handle the caseload 
turf battles between federal agencies trying to decide 
jurisdiction for each new biotechnology product and the constantly 
changing science complicate the task of companies seeking a piece of 
the market said jan kurtz with the science advisory board for the 
federal environmental protection agency

all karl white could get with his degree in 
biology was a job climbing trees to collect plants 
but the job happened to be for a company pioneering in allergy 
work in the middle of hayfever country and now other people are 
climbing trees for him 
his crystal labs supplies 40 percent of the powdered mold pollen 
and other allergy villains purchased by labs that make allergy tests 
and vaccines 
oklahoma is really the center point of all hay fever white 
said within 500 miles are deserts trees hills and mountains not 
to mention the johnson grass and ragweed that flourish in the state 
itself 
the location may be perfect and the business lucrative but white 
says it also federally regulated highly seasonal and workers can 
face some unexpected hazards when they venture into the wild 
collecting specimens 
crystal labs produces up to 1100 pounds a year of powder from 
pollen mold animal skin insects and food his most expensive 
product is mites part of house dust which sell for about 3000 an 
ounce when crushed to powder 
mold can be grown all year in the lab but plants have to be 
collected for pollen at just the right time just before the pollen 
is released the season begins in february with elms and runs 
through octobers goldenrod thats the busiest time for whites 
five employees and 20 contractors 
the work can have complications wellmeaning citizens often 
assume that people collecting plants are doing something illegal 
the most dangerous animal i have run into was humans white 
said almost everytime we go out and start collecting someone 
turns me in thinking im trying to collect marijuana

blobs of molten metal created where 
earths core meets the overlying rock may explain why the magnetic 
north pole wanders by about one degree every decade a laboratory 
experiment suggests 
unlike the geographic north pole where earths lines of 
longitude meet geographers have noted changes for at least 1200 
years in the location of the magnetic north pole which is where 
compasses point 
scientists generally believed that changes within the planets 
liquid iron core were responsible for the wandering of magnetic 
north but blobs of molten core material created in the overlying 
mantle may be at least as important according to the study by 
university of california scientists 
to simulate conditions at the coremantle boundary about 1800 
miles below earths surface they crushed samples of rock minerals 
and liquid iron between diamond anvils at pressures about a million 
times those at earths surface and used a laser to heat the samples 
to more than 5400 degrees fahrenheit 
the study found that molten iron reacts aggressively with the 
rock minerals known as perovskites which are composed of 
magnesium iron silicon and oxygen and which are thought to be the 
main material in the lower mantle 
such reactions could create blobs of ironrich metal alloys in 
the lower mantle that might deflect magnetic field lines generated 
in the core and could explain why the magnetic north pole wanders 
the scientists said 
ucberkeley geophysicist raymond jeanloz presented the study 
during the american geophysical unions fall meeting in san 
francisco

a synthesizer and computer can tap into 
the bodys symphony of electronic voices to let the paralyzed 
make music by moving their eyes or dancers accompany themselves 
scientists say 
biomuse would let a dancer create music directly from the play 
of muscle activity underlying the movement itself said hugh s 
lusted and r benjamin knapp of stanford universitys school of 
medicince in a research paper 
the idea of making music from the bodys electric signals isnt 
new but lusted and knapp wrote that electrodes placed on skin 
pick up many different signals simultaneously which merge to form 
a background of noise and the biomuse computer can select desired 
signals to make music 
the body is literally a symphony of electrical voices sounding 
at different frequencies and intensities they wrote by placing 
the pickup electrodes on the upper arm we can tune in to bicep 
activity 
next we instruct the processor to record the intensity of the 
electricity coming from the bicep then we tell the device to 
translate that electrical intensity to note number on the 
synthesizer keyboard such that low intensity relaxed gives low 
notes and more muscle tension produces progressively higher notes 
the slightest movement produces immediate sound from the 
synthesizer thus simply by tensing and relaxing one arm the 
musician can run notes up and down the keyboard 
it also could use other muscles brain or heart activity since 
the device can use any available nerve or muscle electricity as a 
control signal to the synthesizer a disabled person can learn to 
make music even using eye movements the scientists wrote

the surface layer of lowsalt oxygenrich 
water that supports abundant sea life in the black sea is only 44 
percent as thick as it was 13 years ago us and turkish 
researchers say 
the organisms in the relatively fresh surface water support 
fisheries in the soviet union turkey romania and bulgaria but 
scientists do not know how the change will affect the industry or 
whether conditions will worsen 
the study sponsored by the us national science foundation and 
the turkish government included five black sea cruises by the us 
research ship knorr from april through august it found that the 
surface layer extended to a depth of only 165 feet compared with 
375 feet recorded by researchers in 1975 
university of washington oceanographer james murray who 
presented the study to the american geophysical union in december 
speculated that the change may be due to dams on soviet rivers he 
said the dams already divert up to 50 percent of the water in some 
soviet rivers keeping the fresh water from the black sea but he 
said natural variations also may be responsible

surgeons who corrected nicolasa menchus 
scoliosis used a magnet during the operation stimulating her brain 
to make her limbs twitch and demonstrate that they hadnt damaged 
any nerves or arteries 
the surgery reduced the curvature of the 27yearold guatemalan 
students spine to remove the pressure on her organs that kept them 
from functioning normally the electromagnet she says saved me 
from being paralyzed 
the spinal cord carries sensory signals to and from the brain 
doctors generally use small electric shocks to the limbs and 
electrodes on the scalp to test whether the spine is intact and 
those signals are getting through 
the use of the doughnutshaped attached to the patients head 
lets doctors to be more aggressive with some spinal procedures said 
dr john r johnson assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and 
codirector of the kenton d leatherman spine center of norton and 
kosair childrens hospitals 
about two years ago johnson and colleagues at the university of 
louisville school of medicine heard that researchers in england were 
stimulating the brain with a pulsed magnetic beam to diagnose 
nervoussystem disorders 
because the magnet can trigger nerve cells in only the part of 
the brain that controls limb movement they wondered if it might let 
them test the spinal cord while avoiding some of the side effects of 
electrical stimulation 
in april 1987 they started testing magnetic stimulation on rats 
then on themselves students and secretaries about 60 volunteers 
they found that the magnet triggered twitching of arms and legs if 
placed over the correct region of the brain the muscle activity is 
measured and analyzed by a computer 
the doctors have used the procedure on 48 patients and it has 
failed to trigger movement in about 20 percent harvey l edmonds 
research director for the anesthesiology department said anesthesia 
may be suppressing those patients leg muscles 
im very enthusiastic about it said dr susan porter an 
anesthesiologist who has used the technique in about 20 operations 
at the university of kansas medical center porter said she foresees 
other uses for the magnet such as in monitoring the sciatic nerve 
during hip surgery

it was the year they held a presidential election and half the 
nations voters decided to stay home 
it was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered 
barnacleencrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the 
world it was the year an early decision to let yellowstone burn 
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come 
it was the year oprah decided to diet soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev decided he wanted to be president attorney general edwin 
meese iii decided to resign evangelist jimmy swaggart decided to 
confess his sins and michael spinks decided to challenge world 
heavyweight champion mike tyson 
some decisions worked others didnt 
soviets and americans pulled together to free two surviving 
whales last seen cruising toward warmer waters soviet president 
andrei gromyko bowed out and gorbachev took over oprah winfrey 
the tv host lost 67 pounds 
in yellowstone however officials realized too late they might 
have made the wrong decision by the time firefighters arrived 
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of 
control forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among 
area residents 
swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the 
assemblies of god decided to defrock him spinks lasted for just 91 
seconds and eight decisive blows 
the wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen 
faced with the choice between vice president george bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and frustrated by one of the 
most lowdown dirty presidential campaigns ever an ambivalent 
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to 
overwhelming inertia 
ive always loved election years president reagan said but 
it seemed hardly anyone else did bushs 5446 percent victory over 
his democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout the 
lowest in 64 years 
political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many 
voters werent voting for anyone so much as they were voting against 
the other guy they also determined that bush lost 2 percent of his 
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision 
to tap as his running mate indiana sen dan quayle the first 
baby boomer on a national ticket and a choice that surprised 
even bushs advisers 
it was democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen the 
silverhaired smoothtalking senator from texas who provided the 
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates 
senator you are no jack kennedy bentsen told a flustered 
quayle after the 41yearold senator had compared himself with the 
late democratic president 
the kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation the 25th 
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on 
idealism lost and a world changed 
nowhere was that change more apparent than in ussoviet 
relations 
kennedy on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago shunned 
nikita khrushchev when he visited new york but gorbachev the first 
soviet leader since khrushchev to taste the big apple had a 
superpower lunch with reagan and bush on dec 7 and addressed the 
united nations with no khrushchevstyle shoethumping instead he 
promised to trim 500000 men and 10000 tanks from the soviet armed 
forces 
the visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit soviet 
armenia the soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 
60000 had died and 500000 were left homeless as whole cities 
crumbled under the quakes force 
rescue teams doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in 
from around the world it was the first time since world war ii that 
the soviet union had accepted disaster relief from the united states 
reagan paid his first visit to moscow in june for a summit that 
failed to break new ground in arms control the president hammered 
away on human rights issues and gorbachev later sent america living 
proof of his commitment to change 
nobel laureate andrei sakharov father of the soviet dissident 
movement was allowed his first trip outside the soviet union after 
years of agitation over soviet human rights policies 
americans vigorously agitated for their own causes more than 
5000 people were arrested in antiabortion protests that began in 
july in 32 cities and continued through the year roe vs wade the 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion turned 15 years old 
intact 
anthony mcleod kennedy confirmed as a supreme court justice by a 
unanimous senate inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but 
gave no hint of his views 
court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the 
oncepowerful 
former philippine president ferdinand e marcos and his wife 
imelda were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they 
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded us banks harry

when it comes to bridal fashions the word is options 
a bride can choose a ball gown a country dress a sheath or a 
tailored suit say designers and editors who work in the bridal 
field there are no rules only guidelines 
she can look demure like cinderella at the ball or in a 
departure from tradition alluring in a strapless or 
offtheshoulder dress with a lowcut neckline dresses with jackets 
and detachable trains also make it easier to go from religious 
service to postceremony party with maximum comfort 
holly mcmunn of bridal originals says there are more choices in 
fabrics style and color for brides than at any time in the recent 
past she sees several strong directions 
one type of bride wants a simple dress in a classic silhouette 
a princess empire or sheath style another type chooses an 
elaborate dress she says there is also a demand for the fashion 
statement dress particularly by older brides who may be remarrying 
that reflects silhouettes currently in style she says 
while white and ivory remain the colors chosen by the 
overwhelming number of brides soft tinges of color are becoming 
more popular agree modern bride and brides magazine fashion 
editors one new tinge is iceblue on satin dresses which imparts a 
silvery sheen to white 
still popular are colorthemed weddings in which a particular 
color scheme is carried through in flowers and decorations wedding 
party attire table linen plates even party favors 
some favored schemes include black and white and white and a 
deep tone such as hot pink coral or strong turquoise for spring 
and summer pastels such as mint and lemon yellow are popular 
cindy rose fashion director for voguebutterick patterns says 
the latest styles are available in sewityourself patterns some 
examples include dresses with bows at the shoulder or waist 
ruffles legomutton sleeves and even modified bustles 
according to rose bridal dresses are frankly not as innocent 
as they used to be with bustles and low necklines they do call 
attention to a womans figure many brides want to look like a sexy 
woman so the dresses they select have more style 
an advantage to having a homesewn dress is the opportunity to 
customize it with for example a detachable train snapoff sleeves 
or a coat jacket or bolero 
in keeping with the variety of bridal dresses accessories are 
similarly wideranging according to fashion reports by brides and 
modern bride 
modern bride notes the popularity of hats sprays of flowers for 
the hair and bows worn at the back of the head brides says jewelry 
for the bride has become more dramatic than it used to be seen on 
more brides are drop earrings charm bracelets and antique pins and 
earrings 
for bridesmaids dresses in floral prints and polka dots with low 
necklines or halters worn under jackets are popular for the mother 
of the bride and the groom soft pastel colors in fabrics like lace 
velvet silk moire and taffeta are more popular than the glittery 
dresses of several seasons ago 
rose says the use of expensive details such as reembroidered 
fabric for brides and their attendants is also growing

the sartorial role of the groom and his attendants is to 
complement the attire of the bride and her attendants says bill 
blass 
the designer of womens couture and of mens suits and 
sportswear blass says it is most important that the mens attire 
should be appropriate for both the occasion and the womens dresses 
for a simple country wedding a morning coat would seem 
exaggerated for a city wedding a navy blazer and white flannel 
pants would be a little too casual 
choose clothing suited to your build your age the time of year 
and occasion and the circumstances of the wedding he advises and 
dont overdress even though this may be the biggest day of your 
life 
to blass it is never appropriate for a man to look like the 
little figure on the top of the wedding cake instead he suggests 
quiet classic clothing for men in winter a tuxedo in summer 
perhaps a white dinner jacket 
you cant go out and rent a character for the day of the 
wedding what is appropriate is what suits you says tom fallon 
an associate of blass we see some tragic mistakes when we pass a 
church and notice a groom in a powderblue tuxedo with a ruffled 
shirt you can see they are mortified because the clothes have 
nothing to do with their life 
fashions for grooms and groomsmen dont change much over the 
years and thats fine with blass on the other hand not everyone 
takes quite the classic approach 
according to ken hall of after six manufacturers of dress 
clothes for men grooms are becoming more adventurous in selecting 
bridal attire they are moving away from the traditional clothing of 
the past four years 
there is a groundswell of interest in more freewheeling 
design such as jackets with much broader shoulders mess jackets 
with nippedin short waists and elongated slightly wider lapels on 
jackets he says 
shiny textured fabrics especially in medium tones of gray and 
in black toneontone fabrics are popular gray is more often 
chosen than it was in the recent past and in some areas of the 
country such as the midwest midnight blue dress clothes are also 
in 
even in traditional styles unorthodox fabrics such as 
herringbones are being used for the suits the fabrics were first 
found on european brands but now many american manufacturers are 
offering them he says 
hall says other trends include the return of the lowcut 
threebutton vest to match the jacket and the growing popularity of 
doublebreasted jackets 
fabrics differ little from summer to winter worsted wool is 
first choice

why not actually serve the cake as dessert at the wedding 
cake baker and author rose levy beranbaum who wrote the cake 
bible knows perfectly well why wedding cakes may be the least 
appreciated portion of the wedding food most are not nearly as 
tasty as they look 
she says that the tradition of the tasteless wedding cake can be 
banished by baking your own she includes a section on how to bake 
and decorate wedding cakes in her book 
beranbaum who once made wedding cakes professionally as well as 
teaching others how to do it has put away her cake pans now that 
her book is out but she says that with two days to spare and a 
certain amount of patience the bride a doting relative or friend 
can bake a cake to serve 150 in the ordinary home oven 
she presents formulas for a variety of cakes and icings and shows 
how to decorate and how to calculate quantities for virtually any 
size cake though the labor is one of love not economics a 
homemade wedding cake is almost sure to cost substantially less than 
a bakery cake even if you blow 100 on white chocolate for the 
icing 
the reason most people undertake such a project is to have a 
unique cake which may be white golden carrot chocolate or 
cheese the only requirements are tiers and icing 
beranbaum says that while baking a large cake is not necessarily 
harder than baking lots of small cakes the methods vary for 
example large cakes actually take proportionately less baking 
powder than small cakes do 
the larger cakes also have a tendency to get too brown at the 
edges before the centers are done aluminum strips can be used to 
retard browning the sides so the center can be cooked through 
some tips use cake flour not allpurpose or selfrising flour 
make sure that the butter is softened before its added to the 
batter if it isnt the cake mixture wont be aerated properly and 
the cake will be tough and flat 
oven temperature is critical in baking a large cake she advises 
that before baking a large cake bake a small one and see if it 
takes longer than the recipe a cake that bakes fast might be a 
little humped but a cake that bakes slowly will never be tender so 
raise the temperature in a slowcooking oven she says 
a tiered cake needs support in commercial bakeries the supports 
are wood dowels plastic straws work fine at home she says 
the simplest wedding cake to make is a white or yellow butter 
cake with buttercream icing give it two full days one day to 
make the components and one day to put them together and decorate 
the cake she says 
you can make some decorations ahead of time for example 
marzipan roses can be stored for years most cakes dont have to be 
refrigerated overnight she says 
as for transporting the cake she says that there are only two 
people fit for the job the person who made the cake or the person 
who is paying for it 
the safe method is to place the cake in a box whose sides are 
rigid and keep the largest bottom layer from touching the sides 
provided there are not too many bumps on the ride the cake should 
survive without a blemish 
the cake that launched beranbaums reputation was a fourtiered 
creation covered in what looked like dotted swiss fabric with a trim 
of roses she developed it for bon appetit magazine as an example of 
what could be done at home 
that cake changed my life she says i got so many calls i 
decided to teach intensive classes in special occasion cakebaking 
the information she compiled for the classes and the experiences 
she had baking the wedding cakes led her to develop the formulas and 
expertise that are found in her book

wedding traditions that once were thought oldhat are back 
bridal couples are getting pleasure by doing things the 
oldfashioned way according to barbara tober editor of brides 
magazine 
for example she says calligraphy once again is in fashion for 
invitations and people are thinking of toasts in advance and caring 
about the fact that someone should say something at the reception 
couples are embracing the idea of dressing up sending out 
invitations in advance putting announcements in the newspaper they 
have music they carry flowers they say their vows brides are 
having attendants throwing bouquets wearing a garter and cutting 
the cake she says 
the onceoverlooked personal letter of thanks to friends and 
family for wedding gifts is again in favor though preprinted 
thankyou cards are available etiquette experts agree that the 
sincere and courteous way of expressing thanks is with a 
handwritten note 
as the arbiter of the 80s judith miss manners martin put 
it the only time a handwritten thankyou note is not necessary is 
when no wedding present has been received 
according to the brides book of etiquette another exception to 
the requirement for a note is acknowledging gifts from parents or a 
spouse however its also duly noted that parents and spouse will 
appreciate a special letter of thanks 
for all other thankyous the first requirement is to keep a 
thorough and reliable gift record 
keep track of gifts in a wedding journal a notebook index cards 
or even on a computer record the gift along with the name and 
mailing address of the giver so it will be simpler to get the 
thankyou note on its way quickly indicate when youve mailed it 
so you wont overlook any 
while it has been traditional for the bride to acknowledge all 
gifts today its also quite acceptable for the groom to share the 
responsibility by writing to those whom he knows best 
etiquette requires the use of folded note paper in white ivory 
or the shade of the wedding invitation the stationery can be plain 
or embossed or printed with your name or initials but the bride 
shouldnt send stationery imprinted with her married name until 
after she is married 
a note should mention the gift and refer specifically to 
something about it such as its usefulness or style if you are not 
quite sure what the gift is compliment an unusual or unique feature 
such as color material mention your spouses name in the note 
since as a rule only the writer will sign it conclude with a 
friendly closing sentence 
the timetable for thankyous calls for a note within two weeks of 
the arrival of the gift if the gift arrives on the wedding day or 
during the honeymoon it should be sent within a month after the 
honeymoon says brides 
a good reason for writing notes a few at a time is that its 
easier to make the words of thanks spontaneous and sincere than if 
you tackle several dozen notes at once 
if you expect to receive more gifts than you think you can 
acknowledge right away you can send printed cards to let donors 
know the gift arrived safely and follow up with a personal note as 
soon as possible

the champagne toast is one of the few times during the 
reception when someone other than the bride and groom has center 
stage says michel la croix chef de cave at piperheidsieck 
traditionally the best man offers the first toast to the couple 
but others may do so 
whoever gives the toast should agree on the message with the 
groom ahead of time

received and the guests have taken their seats

when the wedding is over the honeymoon is supposed to begin but 
most couples discover that the honeymoon phase doesnt last out the 
first year of marriage says psychotherapist arlene modica matthews 
the author of why did i marry you anyway houghton mifflin 
says that some couples panic when they realize they arent going to 
live together without conflict they shouldnt negative emotions 
are a normal part of living with another human being and happily 
ever after is a fiction she says 
the fact that most divorces take place in the first three years 
of marriage shows that an unrealistic idealization of marriage can 
be harmful 
any little disappointment makes them think they were wrong 
since divorce is now socially acceptable they take the easy way 
out then they go out and marry the same kind of person again she 
says 
by knowing what to expect and focusing on methods of 
communicating in the first year of marriage couples can resolve 
inevitable stresses which in turn gives the marriage strength to 
endure 
in an interview and in her book matthews identified a 
threestage pattern similar to the steps a baby takes along the 
pathway to independence 
in the first stage each believes the other can fill all 
emotional needs its soon succeeded by the realization that some of 
your needs wont be instantly met you start to think you made a 
mistake that your spouse tricked you 
the third stage is to join the images and realize that your 
spouse is an integrated human who has foibles and flaws as well as 
wonderful traits ideally you both emerge with a sense of constancy 
in which you believe that the marriage will endure in good times and 
bad she says 
this generation thinks it is a good idea to be completely open 
when you are angry fights are healthier than sitting on your 
negative feelings for a year and then simply leaving but you have 
to know how to reveal your feelings 
ask yourself is my spouse going to be receptive to hear this 
now and how can i phrase it so he or she will not feel unduly 
attacked 
start your sentences with i as in i feel hurt being ignored 
at a party stick with the issue at hand dont make it a laundry 
list of everything thats ever bothered you 
she says oldfashioned rules of politeness should not be 
abandoned as soon as the wedding finery is taken off the politeness 
of courtship can be continued to a great degree and it is usually a 
bad idea to be completely honest all the time 
between money and sex she identified money as the more 
troublesome issue most courting couples have terrific sex lives 
but money is a taboo all of us have learned illogical ways of 
dealing with money and because we are marrying later we are used 
to managing money two quirky patterns that are different create a 
real problem 
strategies for coping include hiring a financial consultant to 
help you deemotionalize the situation or even separating finances 
many couples make the mistake of coming together financially without 
discussing their differing patterns she says it may make more sense 
to start out separately and come together with more understanding 
later on 
though sex is less likely to be a bone of contention in these 
days of more open discussion she says that its normal for the 
frequency of activity to decline after marriage 
no matter what the problem matthews says that flexibility 
usually helps solve it the people who will adjust best to 
marriage are those willing to try new ways of behavior in order to 
figure out what they want and how to get it she says

it sometimes seems as if americans are marrying earlier and more 
often 
statistics show that 36 percent of the weddings today are 
remarriages according to brides magazine 
furthermore says barbara tober editor of the magazine half of 
all americans divorce and remarry in their lifetime and the majority 
of women who divorce remarry within about three years 
paradoxically even though they are trying very hard not to 
divorce and to pick the right friend partner and pal if they 
dont they cannot stay in the marriage in these days of lengthened 
lifespan and vigor says tober 
according to cele lalli editor of modern bride one of the most 
striking changes in recent years has been in attitudes towards 
remarrying 
in the past one didnt advertise a remarriage one just 
unobtrusively did it today people flaunt it there is no sin in 
making a mistake and it is wonderful to find happiness she says 
weddings that are remarriages are being planned with just as much 
dedication as the firsttime wedding but there are some 
differences agreed these authorities 
for one thing the couples usually make the arrangements and pay 
for the wedding themselves for another if there are children from 
an earlier marriage they are often part of the wedding 
the remarriage wedding may well be smaller than the average first 
wedding today but not always 
many of the parties are elaborate evening events with dinner and 
dancing says lalli 
according to tober a second or third wedding is often a more 
intense though quieter event there may be a much closer bond 
between the couple and the guests they choose to invite the 
guests are often people who have been supportive during a divorce or 
widowhood they accept the new relationship they are the people you 
want in your life in the future she says 
ralph lamacchia who produces bridal shows says that companies 
providing wedding services are now paying more attention to the 
remarriage wedding market based on his observations of these events 
at which a mix of local service providers and national companies 
sell their wares he says that couples seem more clearminded 
about the type of wedding they want 
the bride tends to choose a more practical dress that can be used 
for other occasions or at least she will buy a dress that reflects 
her fashion style the party is more likely to be at home or in a 
restaurant not at a catering hall or a hotel ballroom photography 
is likely to be more creative and candid they arent going for 
multiple albums 
wedding announcements and invitations tend to be less formal and 
sometimes humorous people are still selfconscious even though the 
taboos have diminished quite a bit he says that nonsectarian 
ceremonies are more common at secondtime weddings 
tober says that at remarriages the issues of etiquette can be 
more difficult to settle for example she says she receives letters 
concerned with dissension in the family such as where to seat 
factions of the family whether to invite former inlaws and how or 
whether to include the children in the wedding 
when i am asked if kids should be in the wedding i say are 
they going to be in the marriage if they are then have them in 
the wedding we even suggest that couples go on a honeymoon alone 
first but have the children join them later she says

a little help from their new friends in the bridal registry is 
what couplestobe are relying on in these days of greater interest 
in home entertaining but less time for shopping 
typically the registrar helps coordinate dinnerware flatware 
and stemware patterns and also takes the bride increasingly 
accompanied by the groom through an everexpanding list of choices 
to make in other categories giftgivers use the registry to select 
a gift thats wanted by the couple 
the return to traditional weddings carries over in choices young 
couples are making for their crystal silver and china say registry 
directors in department and specialty shops for example theres a 
renewed interest in crystal among bridal consumers according to 
cleverley stone bridal registry director at b altmans in new york 
she says that brides are registering for more items than they 
used to including candlesticks vases and pitchers theyre 
choosing more expensive stems too the average price per glass is 
between 27 and 35 many register for two stemware patterns to go 
with the two sets of dinnerware that they select 
besides the silverware fine china and crystal that are 
traditionally listed the nations estimated 5000 bridal gift 
registries are increaslngly listing more unusual gifts desired by 
brides and groomstobe 
some examples on recent lists include exercise equipment 
bicycles fullystocked picnic baskets home electronic equipment 
such as camcorders and computers cooking appliances such as ice 
cream makers and pasta machines and art objects 
there are however some distinct geographic differences 
california couples are registering for patio furniture garden 
tools beach umbrellas barbecue grills and bikes according to rose 
nahabedian registry director at the broadway in glendale calif 
couples dont always register for fine crystal and china many 
of my clients tell me they want to purchase those items later on in 
their marriage she says 
in new york art objects and handcrafts such as oneofakind 
serving dishes are popular with couples registering at saks fifth 
avenues gift department 
another new york area trend is registering at nontraditional 
shops such as dean amp deluca a gourmet food shop a source at the 
store noted that couples come to register for everything from pots 
and pans to cooking tools also popular are gift certificates for 
specialty foods 
all over the country interest in ethnic foods has enlarged the 
range of utensils newlyweds want says anne kupper national 
spokesman for the gourmet gadget chain of williamssonoma pasta 
machines paella pans even nutmeg and cheese graters are registry 
items with this chain 
in the 15 years ive been with the company ive seen some 
things that havent been listed for years come back like fondue 
pots and pressure cookers which make it possible for working 
couples to cook quickly says kupper 
although its customary to include inexpensive as well as 
bigticket items on a wish list michelle kahn bridal registry 
director at neiman marcus in white plains ny says that a 
wedding celebration is one occasion for which you neednt be shy 
about extravagant requests 
some couples have registered for oneofakind crafts such as a 
3000 punch bowl by dorothy hafner or trendy silver china and 
crystal such as that bearing the swid powell label 
with couples wish lists growing more varied the nations bridal 
arbiters are advising gift givers to be more original too barbara 
tober editor of brides magazine says wedding guests should give 
something the couple want but also should personalize their gift 
for example a donor might match up wine goblets and wine a 
requested teapot with a basket of exotic herbal teas fragrant 
soaps with chosen bath towels family photos with a selected silver 
frame a set of parfait dishes with an ice cream maker or a crystal 
vase and a gift certificate for flowersofthemonth

youre getting married in a month or two and you find yourself 
daydreaming about all the things that might go wrong at the wedding 
and in the marriage does this mean you should call the whole thing 
off 
no say two authorities who have talked to many brides and 
grooms jerilynn ross president of the phobia society of america 
says that its normal and appropriate to worry about the unknown 
cele lalli editor of modern bride sees the realization of 
potential conflict as a sign of maturity in the age of divorce both 
say it isnt the worries you should worry about but what you do 
about them 
in a recent seminar she conducted for brides ross noticed both 
brides and groomstobe had more fears than they realized and hadnt 
discussed them 
merely learning that others worried about similar fears made 
the participants feel better because they had felt their worries 
were unique in many instances the partner was surprised to learn 
of the fears she says 
this observation led her to conclude that communicating worries 
may be all thats needed to relieve them even if you need to go a 
third person such as a therapist or religious leader to get the 
worry out its best to reveal it says the psychologist who 
counsels at roundhouse square phobia treatment center in alexandria 
va 
lalli says that because couples getting married now are generally 
older than couples in the recent past there are more potential 
wedding conflicts between them and the way their parents do things 
she sees this as a plus not a drawback 
thats what marriage is all about separating from the family 
working out conflicts that may develop over the wedding is the often 
the first opportunity to act as a couple she says 
one reason why worries may be more overt but less troubling is 
that there is wider latitude in whats considered acceptable and 
greater awareness of a need to communicate couples are less 
inhibited about talking about conflicts says lalli 
in general both women agreed that issues that couples worry 
about fall into one of two main categories practical concerns 
relating to the ceremony and party and philosophical concerns about 
the durability of the bond they are assuming 
todays different way of life has created both the problem and 
its solution for example higher costs force different financial 
arrangements 
traditionally the brides family paid for just about 
everything practically speaking today that is difficult if both 
families want an extravaganza they are more flexible about paying 
for it the traditional guidelines are not relevant says lalli 
because of greater mobility and fact that couples often meet 
and live in a city other than the one where the bride grew up 
theres often some concern about where to have the wedding today 
the right decision is what is most convenient and least expensive 
she says 
ross characterized most worries of couples about to be married as 
normal worries about the future its only if the worries become 
irrational involuntary and inappropriate that phobia a 
psychiatric disorder is involved 
despite role changes in recent years ross says men and women at 
the seminar she conducted worried along traditional lines 
the women all talked about their fears of being a good mother 
they felt the children were their primary responsibility the men 
talked about their fears of being the sole support of a family 
she says

one effect of marrying later is that each partner is likely to 
have been living independently marriage is therefore not merely a 
merger of two people its also the combination of two sets of 
household effects 
moving two people into one home is far from an effortless 
endeavor but youll accomplish the feat more easily if you plan 
ahead make lists and learn how to pack and load a truck 
according to joann alencikas manager of customer services at 
ryder truck rental its wise to start about four weeks ahead of 
time to organize the details of the move even those hiring a mover 
should make an inventory of what they each have the list can be 
used to plan what to get rid of what new items are needed and 
finally to estimate the size truck required to move belongings 
those renting a truck should reserve it well in advance during 
busy summer weekends the peak period of demand a month is not too 
long at other times a week or two is usually sufficient 
when making a reservation be prepared with a list of what you 
need to move so you can get the right size truck rental trucks 
range in size from a 1ofooter with 295 cubic feet or room for one 
roomful of belongings to a 24footer for seven rooms of furnishings 
a 15foot van provides about 750 cubic feet of storage or three to 
four rooms of furnishings 
the majority of moves in the united states are doityourself 
moves accordiing to alencikas primarily because of cost savings 
as an example she says it might cost about 420 to rent a 15foot 
van for a oneway move from new york to boston compared to about 
1000 based on standard tariffs discounted at 30 percent for the 
same move via a van line 
youll also be able to rent protective wrapping and hand trucks 
and to buy bubble pack and cartons from doityourself rental 
companies or of course you can save money by recycling 
supermarket boxes and bubble wrap from wedding presents 
two to four weeks ahead of time make an inventory and start to 
pack and label possessions close and open charge and bank accounts 
turn utilities on and off and notify the old and new post offices 
of your new address 
two weeks before the move its time to start packing 
on moving day its time to start loading the truck 
some tips load the truck onequarter at a time solid from floor 
to ceiling tie off each quarter with sturdy rope dont leave any 
open spaces since a tight fit keeps the load from shifting and 
protects goods from breakage fill in spaces with small boxes load 
the heaviest items such as major appliances first

when aimee gauthier and mike reed wed last fall in stamford 
conn her hobby of collecting 1930s and 1940s tableware and vintage 
tablecloths and napkins occupied center stage 
the tables holding the wedding feast were covered with the 
tablecloths and set with her mixed collection of colorful depression 
glass and fiestaware the menu consisted mainly of food made by the 
bride 
it was a prime example of couples planning their wedding as a 
very personal event 
gauthierreed says colorful tables are conducive to a festive 
atmosphere though unassuming and not normally for a formal table 
the settings were a delightful surprise to guests at her wedding 
she says 
gauthierreed a 25yearold graphic artist says she learned 
some of her stylish ways by working as an assistant to martha 
stewart the food stylist and author of books on partygiving 
including weddings 
she put stewarts lessons on color to use at her own wedding to 
create a relatively inexpensive event that was nevertheless original 
the menu included a salad of thinlysliced filet of beef and red 
and yellow peppers carrots and snow peas in vinaigrette dressing 
there was also tortellini salad with pesto sesame noodles tomato 
and red onion salad and broccoli 
table garnishes included a mix of black purple red yellow 
green and orange peppers and edible nasturtium flowers 
we didnt have fancy food just a simple menu of homemade food 
but everyone said it was the most elegant wedding they had gone to 
i think the table settings had a lot to do with that it was a 
unique way of expressing ourselves she says 
so pleased was she with the wedding and the enjoyment she got out 
of using her rapidlyenlarging collection of dinnerware and 
tablecloths from the 1930s and early 40s that she decided the 
experience held the seeds of a new business idea 
she has launched a business renting the pieces to others for 
parties and special occasions 
depression glass was the poor persons colored crystal it was 
given away as a bonus when people bought their groceries you could 
also buy it for about a quarter a place setting she says 
formerly scorned and found in junk shops depression glass and 
other old favorites such as fiestaware and fire king dishes now 
command good prices and are getting harder to find 
though her new business is unusual it is not unique she says 
she came across the idea in california where it appears to have 
originated 
i realized this business could be the perfect solution i would 
earn money to support our collecting and after renting it out id 
get the whole collection back at the end of the day she says

with wedding ceremonies as varied as they are these days walking 
down the aisle to a different drummer can be a most creative 
experience 
the american music conference has some ideas to consider when 
planning music for the nuptial rites 
if the wedding is in a religious setting be sure to check with 
the clergy or music director to determine what types of music are 
allowed 
if a music advisor or wedding planner is not available talk to 
friends involved in music or music students at a local college 
resist the temptation to choose musical selections only because 
you like them the music should not distract from the ceremony no 
matter how beautiful or entertaining 
if you choose a traditional wedding selection like wagners 
bridal chorus or mendelsohns wedding march consider a 
nontraditional grouping of instruments guitars string ensembles 
or electronic instruments can offer a different approach 
to personalize the ceremony ask friends who can sing or play 
musical instruments well to participate however if family and 
friends arent musical paying for the performance is worthwhile 
position musicians and singers near the front and to the side 
where they can be heard but wont upstage the wedding couple 
keep the music program simple experimentation is best left to 
another time 
the american music conference is a nonprofit organization that 
encourages participation in amateur musicmaking

william karls an autoworker for more than 
nine years isnt expecting to enjoy much of the 45000 he won in 
the state lottery 
after paying overdue child support taxes and bills karls says 
hell have 6000 left for himself but that will dwindle after he 
and about 5000 other workers see their jobs vanish at the chrysler 
corp plant here this week 
for some of the workers the shock still hasnt hit them yet 
said karls 32 for some its not going to hit until the day the 
plant closes 
chrysler announced in january that it would end auto production 
in kenosha by the end of the year laying off 5500 workers because 
the plant is outmoded the plant which began making cars 
commercially in 1902 builds the omnihorizon chrysler fifth 
avenue dodge diplomat and plymouth gran fury 
the announcement prompted outrage from workers and government 
officials who said chrysler pledged to continue making cars in 
kenosha for five years when the company bought the plant from 
american motors corp in 1987 
the union filed a lawsuit against chrysler but withdrew it amid 
negotiations over the shutdown gov tommy thompson also threatened 
to sue but eventually accepted a multimilliondollar settlement 
chrysler officials said they may have been guilty of 
overoptimism in stating that car production would continue but 
insisted they made no promises 
car production ends officially on friday chrysler will continue 
to employ about 1000 of the most senior workers for engine assembly 
many of those losing their jobs said they will have to settle for 
lowerpaying and less stable work some already have been laid off 
im 36 and everything has been pulled out from under me said 
jackie strecker who has worked at the plant for 16 years but 
ill survive most of us will 
strecker sold her home in october to get money in case she needs 
to move shes also among 2200 senior employees who will receive 
full pay until a 20 million job bank provided by chrysler as part 
of the settlement with the union is depleted 
with unemployment compensation strecker figures she should keep 
receiving some income for six months by that time ill have my 
head together enough she said adding that she hopes to take 
classes so she can start a business 
carol tucks who started working at the plant in 1979 signed 
papers with her husband on a 20000 car jan 27 the same day 
chrysler announced its pullout 
the couple had felt secure because of their combined incomes but 
the announcement halted their plans to buy a new home and have 
children 
its almost like the american dream is slipping through our 
fingers tucks said 
i am still very bitter at chrysler said kenosha county 
executive john collins it was the fact that they pumped 
everyones hopes up people went out and bought homes and cars 
amid the bitter feelings toward chrysler a network of state 
local and company initiatives has emerged to soften the blow 
chrysler has diverted profits from 1988 wisconsin car sales into 
a trust fund estimated at 24 million to help workers and their 
families meet housing and education costs 
as part of the settlement with the state chrysler is providing 
an executive to assist southeastern wisconsin communities in 
attracting jobs 
an assistance center at the local united auto workers 
headquarters is offering help with employment searches job training 
and basic education 
earl welch 41 hopes to get work repairing engines after he 
finishes job training to go from 14 an hour to around 8 an hour 
is a big drop he said but you have to figure 8 an hour is 
better than nothing

1989 is to pare down its current account surplus to 95 billion 
from this years projected 138 billion 
the economic planning board said in its economic management plan 
monday that the proposed reduction would be achieved partly through 
more liberal import regulations

to avoid trade friction from the united states and other countries 
that have trade deficits with the nation

percent next year to 65 billion while exports will increase about 
17 percent to 70 billion 
the board also predicted the economy would grow by about 8 
percent next year compared with the 121 percent forcasted for this 
year it attributed the decline to the anticipated slowdown in 
exports

the number of working oil and gas rigs increased 
by eight to total 930 this week marking the second consecutive week 
the rig count has posted a gain baker hughes inc reported monday 
last week the count increased by 17 to 922 a year ago the count 
was 1168 baker hughes said 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaking company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states the biggest gains were posted 
by louisiana with four additional rigs followed by ohio three

pillsbury co gave up its 2month fight and 
agreed to a 568 billion takeover by british conglomerate grand 
metropolitan plc two days after major courtroom setbacks 
grand met will purchase all outstanding shares of pillsbury 
common stock for 66 per share in cash 3 higher than grand mets 
most recent tender offer which was made last week 
the shareholders got much much more money than either the 
marketplace was offering or pillsburys restructuring offered 
karl cambronne a lawyer for dissident pillsbury shareholdersi 
think the shareholders did well 
lawyers investment bankers and company officials worked out the 
deals details saturday and sunday and pillsburys board approved 
the deal sunday afternoon 
on friday a judge in delaware where pillsbury is incorporated 
issued preliminary injunctions to invalidate pillsburys poison 
pill takeover defense and temporarily block the companys planned 
spinoff of its burger king corp grand met requested the rulings 
ruling in a separate lawsuit filed by dissident pillsbury 
shareholders a minnesota judge also temporarily blocked the burger 
king spinoff and said he probably would invalidate the pill 
pillsbury decided to deal because the pill its only 
bargaining chip was gone said stephen carnes an analyst with 
piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
pillsbury common stock was trading at 39 a share the day before 
grand met launched its 60pershare hostile takeover bid oct 4 
pillsburys stock closed at 62 friday on the new york stock 
exchange it opened today at 65 
the price is fair carnes said its a good thing from 
several standpoints the takeover fight has been drawn out too 
long i think its had an effect on the operations at pillsbury so 
maybe grand met can start putting that back together quickly 
the takeover of pillsbury is the latest in a wave of mergers and 
recapitalizations that have swept through the foods industry in 
recent years 
it also comes less than a month after another giant of the 
industry rjr nabisco agreed to be taken over in a leveraged 
buyout the 25 billion deal was the largest in us corporate 
history 
the tender offer made by grand met the british real estate 
liquor and gambling conglomerate expires at midnight jan 3 unless 
extended according to a statement issued by both companies 
as of the close of business friday 61848918 of pillsbury 
common shares representing about 72 percent of the companys more 
than 86 million outstanding shares had been tendered to grand met 
and not withdrawn 
pillsburys 15 board members urged stockholders to tender their 
shares to grand met 
we are pleased that we have succeeded in protecting the 
interests of our shareholders employees franchisees and 
communities and that we have reached a negotiated agreement that 
works to the advantage of everyone said philip l smith chairman 
and chief executive officer of pillsbury 
ian a martin chief executive of grand mets us operations 
said grand met officials also are pleased with the agreement 
pillsbury is the perfect fit to enable grand metropolitan to 
achieve its strategy of becoming a world leader in foods and 
retailing as well as the drinks sector martin said 
grand mets products and services in the united states include 
alpo petfoods and pearle vision centres 
pillsbury which started as pillsbury flour mills with a single 
flour mill in minneapolis in 1869 makes pillsbury flour green 
giant vegetables and a variety of other products in addition to 
burger king it owns benningans and steak amp ale restaurant chains 
during the fiscal year that ended may 31 the company had nearly 
62 billion in revenues it employs 104000 people 
last month pillsbury announced it would make burger king a 
separate company complete with its own board of directors and newly 
issued stock the spinoff was to occur today 
the move had been widely viewed as a lastditch effort by 
pillsbury to fend off grand met

it was a year that gave corporate debt a 
frightening new dimension a year in which everything from car 
rentals to cheerleader outfits tv guide to bloomingdales plumbing 
supplies to paper towels all somehow were affected by a 
megabilliondollar runup in borrowing 
within a few months of the worst stock market debacle in modern 
times american companies scrambled as never before to merge spin 
off sell out pare down and restructure all in the name of 
efficiency growth competitiveness and longterm survival 
the orgy of dealmaking reminiscent of the 1920s corporate 
borrowing binge that preceded the great depression has raised 
disturbing questions about the direction us business will take as 
it struggles to meet the mortgage 
since 1982 us companies have doubled their debt to nearly 2 
trillion an estimated 25 percent of their cash flow is used to 
service debt money that theoretically could be used for investing 
in research training or expansion 
in 1988 alone the dollar amount of mergers and acquisitions 
financed largely with borrowed money totaled more than 200 billion 
enough to wipe out the us trade deficit and erase a good chunk of 
third world debt 
many economists are concerned about what will happen if highly 
indebted companies someday cannot pay the interest they owe they 
say stores will shut factories will close tax revenues will 
tumble unemployment will soar 
some fear that the billions of dollars in investment needed to 
keep american companies competitive could be sacrificed to pay debt 
giving foreign economic rivals such as the japanese even more of an 
edge 
others say bankers insurers and pension funds that loaned the 
money for takeovers will wind up holding securities that could sell 
for 50 cents or less on the dollar a domestic version of the third 
world debt disaster 
i must admit i view with alarm whats going on now said 
sandra shaber an economist at the futures group a washingtonbased 
consulting firm these increased debt levels if we go into 
recession would be quite worrisome 
the rising corporate debt already is rippling through the economy 
in troubling ways such as higher interest rates increased 
bankruptcies layoffs and greater use of cheap parttime and 
temporary workers to cut costs 
those 30 percent discount christmas sales at macys and 
bloomingdales havent been meant to raise holiday cheer the owners 
of these stores need quick cash to service the enormous debt loads 
of their restructured companies 
when the diversified manufacturer interco inc announced it was 
closing two florsheim shoe factories in early december a huge debt 
restructuring to thwart a hostile takeover was to blame 
when workers of trans world airlines and eastern airlines asked 
the government earlier this year to review whether the owners run 
safe operations they said high debt in those carriers were hurting 
maintenance and preventing investment in new planes both airlines 
were bought on borrowed money 
last july the revco ds drug chain became the first big 
debtfinanced takeover company to seek bankruptcy protection from 
creditors while it generates 100 million in cash a year thats 
nowhere near enough to service more than 1 billion in debt 
its our feeling that with the amount of money raised in the 
buyout market in the last several years the amount of deals done 
and the levels done youre going to see a substantially greater 
amount of defaulted and bankrupt companies coming out said james 
bennett chief executive officer of rd smith amp co a new york 
firm that trades in distressed companies bonds 
just in the last few months bennett says the volume of 
distressed bonds has equaled the total hed seen in more than than 
three years and if you start to have a recessionary period 
theres going to be a ton of them 
the concern about corporate debt and its broader impact isnt 
limited to economists labor unions and bond traders even some of 
the most aggressive promoters and beneficiaries of debtfinanced 
takeovers have expressed concern about whether the dealmaking has 
gone too far 
todays financial age has become a period of unbridled excess 
with accepted risk soaring out of proportion to possible reward 
said theodore j forstmann head of the new york takeover firm 
forstmann little amp co 
every week with everincreasing levels of irresponsibility 
many billions of dollars in american assets are being saddled with 
debt that has virtually no chance of being repaid 
even as concern rises about the implications of rising corporate 
debt more managers are lining up lenders to help buy their 
companies or prevent outsiders from doing so 
a recent study by drexel university finance professor george 
tsetsekos suggested that among companies that bought back their own 
stock to boost share values after the october 1987 crash one in 
four was increasing debt levels partly as an antitakeover move 
bank lenders historically burned by bad real estate and latin 
american loans havent expressed much reticence about the latest 
borrowing wave either despite a blunt warning by federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan to carefully evaluate their takeoverloan 
portfolios 
a fed survey earlier this year suggested that 15 percent of 
commercial and industrial loans were related to mergers and at some 
big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent 
one of the key catalysts in this new avalanche of debt is the 
takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or lbo in which a 
buyer with practically no money can purchase a company using its 
assets as collateral for loans sell pieces of the company to repay 
those loans and make a profit in the process 
the result has often been a trimmeddown and highly efficient 
private company liberated from the obligation of paying quarterly 
dividends to shareholders and able to concentrate on its business 
but it may also result in so much indebtedness that management 
becomes preoccupied with paying it back

the leveraged buyout has been extolled denounced and intensely 
debated it has brought out both the best in management skill the 
worst in wall street greed and the concern of lawmakers 
theres something seriously wrong when theres more of an 
incentive for corporate managers to liquidate their own companies 
for their own personal financial benefit than there is an incentive 
for them to make the company more competitive said edward d 
markey dmass one of several legislators expected to conduct 
hearings into leveraged buyouts in 1989 
ironically most ordinary american families probably dont even 
notice how increased corporate debt is part of their daily routine 
like an invisible gas the leveraging of us companies is subtle 
silent gradual everywhere 
if they shop at safeway read tv guide rent a car from avis buy 
dolly madison paper towels shave with a gillette trac ii order 
goodyear radials for the car or install an american standard 
bathtub some of their spending money goes to pay down an enormously 
increased corporate debt 
thats only a result of some of the biggest deals the vast 
majority of debtfinanced restructurings affects smaller companies 
rarely mentioned in the news but just as much a part of everyday 
american life 
for example cheerleader uniforms supplied to most schools come 
from cheerleader group inc a company formed from a 46 million lbo 
engineered last june ten midwest states use fire hydrants supplied 
by water products co which underwent a 20 million managementled 
debt restructuring in december 
despite the growing clamor about where all this debt is leading 
there are passionate defenders of lbos who say the concept of debt 
is widely misunderstood in their view debt is a tool a way to 
exploit money to maximum advantage and should not be viewed as a 
threat 
one of the biggest missing ingredients in congress right now is 
information and understanding about lbos said henry kravis 
principal of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a small but powerful 
investment firm that is the undisputed leader of the technique 
were not going to take the heart out of a corporation he 
told fortune magazine in an interview people who produce things 
will stay we look at the people who report to people who report to 
people well often cut fat at the corporate level 
thered be much less of this and companies would be valued 
more accurately if chief executives felt the pressure from their 
directors to do the cutting that they only do when theyre 
threatened by a takeover 
to a large degree it was kraviss firm that heightened the 
controversy over debtfinanced takeovers its biggest triumph so far 
is the record 245 billion purchase of foodtobacco giant rjr 
nabisco inc announced nov 30 after a bidding brawl that some 
considered a symbol of corporate gluttony 
many will be watching closely to see how rjr manages or even 
survives under a quadrupled debt load of 23 billion some 
forecasters believe kohlbergs triumph also could become its 
greatest defeat and help sour corporate americas appetite for 
borrowed money 
the revco ds bankruptcy was a warning said robert h rock 
president of the philadelphiabased business information firm mlr 
enterprises inc in the december issue of corporate restructuring 
an industry newsletter the rjr nabisco deal may lead us closer to 
the brink

the takeover wave that swept across the corporate 
landscape in 1988 established new highwater marks for dealmakers 
and obliterated the notion that some companies are invulnerable to 
attack 
a lot of companies thought they were safe because they were too 
large said portfolio manager ernest wiggins of the fidelity value 
fund in boston 
but after the megadeals reached in 1988 capped by the proposed 
record 245 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc managers realized 
there is no such thing as being too big to be taken over said 
michael bradley professor of finance and law at the university of 
michigan 
take the case of edward p evans who began the year as chairman 
of macmillan inc but left the publishing and information services 
giant now owned by a british concern after one of the years most 
bruising takeover struggles 
evans had been given good marks by financial analysts for 
improving the profitability of macmillan since taking over in 1980 
the stock market showed its appreciation by pushing the companys 
stock price up more than 12fold during his tenure but it wasnt 
nearly enough 
the day before macmillans annual shareholders meeting last may 
a group led by texan robert bass proposed a buyout at 64 a share a 
26 percent premium over the companys closing price that day 
six months later evans was gone and the company was no longer 
independent despite deploying an arsenal of takeover defenses a 
restructuring hefty severance agreements for top executives a 
poison pill to deter hostile bidders and the assistance of a 
friendly suitor 
company management recruited the acknowledged leader in the 
leveraged buyout business in an effort to acquire the company itself 
and was twice declared the winner in the bidding 
but evans ultimately lost to a persistent rival from britain who 
tripped him up in the courts and won the company by simply offering 
more cash 
william f reilly macmillans president who was allied with 
evans but has stayed on after the acquisition by publisher robert 
maxwell says the defense strategy was like putting just a little 
more glass on the bathroom floor 
it failed he said because nothing stops an allcash offer 
martin sikora editor of mergers amp acquisitions magazine in 
philadelphia said the value of takeover deals in 1988 may shatter 
the record of nearly 205 billion set two years ago even though the 
number of deals was down 16 percent through october from a year ago 
he credits the growing presence of buyout funds set up 
specifically to reap huge returns by buying an undervalued company 
and either running it better or selling it in parts for driving 
the stakes in the takeover wars higher it has created competition 
for deals he said 
sikora estimates there is 25 billion to 30 billion invested in 
such funds that could be used to borrow up to 300 billion for 
takeovers 
fidelitys wiggins said the huge amount of money expressly 
earmarked for takeovers has enabled dealmakers to start considering 
the larger companies as targets rather than simply the mediumsized 
companies previously scrutinized 
thats a lot better for me because the deepest discounts in 
terms of market price versus private value is often in the big 
capitalized stocks wiggins said 
peter linneman professor of finance in public policy at the 
university of pennsylvanias wharton school of business said recent 
dealmaking shows how managements focus has shifted from running the 
company well to getting returns for the shareholder 
in the old days management said it was its objective to 
generate cash flow and if the market doesnt see it so be it 
but what management has realized is right or wrong if the market 
doesnt accurately reflect value someone will come in who will 
he said 
wiggins said he thinks the trend toward bigger deals should 
continue especially as foreign companies enter the fray more 
heavily 
michigans bradley said the trend may depend on how the courts 
ultimately view the growing efforts by various states to enact laws 
giving corporate managements a veto over hostile takeovers 
linneman from wharton said he doubts that congress will amend the 
tax laws to limit the deductibility of interest on money borrowed 
for takeovers you have corporate america on both sides of each 
issue he said 
charles minter a partner in the investment advisory firm 
comstock partners said the debtfinanced buyout craze may turn out 
to be a costly fad like lending to the oil industry was in the 
1970s 
we see where the banks are lending their money and stay away 
from those areas he said there will be some deal that comes 
along to break their backs

like the stock market crash of 1987 the great 
american borrowing binge of 1988 holds the potential for economic 
disaster 
but unlike the onetime shock of collapsing stock values which 
the economy proved resilient enough to overcome the unprecedented 
accumulation of debt threatens longterm indigestion 
the economys course is impossible to predict of course no one 
knew when the current expansion began in 1982 that it would still be 
going six years later a peacetime record the next recession may 
turn out to be just a brief mild slump 
but some economists believe debt has made the economy so fragile 
the next time it falls it may break rather than bend 
what you have to worry about in all these things is whether 
theres a serious threat of bank trouble said charles 
kindleberger a retired massachusetts institute of technology 
economist 
the crash of 1987 took the mania out of the stock market but now 
leveraged buyouts seem to have picked up in a manic way said 
kindleberger author of a 1978 book manias panics and crashes a 
history of financial crises 
leverage is a concept americans grasp young when they first 
notice that one child at the long end of a seesaw can hold up two on 
the short end a loan likewise expands a persons or companys 
financial potential 
but seesaws can suddenly tip the other way and so can loans 
some corporate debtors may be gambling that they will be 
protected from the consequences of their actions by the federal 
reserve the nations central bank which would open the money 
spigots in a recession to keep them from defaulting 
the problem is that easy money while good for lbo artists means 
high inflation for everybody else so far there is no sign that the 
fed is going easy on the money supply in fact it has tightened 
because the economy is growing strongly the acid test will be the 
next downturn 
here are the flash points 
corporations are loading up on debt to finance takeovers to 
escape takeovers or simply to take advantage of the tax 
deductibility of interest payments in the mid1970s corporations 
had 5 of pretax profit for each dollar of interest they paid now 
they scrape by with 2 
banks are lending money for leveraged buyouts and commercial 
real estate the same way they once lent liberally to latin america 
things are already shaky although 1988 will be a record year for 
bank profits it will also set a record for bank failures 
business is not alone in the debt pileup families are borrowing 
to make up for the stagnation in wages and salaries that began in 
the 1970s and household debt is at record levels 
what makes leveraged buyouts a particular concern is that 
borrowers admit in many cases that the only way they can pay off 
their loans is by selling off assets the question is to whom 
the crash of 1987 proved to stock investors that buyers like 
taxi cabs in the rain become scarce just when you need them most 
buyers may be just as scarce when the economy slumps and indebted 
companies desperately need to sell assets to pay interest 
even aside from lbos corporate america has become so attracted 
to debt that a aaa bond rating is almost an embarrassment in some 
circles a sign to some that a company is not sufficiently 
aggressive 
it is true that companies in japan and west germany are more 
heavily indebted than american companies but banking companies in 
those countries directly or indirectly own big stakes in the 
borrowers so they make sure they will not fail in the united 
states banks and bondholders are less sympathetic 
using a computer simulation the brookings institution calculated 
that one big us corporation in 10 would run out of cash by the end 
of the second year of a recession as bad as the last one 
we are going to go into the next recession with basically half 
the interest coverage we had prior to the 198082 downturn wed 
have to expect that there are going to be more corporate defaults 
said john lonski senior economist at moodys investors service inc 
the great danger is the following when a company finds itself 
in a position where it has become difficult to satisfy its interest 
obligations it has to come up with cash to stave off bankruptcy it 
does it by laying off workers reducing operations 
but if many companies are forced to do this what will then 
happen is the recession will become all the more intense that is 
the great worry that all fed policymakers face when they go ahead 
and tighten the money supply lonski said 
other economists say the debt danger can be overdrawn it is not 
clear that raising money by issuing debt endangers the economy more 
than raising money by selling stock said robert dugger chief 
economist of the american bankers association 
any recession that is so bad that it triggers a cascade of 
defaults is already so deep that everybodys pretty much wiped out 
anyway dugger said 
still economists agree that reversing the long decline in the 
national rate of savings would put the economy on a sounder footing 
ironically the feds success in wringing inflation out of the 
economy in the 1980s raised debt burdens by setting off an explosion 
of distress borrowing consumers businesses and the government took 
on new debt to service the old 
federal spending which is often fingered as a culprit in the 
american debt binge may be getting more than its fair share of 
criticism the federal budget deficit is actually shrinking as a 
portion of economic output and is smaller proportionately than in 
japan or west germany 
if americans saved more the united states as a whole 
government corporations and individuals would not need to borrow 
so heavily from overseas the trade deficit would fall and 
foreigners would not be able to buy up as many american factories 
and treasury bills 
as 1989 begins there are some reasons to think the debt binge 
may be dampened soon 
in the coming session congress will consider removing the tax 
advantages of loading up on corporate debt by eliminating the 
deductibility of some portion of junk bond interest payments 
federal regulators may press banks that make risky lbo loans to 
build their loanloss reserves or raise their capital above required 
minimums 
aside from government action the markets themselves are 
beginning to put a lid on leveraged buyouts by shying away from the 
riskiest corporate bond issues 
in contrast to other debt crises the credit risk of merger mania 
is getting plenty of publicity and that may be the best thing for 
it

the buyout binge on wall street played a major 
role in putting the stock market averages in the plus column for 
1988 
but many observers worry that the participants in this frenzy 
racked up shortterm gains at the expense of potential longterm 
pain in the marketplace 
in early december jeffrey applegate an analyst at the 
investment firm of tucker anthony amp rl day inc calculated that 
takeover activity directly accounted for nearly a third of the 
overall increase recorded by one widely followed measure of stock 
prices 
at the time standard amp poors composite index of 500 stocks 
showed a 1291 percent rise since the beginning of the year of 
that applegate reckoned 37 percentage points stemmed from 
takeover stocks 
harder to quantify was the amount of the overall increase that 
stemmed from buying in nontakeover stocks based on the 
expectation or hope that the companies in question might someday 
be bought out at higher prices 
in fact the takeover game has prompted a significant change in 
the way many stock traders and analysts evaluate stocks for their 
profit potential 
instead of looking at a companys business prospects or its 
chances for earnings and dividend growth the new way of gauging 
value is to try to calculate what a stock might fetch if it were to 
become a takeover target 
takeover specialists and their advocates say they are acting in 
favor of all holders of the stocks that get put in play 
after all they say when a stock gets caught up in a bidding 
war everybody who owns it gets the benefit of the increase in its 
price along with the raiders and professional traders known as 
arbitrage who generate most of the activity 
if anybody has a complaint about this bidding they argue it 
shouldnt be people who have a stake in higher stock prices 
but the many skeptics and critics who have watched as the stakes 
of the game reached new heights say it almost inevitably will lead 
to trouble 
if something comes along to curtail or stop the action such as 
legislation to discourage it an important prop under the stock 
market will be removed 
and if the mania keeps up they contend it can only increase the 
dangers of exessive debt and speculative risk 
with the burgeoning bundle of money and credit being amassed in 
buyout funds the result is bound to be too much money chasing too 
few good deals said george putnam iii in his bostonbased 
investment advisory publication the turnaround letter 
in many ways a leveraged buyout is like buying stock on 
margin in other words with only a partial down payment putnam 
added 
however in an lbo you can borrow 90 percent of the purchase 
price instead of 50 percent when you buy stock on margin 
the last time you could buy stock by borrowing 90 percent of 
the purchase price was 1929 need we say more 
analysts at salomon brothers inc say restructuring activity 
should extend into 1989 limiting downside risk in the market but 
also continuing to alienate traditional investors 
at present there is essentially only one buyer of stocks the 
corporate insider 
companies that acquire their own stock or the shares of other 
companies nonmanagement groups that prepare leveraged buyouts and 
raiders all possess inside information of the legal variety they 
have more knowledge than does a seller by virtue of who they are 
by contrast traditional investors both domestic and foreign 
are highly skeptical about the process of restructuring companies 
and the increased commoditization of us equities these investors 
have therefore retreated from the market 
detractors of the buyout wave tend not to mince words among the 
ingredients in what he calls a recipe for disaster in the 
market rochester ny investment adviser charles laloggia cites 
investment bankers who are leveraging corporate america to the 
hilt at monstrous interest rates at the height of the economic cycle 
for no reason other than the fact these transactions generate huge 
fees 
and buyouts by management have drawn some especially pointed 
objections 
the public has always felt that the market was dominated by the 
big players and program trading reinforced that view said 
raymond f devoe jr at legg mason wood walker inc 
the public has always suspected that the market was manipulated 
by insiders and the boesky et al scandals confirmed that view 
now the public finds that you cant even trust the highly paid 
management of your company to act in the stockholders interests

corporate americas reliance on borrowed money 
was never more prevalent than in 1988 when a flood of takeover 
activity was unleashed 
businesses swallowed each other up with a vengeance regardless 
of size and those that tried to resist were forced to make drastic 
structural changes to finance these acquisitions leveraged buyouts 
or restructurings many firms turned to the 180 billion public 
junk bond market where companies whose credit ratings are 
below investment grade offer high interest rates to compensate for 
bigger risks 
once a last resort in public financing junk bonds played a 
pivotal role in the wave of takeovers this past year and have gained 
wider acceptance and perhaps even more respect in the eyes of 
investors and corporate executives 
as more and more companies use highyield debt to finance their 
growth it becomes a regular alternative in terms of raising 
capital said robert s waill managing director for highyield 
research at lf rothschild amp co its almost commonplace 
but all that has come at the expense of the highgrade corporate 
market which includes the elite 5 percent of us companies with 
investmentgrade ratings the nations breadandbutter 
manufacturers fears of large corporate takeovers and even bigger 
debt loads scared many investors away from bonds of indust 
companies this past year 
noninvestmentgrade companies are drawn to the junk bond 
markets seemingly endless supply of funds especially since it has 
enabled them to offer a price high enough to persuade a target 
companys shareholders to sell 
tax laws also have made junk bond financing attractive by 
allowing interest payments to be deducted as a cost of doing 
business companies that raise money through issuing new stock cant 
do the same with stock dividends 
and it costs less to borrow from the public than banks even 
though junk bond yields are usually around four percentage points 
higher than comparable treasury bonds 
as of middecember there were 148 public junk bond issues valued 
at 2717 billion 56 percent of which were used primarily for 
financing lbos or acquisitions according to the independent 
financialresearch firm securities data co just three years ago 
about 27 percent of the 1319 billion in junk bond issues were used 
toward acquisitions it said 
bond investors and traders are bracing for a deluge of big issues 
in 1989 largely as a result of kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 
record 245 billion buyout of consumer products giant rjr nabisco 
inc 
while the bulk of the financing 14 billion will come from a 
commercial bank syndicate 5 billion will be through junk bonds 
another 5 billion of existing rjr bonds is certain to be downgraded 
to junk since the enormous debt load will make it harder for rjr to 
pay off previous debts therefore increasing the risk factor 
it was that deal and other megadeals and proposals including 
philip morris cos 129 billion acquisition of kraft inc that 
sent the industrial bond market into a frenzy this past year bond 
prices plummeted and trading came to a virtual standstill on fears 
that any company regardless of size could become a takeover target 
or aggressor and in the process load itself up with new debt 
the socalled event risk fears consequently have hurt 
supplies in november alone domestic industrial corporations sold 
only two new bond issues in the united states totaling about 250 
million that was down sharply from six bond issues totaling 1 
billion the previous month 
while investors suffered some losses on industrial bonds theyve 
seen their rate of return on junk go up 
marshall b front who manages mutual funds for the investment 
banking firm stein roe amp farnham said the highyield bond portfolio 
has a rate of return of 1125 percent compared with 72 percent for 
the investmentgrade bond portfolio and 17 percent for equities 
the interest rates are very high and to some extent highyield 
paper represents less volatile surrogates to equities said gene 
wong a managing director at prudentialbache securities 
although mutual funds insurance companies and pension funds hold 
most of the outstanding junk bond issues around 70 percent foreign 
interest has increased significantly foreign market share now 
totals around 3 percent compared to just a small fraction a few 
years ago according to a general accounting report released in 
february and analysts 
the last six years of economic expansion have been a boon to the 
junk market by helping to keep defaults down but many portfolio 
managers worry that an economic turndown will reverse that trend 
were concerned that the junk bond default rate has not been 
tested in recent conditions and therefore were not certain that the 
total returns from junk are what they appear to be said philip r 
roberts a senior vice president for aetna life and casualty co 
aetnas 65 billion investment portfolio includes only 200 
million of junk bonds

if a time machine could transport the leveraged 
buyout artists of 1988 back to the 19th century those in arrears 
might be clanging chains in debtors prison denounced as dangerous 
for selling pieces of paper called junk bonds that promise 
rewarding returns 
the comparison shows how the treatment of debt and its 
consequences have changed so profoundly just in a short span of 
western history economists and bankruptcy experts say 
once seen as a symbol of shame scandal weakness and failure 
owing money has been transmuted into status confidence and power 
a company taking on debt is now considered evidence that its 
strong said joseph chervin a bankruptcy lawyer at the new york 
law firm of rosenman amp colin its like a person taking on a 
credit line thats something you flex your muscles about you feel 
good about it 
the modernday attitude toward debt is even more startling when 
compared with the practices of ancient rome where creditors had the 
legal right to cut debtors bodies into pieces 
back in the old old days if you were a king or an emperor or 
some high potentate you could borrow and if you couldnt pay it 
back youd chop the head off the lender said robert kavesh an 
economics professor at new york university if you were an 
individual and you couldnt pay it back youd be a slave of sorts 
william shakespeare articulated englands taboo toward borrowed 
money with the line in hamlet neither a borrower nor lender be 
for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the 
edge of husbandry 
in other words kavesh says stay out of debt 
a couple of hundred years ago defaulting even on a petty debt 
could land an english citizen farmer or shopkeeper in a state 
dungeon or on a boat to australia a onetime penal colony where 
many debtors were exiled 
up until the late 18th and early 19th centuries creditors in 
england had extraordinary control over debtors lives with the 
right to deprive them of their liberty until the debt was repaid 
historical accounts show that by the early 1800s there were eight 
debtors prisons in london alone with inmate populations ranging in 
size from less than a dozen to 600 most prisons were squalid 
filled with vermin and disease 
debtors prisons also were an important part of us history 
what is now the state of georgia was originally a debtors colony 
inhabited by violators of the socalled insolvent laws 
records on file at the new york public library show that in 1816 
nearly 2000 people of new york state were incarcerated for 
delinquent debts more than half of them under 50 each 
debtors prisons eventually were abolished a partial result of 
an industrialized society the development of a rational banking 
system and the evolution of bankruptcy laws but there are 
interesting relics of that era still on the books today bankruptcy 
lawyers say 
for example some state statutes enable creditors to seize 
property of debtors without a court proceeding in pennsylvania a 
legal provision called a concession of judgment allows a creditor to 
obtain a default judgment even if theres no default 
thats certainly a right that goes back to the days of debtors 
prison said neal d colton a creditors rights attorney at the 
philadelphia law firm of dechert price amp rhoads 
others say the symbolic burning of a mortgage is a throwback to 
the days when the yoke of debt could be joyfully discarded the 
shame of owing money forgotten but even that rite has changed in 
the era of borrowing to the hilt 
nowadays what you find is the burning of the mortgage instead 
of liberation is an invitation to refinance again said kavesh 
its an amazing turnabout 
on a larger scale wall street giants such as drexel burnham 
lambert inc and shearson lehman hutton inc pride themselves on 
their ability to aggressively borrow billions of dollars for 
takeovers through the sale of highyield junk bond debt 
securities it remains to be seen how much of this debt will be 
repaid though since most junkbond issues havent matured yet 
for 2000 years debt was condemned by philosophers said

by the numbers the news about leveraged buyouts 
and takeovers seems clear precise and exact to the decimal points 
in a numerical sense the news is clear doesnt everyone understand 
dollars and cents 
true perhaps but when did numbers ever tell the entire story 
in the wake of these corporate convulsions the business scene is 
strewn with questions about ethics and responsibilities about the 
proper use of borrowed money of the role of banks of the future of 
junk bonds 
so vast are the considerations that they begin with the ultimate 
naivete whats happening 
in the past five years 375 billion of corporate equities have 
been removed from markets in the same period the longterm debt of 
nonfinancial companies has about doubled to around 2 trillion 
much of this debt is of unknown quality that is the repayment 
ability of those raising the debt is unproven if borrowers renege 
it will have a severe impact on some of the big lenders such as 
banks and private pension funds 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan brings up another 
consideration he sees mounting private debt particularly corporate 
debt arising from takeover activity as limiting the governments 
options in managing the economy 
congress is concerned too and it should be since leveraged 
buyouts are subsidized by taxpayers that is the interest payments 
on such debt are tax deductible should uncle sam continue to 
provide such an incentive 
have bondholders whose investments fell sharply been abused 
the courts will see to that because some institutional buyers of 
corporate bonds such as pension funds insurance companies are 
suing they say they werent told of managements plan to cheapen 
existing bonds with new debt 
but where do those with less clearcut rights turn 
what for instance are the rights of employees whose company is 
purchased so that it can be broken up sold off its local jobs 
eliminated and its productive years ended 
doesnt the larger community have rights should it sit by idly 
while a once viable division is removed from the tax rolls after the 
town committed itself to new storm and sanitary sewers based on the 
divisions healthy future 
so serious are the potential consequences of buying selling and 
sometimes dismembering entire companies that it seems inevitable 
that even more basic considerations will arise such as the very 
definition of a corporation 
while such fundamental issues caused concern few were fully 
explored or in most instances even addressed in the chaotic year of 
mergers acquisitions leveraged buyouts and takeovers 
while the entire business of buying and selling companies creates 
these issues they were especially acute in regard to the officers 
and directors of companies in which insiders sought control through 
leveraged buyouts 
it might seem a safe assumption that nobody should know more 
about a company including its real value than those whose job it 
is to run it if you accept that assumption however you are 
confronted with a puzzle 
you must for example make sense of the attempted management 
takeover of rjr nabisco inc for 75 a share or 176 billion that 
is what management offered and it was widely heralded as a bonanza 
for shareholders 
quickly however a competing offer came from outsiders at 90 a 
share or close to 21 billion it meant in effect that 
managements offer was far less than the best left on the table so 
to speak were funds equal to the assets of such well known large 
companies as wang labs firestone or inland steel 
the bidding did not stop there however it continued until it 
exceeded 24 billion before managements own board of directors 
fulfilling its obligation to protect shareholders agreed to an 
outside groups offer 
had shareholders accepted managements first offer they would 
have made perhaps the worst deal in us business history 
thankful they hadnt accepted the lowball offer from rjr nabisco 
management many of these shareholders along with civicminded 
individuals and institutions remain concerned about what could have 
been 
unlike the matter of existing bondholders who felt they had a 
clearcut case for the courts many of these issues seem to fall 
into a judicial and regulatory nomans land that might require 
years to deal with 
are activities of corporate management covered by insider trading 
laws should they who possibly could be more privy to inside 
information than the managers of a company possessing it did they 
use it for their own benefit 
in the past two years a number of insider cases instances in 
which nonpublic information was used for private financial gain 
have been prosecuted in most instances the numbers involved 
only millions but in leveraged buyouts the numbers are well up 
in the billions of dollars 
if the securities and exchange commissions insider trading 
regulations are applied to leveraged buyouts the consequences could 
make these other insider cases appear piddling 
question do immediate disclosure regulations apply in leveraged 
buyouts should they 
consider that in matters involving a potential change in the 
price of a stock management is obligated to disclose information 
immediately clearly leveraged buyouts which always affect prices 
arent disclosed immediately 
another nagging question that could become an issue is this what 
assurance do shareholders have that managers in a leveraged buyout 
havent depressed operations knowing that improvements can be made 
later 
of all questions generated by the leveraged buyout binge one 
more than any other seems likely to be answered on the same 
dollarsandcents terms in which the deals were originally proposed 
it concerns the junk bonds 
socalled because they symbolize a very high degree of 
leveraging and therefore are theoretically more risky than 
wellrated bonds junk bonds face their first general test in the 
next recession whenever that comes 
the question will the highly leveraged corporations that issued 
junk bonds be able to sustain payments on these bonds if corporate 
income is reduced because of a general recession 
or will these fantastic buyouts become incredible failures that 
spread financial ruin

employees at a governmentowned 
uraniumprocessing plant returned to work today for the first time 
since a 10week strike halted production of a material critical to 
nuclear weapons 
about 400 workers were asked to report at 8 am after union 
members voted by a 31 ratio saturday to approve a partial contract 
settlement with the westinghouse materials co of ohio which 
operates the plant 18 miles north of cincinnati 
workers were taken by bus to a movie theater to attend seminars 
to teach them how to handle among other things leaks of lowlevel 
radioactive materials said plant spokesman bob walker he said 
production would resume after the seminars probably in several days 
they have to go through a daylong orientation meeting for 
retraining and safety walker said 
we have had some problems with radioactive materials outside 
their containment said pete kelley another plant spokesman 
the seminars were scheduled to satisfy workers complaints about 
safety at the plant kelley said the key issues in the strike 
however were fringe benefits and retirement programs 
the plant formally known as the feed materials production 
center is the only one of 17 federal nuclear weapons facilities 
that processes uranium other plants use uranium supplies have been 
partly depleted since the strike began oct 7 kelley said 
during the strike 250 fernald workers received layoff notices as 
a result of diminished production demands the plant also became 
embroiled in controversy when the us energy department admitted 
that radioactive material had leaked into the environment during the 
plants three decades of operation 
the department has pledged to clean up the plant although recent 
reports indicate the department is considering closing it 
westinghouse materials president bruce boswell estimated a full 
cleanup would take nine to 15 years 
i think you could walk on it without rubber shoe covers 
without putting on a smock and worrying about touching things 
boswell told the cincinnati enquirer in an interview published 
sunday but ill be long dead and gone before the need to keep 
monitoring the site is over 
residents near the plant recently filed a 300 million federal 
classaction lawsuit claiming radioactive waste emitted by fernald 
has harmed their health and property 
the lawsuit names the plants previous operator national lead of 
ohio inc and its parent company national lead industries as 
defendants 
westinghouse which took over the plants operation jan 1 
1986 is not named as a defendant 
the labor agreement approved by members of 14 unions represented 
by the fernald atomic trades and labor council provides for no pay 
increase but allows the approximately 400 workers who were not laid 
off to return to work and pursue up to 4000 safety and health 
grievances 
previously westinghouse had offered to pay workers 150 each to 
drop their grievances 
the agreement also provides for 1600 to be paid to each worker 
during the threeyear life of the contract a new health insurance 
program and the right of the unions to review but not reject the 
hiring of subcontractors at the plant

the justice department is investigating 
whether northrop corp officials received some of the 775 million 
the company paid to south koreans in 1984 in a failed attempt to 
obtain a jet fighter contract a newspaper reported today 
it is unclear which northrop executives are under investigation 
the los angeles times reported 
however a grand jury earlier this year subpoenaed northrops 
chairman as well as four former northrop executives who left the 
los angelesbased aerospace company following disclosures about a 
korean hotel deal to be funded by northrop 
the times citing unidentified sources also reported that a 
northrop consultant once paid to introduce company officials to 
korean leaders may have received as much as 1 million of the 
payments 
in seoul south korea authorities today arrested a south korean 
businessman and charged him with taking 35 million in bribes from 
northrop to promote the sale of the f20 tigershark fighter planes 
the businessman lee minha allegedly collaborated with a former 
korean presidential bodyguard park jongkyu who acted as an agent 
for northrop in trying to sell 200 f20s to south korea prosecutors 
said park a relative of lee died in 1985 
tony cantafio a spokesman for los angelesbased northrop 
declined to comment on the reports of broadened grand jury and irs 
investigations 
the internal revenue service has begun its own investigation of 
northrops 1984 payments to the koreans apparently to determine 
whether american recipients of the money properly reported the 
income the times said 
the federal grand jury here is investigating whether northrop 
violated the us foreign corrupt practices act by making with 
various payments to at least three organizations controlled by 
korean political operator park chong kyu the act bars us 
companies from making direct or indirect payments to foreign 
government officials 
most of the payments apparently were made to build a hotel in 
seoul as an indirect way to help the korean government finance 
purchases of the f20 fighters the times said 
northrop has said it invested in the hotel venture as part of a 
legal offset agreement to demonstrate that in return for the jet 
contract the company was willing to help boost the korean economy 
northrop also funded two other south korean groups controlled by 
park the dong yang express group and bankaborrow which apparently 
were involved to help sell and finance the f20 the newspaper 
reported 
but the aerospace firm never sold any of the fighters the hotel 
never was built and the money is unaccounted for 
northrop has filed a civil lawsuit in south korea alleging it 
was defrauded in the deal but the company never registered the deal 
with south korean authorities and a former northrop consultant has 
alleged the payments were part of a lobbying fund 
a parallel investigation of the funds by a panel of the house 
energy and commerce committee has uncovered evidence indicating that 
northrop consultant jimmy shin a former honolulu night club 
operator may have received 1 million of the money the times said 
through a subpoena the subcommittee on oversight and 
investigation obtained information on a 1 million bank draft to 
shin drawn on the korea exchange banks account with manufacturers 
hanover trust co that account is believed to be part of northrops 
hotel fund the newspaper said 
northrop has paid shin 102000 a year for several years for his 
consulting work including introducing northrop officials to south 
koreans 
the grand jury has subpoenaed northrop chairman thomas v jones 
former executive vice president welko gasich former chief financial 
officer william j mcgagh former vice president james dorsey 
former vice president donald foulds and shin 
the four executives resigned after the korean hotel deal was made 
public early this year all declined comment on the latest 
investigation the times said

csx transportation inc announced 
monday members of the united transportation union have ratified a 
labor agreement that will immediately reduce the size of train crews 
on about 30 percent of its operations 
the agreement covers csxt employees on the former louisville amp 
nashville clinchfield and nashville chattanooga and st louis 
lines the company said 
under the deal one of the two brakeman on most trains will be 
eliminated 
this breakthrough agreement is unique among major railroads 
because we can now immediately run freight trains in the covered 
areas with a locomotive engineer a conductor and one breakman 
without phasing in the reduced crews through attrition of the 
workforce said john snow csx president and chief operating 
officer 
he said the result would be a moreefficient freight service 
the agreement says employees in active service may elect to 
receive a separation allowance of 50000 transfer to another 
location and receive up to 20000 in relocation expenses or accept 
a furlough with rights to return plus a 15000 payment 
snow said the contract efforts are part of csxts goal of 
reducing employment on its 19state rail system to 30000 employees 
while reducing its route milage to 15000 from 20000 miles

grain and soybean futures prices were mixed to 
mostly higher monday on the chicago board of trade 
the market acted much better than anybody expected given the 
bearish news we started with said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
traders said both pits opened under pressure because of a lack of 
confirmation of a big export deal to the soviet union that set up 
fridays rally 
rumors the soviets would buy 400000 tons of soymeal and 25 
million tons of corn also was behind increased farmer selling over 
the weekend that selling was a second factor pressuring prices 
on top of that the market reacted early to reports of rain over 
the weekend in the soybean growing regions of south america and a 
forecast calling for more during the week ahead 
even though the bears pushed it down a little bit they never 
really broke it lespinasse said 
he said buying came from traders who discounted the bad news and 
had faith in the underlying values in the commodities 
on the close wheat was cent lower to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 437 a bushel corn was 3 
cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 270 a bushel

most dennys restaurants which boast an 
always open sign at each location will change policy for one 
day to allow employees to have christmas off but theres one 
problem 
since the restaurants are always open they never have to lock 
the doors in fact some dont have locks on the doors and others 
have locks that have never been used and for which keys cannot be 
found said joe herrera director of marketing 
this week the chain is installing new locks on about 700 
restaurants herrera said 
this is all new to us said jerry richardson president of tw 
services dennys parent company 
the la miradabased food chain also has to come up with closing 
policies but richardson said the dilemma is the price to be paid 
for holiday spirit 
since management has the day off we thought our thousands of 
field employees deserved the same courtesy he said 
about 200 of dennys 1221 restaurants are franchise operations 
and about 50 or 60 of them will stay open said judy lynes a 
publicist for dennys 
all the others will close at 7 pm christmas eve and stay closed 
through christmas day for the first time since the chain of 
restaurants was founded 35 years ago

hostile suitor farley inc has succeeded in 
forcing west pointpepperell inc to call a shareholders meeting to 
vote on a new board of directors the threatened textile giant said 
monday 
pepperell said in a statement from its west point ga 
headquarters it had confirmed that holders of about 27 percent of 
the companys common stock including farleys 98 percent stake 
had called for the meeting 
the pepperell board was required to call the meeting if requested 
to do so by holders of 25 percent of its common stock the statement 
said the board which probably would meet later this week was 
expected to schedule the meeting for feb 25 
on oct 25 farley offered 14 billion or 48 per share for 
pepperell an offer which the companys directors dismissed as 
inadequate they claimed farleys bid was an effort to get the 
company befgs from a thenincomplete 
takeover of jp stevens amp co inc 
farley the chicagobased manufacturer of fruit of the loom 
underwear and acme boots asked other stockholders on dec 1 to join 
in requesting the meeting in an attempt to thwart managements 
resistance to the tender offer 
farleys request for the meeting said it would propose to remove 
pepperells 11 current directors replacing them with an entirely 
new slate 
a farleybacked board would be expected to rescind certain 
poison pill antitakeover provisions from pepperells bylaws 
that would increase the cost of the billion takeover attempt 
however the scheduling of a meeting does not guarantee farleys 
efforts to oust the board would succeed farley still must seek 
support for its asyetunnamed nominees 
farley spokesman jack albertine said monday the companys stake 
in pepperell plus shares already tendered to farley give the 
hostile suitor about 56 percent of pepperells outstanding stock 
however the tenders do not carry voting rights 
farley objects to recent changes in the bylaws that allowed 
management to purchase additional shares resulting in a possible 
19 million profit to pepperell chairman joseph l lanier jr and 
12 million to president don j keller 
other changes benefiting management including socalled golden 
parachutes for directors have effectively prohibited any 
acquisition proposal or tender offer which lacks managements 
support no matter how beneficial to shareholders farleys 
request for the meeting said 
farley also has filed lawsuits challenging georgias 
antitakeover statutes 
pepperell the countrys largest publicly held textile 
manufacturer has countered with lawsuits claiming farleys bid 
violates security and banking regulations because it is financed 
with too much debt 
it also charges that farleys financial adviser drexel burnham 
lambert inc improperly has used information gained during 
pepperells takeover this year of stevens and that drexel is a 
fullfledged bidder in the deal and has failed to disclose that to 
regulators 
a federal district judge has agreed with portions of both 
lawsuits sending the case to the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals where a hearing is scheduled jan 11

pillsbury co fits grand metropolitan plcs 
international expansion strategy even though some grand met 
shareholders have been concerned that pillsbury was an ailing target 
that nobody else apparently wanted analysts said monday 
mineapolisbased pillsbury which has suffered poor earnings 
management turmoil and discontent among franchisees of its burger 
king fastfood chain said sunday it agreed to be taken over by 
grand met for 568 billion cash or 66 a share 
grand met originally offered 60 a share on oct 4 and no other 
suitor stepped in during the 2month takeover battle which largely 
was fought in the courts and the newspapers 
we see pillsbury as a real opportunity and very much look 
forward to get into it and work with the people there tim 
halford a grand met spokesman said monday 
chairman allen sheppard was not available for an interview 
halford said 
when completed the acquisition would be the largest nonoil 
foreign acquisition by a british company british buyers already 
among the biggest foreign purchasers of american properties have 
stepped up purchases of us companies in recent years spurred by 
the weaker dollar 
grand met has been one of the more active buyers engaging in 
several billion dollars worth of transactions in the united states 
and elsewhere in the past year 
also on monday grand met announced it acquired two european 
restaurant chains for a total of about 20 million pounds or about 
37 million at current exchange rates they are the west german 
wienerwald which operates 231 outlets and the spaghetti factory 
with five restaurants in switzerland 
pillsbury whose products include green giant vegetables van de 
kamps frozen fish and haagendazs ice cream fits in well with 
grand mets strategy of focusing on foods liquor and retailing and 
expanding those businesses worldwide analysts said 
grand mets own brands include j and b scotch whisky smirnoff 
vodka alpo pet foods and pearle vision care products 
andrew buchanan an analyst with hoare govett ltd said 
pillsbury represents a great deal for them even at the higher 
price 
its a good strategy buchanan said number one brands in 
the largest domestic market in the world should be susceptible to 
internationalization 
grand mets strong liquor operations have little room for 
improvement said ron littleboy an analyst with the investment firm 
nomura securities in london 
the other two areas retailing and food particularly food 
were starting to look like they were left behind very much uk 
oriented very strong brands in the uk with no international 
presence thats what pillsbury does 
pillsbury should give them those opportunities to see just how 
good they are in food littleboy said 
although the analysts said they were confident grand met could 
turn pillsbury around grand mets share price has been depressed by 
shareholder concern over the acquisition 
grand mets shares fell the equivalent of 18 cents to finish at 
789 in monday trading on the london stock exchange 
with so many people in the us saying how badly managed 
pillsbury was it has been harder for grand met to convince its own 
shareholders what a good deal it is littleboy said 
grand mets shares would be trading 15 percent higher had it not 
been for the takeover littleboy estimated which he said implies 
skepticism to say the least 
but given their grand mets record and their management 
personally i have confidence they can get pillsbury on the right 
track littleboy said 
here are details of other recent grand met acquisitions and a 
disposal 
on friday grand met announced the purchase of sears plcs 
william hill betting chain for 606 million cash 
grand met lost in november a takeover battle for irish distillers 
co plc which makes irish whiskey irish distillers was taken over 
by friendly suitor pernod ricard sa the french liquor company 
in early october grand met announced the sale of its 100hotel 
intercontinental chain to the seibu saison group of japan for 227 
billion 
grand met acquired the us distiller heublein inc for 13 
billion last year it bought usbased liggett group inc a 
tobacco company for 450 million in 1980

the european economic community monday 
agreed to go ahead with a ban on imports of hormonetreated meat as 
of jan 1 and tentatively adopted measures to counter any us 
retaliation against its ban 
the united states has threatened retaliation against eec imports 
of among others boneless ham canned tomatoes fruit juices and 
alcoholic beverages italy denmark and spain would be most affected 
by that 
the eec foreign ministers meeting here monday accepted a 
recommendation by eec external relations commissioner willy de 
clercq not to postpone the ban again 
late last year the eec delayed the bans implementation until 
jan 1 
we do not envisage a new delay as there were no political or 
technical reasons to do so de clercq told reporters 
de clercq said the ban will affect between 130 million and 150 
million of us meat exports a year us estimates have put the 
figure at 170 million 
were extremely disappointed we had hoped that reason might 
prevail said thomas o kay administrator of usdas foreign 
agricultural service if thats the decision that theyve made i 
suppose we have no other recourse except retaliation 
alfred kingon the us envoy to the eec told reporters that if 
the eec counterattacked against us retaliation the united states 
would itself take further steps it is fair to assume we will do 
something in response we are working on it he said 
klingon said the united states asked the eec on friday to delay 
the ban for a brief period to allow a new us administration and a 
new eec executive commission which both take office in january to 
settle the dispute he said he was disappointed the eec did not have 
the flexibility or the willingness to grant the request 
de clercq said the eec will exempt pet food from its ban imports 
of us meat but added we do not expect the americans to accept 
this 
he repeated the ban will be imposed for public health reasons 
but the united states argues the use of hormones to fatten animals 
poses no health risk and has said the pet food exemption did not 
remove its concerns 
the eec says pet food accounts for about half of the us imports 
but us officials say it represents only 30 percent 
the eec foreign ministers also tentatively agreed to counter any 
us trade retaliation in reaction to the eec ban on meat imports 
de clercq said 
this would involve a 100 percent duty on us exports to the eec 
of honey unshelled nuts dried fruit and canned corn that total 
1405 million a year but de clercq said a final decision will only 
be made after washington retaliates against the eec hormone ban 
depending on the extent of us retaliation other products might 
be added to the list de clercq said 
speaking of recent meetings with us officials to avert a 
transatlantic trade war over the hormone ban de clercq said 
dialogue of the deaf was continuing 
he said the eec was interested in limiting the damage of the 
conflict by finding ways to narrow the extent of a possible trade 
war 
in late november de clercq warned us retaliation against the 
eec ban would spark both retaliatory measures and action against the 
united states within the genevabased general agreement on tariffs 
and trade 
the eec has said its ban on hormonetreated meat is legal under 
the rules of the gatt the 96nation world trade organization

another virus has been discovered in packaged 
computer software raising further concerns about the safety of 
commercially available programs 
the latest virus was not dangerous and was spotted after only 
about 400 copies of the software had been shipped but it 
highlighted again the vulnerability of software producers to viruses 
this is widespread this is affecting the biggest names in 
software publishing you can think of right now across the board 
said dr bruce tizes a director and owner of macguide magazine in 
lakewood colo 
a virus is a fragment of computer code that attaches itself to 
other programs and spreads through a computer system some can wipe 
out or alter information while others such as the socalled nvir 
virus cause no serious harm 
the first known case of packaged software being secretly 
corrupted was in early 1987 in freehand a program from aldus corp 
of seattle the hidden program flashed a message on the screen 
conveying a universal message of peace but did not cause any 
harm 
the latest virus a strain of nvir was found in seven programs 
on a compact disk from quantum leap technology inc of coral 
gables fla the virus was detected with special virus screening 
programs 
the disk is the second edition of a cd rom called megarom that is 
for apple macintosh computers the virus infected the disk a type 
of compact disk used to store computer data when it was being 
prepared for duplication at nimbus records in charlottesville va 
according to john sands technical operations manager of the cd rom 
division of nimbus records 
sands said the virus came from a piece of software residing on a 
hard disk drive for macintosh computers that was manufactured by cms 
enhancements inc of tustin calif he faulted cms for not alerting 
its disk drive customers such as nimbus about the virus threat 
cms president jim farooque said in an interview monday that he 
had not been able to verify that the virus had come from his 
company he conceded some of his employees had told people at nimbus 
previously that the virus had come on a cms floppy disk used to 
prepare the hard disk for receiving data but he said its 
possible that they are communicating back and forth information 
that may or may not be true 
farooque said the company voluntarily was helping people get rid 
of the viruses without admitting responsibility for them 
quantum leap was alerted to the virus on dec 9 and began 
alerting recipients of the infected megarom disks last week 
according to the president robert burr the infected disks are 
imprinted with a green decorative pattern sands said new disks that 
are virusfree and have a blue pattern are being shipped out as 
replacements 
almost half of the infected disks were shipped to members of the 
computer press for review the disks are filled with programs known 
as shareware or freeware that are available for free from places 
such as computer bulletin boards 
computer viruses are far more widespread in commercially 
available software than is generally realized tizes said he said 
macguide was assembling demonstration software from major publishers 
for its own cd rom disk and found seven strains of the nvir virus in 
programs from seven major publishers 
invariably the companies didnt know about the viruses when 
he alerted them said tizes a medical doctor he said one had 
already made a recall of the infected disks which had been shipped 
out to pilot customers

takeover strategist carl icahn has purchased 
another 1 million shares of texaco inc raising his stake to 1622 
percent of the thirdlargest us oil company icahn disclosed 
monday 
in a routine filing with the securities and exchange commission 
icahn also included a letter addressed to texacos president james 
kinnear in which icahn denied rumors of improperly acting in concert 
with an unidentified investor to acquire texaco stock icahn is 
texacos largest single stockholder 
ive read with interest newspaper reports that unnamed texaco 
officials have been speculating that i may be acting with another 
investor or partner in connection with my texaco holdings icahn 
told kinnear 
while i think it is inappropriate for any texaco official to 
use the newspapers as a forum to speculate on my intentions i will 
nevertheless respond and tell you i am not acting with any partner 
or other undisclosed person with respect to my texaco holdings 
texaco spokesman peter maneri at the companys white plains 
ny office said texaco customarily declined comment on purchases 
of its stock 
in new york stock exchange trading monday texaco rose 75 cents a 
share to 5137 
icahn said in the sec filing that he holds 3967 million texaco 
shares including the 1 million purchased from dec 13 to dec 14 
for prices ranging from 5137 to 5237 he gave no reason for 
increasing the stake 
icahn has been increasing his pressure on texaco in recent weeks 
raising speculation he might resurrect a failed takeover bid for the 
company the largest us oil concern behind exxon corp and mobil 
corp 
last week icahn stoked the rumors by disclosing he had purchased 
26 million shares in early december for an average of 5037 a 
share 
securities analysts have said icahns moves evidently reflect his 
impatience at the pace of the companys postbankruptcy 
restructuring plan announced earlier this year that plan has failed 
to substantially raise the value of texacos 240 million shares 
outstanding 
last spring icahn made an offer for texaco valued at 145 
billion or 60 a share as part of a shareholder proxy fight to 
oust the companys board but his strategy was defeated by 
shareholders loyal to the board 
but since then texacos dismal stock performance has increased 
the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with 
icahn if he undertook another takeover attempt analysts have said

platinum futures prices closed sharply lower for the third 
consecutive session monday but recovered some ground after key 
south african producers implied the use of ford motor cos 
platinumfree catalytic converters might be limited to the united 
states 
on other markets coffee futures prices continued to rise as a 
dockworkers strike in the major producing country of brazil 
promised scarce supplies during the peak consumption season energy 
futures dipped as temperatures rose and grain and soybean futures 
prices fought off early pressures to register modest gains 
after platinum plunged the daily trading limit of 25 an ounce 
for two straight sessions officials at the new york mercantile 
exchange increased the limit to 3750 early monday and the january 
contract promptly hit the new floor 
thats when south african producers mounted a counterattack 
implying to analysts that fords revolutionary catalytic converters 
had replaced platinum with palladium a metal the plaqtinum 
producers contend will be ineffective in dealing with the leaded gas 
still very much in use outside the united states 
that may have helped shore up platinum said bette 
raptopolous of prudentialbache securities new york but its a 
good guess how much and how long 
the us market was responsible for 55 percent of the platinum 
used in catalytic converters so if its not a catastrophe for 
platinum she added its not far from one either 
most of the wests supply of platinum comes from south african 
mines ford which announced its technological breakthrough last 
week has declined so far to reveal the new materials in its 
converters 
platinum rose 450 for the spot month with the contract for 
delivery in december reaching 52930 a troy ounce but the precious 
metal declined 2920 to 3070 an ounce for the deferred months 
palladium also traded at the new york mercantile exchange was down 
215 to 440 
gold meanwhile was up 40 cents to 50 cents an ounce with 
december at the comex at 41440 a troy ounce silver was up 25 
cents to 28 cents an ounce with december at 611 an ounce 
coffee futures enjoyed a fourth straight session of gains at the 
new york coffee sugar and cocoa exchange as a dockworkers strike 
in brazil approached the oneweek mark and other central american 
exporters and south american rival colombia were saddled with 
problems of their own 
either theres harvest delays because of bad weather or 
transportation problems getting to port said sandra kaul analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
and even those that have the coffee in port are having trouble 
because theyre only allowed to export so much during each quarter 
and theyre already at quota she added 
coffee futures climbed 313 cents to 589 cents with december at 
14538 cents a pound 
a turnaround in weekly weather forecasts was called the main 
culprit in an acrosstheboard drop in energy futures at the new 
york mercantile exchange 
they got slapped down a notch because everybody was calling for 
colderthanusual temperatures and they got turned around said 
jim ritterbusch vice president for trading and research at carson 
petroleum inc in chicago traders bailed out of their long 
positions in heating oil and pulled everything else down 
crude oil slipped 014 to 041 cents with january at 1631 a 
barrel heating oil was down 075 cent to 127 cents with january 
at 5075 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 045 cent lower 
to 022 cent higher january at 4535 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices were mixed to mostly higher on 
the chicago board of trade 
traders said both pits opened under pressure because of a lack of 
confirmation of a big export deal to the soviet union that set up 
fridays rally 
rumors the soviets would buy 400000 tons of soymeal and 25 
million tons of corn also was behind increased farmer selling over 
the weekend a second factor pressuring prices 
and on top of that the market reacted early to reports of rain 
over the weekend in the soybean growing regions of south america and 
a forecast calling for more during the week ahead 
even though the bears pushed it down a little bit they never 
really broke itsaid victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
wheat was unchanged to 3 cents higher with december at 436 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
270 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with december

a federal judge on monday approved the sale of 
eastern airlines northeastern shuttle service to real estate 
magnate donald trump a 365 million deal that labor leaders had 
challenged as a unionbusting effort 
texas air corp the houstonbased holding company that is 
easterns parent firm has been trying to sell off the profitable 
shuttle arguing that struggling eastern needs the cash to survive 
but the carriers unions have argued that the shuttle sale is 
simply a guise for texas airs true motive to dismantle eastern 
whose 30000 workers are represented by three militant unions and 
eventually reconstruct it as a nonunion airline 
there is no doubt that an ongoing struggle has and will 
continue to exist between eastern and its unions us district 
judge barrington d parker wrote in his opinion however the 
court feels that equally plausible is the idea that management is 
seeking to rebuild the company and place it on a sound financial 
footing 
the transaction must still be approved by the department of 
transportation which must affirm that trump can operate the shuttle 
safely and manage it properly 
the flamboyant trump announced his agreement to purchase the 
shuttle for cash on oct 12 saying he would turn the shuttle which 
makes hourly flights among boston new york and washington into 
an absolute diamond 
he said he would rename the service the trump shuttle and 
redecorate its 17 boeing 727 jetliners including painting them with 
gold red and black stripes 
trump already owns casinos in atlantic city nj a helicopter 
service that flies between the gambling center and new york the 
plaza hotel in new york and other prestigious properties 
speaking from his new york office trump said he planned to begin 
service on the new shuttle in february 
this is now a business deal that does not have obstacles in its 
path he said 
phil bakes easterns president and chief executive officer said 
the carrier was gratified at the courts decision today 
were committed to focusing our energies on solving the real 
problems at eastern bakes added we want to resolve our 
economic problems at the bargaining table and would welcome the 
presence of the union leaders at the bargaining table to join us in 
moving this airline forward 
jack bavis chairman of the air line pilots association said 
were diappointed in the outcome but well continiue to do 
everything we can to secure the rights and future of eastern 
pilots 
bavis also said the decision is not a major setback in our 
efforts to prevent texas air from dismantling eastern airlines we 
are studying the options still available to us and will continue to 
pursue this issue in congress and elsewhere 
joseph guerrieri jr the washington attorney for the 
international association of machinists said the union was 
disappointed in parkers ruling and would appeal it 
our concern is for the employees who remain with eastern 
guerrieri said we believe this is the death knell for eastern 
the transport workers union representing easterns flight 
attendants also joined the suit 
on dec 2 the unions asked parker to block the deal saying it 
violated federal labor laws by undermining employees working 
conditions without bargaining over them first with union leaders 
but parker ruled that the shuttle deal did not trigger the labor 
laws protections he noted that in september the courts had 
approved a far more severe scheduling constriction by eastern that 
involved 4000 layoffs the elimination of service to 14 cities and 
the curtailment of 15 percent of the carriers flights 
the impact of the sale to trump shuttle pales in comparison to 
the impact of the september 1988 schedule change the judge wrote 
the shuttle which employs 850 people and makes 62 flights daily 
has been one of easterns few profitmakers earning an annual 
average profit of 17 million over the last five years according to 
eastern spokesman robin matell overall eastern lost 2337 million 
over the first nine months of 1988 he said 
parker wrote that if the unions are right and the airline is not 
truly trying to improve itself then easterns executives are 
acting out a cruel hoax upon the government and the public 
the passage of time should prove whether this is true he 
said 
trump who testified before parker on dec 7 has vowed to boost 
morale at the shuttle and to recognize the unions but has declined 
to guarantee current wages for the employees eastern has offered to 
retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain with the company 
texas air announced in february that it would sell the shuttle 
for 225 million to a new subsidiary it planned to form but 
easterns unions blocked that transaction in the courts and texas 
air chairman frank lorenzo announced in july that the deal had been 
canceled 
since he acquired eastern the nations sixth largest carrier in 
1986 lorenzo has been embroiled in bitter disputes with the unions 
representing the carriers mechanics pilots and flight attendants 
lorenzo has sought wage concessions while the unions have countered 
with lobbying before congress and public relations campaigns 
the sale would give trump all 17 aircraft landing and takeoff 
slots at airports in boston new york and washington 14 airport 
gates and ground equipment

be performing relatively even with the industry and i certainly 
anticipate we will now outperform the market 
upstart hardees and struggling wendys have also had 
morepositive performances lately than no 2 burger king which last 
fiscal year totaled 54 billion in sales 
i think that they really believe that burger king is a diamond 
in the rough said steve lewis who owns 23 burger king 
restaurants in the northeast amid this whole takeover we burger 
king were the key to making this whole thing work 
thomas ferguson president of miamis beacon council which 
promotes the areas businesses and community said we see grand 
met as a savior 
pillsbury kind of treated burger king like a stepchild and 
didnt know what to do with it ferguson told the miami news on 
monday 
ian martin grand mets chief executive for us operations 
called pillsbury a perfect fit in helping grand met become a 
world leader in food drink and retailing 
pillsbury foods and burger king will play a vital role in 
helping us to realize these objectives martin said in a 
statement the merger will greatly expand grand metropolitans 
established presence in the huge us marketplace while enabling us 
to open new business opportunities for pillsbury in global markets

have a major impact immediately on their business 
its going to take some time nothings going to happen 
overnight said dennis lynch spokesman for wendys based in 
dublin ohio having a new owner will clarify at least whos 
calling the shots but that doesnt mean theres a strategic plan in 
place 
for wendys which has been recovering after slipping financially 
the past two years lynch said the confused situation at burger king 
has given us an opportunity to tell our message positively 
hardees based in rocky point nc has been growing fastest 
among the industrys leaders said spokesman jerry singer and 
should hold its own against any new burger king initiatives 
from mcdonalds oak brook ill headquarters spokesman chuck 
ebeling said the successful recipe of good service good value and 
cleanliness is what the industry leader concerns itself with 
we dont talk about our competitors or the industry ebeling

a federal judge rejected a plea 
agreement from developer john a kroh jr monday and sentenced him 
to two years in prison and ordered him to pay 650000 in 
restitution for bank fraud 
the case is similar to one that resulted in a 10year prison term 
for kroh thursday in missouri us district judge earl e oconnor 
sentenced the former president of kroh brothers development co to 
serve the twoyear term consecutively with the 10year sentence he 
received last week 
in the kansas case kroh pleaded guilty to two counts of an 
eightcount indictment on oct 14 under a plea agreement reached 
with federal prosecutors kroh admitted he understated his 
liabilities in financial statements to two kansas banks from which 
he was seeking loans 
prosecutors agreed to recommend probation but oconnor said he 
could not go along with the recommendation which he called a 
tremendous break for kroh 
the defendant in all likelihood judging from the missouri 
case would more than likely have been convicted here on all counts 
just as he was there oconnor said and in all likelihood a 
sentence on the order of what was imposed there in missouri would 
probably have been appropriate here 
the judge ordered kroh to make restitution of 400000 to capital 
city bank amp trust of topeka and 250000 to kansas national bank amp 
trust of prairie village 
the cases in the two states stem from the collapse of the kroh 
real estate empire 
krohs brother george kroh pleaded guilty in may to bank fraud 
and conspiracy he served two months in a federal prison his 
original threeyear sentence was reduced in july partly because he 
agreed to testify against his brother

first bank system inc will lose about 300 
million in its current fiscal year largely because it will book a 
500 million loss on the sale of a securities portfolio the bank 
holding company announced monday 
the bank will sell about 46 billion of its 75 billion 
investment securities portfolio because interest rates have risen on 
the money the bank borrowed to buy the securities said dick 
schoenke first bank vice chairman 
schoenke said the loss would not prompt the company to cut back 
on employment or on its branch system 
first bank is one of the nations 50 biggest bank holding 
companies and is minnesotas largest banking concern 
first banks expected 300 million net loss for the year would 
follow profits of 496 million in 1987 and 2029 million in 1986 
when the securities sales are completed in the first quarter of 
1989 total assets of first bank system will be approximately 23 
billion down from the current 283 billion ankeny said 
most of the securities to be sold are government bonds many of 
which were purchased during the third quarter of fiscal 1986 the 
46 billion portfolio is earning about 693 percent interest 
nearly as much interest as the bank is paying on the 41 billion it 
borrowed to buy the bonds and other securities schoenke said 
interest on the shortterm loans the bank took out to buy the 
securities was increasing threatening to surpass the amount of 
interest the bank is earning on the securities schoenke said 
by selling the securities before they reach maturity the bank is 
losing the 500 million of equity it used to purchase them schoenke 
said 
we decided to take this action because the anticipated economic 
costs risks and other implications associated with the portfolio 
hedging strategy could not be justified said dh ankeny jr 
chairman of first bank in doing so we have substantially reduced 
our risk profile and helped position the company for improved 
profitability 
the action has been reviewed by the federal reserve system and 
the office of the comptroller of the currency even accounting for 
the sales first bank still will exceed minimum regulatory levels 
for liquidity ankeny said

a federal judge ruled monday against security 
pacific national bank and the us comptroller of the currency in a 
dispute with securities dealers over the banks sale of 
mortgagebacked securities 
us district judge kevin duffy in new york ruling in a suit by 
the securities dealers association rejected the comptrollers 
decision to allow the bank to sell mortgagebacked securities backed 
by its own mortgage loans 
bank spokeswoman martha goldstein said security pacific the main 
unit of the nations sixthlargest bank holding company was 
considering an appeal she didnt know if the decision would force 
the bank to stop selling mortgagebacked securities pending appeal 
duffy ruled that the banks sale of such securities would violate 
the glasssteagall act depressionera legislation that among other 
things limits the rights of banks to enter the securities business 
the associations suit is against the comptroller and security 
pacific intervened on behalf of the defendant 
the dispute centers on the decadeold practice of banks and 
savings and loans to sell packages of mortgages on the socalled 
secondary market rather than selling single loans 
the association maintained in its suit that banks should offer 
the mortgagebacked securities through a dealer rather than 
packaging and selling the securities themselves 
in an unrelated matter a security pacific official disclosed 
that the bank had added 100 million worth of loans on arizona real 
estate to its list of nonperforming loans in the fourth quarter 
the change is balanced by positive developments elsewhere and 
doesnt affect the banks predictions that fourthquarter earnings 
scheduled for release jan 17 will show an increase over the third 
quarter said the official senior vice president jay gould

horton homes inc said monday it had fired 
87 employees who failed a recent round of drug tests slashing by 13 
percent the workforce at the mobile home manufacturer that is 
eatontons biggest employer 
the firings on friday which were precipitated by a round of drug 
tests that began last tuesday also triggered a wave of calls by 
jobseekers as word of the dismissals spread through the town of 
5000 about 60 miles southeast of atlanta 
rudy hicks the companys personnel manager said the company 
undertook the drug testing because apparent employee drug use was 
hurting production and quality 
we just cant operate with drug use hicks said theres 
too much dangerous equipment out there and it was costing us a 
fortune trying to put up with it 
most of those fired after failing drug tests friday were 
production workers although some were in management hicks said 
there is no union for production workers at the plant 
horton homes instituted a voluntary drug rehabilitation program 
three years ago hicks said but it had only limited success 
several months ago horton homes started drug screening for new 
employees and notified current workers they would be subject to drug 
testing 
hicks said the latest tests came after various complaints by 
plant employees about coworkers 
when we heard that several times in the last two or three 
weeks we just decided to go ahead and drug test he said 
ill promise you this this wasnt done without a lot of tears 
and a lot of concern theres more than just jobs here theres 
homes theres children theres christmases 
horton hired national health laboratories to carry out the 
urinalysis last tuesday testing for marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and pcp the procedure included a retest and 
verification for samples indicating drug use 
of the 87 fired 31 had participated in the companys voluntary 
drug rehabilitation program at one time or another hicks said 
horton homes officials had thought the tests would reveal a 
higher number of drug users hicks said further testing was planned 
hicks said some of the fired employees possibly could return to 
work at horton homes but that could only occur under stringent 
conditions for the employees rehabilitation 
hicks said the firings had knocked fire out of production in 
the plant friday but horton homes was swamped with job calls monday 
as news of the firings spread he said 
i had already closed applications for the rest of the year and 
now im probably going to have to open them back up hicks said 
we probably wont do anything until after christmas
