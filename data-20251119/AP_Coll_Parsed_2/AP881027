faced with thickening ice plunging 
temperatures and the imminent departure of two soviet icebreakers 
rescuers late thursday made a lastditch effort to free two whales 
threatened again by the arctic icepack 
the california gray whales freed from nearly three weeks 
confinement in their icebound breathing hole off point barrow moved 
closer to open water via manmade breathing holes and channels cut 
in the ice by the soviet ships 
but as night fell thursday the whales were in the last breathing 
hole cut for them with about 300 meters of ice between the hole and 
open water said rescue coordinator ron morris 
temperatures thursday hovered around 15 degrees below zero and 
were expected to drop to minus 20 to 25 degrees below overnight 
cold enough to begin freezing over the adjoining open water of the 
arctic ocean 
rescuers left a portable generator to power deicing equipment at 
the whales last breathing hole and light a beacon for the 
icebreaker vladimir arseniev which was to make two or three final 
runs to try to free the whales 
this should free them morris said hopefully the whales 
will see the opportunity to leave weve given them the best shot 
tonight morris said the soviets had to leave thursday night 
the plunging temperatures quickly refroze the channels the 
icebreaker had made earlier thursday eskimos broke out chain saws 
and cut dozens more breathing holes leading away from the clogged 
channel toward the open sea 
by nightfall the workers were encountering dangerously unstable 
ice as a result of the icebreakers earlier efforts 
as they did wednesday the whales readily followed the path cut 
for them by the eskimos as night fell they had advance as far as 
the last breathing hole 
in a new tactic rescuers carved 30 new holes thursday in hopes 
that the whales would follow the holes away from the channel and 
eventually reach open water via another route the soviet ships were 
clearing 
theyre ready to go home after nearly six months at sea said 
rear adm sigmund petersen of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration we felt also with the weather creeping in like 
this we had to do something tonight 
everyone hopes that when daylight arrives friday both the 
soviets and the whales will be gone petersen said 
noaa ice analyst gary huffard said the open water was definitely 
beginning to freeze but he remained optimistic that the whales 
could escape if they could get beyond the edge of the pressure ridge 
battered down by the icebreakers earlier in the week 
eskimos with chain saws had cut a series of breathing holes that 
allowed the whales to swim well away from the original hole to which 
they had been confined 
the whales grew accustomed to the cutting and during a frenzy of 
work wednesday in which 50 new holes were cut the whales 
repeatedly surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice 
was removed 
since the whales were accustomed to the noise of the saws that 
sound might be used to coax them forward toward open water said 
morris a biologist with the us national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the eskimos eventually worked the marine mammals to within a 
quartermile of a channel carved through the 18inchthick ice by 
two soviet icebreakers late tuesday and early wednesday then the 
icebreaker vladimir arseniev reopened the partially frozen channel 
the manmade channel aimed at guiding the whales to an natural 
open lead through the ice and eventually to open water 
partially refroze during the night morris said 
he said the whales were conditioning themselves back to 
reality after nearly three weeks of confinement in the ice off the 
coast near point barrow 
he also announced a crackdown on access to the whales by 
reporters and others he said pilots entering restricted air space 
over the whales were subject to fines of 25000 
a biologist for the north slope borough geoff carroll said 
thursday that the whales continued to appear healthy 
the fate of the whales may never be known scientists involved in 
the rescue that cost more than 800000 didnt attach radio 
transmitters to the whales to track them in part because of concern 
that the devices would only add to their stress said federal marine 
mammal biologist jim harvey 
a whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago 
apparently died last week 
the endangered california gray whales have one of the longest 
migration routes of all mammals 6000 to 8000 miles from summer 
feeding grounds in the arctic to the warm water off baja california 
their population has risen to about 20000 growing at an annual 
average of 25 percent for the past decade officials said

what could easily be one of only operas ever 
performed in ancient langauge of the aztecs will be staged at the 
pyramids of teotihuacan in mexico 
tenor placido domingo singing in nauhatl will star in the 
premiere of lalo schifrins songs of the aztecs on the stone 
stage of the square of the moon built centuries ago by ancient 
mesoamericans 
schifrin will conduct the mexico philharmonic at the oct 29 
event a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the 
aztec temple of teotihuacan an hours drive from mexico city 
american express has pledged 100000 toward the restoration 
the composer said doing an opera in nauhatl was not a serious 
problem the chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a 
foreign language he said 
i thought it would be better to do it in the original language 
with a translation the use of a dictionary and grammar i was able 
to work it out chocolatl was a secret drink of the aztecs we say 
chocolate our word coyote comes from their coyotetl 
he was helped by a nauhatl authority dr georges beaudo of the 
university of toulouse in france 
schifrin wrote the music after finding some precolumbian poetry 
in spanish by nezahualcoyotl 143272 
it was so beautiful i decided to use it he said the 
last line of the poem is it cannot be in vain why we come to this 
earth let us leave some flowers let us leave some songs 
for the oct 29 performance 10000 chairs will be set up a new 
sound system built and tv screens put in to provide subtitles in 
spanish and english were trying to make some of the prices very 
popular he said a thousand people are going to pay very very 
high prices i cannot tell you how much money it takes to preseve 
something that is very important to know where were coming 
from is going to help us to know where were going 
the pyramids at teotihuacan date from 100 bc to 100 ad 
the site of the concert schifrin said is in the city of the 
gods in a square of stone the square of the moon 
the square is raised its exactly the place for the full 
symphony full chorus soloists and conductor where musicians used 
to play 500 years ago he said it was a stage they built it 
for us along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways the 
whole place looks very impressive we go to greece and rome to find 
architectural riches but we have it right here 
that schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise 
those who know him either from his jazz days with dizzy gillespie or 
as a composer of more than 80 film and tv scores 
schifrin who is 56 was born in buenos aires where his father 
was concertmaster of the buenos aires philharmonic he studied 
composition and piano at the paris conservatory and returned to 
buenos aires where he became a composer arranger conductor and 
pianist in pop jazz and classical music 
ive seen opera since i was a child i had a dramatic instinct 
this is probably one of the first times im saying this openly but i 
think movies are the opera of today he said 
in the cincinnati kid where i had ray charles playing along 
with a symphony orchestra it was not pop music this was really 
serious music to me and i think to many people 
the score of bullitt is being played by symphony orchestras 
now i did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of 
cool hand luke 
he moved to the united states in 1958 and played piano in 
gillespies quintet from 196062 he composed gillespiana suite 
for the first record he on which he played with dizzy 
many people think i went to hollywood to make money she 
said i didnt have any idea about how much money i was going to 
make there is a group of composers in new york and there is no 
outlet to play their music duke ellington was the only example 
since haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music the 
reason i went to hollywood was there was an outlet for hearing your 
music you composed 
lately he has done less film composing and more conducting last 
december he became music director of the paris philharmonic their 
first recording together ravels mother goose stravinskys 
petrushka and schifrins double bass concerto with soloist gary 
karr is being released this fall 
i think music is to be shared and not only through mechanical 
means like records you can be in a theater or even a stadium doing 
something for several thousand people that is very thrilling

turbaned peasants trudge by prodding water 
buffalo and lugging firewood and taking little notice of the 
towering hollow structure from another time and for another universe 
surrounded by green mountains in an isolated corner of sichuan 
province the xichang satellite center and its 11story gantry is 
the takeoff point for chinas entry into the international satellite 
launching market 
the base normally closed to foreigners is on display as china 
enters final negotiations with washington on issuing us licenses 
for the launch of three hughes aircraft co satellites they would 
be the first american satellites put into orbit by a nonwestern 
country 
agreement has been reached on safeguarding us technology 
secrets during the launch process and establishing chinas liability 
in case of accident 
officials meet again in november to work out how to ensure that 
chinese prices much lower than those charged by the us space 
shuttle or european ariane services wont jeopardize the american 
commercial launching industry 
xichangs first commercial venture could come as early as 1989 
with the launch of westar 6 an old satellite retrieved by the space 
shuttle in 1984 for asiasat a hong kong consortium 
an australian company aussat intends to put two hughes 
communications satellites into orbit in the early 1990s 
china decided in the mid1970s to build a rocket base in this 
remote area because it is easy to defend sparsely populated and has 
clear winter days well suited for launches 
but while the base is part of chinas march to the 21st century 
it is surrounded by reminders of the middle ages 
the site is 40 miles north of xichang a small town accessible 
from the provincial capital of chengdu by twiceaweek airplane 
flights or a 12hour train ride 
on the road from xichang women wash clothes in streams water 
buffalo pull wooden plows through rice paddies and barefoot 
children scamper around mudbaked houses farmers spread their grain 
on the road so truck wheels can help grind it 
between launches the base looks abandoned 
the site run by the peoples liberation army employs 1200 but 
new buildings to house the 141foot long march iii rockets and 
satellites during prelaunch testing are almost empty 
windows in the gantry blown out during the last launch in march 
have yet to be replaced 
about four miles from the launch pad only two engineers sat at 
monitors in the gymnasiumlike control center a smaller control 
center built into the mountains at the launch site was not shown 
to visitors 
site officials say the simplicity of the operation is a main 
reason for its competitive prices and high success rate china 
reportedly can undercut space shuttle or ariane prices by as much as 
30 percent 
tong lianjie deputy director of the center said the price 
advantage is mainly because our launching facilities are simple 
reliable and practical 
he said the equipment all produced in china is relatively cheap 
and technical personnel in china have fairly low salaries we will 
not seek a high profit although of course we will seek a profit 
tong gave assurances china will not pose a threat to other 
satellite services because of the limited number of launches we 
cant be that competitive in the international market 
center officials said military control over chinas space program 
is another reason for its successes since 1970 when china became 
the fifth nation after the soviet union the united states france 
and japan to launch a satellite with its own carrier rocket it has 
had 23 successful launches and one failure 
military discipline is better than that of civilians who spend 
half the time smoking cigarettes and the other half working said 
wang yongde deputy director of the center 
chinas space program overseen by the ministry of aeronautics 
and astronautics is concentrating on building a more powerful 
version of the long march iii and adding a second launch pad at 
xichang by early 1990 this will give china the ability to put a 
payload of up to 88 tons in orbit compared with 14 tons at 
present and 12 tons for the space shuttle 
china has had feelers about its launching services from more than 
a dozen countries and has signed an agreement with brazil for future 
joint development of satellites for the study of earth

a cartoon shows a government 
soldier facing a guerrilla each holds an assault rifle but piled 
on the soldiers bent back are a us military adviser a human 
rights monitor and papers documenting rights abuses 
the guerrilla stands tall unencumbered 
the drawing in the office of col mauricio vargas chief of 
operations for the joint chiefs of staff illustrates how human 
rights are considered a burden by many salvadoran officers 
interviews with soldiers diplomats and judicial authorities 
suggest that only us pressure and fear of losing us aid keep the 
army in line 
abuses by the armed forces are far fewer than in the early 1980s 
when death squads were killing hundreds of people every month but 
two peasant massacres and a gang rape in recent weeks have raised 
concern 
amnesty international said wednesday that hundreds of suspected 
government opponents have been killed in the past two years by death 
squads usually made up of troops and police 
were only at the beginning of a long road toward respect for 
human rights obviously not at the end of it said judge rene 
zelaya who is handling the rape case 
the increased death squad activity comes with president jose 
napoleon duarte suffering from cancer and leftist leaders 
reentering the country after guerrillas agreed to let their 
political groups participate in a march 1989 presidential election 
duarte a centrist has vigorously opposed death squad activity 
leftists who fled because they feared for their lives said they felt 
they could return because death squad activity was down 
at the same time politically motivated slayings by leftist 
guerrillas have reportedly increased 
el salvador has received more than 3 billion in us economic 
and military aid this decade more than any country in the western 
hemisphere but us lawmakers have said continued aid depends on 
growing respect for civil liberties 
officers and troops are not afraid to say they see respect for 
human rights as a burden 
it limits our action said lt ali valdez of the elite arce 
batallion during a recent patrol of guerrilladominated hills in 
northern morazan province 
cpl jose antonio lopez said thousands of civilians killed by 
death squads in the early 1980s deserved what they got 
paratrooper sgt mauricio orellana said he favored the 1932 
solution to defeat leftist guerrillas at war with the usbacked 
government he was referring to the slaying by forces of 
thendictator maximiliano hernandez martinez of up to 20000 
peasants to quell a rebellion by a few hundred against landowners 
one recent massacre took place sept 21 when soldiers detained 
most of the residents of the hamlet of san francisco and accused 
them of collaborating with rebels 
the soldiers took seven men and three women to a ravine tied 
them up and killed them with grenades and rifle fire according to 
neighbors and relatives of the dead 
seven were shot in the head from less than six inches away an 
autopsy showed a judge issued arrest warrants for four soldiers 
but none has been handed over to judicial authorities 
human rights groups said they feared the investigation into the 
massacre the first mass killing of civilians in four years would 
make ordinary soldiers scapegoats and not focus on the responsible 
officers 
americas watch a private organization that monitors rights in 
the western hemisphere issued a report on el salvador on oct 2 
it said killings declined between 1984 and late 1987 before 
rising again and notes that no salvadoran officer or death squad 
member has been prosecuted and punished for a human rights violation 
amnesty international said dumped bodies frequently are found 
decapitated dismembered strangled or showing marks of rape or 
torture such as burns and machete wounds 
amnesty international said death squads intimidate government 
opponents by publishing death lists in newspaper advertisements 
and delivering coffins to the homes of intended victims 
zelaya has been handling the case of a 20yearold who says she 
was raped by 13 soldiers in the town of apastepeque 
zelaya asked the commander of the cavalry regiment whose soldiers 
allegedly raped the woman for the names of the men on duty the day 
of the attack he received no response 
in the most recent incident several men in army uniforms arrived 
the night of oct 14 in the hamlet of tres ceibas 11 miles north of 
san salvador and pulled four young men from their homes 
minutes later several shots were heard relatives found the 
bodies of the four shot in the head about 40 yards away 
rights groups blamed the army the armed forces said the killers 
were guerrillas masquerading as soldiers 
the roman catholic churchs legal aid office has noted a sharp 
rise in politically motivated slayings of civilians this year 
executionstyle killings of civilians by the rebels are likewise up 
sharply 
however the guerrillas usually take responsibility for such 
slayings which they call bringing to justice

the popularity of occultism 
including devil worship is growing among west germanys young and 
a newspaper said some even engage in the practices during breaks at 
school 
parents public officials and church leaders say 10000 
teenagers may be involved in occult practices ranging from seances 
to black sabbaths in which animals are sacrificed at cemeteries 
a frontpage report oct 8 in the influential frankfurter 
allgemeine zeitung carried the headline the occult is spreading 
in our schools 
it cited instances of pupils using breaks between classes for 
occult practices and said participants withdraw from other 
teenagers their thoughts constantly revolve around the puzzling 
world of the spirits 
in september a meeting of the national parents council issued a 
statement declaring the rise of occultism and magic practices 
among pupils indicates spiritual and psychological deficits in our 
society 
hansjoachim neuser spokesman for the northrhine westphalia 
state culture ministry said teens are using occult beliefs as 
they would a drug this is more than just an individual case or a 
passing fad 
he said officials the number of reports from schools was growing 
especially from religion teachers 
often the pupils themselves get scared they might have gone too 
far in their occult practices and turn to their religion teachers 
for help neuser told the associated press by telephone religion 
is a subject in most west german public schools 
occult practices among teenagers range from experimentation 
with pendulums or glasses to devilworship ceremonies calling for 
animal sacrifice neuser said 
the first practice mentioned involves calling on spirits to guide 
a dangling pendulum to letters or words placed beneath it in other 
ceremonies spirits of deceased friends or relatives are asked to 
move a glass coins or a table in response to certain questions 
among factors blamed for the turn to occultism are youth 
unemployment broken homes and pessimism about the future 
two teenage members of a group practicing devil worship were 
convicted of murder by a muenster regional court in october 1987 
they slit the wrists and throat of another cult member in what was 
to be a group suicide 
youngsters killed a cat during a black sabbath at a dortmund 
cemetery and ripped out its intestines the hamburg newspaper welt 
am sonntag reported on feb 21 
spiegel the weekly news magazine published a photograph oct 
12 1987 of a note it said was written by a ninthgrader in 
lahnstein and intercepted by her teacher 
i asked lucifer yesterday who is possessed by the devil it 
said and listed the names of 11 other pupils the magazine reported 
the rev walter schmidt of the lutheran central organization for 
world views in stuttgart said at least 10000 teenagers are 
involved to one degree or another in various occult practices 
a lutheran pastor in stuttgart the rev hansjuergen ruppert 
said teenage adherence to traditional religions is declining in 
concert with occultisms rise 
teens are in increasing numbers turning away from traditional 
religion and turning to the occult as a replacement he said we 
have to increase contact with them through church youth groups and 
by strengthening their bonds to religion the danger is that these 
children may continue drifting away from society 
neuser expressed fear of a deeper effect 
this involvement happens while the youngster is still forming a 
sense of values and responsibility if distant powers are supposedly 
controlling his behavior he never has to take responsibility for 
his actions

in the ultra orthodox neighborhood of mea 
shearim a bearded man in a black coat and hat used a stick to rip 
down a political poster prompting an angry outburst from a 
passerby 
i dont mind campaign posters but this is a personal attack 
explained rabbi mordechai shlesinger as he tore down the poster 
which attacked a rabbi aligned with the agudat yisrael party 
the incident reflects increasing tensions in the campaign leading 
up to tuesdays elections especially among religious parties whose 
swing votes may determine the next prime minister 
the campaign in religious areas has been marked by telephone 
threats and vandalism including swastikas painted on walls 
apart from the religious tensions labor party leader shimon 
peres has been doused with water and targeted by stonethrowers 
nine hecklers were arrested for blocking peres car on tuesday 
religious parties are expected to control 13 to 15 pivotal seats 
in the 120seat parliament or knesset 
if election results between the big parties are as close as 
expected both peress leftofcenter labor and yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc will court the religious parties to try to 
form a ruling coalition 
this will give the religious parties influence far beyond their 
numbers especially in legislation touching on education and social 
affairs 
balconies doors and walls are covered with colorful campaign 
symbols and posters in the normally staid mea shearim neighborhood 
of jerusalem and in the religious town of bnai brak near tel aviv 
but some of the writing on the rough ochre walls is threatening 
death to the leftists says one another slogan warns a leading 
politicians your blood will be spilled 
the issues in mea shearim are distinctly different from the war 
and peace questions being debated by labor and likud 
on one wall a swastika was placed next to the name of the 
citizens rights movement a liberal party with a strong stand 
against religious coercion such as the forced closing of theaters on 
the sabbath 
murder the pathologists and archaeologists said one scrawl 
underscoring ultra orthodox demands to ban autopsies and prevent 
archaeological digs near cemeteries 
the issue pits agudat yisrael which holds two parliament seats 
against a splinter group degel hatorah 
agudat yisrael accused its opponents of sending hit squads to 
vandalize property and attack agudat followers the independent 
nation newspaper said the squads consisted of men with sticks and 
metal bars 
moshe ravitz a spokesman for degel hatorah denied the 
allegations we tell our people not to hit back even if they get 
blows he said 
in television ads religious parties have stressed the need for 
more financial support to yeshiva seminaries and attacked social 
permissiveness they say has led to drug problems 
religiously observant voters account for about 20 percent of the 
29 million eligible voters and most of their political factions 
have drifted to the right in recent years but leaders do not rule 
out a deal with labor 
likud is closer to our views but i dont say now that labor 
cant change this rabbi moshe zeev feldman leader of the agudat 
yisrael 
labor members have been resistant to orthodox demands for sabbath 
observance and legislation outlawing nonorthodox conversions 
but feldman said in an interview in his bnai brak apartment that 
it was very important that the country should at least publicly 
maintain an appearance of judaism by observing religious law 
the only liberal religious party is the meimad a new group that 
broke away from the larger national religious party 
chaim rippel a meimad candidate for parliament said his party 
would try to heal the rift between religious and secular jews 
the partys views on the future of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip are close to those of labor although we believe that 
the land of israel belongs to us we are willing to make territorial 
concessions for peace he said

yves saint laurent played it safe with streamlined 
classics in his readytowear show for next summer 
short and edited down to essentials the show wednesday was a 
relief after other presentations that dragged out a hundred ways to 
create draped flowered sheaths for a sex kitten 
saint laurents fashion statement was short and pithy and the 
clothes often looked like simpler versions of his last couture 
collection just as deftly cut in their own way 
in day wear he led off with marinerinspired suits in navy or 
white broadcloth pants or skirts just above the knee with a 
slightly fitted battle jacket or fitted blazer both with brass 
buttons and topped with jaunty sailors berets 
saint laurent kept to his favorite shaped shoulders and short 
skirts though he also dropped some hemlines in fluid flared or 
pleated skirts to below the knee and longer to midcalf length in 
some pretty white belted sundresses with circular skirts 
saint laurents silk jersey sheath just barely caressed the body 
in tiny stripes it was crisscrossed by diagonal buttoned piping a 
perfect little navy pleated dress with a white collar and bow could 
not have been simpler yet had the masters touch 
saint laurent did not go in for the pyramidal trouser line 
sweeping paris but kept his pants long and straight in suits or 
narrow and cropped matador style for this peppy new line he 
teamed the cropped pants with fitted jackets that had big puffy 
sleeves in colors like bright yellow and turquoise damasked cotton 
pique 
with few exceptions the color themes were played in a low key 
black navy and white took precedence with autumnal hues of beige 
khaki and ochre not far behind jazzy colors popped up in bicolored 
suits in shades of turquoise lime or corn yellow the one flame red 
cotton poplin dress with balloon sleeves was a standout among all 
the sober clothes 
theres good news for those who cant afford saint laurent 
couture in readytowear he offered an excellent version of the 
tuxedo dress he did in 20 different ways for couture less 
successful but still fun was the bright bicolored suit with 
grapebunch embroidery on shoulders and pockets and even striated 
grapeshaped buttons 
catching the mood of the times saint laurent concentrated on 
simple crepe de chine dinner dresses rather than 
rhinestoneencrusted ball gowns loaded with flounces froufrou and 
lace short kimonowrapped silk dresses or variations on the 
shirtwaist in silk had a kind of studied throwaway simplicity 
for a finale there were goldbelted draped white crepe gowns 
the show left some in the audience hungry for more but there was 
nothing extraneous everything in this understated collection was 
wearable and chic

president reagan is seeking agreement from 
moscow on an onsite inspection proposal his administration says 
will make a strategic arms reduction treaty verifiable while 
shielding legitimate us secrets and interests 
state department spokesman charles redman said wednesday that the 
president recently made a number of verificationrelated decisions 
including some on the approach we will take to socalled suspect 
site inspections 
but he declined to spell out details while the ussoviet arms 
reduction talks are continuing in geneva the two sides are seeking 
to work out 50 percent cuts in their arsenals of strategic or 
intercontinental nuclear weapons 
redman said that while considerable progress has been made at 
the geneva talks much still remains to be done 
our intention in the start talks is to flesh out the details of 
our position including the details of a start verification regime 
so that there will be a complete us position on the table in 
geneva he said 
start will have the most extensive verification regime in 
history well beyond that of the verification measures of the inf 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
redman added that we are convinced that these provisions will 
make the treaty effectively verifiable at the same time we must be 
careful to protect legitimate us secrets and interests we 
believe the proper balance has been made between those two 
considerations 
redman also said the united states has completed its negotiating 
position on spacebased defenses with proposals intended to 
complement our initiative to permit the development testing and 
deployment of all spacebased sensors 
this element does not represent any change in longstanding us 
policy on the abm antiballistic missile treaty and its proper 
interpretation he said adding that administration policy on the 
conduct of the strategic defense initiative as worked out with 
congress also is unchanged 
testing of spacebased components which is permitted by the 
abm treaty does not represent deployment of such components 
redman said and added us policy remains that we will not accept 
any restrictions on sdi beyond those of the abm treaty

a money shortage is threatening the national 
weather service less than a month into the governments new fiscal 
year although officials say no decision has been made on whether to 
close offices 
an employee union said wednesday it had obtained information from 
the commerce department parent agency of the weather service 
indicating that as many as 40 weather offices could be in jeopardy 
weather service spokesman donald witten confirmed that the agency 
is facing financial problems and said many options are being 
considered for saving money he said no decisions have been made on 
any closings 
a recently approved pay raise for federal workers coupled with 
budget cutbacks is expected to leave the weather service about 25 
million short of its needs for the fiscal year that started oct 1 
basically were looking at the operation and seeing what we 
can do to meet that shortfall witten said in a telephone 
interview 
obviously the sooner you do it in the fiscal year the better 
but the fact is we havent decided on any specific reductions at 
this time were looking at a lot of options he said 
witten said the weather service has instituted a hiring freeze 
and is considering offering early retirement to employees who may be 
eligible to leave before the normal retirement age as immediate 
ways to save money salaries are by far the largest item in the 
agencys budget 
the national weather service employees organization issued a 
statement claiming that plans have been drafted to close as many as 
40 of the 191 weather offices 
such a series of closings could have a serious impact on 
forecasting particularly affecting airline operations the group 
said 
the weather service offices collect hourly observations which 
are transmitted to the national meteorological center in suitland 
md where a national forecast is developed that is then sent to 
local forecast offices which use it along with their local 
observations to issue local weather forecasts and alerts 
this is not the first time weather service offices have been 
threatened with closings in efforts to save money each time 
however congress has voted money to keep the offices open 
among the weather data collection offices that may be threatened 
according to the employees group are 
eastern region mansfield ohio elkins wva reading pa 
lynchburg va parkersburg wva 
central region alamosa colo dubuque iowa aberdeen sd la

the secret stealth bomber isnt even scheduled 
to be publicly unveiled until next month but it already has become 
a target for critics who say it isnt needed and may not work 
the latest complaints were raised in a report wednesday by the 
federation of american scientists a private group which in the past 
has been sharply critical of reagan administration arms control 
policies and defense decisions 
there is no role for the b2 the report said using the 
formal name of the plane designed as a flying wing and made of 
hightech materials that make the plane difficult to detect on radar 
we should probably use the first b2 prototype to gain some 
practical experience with this novel military technology but there 
seems little reason to proceed now with the production of this 
bomber it said 
the pentagon is scheduled to unveiled the bomber publicly nov 22 
at the northrop plant in palmdale calif thus far the air force 
has only released an artists drawing 
congressional critics have raised questions about the planes 
future particularly as cost estimates have increased both the 
senate and house armed services committees have backed the planes 
but the two democraticcontrolled panels have also asked the air 
force to justify rising costs and assure congress that technical 
problems can be solved 
the air force is tentatively planning to buy 132 of the planes 
the first estimates in 1981 were that the fleet would cost about 22 
billion but the figure rose to 43 billion by 1987 and the general 
accounting office now estimates that 132 b2s will cost 688 
billion that would make the b2 the most expensive weapon system 
ever built 
production is tentatively scheduled to begin early next year the 
b2 along with the b1 bomber is intended to replace the aging 
b52 as the newest components of the us threepronged nuclear 
deterrent which also includes submarinelaunched missiles and 
landbased missiles such as the mx 
the report by the federation of american scientists said the 
secrecy surrounding this project intended to protect technological 
secrets from the soviets is also hiding an expensive project of 
dubious merits from americans 
air force officials when asked for comment said they had not 
yet seen the fas report 
the fas noted that two missions for the b2 have emerged from 
the veil of secrecy 
some argue that the b2 is needed to offset improvements in 
soviet air defenses others argue that the b2 is needed in 
order to attack soviet mobile missiles such as the ss24 and ss25 
neither of these arguments in favor of the b2 is particularly 
compelling it said 
the soviets are likely to upgrade their air defenses but even 
when they do they will still be vulnerable to us weapons such as 
nucleartipped cruise missiles and the b1 the fas said 
using the b2 to hit soviet mobile weapons is risky because the 
plane would needed targeting information from us satellites the 
fas said those satellites could be knocked out by soviet weapons 
during the early stages of any war it said leaving the b2 without 
an effective way to locate its targets 
in fact the stealth bomber is as much a firststrike weapon as 
the mx both systems are intended to destroy soviet missiles before 
they can be launched against the united states said the fas 
which has also been critical of the mx 
it concluded that the b2 poses the same dangers as the mx and 
the strategic defense initiative increased risk of nuclear war 
further escalation of the arms race and complication of arms 
control and reduction 
the fas study cited what it said are a number of technical 
concerns about the b2 
problems with the stability of flying wing designs date back to 
the yb49 flying wing in the 1940s it noted citing reports that 
a companion f19 stealth fighter has suffered several crashes the 
air force has not confirmed those crashes 
even should all the problems be solved there are a number of 
questions regarding the extent to which the b2 and its stealth 
technology will be effective it said

a tale of two politicians 
george bush born and raised in new england moved to texas as a 
young man made a career for himself in one of the states leading 
industries raised a family entered texas politics and was twice 
elected to office 
he is dogged to this day by skepticism about his claim to be a 
texan 
ronald reagan born and raised in the midwest moved to 
california as a young man made a career for himself in one of the 
states leading industries raised two families entered california 
politics and was twice elected to office 
nobody ever suggests that he is not a californian 
in fact as reagan flies off today for a round of preelection 
politicking much of his activity will be focused on the state he 
first visited as an iowa sportscaster covering the chicago cubs in 
spring training 
thats his home state its felt he can be very helpful here 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters in santa 
barbara as he outlined the illinoisborn presidents itinerary right 
after the republican convention in august 
but if bushs career as an oilman and his two terms as a 
congressman from a houston district dont qualify the vice president 
as a texan how come a movie career and two terms as governor of 
california make reagan an undisputed californian 
i wonder whether it doesnt have to do with the important 
events in ones life whether one considers oneself a native of a 
particular state says alan heslop a professor of ethics at 
claremont mckenna college and a specialist in california voting 
opinions one of the most important events to all of us i think 
is where ones children go to school ronald reagans children went 
to school in california 
of bushs five children one attended the university of texas 
but the others went to harvard business college and yale to tulane 
to the university of virginia and to boston college 
there are more reasons for the difference 
for one thing while texans traditionally look askance at new 
englanders california was practically settled by midwesterners 
pasadena was once called in fact the indiana colony of 
california 
the settlers of southern california came mainly from the 
american heartland from rural and smalltown areas historian 
garry wills wrote but they invented something different a kind 
of hick cosmopolis 
reagan was right at home 
both his marriages were to women he met in california but both 
were from the midwest as he was jane wyman was born in st joseph 
mo and nancy davis grew up in chicago 
even louella parsons the gossip columnist who chronicled his 
marriages was from reagans home town of dixon ill 
except for the white house reagan has never maintained a home 
outside california since he signed a sixmonth contract with warner 
brothers in 1937 he had a home in pacific palisades before being 
elected president and plans to divide his time between a home in los 
angeles and his ranch north of santa barbara starting jan 20 
bushs legal residence is suite 271 of the houstonian hotel and 
conference center but he purchased a home in kennebunkport maine 
after becoming vice president 
whatever his residence bush supporters in texas resent 
suggestions that he is not one of them 
texas is really his home and he loves the state will farish 
whose houston company handles the vice presidents assets in a blind 
trust said in a recent interview 
bush too likes to remind texas audiences that hes back 
home 
still ponder this 
when reagan spoke at an italianamerican dinner of meat balls and 
ziti in west orange nj this month the band unhesitatingly 
struck up california here i come the second line is right 
back where i started from 
if it had been george bush would they have played deep in the 
heart of texas

continued low wages and difficult working 
conditions will lead to a shortage of health aides needed to care 
for americas elderly according to a report prepared by advocacy 
groups 
this nation is on the brink of a fullblown crisis in 
caregiving for the chronically ill said lou glasse president of 
the older womens league which joined with a government employees 
union in commissioning the study 
an exploited overburdened work force is caring for the frail 
the sick and the elderly glasse said 
glasses organization issued the study jointly on wednesday with 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
gerald w mcentee president of the 14 millionmember union 
said chronic care workers are among the most exploited workers in 
our nation 
the solutions to the crisis are obvious a higher minimum 
wage improvements in medicaid reimbursement more stringent 
licensing and training requirements he said 
the groups report compiled information from state and federal 
statistics from 1985 to the present 
it painted a bleak picture of the 15 million health care aides 
caring for patients in americas more than 25000 nursing and 
private homes it said the majority of the workers are middleaged 
minority women earning just above minimum wage without insurance 
coverage or overtime 
most leave their health care jobs within five years for those 
reasons 
given the conditions glasse said it will be difficult to find 
the 500000 health care aides the labor department estimates will be 
needed by the year 2000 
the report quoted the american health care association as saying 
more than half of nursing homes surveyed already report shortages of 
nursing aides 
the national association of home care representing organizations 
providing home care reported comparable shortages 
alice quinlan a consultant who compiled the study noted that 
the number of persons requiring paid caretakers is increasing 
rapidly she said many family members who otherwise would provide 
such care now must seek employment to make ends meet

something strange is going on in this years 33 
election contests for the us senate democrats are raising more 
campaign money than their republican rivals 
by the end of last month according to financial data reported to 
the federal election commission the 33 democrats running for senate 
seats had collected 836 million toward their campaigns their 33 
gop opponents had pulled in 733 million 
it is unusual said tom mason communications director for 
the national republican senatorial committee the partys campaign 
arm but its incumbency talking as well as givers 
expectations that the senate will remain under democratic control 
he said 
it is true that incumbents always have an easier time raising 
campaign money and that democrats have more incumbents 15 up for 
reelection this year than the republicans 12 
and it also is true that most political analysts are predicting 
not only that democrats will hold onto their 5446 senate majority 
but they may pad it by a seat or two come nov 8 
gop incumbents actually fared slightly better than their 
democratic counterparts in fund raising the dozen republicans 
averaged 38 million apiece as of sept 30 while the 15 democratic 
senators averaged 34 million 
but in nearly every other category openseat races 
challengers and political action committee money the democrats 
outdistanced their traditionally wellheeled rivals 
mason chalks some of the differences up to unusual situations in 
a handful of states that skew the numbers the democrats way and 
topping his unusual list is herb kohl 
its like running against a bank he says of the milwaukee 
democrat who holds a substantial lead in the wisconsin senate race 
against gop state senate minority leader susan engeleiter kohl 
owner of the milwaukee bucks basketball team and heir to a family 
grocery store chain spent 3 million most of it his own money to 
overcome betterknown rivals in the primary and may top 6 million 
by election day 
engeleiter who is conceded to be better versed on the issues 
was trailing 3to1 in fund raising and was down by more than 20 
points in the last published statewide poll kohl has sought to make 
his spending a virtue saying it means he wont be beholden to 
special interests nobodys senator but yours is the tagline to 
his prolific tv spots 
mason also points to virginia an open seat where former 
democratic gov charles robb has been regarded as the prohibitive 
favorite for years and has been treated by campaign donors more as 
an incumbent than as an openseat candidate robb had raised 27 
million compared with 192000 for his lesserknown gop opponent 
maurice dawkins 
in addition republicans say the presidential election has 
diverted attention from bids by quality gop candidates and made it 
harder for them to compete for a limited amount of campaign dollars 
but democrats have other explanations for their newfound parity 
with the gop in fund raising 
the candidates we recruited are an impressive group of elected 
officials who have their own political bases and their own 
fundraising bases said anita dunn spokeswoman for the 
democratic senatorial campaign committee democratic challengers 
are not being outspent 2to1 or 3to1 like in previous years 
democrats after a slow start have learned to be competitive for 
specialinterest money as well she said fec figures show 
democratic senate candidates overall have received 214 million 
from political action committees while republicans have collected 
just 175 million 
the disparity led to a woodshed session last month at which 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and chief fundraiser rudy 
boschwitz rminn called leaders from business pacs to a meeting 
to scold them for supporting democrats 
were getting far fewer contributions than the democrats are 
said mason the message at the meeting was that business pacs 
should take a serious look at probusiness candidates that they 
should look at the philosophies of the people theyre giving to 
some capitol hill observers are predicting that the democrats 
catchup in raising pac money will lead republicans who have 
protected the current fundraising system so far to throw out the 
rules in 1989 
this i think will be the last election we have under the 
current system said charles cook a political analyst and author 
of a political newsletter i am convinced were seeing bigtime 
reform next year republicans just are not going to defend pacs any 
more they will decide its in their self interest 
republicans are not shut out of the picture entirely when it 
comes to money however sen pete wilson rcalif tops the money 
list for all candidates so far this year having amassed about 12 
million for his reelection bid roughly double the amount his 
challenger lt gov leo mccarthy has raised 
and in a hardfought open seat contest in mississippi republican 
rep trent lott has outdistanced opponent rep wayne dowdy in fund 
raising and holds a nearly 4to1 advantage in cash on hand going 
into the crucial final weeks of the campaign

is there a market niche among swing voters for 
a massachusetts governor whos mounting an unprecedented television 
sales campaign for himself probably not analysts say but hes got 
the right idea 
saturation exposure is a perfectly reasonable strategy for 
democrat michael dukakis given his doubledigit deficit in the 
polls and the proximity of election day says larry sabato a 
political scientist at the university of virginia 
but youve got to have a product to sell you have to have 
something people want to buy says sabato what they may not be 
accounting for is the fact that most people have apparently 
concluded that they dont want michael dukakis to be president 
seeing him more often is not going to change that evaluation 
dukakis is waging an airwaves war to ward off the closing of 
american minds abetted by tv news and interview shows that are 
providing him with unprecedented blocks of free exposure to millions 
of viewers 
the invitations are flowing to both dukakis and republican 
nominee george bush but while bush the nearly prohibitive 
favorite is still weighing whether and where to appear dukakis is 
taking on all comers 
hes going on every tv show he can find except morton downey 
jr joked michael robinson a georgetown university government 
professor pollster and author of two books about campaign media 
coverage 
dont get me wrong hes doing the right thing robinson 
added but will this turn the election around of course not 
dukakis latest extended appearance 90 minutes on abcs 
nightline tuesday night drew predictable raves from his own 
spin doctors and equally predictable putdowns from the bush camp 
a terrific session pronounced dukakis adviser steve 
engelberg 
he got his pants chewed up declared bush spokesman mark 
goodin 
more objective reviewers noted that dukakis passed up numerous 
chances during the interview to stress his new populist image as a 
fighter for main street americans a president who would be on 
your side he also failed to reject a koppel suggestion that bush 
has nailed yoabato said 
that was the dullest interview ive ever seen ted koppel conduct 
dukakis answers just werent that lively or interesting and he 
missed so many opportunities to make useful points from his 
perspective something to warm him up something to make him appear 
more human 
dukakis is running the usual 30second tv ads and a 5minute 
network spot summarizing his appeal he has already appeared in 
addition to nightline on the morning news shows and the larry 
king talk show on cable news network 
his wife kitty was on cbs face the nation his running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen was on abcs this week with david 
brinkley and was interviewed on the cbs evening news wednesday 
night 
a new cbs newsnew york times poll indicates about a quarter of 
the nations probable voters still classify themselves as undecided 
dukakis will have a few more shots at them including lengthy 
appearances on the cbs and nbc evening newscasts and an interview 
with david frost on the fox network nov 6 
everything depends on his performance and how interested swing 
voters or soft bush supporters are in hearing him make his pitch 
said john buckley a republican consultant and cbs commentator 
he has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose 
buckley added hes behind in every poll hes behind in more than 
40 states his only hope is to get as much exposure for himself as 
possible and hope that what he says has some resonance with voters 
robinson a selfprofessed democrat said he cant imagine 
dukakis attracting anyone into his column by force of personality 
but he cant hide now hes got to come out hes got to be michael 
dukakis and he will go down in an honorable defeat

an antinuclear physicians group on wednesday 
urged president reagan to take drastic steps to improve safety at 
us nuclear weaponsmaking facilities where production virtually 
has halted because of safety concerns 
four major plants in the 14facility manufacturing complex have 
been wholly or partially closed for safety reasons and the 
production of nuclear weapons has ground to a halt according to 
officials at the energy and defense departments 
the antinuclear group physicians for social responsibility 
said in a statement that contamination and dubious safety procedures 
at the plants have direct and potentially devastating medical 
implications 
they constitute a public health emergency said h jack 
geiger a member of the committee and a professor at the city 
university of new york medical school 
geiger said not enough studies have been conducted to determine 
whether nuclear wastes from the sites have caused cancer or other 
illnesses among workers or nearby residents the energy department 
has estimated it would cost 66 billion to 110 billion in the 
longterm to clean up the waste and upgrade the facilities and 
congressional estimates have run as high as 170 billion 
in a letter to reagan the physicians group urged the 
administration to give the newly created national defense safety 
board the power to close down any energy department nuclear facility 
it deems not in compliance with safety public health 
occupations and environmental standards 
congress created the board under the defense authorization bill 
for fiscal 1989 to monitor does beleaguered nuclear weapons 
program which manufactures atomic weapons for the pentagon the 
board does not have powers of enforcement 
doe is reviewing the safety and operation of all of its plants to 
report to congress by middecember on whether to close any of them 
the wall street journal on wednesday said an early draft of that 
report calls for permanent closing of two facilities one in 
fernald ohio and another near denver where work was interrupted 
earlier this year because of health and safety reasons 
at the rocky flats plant near denver two workers and an energy 
department inspector suffered lowlevel radioactive contamination on 
sept 29 after which authorities closed building 771 a plutonium 
reprocessing facility there 
the energy department cited the exposure of the workers when it 
announced the closing earlier this month however the department 
was aware of severe problems at the plant even before the accident 
a department official said late wednesday 
its my understanding that the contamination of the workers 
and the inspector was essentially a catalytic incident that 
prompted the closing of the facility said c anson franklin the 
chief energy department spokesman said in an interview 
franklin said energy department inspectors had been in the plant 
several times before the accident and had come up with quite a 
long list of changes we believe the contractor rockwell was 
sincere and committed to making these changes but we felt the 
progress assessed after the accident hadnt been as rapid as we 
would like to see so that feeling led to the conversations that 
resulted in the shutdown of the facility 
rockwell spokesman ed heintz on wednesday emphasized that 
although building 771 the plutonium reprocessing building is 
closed down that does not necessarily mean the plants operations 
are halted however he said he couldnt provide more specifics 
because the quantity of plutonium stockpiled was classified 
the new york times in thursdays editions quoted a general 
accounting office report as saying that an inspector identified in 
the gao report as j krupar found a series of very serious 
violations at rocky flats that left no margins for safety 
his concerns included slow and unskilled work by employees 
assigned to monitor radiation levels radiological monitors that 
were unchecked out of service and out of calibration 
haphazard inconsistent posting of warning signs outside rooms 
with radioactive contamination electrical safety is dangerously 
managed and attitudes are complacent 
the gao report was prepared for rep david e skaggs dcolo 
and a copy was obtained by the times 
franklin told the associated press i havent seen the gao 
report but its my understanding that it essentially recaps the 
findings of the department of energys inspectors at rocky flats 
workers at the feed materials production center in fernald about 
20 miles north of cincinnati have been striking the plant for a 
month forcing it to suspend operations and ohio gov richard 
celeste has urged that federal authorities close the fernald plant 
which according to doe documents filed in court regularly has 
dumped radioactive waste into the water and air 
a doe spokesman will callicott said that because the 
departments study on whether to close any nuclear facilities was 
not complete it is premature to comment on its recommendations 
two other major weapons facilities have been closed the three 
reactors at the savannah river plant at aiken sc where the 
department manufactures plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons 
were shut down earlier this year for safety reasons 
the department is working on plans to restart one of the reactors 
in december although details have not been finalized callicott 
said 
the department closed down the other reactor at which it had been 
manufacturing plutonium and tritium in hanford wash and has no 
current plans to reopen it officials said 
the physicians committee urged reagan to prohibit the 
department of energy from restarting any of its reactors at savannah 
river or reopening facilities presently closed at fernald rocky 
flats and hanford until an independent commission completes an 
evaluation of the public health occupational and environmental 
safety risks of the continued operation of these facilities 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said the presidents office 
had not received the letter from the physicians committee and could 
not comment directly on it 
the department of energy is on top of this situation said 
cooper energy secretary john herrington has developed a plan to 
check out all the sites to issue a report in december on all of the 
sites and rank the sites in order of safety 
the bottom line is that the president has said that we will not 
operate an unsafe nuclear plant and we will not said cooper 
us officials have said they have adequate supplies of 
plutonium but face critical shortages of tritium a radioactive 
isotope of hydrogen used to boost the power of nuclear explosions

when george bush gets wound up odd words 
sometimes happen 
this can sentence a campaign crowd to some bizarre sentences but 
the partisans dont seem to care so they cheered the vice president 
in akron ohio the other day when he explained 
in terms of the environment i will be a good president for the 
environment because i know in what kind of decade to leave the kids 
not what were in right today 
i will do better he said 
and in williston vt on taxes 
you know the governor of massachusetts i dont know why they 
call it taxachusetts i didnt name it taxachusetts the people in 
taxachusetts named it taxachusetts 
bush campaign days generally begin with a smooth polished 
performance dealing with a single theme economics this week the 
republican presidential nominee speaks from a text sticking to the 
script by using a teleprompter hes an orderly orator most 
mornings scripted and steady 
but the relatively mildmannered campaigner vanishes later in the 
day when it comes time to deliver the standard everyday campaign 
speech to the rally at the firehouse or the airport or the 
republican barbeque 
for example heres bush taunting democratic nominee michael 
dukakis for his latecampaign counteroffensive accusing the 
republicans of lying about his record 
these guys can dish it out but they cant take it ill tell 
you something i love it 
perhaps he did but within a day his campaign strategists had put 
together a dossier and staged a washington news conference to defend 
their advertisements and insist that dukakis was the liar 
and on wednesday they began broadcasting a countercounter ad 
that begins michael dukakis deliberately misled 62 million 
americans in the last debate 
bushs sometimes fractured campaign rhetoric usually shows up in 
his set standard speech the one delivered to the daily rallies 
routine in any presidential campaign 
those speeches are essentially a shorthand review of whats gone 
before a compilation of the lines that worked best along the way 
they are like pieces of a puzzle assembled into one speech 15 
minutes or so of the candidates best applause lines and they 
become as predictable as a tape recording in most campaigns 
bush has put the excitement back its as though a few of the 
pieces of his set speech came from another puzzle 
hey listen i forgot i cant let one event go by he 
told a gop rally in lima ohio tuesday and hit dukakis for 
criticizing the us invasion of grenada five years ago 
he almost forgot the pledge of allegiance too but not quite 
i think it is good to have children sign the pledge say the 
pledge 
in sioux falls sd on wednesday bush thanked a crowd for 
south dakotas hospitality saying youve been very pleasant to 
the bush family weve been here thousands of us five kids one 
wife me back again 
bush has taken to counting the days until the nov 8 election 
although not always well with 13 days to go he urged republicans 
in billings mont to turn out their vote literally 11 days and 
an hour were going to know the answer to this 
that certainly would make him the first to know

an independent group supporting george bush 
plans to flood cable stations in ohio and florida with ads 
denouncing the military stands of democrat michael dukakis whose 
campaign is denouncing another new bush ad as a cynical lie 
the national security political action committee said wednesday 
its ad will run 2400 times nov 17 on cable stations in florida 
and ohio the production and time buys cost 100000 
the spot lists five weapons systems it said dukakis opposes and 
says a dukakis group calls for a 75 billion cut in defense a 
reference to the bostonbased jobs with peace campaign on whose 
board dukakis serves 
as former chairman of the joint chiefs i know that such cuts 
will cripple our country retired adm thomas h moorer says in 
the ad we cannot afford to have dukakis sitting across from 
gorbachev we must support george bush for president its a matter 
of national security 
the probush group has spent 25 million on ads supporting the 
republican including earlier ones running under the name americans 
for bush bush campaign officials have filed complaints against the 
group and disavowed its activities 
a new ad accusing dukakis of raiding his states pension fund 
which began airing tuesday night in spot markets around the country 
drew protests from both the dukakis campaign and the wall street 
journal 
the ad says dukakis deliberately misled 62 million americans 
in the last debate by denying the raiding charge and calls him 
unbelievable 
the spot features a debate clip and a quote from the journal that 
it is indisputable that 27 million moved out of the nations most 
underfunded state pension system so that the governor could claim 
to have balanced the fiscal 1988 budget 
albert hunt washington bureau chief for the journal said the 
newspaper is protesting the ad to the bush campaign becauses it 
creates the impression that the quotes came from the front page when 
in fact they came from the opinion pages 
the dukakis campaign said the incident in question was a 
budgetary transfer of an unanticipated surplus and had no effect 
on the level of pension benefits or the security of the system 
also on the ad front the national rifle association said it is 
suing the dukakis campaign to stop threats of legal action against 
radio stations airing ads attacking the democrats stands on gun 
control and crime the ads are running in more than 20 states 
the nra is seeking a judicial declaration that the dukakis 
campaigns threats of legal action are baseless and the first 
amendment would protect radio stations against any liability if 
legal action were taken the lawsuit also seeks an injunction to 
stop further threats of libel suits against the radio stations 
dukakis general counsel daniel taylor has told the nra it is 
distorting dukakis positions and wrongly attributing statements to 
him dukakis campaign officials in several states have told radio 
stations to stop running the ads

republican presidential nominee george bush said 
wednesday that democratic rival michael dukakis sounds like a man 
just itching to repeal the income tax cuts of the past eight 
years bush said his election would be a mandate against tax 
increases 
in an economics lecture stressing his weeklong campaign theme 
the vice president said the massachusetts governor never met a 
payroll and doesnt understand the impact of taxes on business 
bush campaigned in michigan with 20 electoral votes at stake on 
nov 8 before heading for rallies in sioux falls sd and 
billings mont small states where his aides said the race could be 
close were going to shore up our support said press secretary 
sheila tate 
bush told more than 1600 people at the economic club of detroit 
that reagan administration policies have produced astounding 
economic growth despite democratic voices of doom 
the gop nominee said he would seek to spur that growth by cutting 
the capital gains tax rate a proposal dukakis has denounced 
repeatedly as a tax break for the wealthy 
capital gains realized on the sale of such assets as stocks and 
real estate are taxed like any other income under tax legislation 
that took effect last year bush wants to restore preferential 
treatment for capital gains cutting the top rate from 33 percent to 
15 percent 
he said such a move has been endorsed by everyone from john 
f kennedy to president reagan from democratic vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen to bush running mate dan quayle 
its not a tax break for the rich it is a break for those who 
want to have a job in this country bush said unfortunately my 
opponents only experience with business is regulating it and taxing 
it 
hes never run a business hes never met a payroll he 
doesnt understand how when youre starting out you need people to 
join you in taking a risk so he paints my proposal as an effort to 
help the rich 
wrong said bush he said most capital gains are realized by 
people who earn less than 50000 a year 
the dukakis campaign on the other hand cites a congressional 
budget office study concluding more than half the capital gains are 
realized by the 1 percent of richest americans 
as for income taxes bush said rates have been cut by an average 
27 percent since reagan took office in 1981 and the results in new 
jobs and economic growth have been staggering 
despite the certifiable success of our tax cuts in unleashing 
the longest recovery in our history my opponent thinks they were a 
disaster bush said recalling dukakis criticism of the cuts 
during the democratic primary campaign 
those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching 
to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our 
history bush said 
he said the reason is that dukakis is proposing mandated new 
spending that would cost the government and business billions upon 
billions of dollars 
if i am elected in 13 days eight hours and 22 minutes from now 
i will work with congress telling them the american people in 
electing me voted against a tax increase bush said 
he said the voters also would be say they wanted the president to 
have lineitem veto authority so he could delete specific spending 
items from an appropriations bill without vetoing the entire measure 
answering written questions bush said the us trade deficit 
should shrink under current policies 
im convinced that this is on the right track without further 
legislation he said i have in the past supported the voluntary 
restraint agreements as they affect autos and i am openminded on 
that question but i am not one who favors protection 
bush refused to say who he would nominate as secretary of state 
on the ground that such a disclosure might break rules against 
promising appointments the cabinet post is widely believed to be 
earmarked for james a baker iii his campaign chairman former 
treasury secretary and a longtime bush associate from texas 
bush said that to answer questions about appointments to a bush 
administration conveys a sense of overconfidence that i do not 
feel 
bush wrapped up his campaigning with a rally in billings mont 
repeating that that dukakis could raise income taxes 
dont elect him because he just might take that tax cut away 
from the american people bush said again 
at rocky mountain college on a gymnasium stage with montana 
republicans and a dozen impassive indians in full headress bush 
also renewed his pledge to fight against gun control 
im a sportsman im a hunter like to do it he said and 
i dont believe we need the federal govenment going forward with gun 
control legislation 
urging montana republicans to turn out the vote on nov 8 bush 
had a little trouble with his arithmetic 
literally 11 days and an hour were going to know the answer 
to this he said of an election 13 days away 
in billings air force two taxied to the runway for a flight to 
tacoma wash but then turned back when the galley crew reported 
gas fumes in the rear of the plane fire fighting crews were sent in 
and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made 
bush and other members of his entourage remained on board 
after about 20 minutes it was determined that strong cross winds 
had blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on 
takeoff as they did when the plane departed 
some time after bush left the press plane chartered by media 
covering the vice president was held on the ground because of high 
winds that prevented takeoff bush officials said 
at a republican rally in the stockyards in sioux falls bush 
challenged what he said were democratic proposals to impose supply 
controls on american farmers he said dukakis stands for such 
tightened controls and i dont believe he should be against the 
american farmer 
we are not going to pull the rug out from under the american 
farmer and go to some kind of supply management bush told several 
hundred people at the stockyards rally

in israels wideopen electoral system a man 
who once threw a bomb into parliament and an 89yearold former 
vegetable vendor who wants to throw a monkey wrench into 
parliamentary rules are running for office 
their parties are among several special interest groups counting 
on singleissue platforms to woo undecided voters in the nov 1 
parliamentary elections 
others entered in the race include parties that want to ban 
income taxes improve prisoners rights get rid of onethird of 
israels legislators and boost pensions for retirees 
the small parties are encouraged by israels system of 
proportional representation which awards a seat in the knesset or 
parliament to any group that wins 1 percent of the vote about 
24000 ballots 
pollsters say it is unlikely parties with limited appeal will 
succeed i dont expect any of them to be in the knesset after the 
elections said political analyst daniel elazar of the jerusalem 
center for public affairs 
but elazar conceded theyre very entertaining a little 
like the dogandpony act in a vaudeville show 
the election is being contested by 27 parties including 14 that 
now hold parliamentary seats prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc and foreign minister shimon peress labor 
party are expected to split about 60 percent of the vote 
one of the more obscure hopefuls is the topaz party of diamond 
polisher moshe duak who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1957 
after a hand grenade he tossed into the knesset wounded then israeli 
leaders golda meir and david bengurion 
duak who says his party represents jews of middle east origin 
told election officials he walked across country to collect the 
1500 signatures needed to get on the ballot 
when he registered for the elections duak pulled a list of 2000 
signatures from a weatherbeaten backpack and said i dont have a 
phone but you can reach me at the place where im studying 
another small party hoping for a break is the silent force 
movement which placed 89yearold david sanhi at top of its 
ticket to highlight its protest against irrational laws and rules 
party founder yaakov gross said one such rule could make sanhi a 
retired vegetable stand owner who has never held office speaker of 
parliament because the post goes to the oldest member until a 
permanent speaker is elected 
gross also wants to end income tax because he said it encourages 
cheating and immoral behavior 
he said he named his party the silent force because people 
kept telling him weve never heard of you 
the party got some attention by choosing to identify itself with 
a hebrew letter that is sometimes used as a phallic symbol 
it was appropriate for a protest party gross said we 
figured we could use it in our campaign ads as long as we used it 
in a very delicate way 
two other offbeat candidates victor tayar and benzion koren 
have each failed in running for parliament seats twice before 
tayar a restaurateur says he is a champion of the poor just 
like jesse jackson koren whose goal is better housing for army 
veterans is enough of a believer to have sold his jerusalem 
newstand to pay the 7700 registration fee 
some pollsters say a few small groups may pick up one or two 
seats if they represent large special interest groups and enough 
voters become disenchanted with labor and likud 
aba gefen a retired civil servant who heads the pensioners 
party hopes to win enough seats on the strength of israels 400000 
retirees to play a role in forming a coalition government 
if we hold the balance of power after the elections well have 
an influence said gefen who wants to increase pension benefits 
however if the pensioners party fails to get a seat its ballots 
will be ignored and labor party officials say such wasted votes 
could cost them much needed support likud also worries about little 
parties that will cut into its backing from jews of middle east 
origin 
elazar noted small parties have goals other than winning votes 
most of them just want to get on tv so they can talk about an idea 
they think is important he said 
thats the way israeli democracy is structured he added 
in this country theres the possibility of giving a voice to 
almost anything

nato must maintain shortrange 
nuclear weapons now that the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to ban intermediaterange missiles a new report says 
the study will be the focus of a meeting beginning today of 
defense ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization 
officials said most nato nations want to increase the range of the 
tactical weapons to make up for the loss of intermediaterange arms 
the defense chiefs will be asked to endorse the report a 
detailed look at the role of shortrange nuclear rockets and 
artillery in the western alliance 
the conclusion is yes there will be a requirement for 
shortrange nuclear forces but theres no reason for a decision 
on how to pursue that goal now a us official said on 
condition of anonymity 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the treaty in december to eliminate all us and soviet landbased 
missiles with ranges from about 300 miles to 3400 miles 
since the agreement the question of upgrading shortrange 
nuclear forces artillery and missiles with ranges up to about 300 
miles has received more attention 
the overall aim is the maintenance and enhancement of an 
effective deterrence said frits bolkestein the dutch defense 
minister 
he said the range of shortrange or tactical weapons should be 
extended and made more flexible and less vulnerable 
if systems can be made more effective and more survivable the 
number of warheads may consequently be reduced he said 
the ministers were expected to make no decisions on the 
controversial issue of modernizing shortrange weapons 
even so the discussions probably will shape the debate leading 
to a decision on whether to give nato more powerful nuclear weapons 
for the front lines analysts say ranges eventually may be extended 
up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles 
the united states and britain have indicated support for 
modernizing shortrange weapons but west germany and the 
netherlands with strong antinuclear groups say nato has no 
pressing need now for such a decision 
the most controversial of the weapons under discussion for 
modernization is the lance surfacetosurface missile which was 
introduced in 1972 and which military analysts say will be obsolete 
by 1995 
the lance has a range of a little more than 60 miles and a new 
system might boost that up to more 250 miles 
also under discussion is a new tactical airtosurface missile 
called a standoff weapon which would replace nuclear gravity 
bombs it would allow fighters to launch weapons to a target without 
flying over heavy fighting 
the shortrange arsenal also includes nuclear artillery shells 
for 155 mm and 203 mm howitzers which have ranges up to 18 miles 
work on upgrading these arms is under way 
us defense secretary frank carlucci will attend the talks held 
twice a year on nuclear issues 
fourteen of natos 16 members will take part with iceland 
attending as an observer france is not part of natos joint 
military structure

the cafe royal was a legendary lower east side 
restaurant where the stars and patrons of the nearby yiddish 
theaters gathered to snack and schmooze before and after 
performances 
the famous second avenue watering hole is gone now but its 
spirit permeates hy krafts cafe crown a modest mild comedy 
set in a fictional recreation of the old cafe the play directed by 
elia kazan first had a threemonth broadway run during the 194142 
season 
nearly a half century later cafe crown has returned in a 
lavish loving production at the new york shakespeare festivals 
public theater the director this time around is martin charnin the 
man behind the musical annie charnin has done all he can to 
resuscitate the old play and for much of its three acts he 
succeeds 
first of all charnin and designer santo loquasto have created an 
evocative setting a beautiful old world restaurant done in dark 
wood and emerald green walls an elaborate bar hugs one side of the 
stage with a cluster of tables scattered down front theres even a 
spiffy revolving front door that hurdles customers in and out of the 
cafe 
second he has a bravura leading man eli wallach stars as 
impresario and actor david cole a role modeled after the famous 
yiddish performer jacob adler 
i dont believe in restraint bellows cole and neither does 
wallach the character may be jewish but wallach is all glorious 
ham 
the thin plot turns on coles decision to return to the theater 
as the director of a new family drama he has written its a 
simple tragedy he explains the story of parents and 
children if the story sounds a little bit like king lear 
whats the difference the audience will adore it cole proclaims 
thirdly cafe crown contains an astonishing array of veteran 
character actors those hardworking seldom celebrated performers 
who shine even in supporting roles eighteen actors play 21 roles 
in the play and theres not a dud among them 
wallach dominates the evening but he gets strong support from 
this cavalcade of performers anne jackson wallachs reallife 
wife plays his estranged spouse in cafe crown in a beautifully 
underplayed performance miss jackson lets wallach get the laughs 
she gets the sympathy 
bob dishy is the essence of exasperation as a harried cafe 
employee but the master of the putdown is fyvush finkel as an 
unflappable waiter who turns badgering the customers into a 
laughgetting art form 
there is more hilarious funny business from harry goz as a 
prolific yiddish playwright now working on play number 153 joseph 
leon as a newspaper drama critic who writes his reviews before he 
sees the plays and marilyn cooper as his whining wife who also 
fancies herself an actress 
although this affectionate revival confirms that cafe crown 
is not a lost masterpiece it does demonstrates that with a 
marvelous cast astute direction and a wonderful setting an 
enjoyable evening can be spun from the lightest of material

the united states has decided to withdraw from 
its frontline persian gulf position one of two huge rented 
barges used to support special operations forces in the waterway 
administration officials say 
the barge which had been stationed in the northern gulf near an 
iranian stronghold on farsi island is gradually being withdrawn to 
an anchorage off bahrain said the officials who spoke wednesday on 
condition they not be named 
the barge will remain operational for the time being in part 
to reassure arab allies in the region the united states is not 
withdrawing its forces precipitously the sources said 
but the withdrawal is just one more indication the pentagon is 
prepared to reduce its naval presence if the ceasefire between iran 
and iraq holds 
this isnt the start of the drawdown because we havent 
removed any of our warships yet said one official but its a 
step in that direction 
the barges rented and deployed in 1987 after the reagan 
administration agreed to protect kuwaitiowned tankers inside the 
gulf were cloaked in secrecy for months it was only in late july 
that pentagon officials authorized reporters in the region to visit 
one of them for the first time 
the floating combat bases were put together when arab states 
surrounding the gulf rejected us pleas to use their territory for 
the special forces 
equipped with communications gear and a variety of weapons the 
barge bases were home for navy seal commandos who manned patrol 
boats and army special operations forces helicopters 
the barges codenamed hercules and winbrown 7 have been cramped 
homes for about 200 soldiers sailors and marines 
gen george b crist the head of the us central command said 
in a recent interview that the barges were instrumental in 
discouraging iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven 
months before the ceasefire 
their secret nightflying army helicopters also caught an 
iranian minelayer proving that tehran was mining gulf sea lanes 
the general noted 
crist added that the barges an idea borrowed from vietnam where 
american forces patrolled in enemyheld areas showed it was 
possible to range far afield without a tremendous base 
infrastructure and still project our power

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen has renewed his attacks against republican counterpart dan 
quayle but he still stops barely short of declaring him unqualified 
on the cbs evening news on wednesday night anchorman dan 
rather put it directly to bentsen do you or do you not believe 
that sen dan quayle is qualified to be president of the united 
states he asked 
bentsen the courteous texas senator that he is refused to give 
a yes or no answer 
he is not nearly as qualified as a lot of other heavyweights in 
the republican party he said i think everyone in the congress 
was shocked and surprised when he was chosen 
earlier wednesday bentsen blasted quayle at a rally in 
riverside calif 
george bush has a proven record of failure in the war against 
drugs bentsen said and now he wants to turn that job over to 
dan quayle now you just tell me any qualifications he has in that 
regard if george bush is serious about the war on drugs then why 
would he choose dan quayle to lead it 
he compared himself with his junior senate colleague from indiana 
my friends theres an important difference here he told the 
crowd at the plaza outside the riverside calif city hall i 
think millions of americans would agree that dan quayle is not 
qualified to step in if he had to and be president of the united 
states of america 
bentsen went on to ridicule the republican campaign for saying 
quayle would head the us space program 
i see where dan quayle also wants to play a major role in 
national security he said doesnt that shake you up a bit 
thats a frightening thought are you ready for that 
bentsen talked of how bush attended 17 national security meetings 
and did not speak up against selling arms to iran in exchange for 
hostages but you know when i think about that and i think 
about dan quayle i believe id rather have george bush there not 
saying anything than having dan quayle active at the national 
security meeting he said 
the democratic campaign says quayle remains a problem for bush 
and one that would make a difference if the polls tighten up 
we need to keep that issue in front of the voters said mike 
mccurry bentsens press secretary 
bentsen planned to continue stumping in california today for that 
states 47 electoral votes more than any other 
a los angeles times poll released this week put the democratic 
ticket 11 points behind but campaign officials said they believed 
dukakis new advertising campaign was already cutting that margin 
on bentsens schedule today was a foreign policy address to the 
world affairs council in los angeles

the agriculture department doesnt usually 
promote crop failures but its making one exception this year 
when farmers go into their local usda offices these days to apply 
for drought relief or see about the 1989 wheat program theyll 
probably see posters warning about the hazards of growing marijuana 
the usda says its antidrug message will be carried into every 
corner of the nation by the departments sprawling agencies 
one day or one week will not solve the problem of illegal drug 
use agriculture secretary richard e lyng said wednesday but 
participation in this day and in the weeks activities can help 
mobilize the efforts of concerned citizens in government and out 
to solve this distressing problem that faces america 
president reagan recently proclaimed the week of oct 2430 as 
national drugfree america week in washington daily programs of 
entertainment and brief speeches are making the rounds of various 
government departments 
we should note that this effort is bipartisan lyng said 
others like us are meeting today or on another day this week 
all across the nation they are assembling in town meetings in 
conferences at rallies in schools 
lyng paid tribute to a number of usda agencies for antidrug 
activities including the forest service which he said last year 
eradicated more than 250000 highpotency marijuana plants grown 
illegally on national forests plants that had a street value of 
nearly 1 billion 
the forest service arrested 135 suspects associated with the 
illegal pot harvest and charged them with felonies he said 
another agency the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service is displaying antimarijuana posters in its 3000 county 
offices he said 
the ascs handles commodity programs payments and emergency 
drought relief for participating farmers the agency also is using 
newsletters in its program aimed at illegal marijuana cultivation 
lyng said the departments food and nutrition service which 
administers school lunch and food stamp programs is working with 
the american school food service association to support a just say 
no message among school children 
the agency also is working with the association to conduct a 
poster and essay contest with a drug prevention theme among 
elementary and secondary schools 
also he said the food agency encouraged the dairy industry to 
display just say no on the side panels of milk cartons used in the 
school lunch program a potential for reaching 26 million children 
in more than 90000 schools 
the department extension service through volunteer adult and 
teenage 4h leaders has established alcohol and drug abuse programs 
in more than 30 states lyng said

agriculture department scientists say they have 
found a way to make oranges and grapefruits shed their peels quickly 
and easily with only a little tug here and there 
the quick strip job is accomplished by giving the fruit a dose of 
an enzyme pectinase which dissolves the albedo or the white 
fleshy tissue that glues the peel to the fruit 
robert a baker a chemist in the departments agricultural 
research service said the process leaves the fruits core much 
cleaner than if you peeled it yourself 
baker said the technique called vacuum infusion may reduce 
current losses as high as 40 percent of fruit and juice from 
hand peeling and sectioning he works at the agencys citrus and 
subtropical products laboratory winter haven fla 
citrus processors can use this technology to make highquality 
orange and grapefruit sections that can be placed in jars canned 
wrapped in plastic and sold as readytoeat peeled fruit or used in 
salad bars baker said in a report released here 
pectinase was described as an inexpensive food enzyme approved 
by the food and drug administration and used in the jelly and jam 
industry baker said the enzyme solution is so weak that it has no 
taste and doesnt affect the fruits flavor 
the technique was invented by joseph bruemmer a chemist who 
leads the research group that includes baker at the winter haven 
laboratory

washington ap some parttime tobacco graders employed by the 
agriculture department will get pay raises of up to 20 percent 
beginning nov 6 
assistant secretary kenneth a gilles said wednesday that the 
tobacco graders in the gs5 and gs7 government pay scales will be 
raised 20 percent while those at then gs9 level will receive a 13 
percent increase 
the workers whose jobs are seasonal now get about 290 a week 
at the gs5 level 360 a week at gs7 and 440 a week at gs9 
gilles said usda asked the office of personnel management on aug 
25 for a 20 percent increase across the board but received approval 
for only the three lower pay scales raises for graders at the 
higher levels of gs11 and gs12 were denied they currently receive 
about 533 and 638 per week respectively 
this pay increase will make it easier for usda to recruit and 
maintain its quality tobacco grading work force gilles said 
about 260 tobacco graders work for the departments agricultural 
marketing service an agency spokesman george clarke said their 
salaries are paid from user fees and not taxpayer funds 
federal employees are scheduled for a 41 percent pay increase on 
jan 1 1989 and all tobacco graders including the ones receiving 
nov 6 increases will share in that one the agency said

for lovers of classical singing the news at the 
metropolitan operas first the barber of seville this season is 
that kathleen battle was in her usual radiant voice and the rest of 
the cast was right up there with her 
for musicologists the news is that the remarkable thirdact aria 
which rossini wrote for tenor manuel garcia who sang almaviva at 
the 1816 premiere was sung wednesday night by american tenor 
rockwell blake rossini took the aria out in 1817 when the tenor 
engaged couldnt sing it the met had not included it for 25 years 
and possibly never had 
blake who has the flexibility to sing pleasingly what really is 
coloratura for a man is used to singing the aria in europe in a 
letter to critics last week he expressed dismay that the met had 
cut 20 measures of it 
leo nucci sang the barber figaro he establishes his brash 
loud wheelerdealer character in his first entrance coming on like 
a snakeoil salesman with that planted in listeners minds nucci 
tones down to become a fine singer and team player in an operatic 
farce 
bass enzo dara was unusually funny as the guardian of rosina 
miss battle who intends to marry her he will of course be 
foiled by almaviva whose disguises as a soldier and a music 
teacher cooked up by figaro get him close to rosina 
daras comic timing and his singing are superb to add humor he 
uses several different walks including a fast selfsatisfied 
shuffle after he locks rosina in the house 
miss battles voice is what a listener would dream it should be 
accurate full of delicate warmth floating with infinite grace 
robert lloyd of essex england made his met debut as the 
real music teacher he has a ripe bass and is commanding it was 
a delight to watch dara respond to his stage business 
margaret jane wray has a small often ignored scene as the 
housekeeper which she sang so well as to be noticed 
ralf weikert of austria who made his met debut last season with 
another bel canto opera the elixir of love conducted with 
sensitivity 
the met last had presented the barber in its 198485 season

an iranian father and son convicted of a plot to 
smuggle hightech missile parts from the united states were part of 
a worldwide effort by iran to obtain us weapons during the 
persian gulf war an official says 
ahmad modarressi 64 and his son majid 30 each face up to 15 
years in prison and 125 million in fines for their attempt to send 
microwave tubes for the hawk antiaircraft missile system to tehran 
the father pleaded guilty last week and the son was found guilty 
wednesday after a fourweek jury trial in us district court 
the iranians have made a concerted effort all over the world to 
buy american weapons and parts and we have made a concerted effort 
to stop them said edward kittridge a spokesman for the us 
customs service this is a case in which we have prevailed 
the trial stemmed from a 10month investigation in which a 
customs agent posed as an employee of the massachusettsbased 
raytheon co maker of the hawk missile 
the undercover agent steven crogan recorded conversations with 
the modarressis in which they offered to pay him 280000 if he 
would steal the microwave tubes from raytheon 
they told crogan they planned to disguise the tubes as 
welldrilling equipment and ship them to iran via a third country 
such as libya turkey or switzerland 
expert witnesses testified that the tubes are a critical 
component of the radar system that allows the hawk to blast jet 
aircraft out of the sky 
they said iran bought the missiles from the united states in the 
1970s while the shah was still in power but has run short of parts 
since the islamic revolution in 1979 and the beginning of the 
iraniraq war a year later the two sides reached a ceasefire in 
august 
the modarressis were arrested jan 15 in a brighton freight yard 
where they had come to inspect the tubes 
the father and son went on trial together sept 28 but as 
testimony neared a close last week the elder modarressi 
unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty leaving the jury to decide 
only the case of the son 
the younger modarressi is a resident alien who has lived in the 
united states 12 years and has an american wife and 4yearold 
daughter in cincinnati 
during the trial his father was described as an international 
merchant with homes in istanbul and tehran who previously had traded 
in shoes and pecans 
judge mark l wold scheduled sentencing for both men nov 7 and 
released the son until then the father is being held at the salem 
house of correction 
defense attorney robert richman said he probably would appeal

if the iraniraq peace talks break down 
over the disputed shattalarab waterway iraq will reopen a 
deepwater port west of the waterway its un ambassador says 
the ambassador ismat kittani predicted resolution of the issue 
and also was optimistic about an exchange of tens of thousands of 
prisoners of war held by each side saying that is the brightest 
part of the picture 
the iraniraq peace talks are to resume monday in geneva the two 
enemies agreed to a ceasefire in august halting the war that began 
in 1980 
kittani said one key to the talks is that his country is seeking 
a pledge from iran not to resume stopping ships in the persian gulf 
to search for iraqbound war cargo 
iran has not searched any ships since the ceasefire began aug 
20 but says it retains that right 
kittani made his comments wednesday night at his home before 
returning to baghdad for consultations 
the deepwater port at khor zouber said kittani was productive 
before the war began and could be restored if iran wont guarantee 
free navigation on the shattalarab as well as agree to its being 
dredged 
the khor zouber port just west of the shattalarab is entered 
through the khor abdallah channel which empties into the persian 
gulf 
the shattalarab was iraqs primary outlet to the gulf before 
the war but it has been blocked by sunken ships unexploded 
ordnance and an accumulation of eight years of silt 
asked if iraq wishes to develop an alternative deepwater port 
kittani replied well have to if iraq wont agree to begin 
dredging and reopen the shatt known to iran as the arvand river 
clearing the shatt will take two years he said adding that the 
united nations could be called in to help the dredging 
the un cleared the suez canal of ordnance two times after 
wars in 1956 and 1973 between israel and egypt kittani noted 
iran insists the 1975 algiers treaty that defines their border as 
running down the middle of the shatt be maintained president saddam 
hussein of iraq rejected the treaty in 1980 
asked how long iraq was willing to continue the geneva talks 
kittani said we are ready to stay there until hell freezes over 
or until we reach complete agreement

the state supreme court has spared new 
jerseys only female deathrow inmate ruling she was not directly 
to blame for the death of her goddaughter whose last months were 
spent in torture chained to a bathtub 
marie moore 42 of paterson had been on death row since november 
1984 when she was convicted of firstdegree murder for the death of 
theresa feury an orphan who came to live with ms moore 
the girl died at age 13 in january 1983 of head injuries suffered 
when she hit her head on the bathtub to which she was chained every 
night the girls mummified body was found the following december in 
an attic crawl space in ms moores house 
the supreme court vacated ms moores death sentence wednesday 
and ordered a new trial on the murder charge it did not disturb her 
passaic county superior court convictions for kidnapping attempted 
murder terroristic threats and aggravated assault for which she is 
serving 87 years without eligibility for parole 
the ruling was the first time the court found the death penalty 
was improperly applied ms moore was the sole woman on new jerseys 
death row 
were pleased with the decision said roy greenman an 
attorney who represented ms moore 
greenman applauded the courts finding that the lower court erred 
in failing to have jurors consider the lesser charges of 
manslaughter or aggravated manslaughter 
joseph falcone the passaic county prosecutor at the time and now 
a superior court judge in essex county declined to comment passaic 
county prosecutor ronald fava also declined to comment saying he 
had not had time to digest the opinion 
in an interview with the associated press in 1985 ms moore a 
former hairdresser and telephone operator said she had become a 
fundamentalist christian while in prison 
the court ruled that if the medical evidence established that 
theresa feurys death was caused by starvation or her weakened 
medical condition or by asphyxiation resulting from her being 
wrapped and stuffed in a crawl space while alive we would agree 
with the state that a jury could find that moore by her own conduct 
caused theresas death 
the medical evidence presented in this record however does 
not support that finding according to the medical examiner the 
victim died as a result of blows to the head and face caused by 
striking the tub the court said marie moore did not deal the 
victim those fatal blows 
court records show the girl fell against the tub after being 
lifted by ricky flores a boy who began living with the family in 
the fall of 1981 when he was 14 ricky became ms moores enforcer 
and lover according to the supreme court account 
flores served two years in a juvenile facility after a plea 
bargain for his role in the girls death greenman said the youth 
completed his sentence and was freed 
according to testimony at ms moores trial theresa was starved 
forced to wear disposable diapers and hanged from her thumbs 
court records said the boy also was a victim of ms moores 
attacks prosecutors said she met him and other victims through 
friendships they had developed with her own daughter who also lived 
with the family 
during the trial the defense introduced testimony from a 
psychiatrist that ms moore suffered from psychological problems 
that diminished her capacity to control herself she told the 
victims their punishments were ordered by a violent male she named 
billy joel 
authorities said ms moores daughter was not a victim of abuse

the arrival of the nuclearpowered carrier 
uss nimitz and eight support ships in the arabian sea this weekend 
will not change the number of navy ships in the persian gulf region 
officials say 
the new us carrier contingent in battle group bravo will 
replace a similar unit led by the carrier carl m vinson both 
groups are part of the us pacific fleet 
the change will leave the united states with 26 ships one fewer 
than on aug 20 when a ceasefire took effect in the 8year war 
between iran and iraq us officials said wednesday 
the us contingent is by far the largest of seven foreign naval 
units in the region about 16 us ships including six mine 
sweepers are in the gulf at any given time 
the impending switch in us carrier battle groups returns one of 
the navys powerful aegistype missile cruisers to the area for the 
first time since the uss vincennes left 
officials said the uss antietam one of the newest of the 
hightech billiondollar warships is making its first trip to the 
region as a nimitz escort 
other ships in the battle group are the nuclear cruiser 
california missile destroyers waddell and benjamin stoddert 
frigate barbey ammunition ship kiska supply ship mars and the 
oiler willamette 
pentagon officials say the american force in the gulf will be 
scaled back to five or six ships if the truce continues to hold 
that was the size of the navys middle east force when the war 
escalated in mid1987 and the united states began escorting 
kuwaitiowned tankers that had been given us registry and flew the 
american flag 
the officials have not disclosed a timetable but military 
sources say some reductions probably will come through attrition or 
changing the orders of ships marked for gulf duty 
military sources say a us carrier force probably will continue 
to operate in the indian ocean for about half the time as it did 
before the gulf crisis 
in the only force cutback to date the aegistype cruiser mobile 
bay had its orders for the gulf canceled aug 12 the day before it 
was to leave for the middle east to replace its sister ship the 
vincennes 
the vincennes departure in early september reduced the us 
strength to 26 ships 
although fleet strength has not been reduced further the navy 
has curtailed air surveillance activities and ended the close 
escorting of usflagged kuwaiti tankers through the gulf 
us warships now monitor the tankers movements ready to 
respond in case of trouble no armed incidents have been reported in 
the gulf since the truce military and shipping officials say 
britain and italy also have announced they no longer will 
accompany commercial ships in convoy

we need the kind that ronald reagan has brought to this 
country bush declared 
after stops wednesday in detroit sioux falls sd and 
billings mont bush flew here for an endorsement today by a 
maritime union and a rally washington is considered a tossup state 
then he was heading for california where 47 electoral votes the 
largest prize in the nation are at stake bush will spend two days 
in california before heading back east 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said that in the 12 days 
remaining before the election were going to focus on states 
where we think the support is soft where the margin is close 
were pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to 
continue to work to make sure weve locked up the necessary 
electoral votes fuller said 
bush made a point wednesday of claiming that michael dukakis his 
democratic opponent would put in jeopardy the income tax cuts 
enacted during the reagan administration 
he said dukakis called the tax cuts one of the worst bills that 
congress ever could have passed 
well dont elect him cause he might just take that cut away 
from the american people and i will not do that bush told a 
cheering crowd of perhaps 2000 people in a gymnasium at rocky 
mountain college in billings 
a determined dukakis supporter a young woman who gave her name 
as victoria brown dashed back and forth through the audience with a 
dukakis sign until it was snatched away by someone in the crowd she 
tussled with her antagonist and both were led away by a policeman 
while bush is waging a determined battle to win the 20 electoral 
votes in michigan where he spent wednesday morning he had conceded 
south dakota during the primary session to thenrival bob dole 
taken together south dakota and montana offer only seven of the 
270 electoral votes needed to win the white house wednesdays visit 
was his only stop in each state in the general election campaign 
asked as he left billings why he even bothered to stop there 
bush replied theres a lot at stake here youve got two 
congressional seats youve got a governors seat youve got a 
senate seat youve got the president and the vice president 
so it is very very important and it shows that we are taking 
absolutely nothing for granted the vice president told reporters 
recalling the words he had said inside the gym bush said i am 
running like i am behind and i mean it and we are not going to 
lighten up at all 
in billings air force two taxied to the runway for the flight to 
tacoma but then turned back when the galley crew reported gas fumes 
in the rear of the plane fire fighting crews were sent to the plane 
and the engines were turned off while an inspection was made 
bush and other members of his entourage remained on board after 
about 20 minutes it was determined that strong cross winds had 
blown fuel fumes into the aircraft and they would dissipate on 
takeoff as they did when the plane departed 
some time after bush left the press plane chartered by media 
covering the vice president was held on the ground for a couple 
hours because of high winds that prevented takeoff bush officials 
said it aborted three takeoffs because of a stalled engine before 
finally departing

larry flynt offered a selfstyled soldier of 
fortune 1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers hugh hefner 
and bob guccione and frank sinatra and walter annenberg 
authorities said 
the purported hitman mitchell werbell died of a heart attack in 
december 1983 about a month after flynt gave him the check 
sheriffs capt robert grimm said wednesday night werbell was in 
his 60s when he died of natural causes authorities said 
flynts alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been 
filed against him 
grimm told a news conference that information about the plot 
turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murderforhire 
slaying of new york theater producer roy radin whom authorities 
said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie the 
cotton club 
a former flynt bodyguard william mentzer is one of four 
defendants charged in radins killing 
investigators have not interviewed the hustler magazine publisher 
and have not presented a case to the prosecutor grimm said he 
declined to elaborate and said los angeles county sheriff sherman 
block spoke about the purported plot earlier in the day because he 
had been approached by the news media 
our investigation is continuing grimm said 
grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as hefner sinatra 
and guccione he declined to name a fourth person targeted but 
authorities told knbctv that person was annenberg the publishing 
magnate and former ambassador 
larry flynt one evening called an individual by the name of 
werbell to his home and allegedly offered him 1 million if he would 
arrange for the death of these four individuals said block 
adding he took the matter seriously 
ive been led to believe that larry flynt has a propensity to 
try to harm people he sees as his enemies whether over business 
arrangements or whatever 
a woman at flynts office told the associated press flynt just 
said he doesnt make comments on trash like that 
werbell was an international arms dealer who developed the mac10 
submachine gun he called himself a retired general of the royal 
free afghan army according to promotional material from his 
georgiabased counterterrorism firm sionics inc released by the 
sheriffs department 
grimm displayed a photocopy of a 1 million check allegedly 
signed by flynt and made out to werbell 
block said a flynt associate immediately stopped payment on the 
check so it never was negotiated 
the year of the alleged plot flynt claimed to have knowledge of 
videotapes purportedly showing vicki morgan mistress of the late 
diners club founder alfred bloomingdale engaged in sexual antics 
with reagan administration officials 
the tapes were never proven to exist 
at the time flynt was heavily sedated with drugs to assuage pain 
from wounds that left him paralyzed after a 1978 assassination 
attempt during an obscenity trial in georgia 
hefner publisher of playboy magazine said his place on the list 
was the price of celebrity its part of being famous in the later 
part of the 20th century he said in a statement i have no 
association with those who made up the list or those whose names 
appear on it 
guccione publisher of penthouse magazine said he had been 
informed about the alleged plot by a flynt bodyguard some time ago 
susan reynolds publicist for sinatra said the entertainer had 
no comment 
a telephone call to annenbergs palm springs home was answered by 
a woman who said he was on the east coast and wouldnt be 
immediately available for comment

researchers say fishermen using more sophisticated 
equipment are catching fish before they are old enough to spawn 
causing the number of mature cod in new england waters to plummet 
a recent study found that just 30 percent of the cod in the rich 
georges bank fishing area that were alive at the beginning of 1987 
survived to the beginning of 1988 the high mortality rate poses a 
threat to the cod population and the 40 millionayear new england 
industry it supports 
also studies found that the spawning stock of georges bank cod 
declined for the fifth consecutive year in 1988 to 681 million 
pounds the lowest in the 11 years that stock size has been 
calculated 
its clear that the fishing effort is at record high levels 
said fredric m serchuk chief of offshore fishery resources 
investigation for the federal northeast fisheries center in woods 
hole 
the fishermen are very dependent on small young fish he 
said as a result when there has been successful spawning the 
fish dont remain in the population long enough to contribute to the 
spawning stock 
the number of fishing vessels days spent at sea and fishing trip 
duration is increasing serchuk said fishermen also have become 
more efficient by using more sophisticated fishfinding equipment 
the fisheries center estimates that the 1988 commercial catch of 
georges bank cod will be about 525 million pounds about 25 percent 
higher than in 1987 
the increased 1988 catch is due to recordhigh fishing levels by 
the regions 1600 fishermen who fish for cod and other bottom fish 
and an aboveaverage number of cod hatched in 1985 
but with a high mortality rate the 1985 generation is being 
depleted quickly for 1989 serchuk forecast a low supply of cod 
because the number of fish hatched in 1986 that would be catchable 
next year appears low 
according to the fisheries center the survival rate for georges 
bank cod has fallen from about 65 percent in 1978 to 30 percent last 
year 
another problem has been a 1984 world court decision that created 
a territorial boundary line in georges bank about halfway between 
cape cod and nova scotia barring american fishermen from prime 
waters now belonging to canada the boundary means the same number 
of fishermen are restricted to a smaller area 
cod is the predominant species landed in the us atlantic 
generally accounting for more catch by weight than other bottom fish 
such as haddock and yellowtailed flounder

a judges decision has forced rep pat swindall to 
fight an uphill battle for reelection while under a perjury 
indictment but he has said he hasnt lost any moral high ground to 
his opponent former actor ben jones 
in one of the nations bitterest campaigns swindall rga has 
repeatedly brought up his democratic rivals admitted alcoholism and 
past brushes with the law jones who played cooter on 
televisions the dukes of hazzard has proposed in turn that 
swindall be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems 
the battle returned to the limelight wednesday when us district 
judge robert vining halted the twoterm congressmans trial on 10 
perjury counts until after the nov 8 election 
swindalls highspeed strategy of representing himself as his own 
attorney amid the campaign backfired when vining brought into court 
two recent campaign mailings one of which mentioned swindalls 
claim that a private polygraph test supports his defense 
vining who disallowed a polygraph test as evidence in the trial 
said the literature might influence jurors he also said he wanted 
the justice department to investigate whether swindall violated 
court rules governing comments lawyers may make outside the 
courtroom 
the judge then dismissed the jury and later rejected swindalls 
last attempt at a quick trial a request that vining hear the case 
without a jury prosecutor craig gillen also was willing to allow 
vining to render the verdict but federal court rules also require 
the judges consent 
swindall who had demanded his own indictment from the floor of 
the house said he very much would have liked to have had an 
exoneration before the election 
however i knew that with a campaign with only two weeks to go 
and with the issue of perjury uppermost in many peoples minds that 
it was important for me to get that polygraph evidence out to the 
voters of the 4th district because it totally exonerates me he 
said 
swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury when he said he did 
not remember being told that an 850000 home mortgage loan he was 
seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds swindall 
negotiated the loan with a money broker who turned out to be an 
undercover federal agent and the prosecution has a recording of the 
agent telling swindall he had a gut feeling drugs were involved 
jones would not comment on the case we had an 18point lead 
before the indictment and we got it not because of his problems 
but because of our hard work he said 
a poll by the atlanta journalconstitution after swindalls oct 
17 indictment found the challenger leading 5327 percent 
were going to run the last two weeks of this campaign just as 
we had planned to not talking about pat swindall at all jones 
said were going to be talking about ben jones and taking the 
high road 
nonetheless the campaign has featured swindalls repeated 
questions about jones own legal problems and his admitted bout with 
alcoholism 
during his drinking days jones acknowledged he was arrested on 
several occasions for what he called stupid alcoholic behavior 
referring to old disorderly conduct charges 
swindall also called for new debates wednesday and said jones 
recently had avoided them adding if i held positions that are so 
clearly liberal i wouldnt want to face the voters either 
jones denied ducking swindall he said he has debated the 
congressman eight times and claimed swindall declined seven 
invitations to attend forums with jones 
but he said his schedule for the remainder of the campaign is 
already set and will not include debates 
swindall said he will ask voters to support him with the 
understanding he would resign if convicted that approach he said 
would ensure that a new republican candidate could enter the 
subsequent special election 
i believe they will reelect me with the understanding that an 
exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration 
before the election he said

chinese family planners today claimed a slackening 
of the population explosion in the first half of this year but said 
keeping the growth rate at manageable levels will not be easy 
li honggui a senior official in the family planning commission 
also disclosed at a news conference that there were 1039 million 
abortions 46 for every 100 live births in china last year 
china denies it forces women to undergo abortions although local 
officials are said to exert heavy pressure on women with unplanned 
pregnancies to abort 
according to a nationwide survey of 500000 households there 
were 884 births and 339 deaths per thousand people in the first 
six months of 1988 for a natural increase of 545 per thousand 
li and other members of the survey team said that compared to 
1004 births in the first half of 1987 and 2326 births for that 
entire year 
offices at various levels strengthened their work at the 
grassroots level liang jimin deputy chief of the survey team 
said in explaining the decrease 
li stressed that the survey conducted by 20000 people was 
accurate the communist partys official peoples daily reported 
last week that there has been serious underreporting of births from 
many rural areas because family planning officials file false 
reports to meet unrealistic birth targets 
li said the target of keeping chinas population 108 billion at 
the end of 1987 down to 12 billion in the year 2000 will not be 
met if there is any letup in population control policies 
chinese population experts have said the country could have up to 
128 billion people at the turn of the century if a recent 
population boom continues 
the nationwide growth rate climbed from 11 per thousand in 1985 
to 1616 in 1987 as a baby boom generation of the early 1960s 
reached childbearing age 
the faster growth rate is a result of a relaxation of chinas 
onechildperfamily policy although most couples in cities are 
allowed only one child couples in rural areas are generally allowed 
two particularly if the first child is a girl 
rural families want boys to help work the land and carry on the 
family name and many newly affluent peasants are willing to pay 
large fines for exceeding birth quotas until they produce a boy 
zhang pei deputy director of the department of education and 
communication in the family planning commission said families that 
produce unplanned babies are usually fined 10 to 15 percent of their 
annual incomes with the money going to welfare facilities he said 
some families have been fined up to 540 more than four times the 
average per capita annual income in the countryside

a man revealed to his 9yearold daughter 
that a pennsylvania couple claims she is their child and was mixed 
up at birth with another infant but he insisted he will not allow 
tests to prove it 
robert w mays a 43yearold roofing supply salesman identified 
himself for the first time wednesday as the father of the girl 
kimberly michelle mays he said he decided to step forward for fear 
that she would be told by someone else who might frighten her 
it took me a long time to realize the seriousness of this 
situation he said at first i thought it was at terrible 
joke 
regina and ernest twigg of langhorne pa claim the girl was 
born to them but was swapped with another child soon after birth in 
1978 at a florida hospital the girl they raised as a daughter died 
in august of a heart defect 
during a news conference at his attorneys office mays said he 
told his daughter a week ago of the twiggs monthslong battle to 
require her to submit to genetic blood tests to prove her parentage 
it was the most difficult thing i ever had to do in my life 
he said for a moment there was panic in her eyes she said 
daddy i dont want to move away 
does it mean im not your little girl she asked 
mays said he reassured the blond fourthgrader that he was her 
father and nothing would change then she settled down 
it was the only time during our hour talk she stopped me it 
was all that was important to her she wanted to make sure 
everything was still in place then she asked could she go ride 
her bike mays said 
mays said the twiggs have presented no evidence to show kimberly 
could be their daughter and even if genetic tests supported their 
claim mays said he would not surrender her 
i would fight to the ends of the earth for her he said 
i wouldnt care if they traced her heritage to cabbage patch 
usa she is my daughter 
an attorney for the twiggs william post said mays was 
irresponsible for coming forward 
the twiggs were terribly distressed and amazed that he would do 
a thing like that that he would call a press conference and 
expose a child to this kind of publicity post said 
the twiggs have said their daughter a healthy girl was switched 
in a babyselling scheme at hardee memorial hospital in wauchula for 
a sickly child hospital workers then altered records to hide the 
swap they allege 
kimberly was born at the hospital in late 1978 about the same 
time as the daughter the twiggs raised arlena the couple said 
genetic tests this summer proved arlena was not their biological 
daughter 
the twiggs filed a 100 million suit against the hospital and 
some of its employees and persuaded the fbi to investigate the fbi 
failed to find sufficient evidence that federal law had been 
violated 
this month the twiggs asked a judge in sarasota to force 
kimberly to submit to sophisticated genetic tests to determine if 
she has opositive blood like theirs but mays said he also has 
otype blood and doesnt know what type kimberly has 
the judge has yet to rule on whether the testing should be 
required 
mays said he hopes his disclosure will help avoid a long legal 
battle that could evolve into a custody fight with the twiggs 
we want them to please think about this child and not cause 
trauma in her life he said

portions are big enough for three and what else 
would one expect at a restaurant called triplets 
whats remarkable is that none of the three owners knew they were 
triplets until age 19 when they met and became best friends 
roommates classmates and eventually business partners 
robert shafran eddy galland and david kellman were born on long 
island 27 years ago adopted at birth and raised in the area not 
even their adoptive parents knew they were triplets said galland 
we were all fat kids with brown curly hair and we knew we were 
adopted we were comfortable with it he said 
in 1979 galland went to sullivan county community college but 
transferred the next year bobby came the next semester to 
sullivan and my friends thought i was back galland said 
one friend asked shafran his birth date and whether he was 
adopted and then told him he probably had a twin news stories were 
published about the brothers and when kellman saw one he realized 
the twins were triplets 
on sept 18 1980 they met 
it was like we always knew each other it was instant an 
incredible feeling said galland we knew immediately that we 
wanted to spend a lot of time together 
it was total excitement said kellman it was electric 
they all transferred to city university of new york rented an 
apartment got a parrot named zack and turned down book offers 
they earned degrees in business and international marketing 
eventually they got jobs at sammys famous roumanian restaurant 
a boistrous lower east side institution known for huge portions and 
familial atmosphere 
they learned their lessons well and in january opened triplets 
roumanian restaurant in the soho section of manhattan serving 
similar ambiance and abundant eastern european food 
it seats 200 and while people come in as strangers the brothers 
try to make sure they dont leave that way 
intentionally just a tad tacky triplets has a big awning with 
cartoon faces of the owners outside inside on three levels there 
are mauve banquettes mirrors and dozens of color photographs of 
diners having the time of their lives 
there are tshirts and coffee mugs decorated with the triplets 
mugs a triplets club offers discounts and special events on each 
table is a lighthearted comic bookstyle version of the brothers 
story 
sometimes there are comedians belly dancers musicians 
singalongs the words to such songs as hava nagila and new 
york new york are printed in the menus 
people walk in and say whos the bar mitzvah boy said 
shafran 
the brothers divide chores but shafran said all of us talk 
about what were looking for we can cover each others 
responsibilities our paths cross constantly 
and they clown around almost constantly they tell half jokes 
laughing before anyone on the outside has heard enough to get them 
sitting recently around a table in their restaurant the brothers 
are distinguishable shafrans the largest kellman the smallest 
kellman also is reputed to be the most levelheaded galland the 
most volatile shafran and kellman are married galland is single 
but theres no doubt theyre triplets 
theyre gregarious show signs of working out and dress 
fashionably each had a similar upbringing with upper middleclass 
jewish families theyve been studied by researchers looking at 
similarities and differences among separated twins and triplets 
galland said they are not interested in finding their biological 
parents and wont discuss the subject 
but theyll talk plenty about the comforts of home they offer at 
triplets 
huge portions of steak veal chops or chicken stuffed cabbage 
chopped liver chicken soup mashed potatoes with chicken cracklings 
and potato pancakes 
syrup pitchers of schmaltz rendered chicken fat sit on each 
table along with blue siphons of seltzer the seltzer is essential 
for the egg creams diners with any appetite left mix up after 
dessert using the traditional foxs ubet chocolate syrup and milk 
why such fare when americans are being urged to cut down on fat 
and salt 
we dont expect to see the same people every night let people 
have their wholegrain rice and their sushi five nights a week and 
then come here said galland i cant tell you how many times 
people say i havent eaten like this since my mother was alive or 
since my grandmother was alive

former nixon white house aide dwight l 
chapin who was imprisoned because he lied about his connection to 
political dirty tricks during the watergate scandal is serving as 
an unpaid staff adviser to george bushs presidential campaign a 
published report today said 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin asked whether it was 
appropriate for a watergate felon to be working as a campaign 
adviser told the san jose mercury news its not as if the guy 
has not paid his debt to society 
we feel that he ought to be allowed to participate in the 
process at this point goodin said 
a document distributed by bushs campaign headquarters last month 
to state republican officials lists chapin as one of four senior 
advisers to the scheduling and events unit of the national bush 
campaign a copy of the twopage document was obtained by the 
mercury news 
chapin was found to have lied about his dealings with donald h 
segretti a practitioner of campaign infiltration and sabotage whom 
chapin hired for the 1972 nixon reelection campaign 
his background is advance work goodin told the newspaper 
referring to chapin and thats been his strong suit my 
understanding of his chapins role is that from time to time he 
consults on some big events on advance techniques 
chapin who was president nixons appointments secretary from 
1969 to 1973 was convicted of two counts of perjury in april 1973 
and served six months in prison for lying to a federal grand jury 
that was investigating the watergate scandal

here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the 
trapped whales in barrow alaska 
oct 13 three california gray whales are discovered trapped in 
ice east of point barrow they apparently became stuck a week 
before biologists are unable to contact an icebreaking ship to give 
aid 
oct 14 whales continue to swim several hundred feet offshore 
using two holes in the ice to breathe biologists believe time is 
running out for the grays as temperatures drop to minus 13 degrees 
threatening to shrink the whales breathing space efforts fail 
again to contact an icebreaker 
oct 18 biologist says one whale may have pneumonia as an 
alaska army national guard skycrane helicopter sets out to tow a 
185ton hovercrafttype icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to the 
whales president reagan telephones with his support 
oct 19 eskimos cut new holes in the ice but the barge effort 
is hampered by shallow water biologists say the whales health 
appears stabilized and that they are handling their captivity 
better than first believed 
oct 20 barge begins its journey but moves only six miles 
through sand bars mud and shallow water two minnesota 
brothersinlaw arrive with deicers to enlarge breathing holes for 
the whales 
oct 21 one of the whales nicknamed bone disappears and 
is presumed dead rescuers try plan b a 5ton concrete 
bullet wielded by a helicopter loaned by the national guard an 
easterly wind opens leads or open water through the ice within 
four miles of the whales the soviet union offers an icebreaker to 
help in the rescue 
oct 22 eskimos using chain saws lead the whales almost a 
halfmile closer to open water by carving 24 breathing holes in the 
ice the skycrane dropping its bullet punches four 15to20foot 
holes in the ice at 75yard intervals but a massive pressure ridge 
of ice stands in the way 
oct 24 whales apparently spooked by shallower water over a 
shoal reverse course retreating 800 yards towards shore 
scientists probe the ice ridge for a weak spot that arriving soviet 
icebreakers could attack 
oct 25 two soviet icebreakers arrive and begin work smashing 
through the ice ridge the whales follow a detour cut by eskimos 
using chain saws around the shoal they had refused to pass 
oct 26 the soviet ships move within a quartermile of the line 
of breathing holes rescuers used a gargantuan tractorlike device 
propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the ships the 
whales moved into the new waterway cut by the vessels and were seen 
swimming in the channel that leads to the open sea

when david katz made his motion before judge julia 
nowicki her honor eyed him with great seriousness then performed 
the opening strains of marche militaire francaise 
no they arent a pair of comics theyre members of the chicago 
bar association symphony orchestra a 47member ensemble of lawyers 
who want to make motions in music as well as in the courtroom 
its a real nice break said ms nowicki 40 a domestic 
relations judge by day cellist by night with the 2yearold 
orchestra 
its real nice to be with lawyers and not fighting 
katz the orchestras conductor is the only nonlawyer among the 
performers who get together once a week in ms nowickis courtroom 
for practice 
about 30 lawyermusicians were free of their legal duties 
wednesday night when katz brought down the baton for the orchestras 
fall debut its ninth performance since its founding 
saintsaens marche militaire was followed by rossinis 
overture to the barber of seville sir arthur sullivans 
overture to hms pinafore and a tribute to another illinois 
lawyer lincoln portrait by aaron copland 
asked to assess the performance ms nowicki whose only formal 
music training came during her years in the chicago public school 
system at first didnt want to have any part of what might be 
selfincriminating testimony 
but she finally allowed judiciously that it was pretty good 
what the orchestra lacks in musicianship it makes up in spirit 
and seriousness 
i did this only for you bassoonist carl silberman told katz 
at the end of the performance in paneled hall at the university club 
i came into the rossini cold he added explaining that he 
had never before played the composition 
katz who heads the adrian mich symphony orchestra said one 
of the pleasant challenges of working with the lawyers is the 
variety of ability and experience they bring to their performance 
they take it very seriously but its fun for them and thats 
what makes it fun to conduct this orchestra said katz 
the lawyers orchestra has its orgin at a chicago symphony chorus 
messiah concert in which amateur singers and musicians perform 
with professionals 
ms nowicki one of the messiah participants discovered she 
was sitting next to another cellistlawyer why not get lawyers 
together to make music they thought 
part of being a lawyer is the ability to focus in on the work 
they do said katz i think lawyers are all performers at heart 
and they always rise to the occasion 
practice is a little nervewracking for the courthouse guards 
when the players file in for practice 
just what might be in those black cases everyones seen the 
movies of prohibition era gangsters and their machine guns 
this is chicago and walking into the courthouse with violin 
cases was a real problem for the guards said katz 
but everything considered the musicianlawyers do well he said 
its good therapy

president corazon aquino today 
threatened to shut down the company whose passenger ship sailed into 
typhoon ruby and sank with hundreds of people aboard 
authorities ordered the owners to explain why they should not 
lose their license for letting the vessel sail into a storm whose 
winds reached 140 mph 
the latest casualty figures indicate just 197 people survived the 
sinking monday of the 2855ton dona marilyn in heavy seas about 300 
miles southeast of manila 
the coast guard said an undetermined number of others reached a 
small island more than 100 miles west of where the ship sank at 
least 33 bodies have been recovered officials said 
some survivors remain in shock and were refusing to be flown from 
the islands where they washed ashore coast guard officials said 
today 
the ships manifest showed 431 passengers and a crew of 60 but 
coast guard officials said the headcount at sailing time was 379 
passengers 
today mrs aquino told reporters she had ordered the department 
of transportation to investigate sulpicio lines which owned the 
dona marilyn and another passenger ship that sank 10 months ago with 
more than 3000 casualties 
the dona paz dona marilyns sister ship collided with an oil 
tanker last december off mindoro island only 28 people survived 
if it is necessary to suspend operations of sulpicio lines 
then i would do so mrs aquino said on wednesday she said 
investigators should determine why the dona marilyn sailed despite 
the typhoons approach 
philip tuazon administrator of the governments maritime 
industry authority said his organization had ordered sulpicio to 
explain why we should not suspend them 
sulpicio president carlos go said he could not explain why the 
vessel sailed from manila on schedule sunday morning for tacloban 
350 miles southeast although the storm was approaching the eastern 
philippines 
go said he would have to speak first with surviving crew but 
added during sunday when they left manila the weather was 
clear 
in tacloban sulpicio station manager bernardo cabigon said the 
dona marilyns skipper was not among the confirmed survivors but 
that the chief mate and two other officers were reported safe on 
almagro island 
capt daniel delgado philippine coast guard chief of staff said 
the vessel was allowed to sail because no typhoon warning had been 
issued for the manila area at the time 
but nanette lumarda chief of the government weather services 
tropical cyclones secton said ruby developed into a tropical storm 
as early as 8 pm friday about 645 miles east of mindanao island 
at 11 am sunday one hour after the dona marilyn sailed the 
weather service issued a bulletin warning that ruby had grown into a 
typhoon and was moving westnorthwest toward the visayas islands 
she said 
she added that on sunday afternoon about 24 hours before the 
dona marilyn sank the weather service issued an international 
shipping advisory warning of rough to very high seas along the 
route of the stricken vessel she said warnings were updated every 
six hours 
vicente gambito a sulpicio vice president said the company 
received a message early monday from the dona marilyn that it was 
buffeted by giant waves south of masbate island 
gambito said the company ordered the captain to change course for 
the west using masbate as a shield against the storm five hours 
later the captain radioed the ship was taking in water and the 
condition was critical he said 
meanwhile go said 139 survivors were aboard another company 
ship the princess and expected in tacloban later today he said 
the others were still on maripipi almagro and other small islands 
near where the vessel sank 
lt edmund luscre coast guard operations chief in iloilo said 
an undetermined number of survivors reached sicogon a tiny resort 
island off the coast of panay sicogon is about 100 miles west of 
where the ship sank

those involved in freeing two california 
gray whales from their icy enclave said the experience left a 
lasting impression 
this is the wildest thing thats ever happened to me said 
craig george one of two north slope borough wildlife biologists who 
babysat the whales since they were found two weeks ago trapped in 
ice so thin it wouldnt support a mans weight 
its crazy it doesnt make any sense but its wonderful 
george said 
he said that at first he didnt think the whales could be freed 
no i thought it was one of those exercises in futility that 
you had to do he said i learned a lot i learned that with 
persistence clear thinking and proper chain saws you can do 
anything 
his colleague geoff carroll who shared the vigil for night 
after cold lonely night said he was more optimistic from the 
beginning 
it was just one of those things where you start out and see 
what happens i guess i always believed wed get them out but i 
never thought it would turn out the way it did 
whaling captain arnold brower also spent countless hours on the 
ice offering his expertise and mobilizing the eskimos who kept the 
whales alive and moving toward safety by cutting a path of more than 
100 breathing holes 
im really relieved he said i feel like my burden may be 
lifted 
rescue coordinator ron morris said he never had any doubts about 
the eventual success of the operation which ended with the whales 
following the path cut by a soviet icebreaker 
rick skluzacek and greg ferrian minnesotans who showed up 
uninvited to provide deicing equipment that enabled rescuers to 
keep the breathing holes open were elated 
great skluzacek said of the whales escape anything more 
than that oneword answer is too much you cant describe the 
feeling 
i couldnt feel better now no way shape or how he said as 
he went off to look for a cigar to celebrate 
it was a onceinalifetime experience said ferrian 
skuzaceks brotherinlaw but if anybody asked me to do it again 
id say no 
the environmental group greenpeace hailed the spirit of 
cooperation that characterized the rescue 
these whales showed us the way toward global consciousness and 
true international cooperation campbell plowden the groups 
whale campaign coordinator said in a statement released in 
washington dc if this much attention would only be paid to the 
plight of the hundreds of whales harpooned each year by japan 
iceland and norway the whales could truly be saved 
president reagan praised the rescue in a statement from the white 
house the human persistence and determination by so many 
individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankinds concern for 
the environment he said it has been an inspiring endeavor 
the soviet news agency tass noted those comments in its report on 
the story today

now and then peggy say allows herself to think 
about what would happen if terry anderson does not come home the 
brother she has not seen in 3 years marked his 41st birthday today 
still in captivity 
i tried to think what if he didnt come back what if they 
killed him i dont know what i would do because i would be so 
angry mrs say said during a recent interview at her home in a 
lakeside community near cadiz 
andersons birthday his fourth in captivity since he was 
abducted march 16 1985 in beirut was being celebrated with 
parties prayer services and rallies by friends and wellwishers 
from the middle east to his home town of batavia ny 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in 
lebanon he was kidnapped by the proiranian shiite moslem faction 
called islamic jihad or holy war 
we arent forgetting him said terri fritz of batavias radio 
station wbat which along with a merchants group sponsored a 
birthday party with a huge cake decorated with 1321 candles one 
for each day of captivity 
in lebanon seven newspapers published a letter to anderson on 
the eve of his birthday from a group of journalists working for his 
release 
we join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom we 
greet you we salute you and we encourage you said the letter 
from the journalists committee to free terry anderson all free 
men and women who live by the pen share in your captivity 
mrs say 47 who planned to spend andersons birthday with 
family and friends in new york city has devoted most of her energy 
since his abduction to gaining his release 
while she has tried to contemplate the worst she and her 
husband david are hopeful her brother will see freedom by the 
presidential election less than two weeks away 
its such an agony of anticipation mrs say said having 
been burned so many times in the past you try not to think about 
it 
something else she would prefer not to think about is how to tell 
her brother of the family changes that have occurred during his 
absence 
their father glenn r anderson died of cancer in february 1986 
four months later their 46yearold brother glenn jr died of 
cancer he died four days after making a videotape from his bed 
appealing to andersons captors 
andersons daughter gabrielle who was 10 years old when he was 
kidnapped is now a teenager he has yet to meet a second daughter 
sulome whose third birthday was june 7 
mrs say a quiet woman with piercing brown eyes has led 
candlelight vigils outside the white house and had coffee with 
president reagan in 1986 she made a 5000mile trip to the 
mideast and she has appeared on national talk shows 
i simply want my brother back she said 
today students at buffalo state college in new york planned to 
hold a rally on andersons behalf while in catskill south of 
albany parishioners of st patricks church scheduled a prayer 
service 
we see it as a chance to sensitize students to the issues of 
freedom said paul dewald a journalism professor who organized 
the rally terry is joe america to us and we have to stand up for 
him 
students were to wear armbands with andersons name and sign a 
huge birthday card that will be forwarded to lebanon dewald said

ap and other journalists in new york city

scientists seeking aids treatments and ways to 
make donated blood even safer say their studies suggest an unusual 
potential weapon ozone the main gas in smog 
im engaged in preliminary studies on the use of ozone in the 
treatment of aids aidsrelated complex and intractable diarrhea 
often suffered by patients with the deadly disease said dr michael 
carpendale of the veterans administration medical center in san 
francisco 
in a pilot study five aids and aidsrelated complex patients 
were given ozone rectally through a tube said carpendale the 
hospitals chief of rehabilitative medicine 
the treatment halted severe diarrhea in four of the patients 
possibly by hindering the aids virus he said wednesday 
wagner and dr kenneth wagner who conducted another ozone study 
said they want to study whether the worsening of aids in patients 
might be slowed if some of their blood is removed treated with 
ozone and replaced or if they are given the gas rectally so it is 
absorbed quickly into their blood 
the other study found ozone stopped the aids virus from 
multiplying in donated blood while leaving more than 90 percent of 
blood cells undamaged said wagner until recently head of the aids 
unit and infectious disease division at the naval hospital in 
bethesda md 
the findings raise the possibility that ozone often used to 
disinfect water and sewage might be applied to further reduce the 
risk that donated blood could carry the aids virus he said during 
the 28th interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and 
chemotherapy 
because blood donors are now tested the chance of a unit of 
blood carrying the virus is 1 in 50000 to 100000 said dr steven 
kleinman medical director of american red cross blood services for 
los angeles and orange counties 
kleinman said wagners study suggests but doesnt prove ozone 
could kill aids or other viruses in blood but its reasonable to 
try it out with more studies because we would like to make the 
risk much smaller 
the use of ozone to sterilize donated blood or treat aids 
patients would have to be proved safe for humans said dr mark 
rarick a blood and cancer specialist and aids researcher at the 
university of southern california 
medical uses of ozone have been limited largely to 
unsubstantiated treatments for various diseases by european holistic 
medicine practitioners 
rarick and kleinman said more studies must be done to determine 
if ozone not only stops the aids virus from multiplying in blood 
but actually prevents virus components hiding in blood cells from 
infecting other cells 
rarick also questioned whether treating aids patients with ozone 
would destroy virus particles hiding in body tissues something 
necessary to reduce symptoms carpendale said he plans to study that 
question 
nevertheless the preliminary results warrant further 
investigation rarick said 
wagner is now a senior researcher at the henry m jackson 
foundation for the advancement of military medicine but conducted 
his study with colleagues at the naval hospital before he retired 
from the navy on oct 1 
carpendales study hasnt been published but he is seeking 
approval to treat 20 more aids patients with ozone 
the use of ozone against aids may make many scientists roll 
their eyeballs wagner said but when you have a very bad 
disease like this with no cure you have to have an open mind

resettle the boat people 
asean groups thailand malaysia indonesia singapore the 
philippines and brunei 
the two days of informal discussions in thailand are organized by 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees which is also 
participating 
it was the first time since a 1979 international refugee 
conference that vietnam has participated in talks on a comprehensive 
strategy for alleviating the problem aid officials say there is a 
good possibility of another international conference early next year 
some southeast asian countries adopted tough policies even 
pushbacks against vietnamese boat people after they surged into the 
region in 1987 in the highest level in years 
vietnam eager to mend frayed relations with its noncommunist 
neighbors agreed this year to cooperate in finding a solution and 
has separately held talks with hong kong and malaysia on a possible 
program to repatriate some of the vietnamese 
a repatriation agreement recently was reached with hong kong 
a total of 28116 vietnamese boat people fled to neighboring 
countries in 1987 the highest annual figure since 43676 fled in 
1982 according to unhcr figures the highest number 11195 
arrived in thailand nearly triple the 1986 figure

a young japanese woman had the trip of a lifetime 
on a flight from tokyo to london a choice of 353 seats six 
movies a gourmet menu and the exclusive attention of 15 cabin 
attendants 
british airways said today that the woman identified only as 
mrs yamamoto was the lone passenger on the 8000mile flight 008 
which arrived at heathrow airport tuesday afternoon 
the jumbo was delayed going into tokyo and by the time it set 
off for london all the other passengers had been rebooked on to 
other flights said a british airways spokesman who by custom was 
not identified 
mrs yamamoto had actually arrived early at the airport for 
another british airways flight which was leaving later but since 
she was there she was offered the opportunity for the flight of a 
lifetime the spokesman said 
we had to come back empty because the jumbo was due back in 
britain to get back into its schedule 
mrs yamamoto on her way to join her husband who is studying at 
salford college of music had paid the standard 2975 economy fare 
for the 11hour trip but she sat in business class dined on 
poached salmon and watched goldie hawn in overboard 
the daily express estimated the flight cost at least 22750 
17500 for fuel and 5250 in wages for the cabin attendants and 
six flight deck crew 
were certainly not aware of it ever happening before and im 
sure mrs yamamoto saw british airways inflight service at its 
best the spokesman said

beating death of the 6yearold girl she and her livein lover 
illegally adopted but her attorney says she never will forgive 
herself for what happened

wednesday against hedda nussbaum who is expected to testify that 
her livein companion joel steinberg killed lisa steinberg whom 
they obtained as a newborn from an unwed teenage mother 
steinbergs murder trial was to resume today ms nussbaum is 
expected to be the star witness against him 
assistant district attorney john mccusker in requesting that 
murder charges against ms nussbaum be dropped said she was so 
physically and mentally incapacitated on the night of the murder 
that she was not criminally responsible for lisas death 
manhattan criminal court judge john stackhouse granted the motion

she hasnt excused herself she never will 
scheck also said the former childrens book editor would do 
anything to bring the child back he praised the district 
attorneys decision not to prosecute her saying it came after an 
unbelievably thorough and complicated investigation 
ms nussbaum 46 and steinberg 47 had been charged with 
seconddegree murder in the death of lisa last november steinberg 
was indicted by a grand jury on the charge ms nussbaum was not 
she has undergone surgery and extensive psychiatric treatment in 
the past year for physical and emotional injuries that her lawyer 
has said were inflicted by steinberg 
steinbergs lawyer ira london said of the dismissal of the 
charge i think it gives her an additional motive not to tell the 
truth it certainly is an incentive to tell the district attorney 
what he wants to hear but her credibility is a matter still for the 
jury to decide 
during opening remarks at the trial tuesday london called ms 
nussbaum delusional and told jurors they would learn of her 
selfdestructive romance with satanic cults and her 
sadomasochistic behavior outside the home 
scheck on wednesday said the implication of londons remarks was 
that ms nussbaums injuries were inflicted by someone other than 
steinberg 
that suggestion is absurd he said 
lisa was found unconscious in the couples squalid greenwich 
village apartment nov 2 and died three days later her death drew 
national attention and made her a symbol of the plight of abused 
children 
a 16monthold boy mitchell was found in the apartment sitting 
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen authorities said he 
also was illegally adopted and now lives with his biological mother

the president of a paper supply company being 
investigated in the pentagon fraud and bribery probe told employees 
to throw out documents that prosecutors say contained incriminating 
evidence court papers show 
federal agents seized the documents later that day june 21 from 
trash containers at the kane paper co on long island according to 
the search warrant application which along with other court papers 
was first made public wednesday 
the papers released by us district judge edward korman in 
response to a newspaper request show that james kane the firms 
founder called his company three times to talk with employees about 
throwing out business papers 
kanes conversations were intercepted by fbi agents who had been 
secretly monitoring phone conversations at kane paper which 
supplies paper products to aerospace companies 
kane is also the president of the long island aerospace political 
action committee and has been described by officials as an associate 
of charles gardner a private consultant and a former vice president 
of the unisys corp whose home has also been searched 
unisys is one of the nations largest computer manufacturers and 
a major military contractor search warrants were served at the 
companys eagen minn and great neck plants 
a secretary at kane paper said kane was out of town wednesday and 
unavailable for comment a message left with kanes attorney 
vincent fuller in washington was not immediately returned 
authorities have said agents deliberately had not gone to kanes 
plant on june 14 when they staged the first nationwide series of 
raids involving the defense contracting scandal because they wanted 
to continue monitoring the wiretaps 
on june 21 kane called in the morning and spoke to an employee 
identified as thomasa avellina according to court testimony by fbi 
agent dan melore 
kane says to avellina i think what you should do quietly is 
go through anything that might be around that you want to get rid 
of ok melore said avellina says to throw them out 
melore said kane no yeah avellina answers ok melore 
said 
kane again called avellina in midmorning and asked him did 
you get rid of the blank did you get rid of most of yours 
melore said avellina yeah 
kane called a third time around noon and spoke with another 
employee daniel carroll to ask if avellina had thrown out the 
documents melore said 
under questioning by korman melore said agents at the plant had 
seen business documents in at least one trash container those 
documents were later seized 
thats the circumstances which leads us to believe that at this 
point they were attempting to destroy incriminating documents 
melore said 
court documents made public earlier indicated that investigators 
were seeking information at kane paper about the possible extortion 
of campaign contributions from companies by private consultants and 
others 
korman also questioned melore about kanes relationship with 
gardner 
i know when we did the wiretap you persuaded me that kane was 
engaging in conversations with gardner that would relate and could 
relate to the unisys matter in which gardner was involved korman 
said but with respect to documents that are at kanes place of 
business thats another story kane wasnt involved in defrauding 
unisys

a federal study of workers at the savannah 
river nuclear plant found twice the usual rate of deaths from 
leukemia 
the finding by the oak ridge associated universities center for 
epidemiologic research is consistent with the results of a study by 
the du pont co released in 1976 plant officials said in a 
statement wednesday du pont runs the federal plant under contract 
the oak ridge study included 1274 male hourly workers who were 
hired before 1955 and worked five to 15 years overall they had 
fewer than expected deaths from all causes but six leukemia deaths 
a greater number than would be expected 
the finding of an increase in the number of leukemia deaths in 
this population warrants further investigation we are conducting a 
study in which a full assessment will be made of radiation and 
chemical exposure said donna l cragle head of a team of 
researchers at the oak ridge center 
cragle said in a statement released by the plant that further 
studies are under way to determine if the leukemia deaths are in any 
way related to the workers exposure to radiation or chemicals on 
the job 
radiation monitoring data for the men who died of leukemia showed 
that all were exposed to less than the current annual occupational 
radiation limit 
the researchers findings were reported this month in the 
american journal of industrial medicine they have been presented to 
plant employees and managers 
oak ridge associated universities is a private nonprofit 
association of 49 colleges and universities based in tennessee that 
is a management and operating contractor for the department of 
energy 
in a related development a national group of 60000 physicians 
and medical students called wednesday for the creation of a national 
medical board to assess public and environmental health problems 
associated with the operation of the savannah river plant and other 
us nuclear weapons plants 
physicians for social responsibility said production of nuclear 
weapons should not be resumed at savannah river until public health 
questions related to the plants operation are resolved 
and 28 members of the house armed services committee called 
wednesday for the department of energy to prove that the plants 
reactors are safe before they are restarted 
in separate but similar letters to president reagan and energy 
secretary john herrington the bipartisan coalition also urged the 
department to ask for enough money to correct mounting technical and 
environmental problems at the facility near aiken and at other 
nuclear weapons production facilities 
the letters written by rep john spratt dsc and signed by 
about 27 others place blame for the deteriorating complex on the 
department 
they say the result is that the nation is unable to produce 
nuclear materials needed to maintain the deterrent value of our 
nuclear weapons 
unlike a similar letter signed last week by 12 congressmen the 
spratt letters do not criticize du pont or any other contractors 
that operate does weapons facilities 
the crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period and 
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance safety and 
operating conditions said the letter to herrington 
among the demands in the letter to reagan is the appointment of a 
fivemember safety panel approved by congress during the summer the 
panel would represent another check on the energy departments 
operations 
herrington announced oct 11 that the department plans to restart 
one of the savannah river reactors by dec 31 except for an 
abortive attempt to restart another reactor in august all of the 
plants reactors have been shut since april due to safety concerns

striking hollywood teamsters were scheduled to 
vote on a tentative settlement with producers that a union leader 
expressed little enthusiasm over but predicted will be ratified to 
end the 24dayold walkout 
theres no winner earl bush secretarytreasurer of 
teamsters local 399 said wednesday in announcing the tentative 
pact its time to go back to work and get the industry back on 
its feet 
the teamsters on strike since oct 3 were scheduled to vote on 
the threeyear contract this afternoon if approved the 2100 
studio drivers represented by the local could return to work at the 
beginning of next week 
results of the balloting were expected late tonight or friday 
officials said 
it also was disclosed wednesday that 600 members of the laborers 
union settled their strike with the producers and will return to 
work monday 
and representatives of about 100 striking studio electricians 
were reported to have concluded their negotiations with the 
producers late wednesday and also are supposed to vote today on 
their pact 
at a news conference to announce the settlement bush showed 
obvious displeasure over the agreement in the teamsters strike and 
refused to say whether he would recommend it to union members 
i can recommend that its time to end the strike or a 
lockout bush said thats a lot different than recommending 
that this package is good or recommending to the members that they 
should be accepting on the terms of the package 
neither bush nor nicholas counter iii president of the alliance 
of motion picture and television producers would give details of 
the pact but a source told the los angeles times that union lost on 
a major issue in the strike new rules for overtime 
under the new contract a driver will only be paid overtime on 
saturday or sunday if working on those days means putting in more 
than 40 hours a week the source told the times previously drivers 
were paid overtime for all weekend work 
the agreement also would give most drivers 45centanhour wage 
increases for each of the next three years the newspaper reported 
the basic drivers wage under the current contract is 1661 an hour 
the studios have used replacement drivers during the strike but 
the teamsters are expected to get their jobs back the times said

vilma bande was frightened as giant 
waves rocked the passenger ship dona marilyn but the crew urged her 
to remain calm and take off her life jacket 
moments later she was adrift in stormy seas and the vessel was 
gone 
the 19yearold nurse en route to visit her parents in tacloban 
was among up to 500 passengers bound for tacloban from manila aboard 
the ship when it sank monday during the height of typhoon ruby 
she and more than 100 other survivors dazed and sullen after 
their ordeal arrived today in this city 350 miles southeast of 
manila the survivors included at least six children one a 
4yearold girl 
asked what happened to her parents the girl sighed theyre 
gone 
survivors appeared bruised and shaken several told of struggling 
for three or more hours in violent seas before washing ashore on 
small islands near where the vessel sank 
few survivors smiled or waved as they walked from the ship that 
brought them to tacloban some still clutched the life jackets that 
had saved them 
in manila the coast guard said some survivors remained today on 
small islands too shaken to agree to board rescue vessels 
officials said several were in shock 
miss bande said that as giant waves battered the 2855ton dona 
marilyn on monday she and hundreds of others anxiously waited on 
deck as the crew frantically tried to pump water from the ship 
there was no announcement the crew members were shouting 
dont panic remove your life jackets relax this is normal 
she said but few passengers if any heeded the advice 
suddenly she recalled a giant wave as tall as a building 
crashed over the deck and the vessel rolled to the side 
i jumped and in less than one minute i turned my back and the 
ship was gone she said 
lea hugo 29 donned a life jacket and leaped into the raging sea 
although she did not know how to swim 
i was struggling in the water she said i saw a piece of 
wood and clung to it the next thing i knew somebody grabbed me and 
helped me to shore 
miss hugo washed ashore on almagro island about 20 miles from 
where officials believe the dona marilyn sank 
she said some island fishermen braved the raging seas and set out 
in small boats to rescue passengers other survivors washed up on 
the beaches barely strong enough to walk 
the ordeal has left miss hugo a nurse temporarily blinded 
still she is thankful to be alive 
i am looking at you but i can only see your silhouette she 
said as tears streamed down her bruised face i guess im just 
lucky

an undersea explorer who found a wrecked pirate 
ship four years ago believes he can locate the site of the boston 
tea party and hopes to recover some of the 342 chests dumped into 
boston harbor in 1773 
barry clifford said he will ask the state board of underwater 
archaeological resources for a permit to survey what he believes is 
the tea party site and thesites of other harbor shipwrecks dating 
back to 1612 
we have very high hopes of finding these chests in very good 
condition clifford said we have every reason to believe that 
they would be in a fairly close radius to the original site and 
obviously buried in the mud 
clifford the 43yearold president of maritime explorations inc 
in chatham said he and his assistants have surveyed the harbor with 
electronic imagegathering equipment for 18 months in an effort to 
pinpoint the location 
he declined to say where he believes the tea party occurred 
fearing the site might be raided but he said it is in fort point 
channel not far from where the beaver a replica of one of the tea 
party ships is docked 
while some of the chests probably floated away many should be in 
the area under four to 10 feet of mud clifford said 
the chests are believed to be 16 inches long 12 inches wide and 
12 inches high and covered with lacquer and enamel 
chinese lacquer is impervious to water and with the mud acting 
as a refrigerator our chemists feel theres a good chance that some 
of these chests will be in good condition clifford said 
robert cahill described as an expert on new england shipwrecks 
told the boston herald each chest could be worth as much as 1 
million depending on its interest as an historical artifact 
the tea party was a protest against the threepenny tax king 
george iii imposed on american colonists for a pound of tea 
on dec 16 1773 30 patriots dressed as american indians 
raided three ships in boston harbor hauling crates containing tea 
chests to the decks opening the chests and throwing them into the 
ocean 
in 1984 clifford located the 18th century pirate ship whydah off 
wellfleet on cape cod he said he has excavated less than 4 percent 
of the treasure estimated at millions of dollars that was on that 
ship

president reagan said today americans 
should vote for republican george bush as an act of selfdefense 
because democratic rival michael dukakis favors gun controls and to 
say no to higher taxes 
playing to the conservative values of his audience of gop 
partisans at a little rock airport rally the president portrayed 
dukakis as a farout liberal who would raise taxes and threaten the 
nations defenses but is trying to disguise his real goals from 
the voters 
i have to say how can a man running for president of the 
united states look the american people in the eye and tell you that 
his ideology doesnt matter reagan asked in a prepared speech 
in one of his hardesthitting speeches yet as bushs chief 
surrogate on the campaign trail reagan suggested that the 
massachusetts governor has used his newly toughened attacks on the 
gop nominee to hide his own liberal record 
ladies and gentlemen if he is saying to you that what he 
believes doesnt matter isnt he really saying that what each one 
of us believes doesnt matter reagan asked 
embarking on a weeklong crosscountry tour reagan was 
traveling from arkansas to missouri and california to tout his vice 
president as crimebusting yet compassionate man who deserves to 
inherit the white house oval office 
on nov 8th go into that polling booth and do some negative 
campaigning of your own the right kind of negative campaigning say 
no to new taxes and yes to the republican ticket the 
president told his audience 
he charged that dukakis would allow only the military and 
police to carry guns and said voters should cast their ballots 
for bush and his running mate dan quayle as an act of 
selfdefense 
dukakis says he wants to keep guns out of the hands of criminals 
but favors their ownership by hunters sportsmen and homeowners who 
want to protect their lives and property 
throughout his speech reagan boasted of what george and i 
had achieved for eight years george bush and i have worked 
sidebyside in the white house during times of crisis and times of 
historic triumph and achievements he said 
for example the president said you know violent crime has 
fallen significantly since 1981 because george and i put criminals 
on notice 
the president claimed that under bushs leadership a federal 
task force had slashed 600 million manhours of paperwork a year 
from the governments workload spearheaded the administrations 
antidrug offensive and paved the way toward the ussoviet treaty 
banning mediumrange nuclear missiles 
reagan praised bush as strong decent loyal wise capable and 
compassionate a man who has the qualities necessary to fill the 
office of president 
he added as for a certain governor from a certain new england 
state id best let someone else do the talking former arkansas 
congressman ed bethune said hed met this fellow 10 years ago and 
his reaction was let me quote him now i have never met a person 
in my whole life who is more liberal 
reagan obviously buoyed by recent polls showing bush widening 
his lead over the democratic nominee said i have little doubt 
that the people of the united states are going to do exactly what i 
did eight years ago they are going to choose george bush 
at a gop fundraising luncheon wednesday in baltimore the 
president said bush has democrats squirming and squealing 
because hes shown them to be what they really are as liberals 
who stand outside the mainstream of american values 
in light of bushs doubledigit leads in the polls reagan also 
will spend some time next week boosting local gop candidates in 
several cities in southern california as well as nevada and 
wisconsin 
amid his hectic schedule of crosscountry campaigning reagan has 
sandwiched in a weekend respite at his santa barbara ranch with his 
wife nancy 
since labor day reagan has made 21 political appearances in 13 
states and has raised about 88 million for the national and state 
republican campaign coffers

a second canadian businessman is back in 
the bidding for the assets of ptl the financially troubled ministry 
of deposed television evangelist jim bakker 
real estate magnate peter thomas of vancouver asked us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds to consider his proposal along with 
that of stephen mernick of toronto 
four of ptls largest creditors joined in thomas motion which 
was filed wednesday in federal bankruptcy court attorneys for two 
creditors said they werent endorsing thomass 113 million offer 
over mernicks 115 million bid but that they want reynolds to have 
a choice from at least two competing bids 
reynolds is scheduled to rule on thomas motion nov 16 which is 
the same day he has set to consider a motion approving a sale to 
mernick 
ptl which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 
must sell its assets to pay debts that could amount to more than 
130 million 
ptls holdings include the 500acre heritage usa theme park 
1700 acres of undeveloped land and the ptl satellite tv network 
mernick had apparently won the bidding oct 4 when ptl trustee 
mc red benton accepted his 115 million offer and promised not 
to negotiate further with anyone else other bidders can go directly 
to the court but none had done so until thomas filed his motion 
wednesday 
in accepting mernicks bid benton said he had rejected a 113 
million offer by thomas in september because thomass 46 million 
cash down payment would not be due until september 1989 
mernicks offer includes 50 million cash by dec 31 however 
mernick has until nov 15 to back out of the deal with no penalty 
thomas new offer still has a 113 million total price but 
matches mernicks 50 million cash thomas would have until feb 28 
to back out and until june 30 to close the sale and come up with 
the cash 
thomas announced his reentry in the bidding at his vancouver 
british columbia headquarters 
were elated thomas said we didnt like being on the 
sidelines we always felt our offer was one of the best 
in a telephone interview with the charlotte nc observer 
thomas said he thinks his offer may be more attractive to reynolds 
because he promises to maintain heritage usa as a christian retreat 
while mernick who is jewish makes no such pledge 
i think mernicks and my offers are so dramatically different 
that its right the judge should look at them thomas said my 
offer is committed to keep the ambience of the site like it is 
and mr mernicks offer is more of paving it and putting a shopping 
center on it 
mernick said two weeks ago that he had made no decision about 
what he would do with heritage usa but added that the undeveloped 
land would be excellent for condominiums shopping centers and 
commercial buildings

smarting from one of the heaviest israeli 
air raids on their strongholds this year palestinians today buried 
19 people killed in an air assault and ensuing ground battle near 
the port city of sidon 
although the palestine liberation organiztaion said it planned 
mass funerals for the victims they were buried in quiet ceremonies 
in sidons main cemetery and a palestinian graveyard in the nearby 
village of darb elseem 
there were no antiisraeli chants or cries for revenge that had 
characterized funerals for victims of previous israeli attacks 
we just couldnt risk mass gatherings said a guerrilla 
officer at one of the funerals he refused to give his name with 
israels appetite for attacking at its peak we figured its prudent 
to keep a low profile 
police said rescuers using gasoline lanterns searched the rubble 
of a guerrilla base of 30 buildings pulverized in the wednesday 
morning bombing of sidons mieh mieh refugee camp they dug out nine 
bodies 
a family of six a man his wife and their two sons and 
daughters were among the bodies the childrens ages ranged 
between six and 15 police said the three other victims were 
guerrillas 
six bodies were found immediately after the air raid on the base 
which belonged to palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
aarafats mainstream fatah guerrilla group 
four other palestinian guerrillas were killed in a ground battle 
that began after the raid with israels main proxy force the south 
lebanon army militia 
the four guerrillas belonged to the radical fatahrevolutionary 
council which is headed by the notorious palestinian terrorist 
mastermind abu nidal 
the mieh mieh air raid claimed the second heaviest casualty toll 
of israels 18 air strikes in lebanon this year twentysix people 
were killed and 30 wounded in the first air raid north of sidon jan 
3 
police and guerrilla spokesmen regarded wednesdays assault as 
the worst in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties 
mieh mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since 
israels 1982 invasion of lebanon said a police spokesman in 
sidon he cannot be named under standing regulations 
among those killed was col mustafa daoud commander of the 
1000strong fatah militia 
the mieh mieh raid was followed 4 hours later by two bombing 
runs against guerrilla bases of prosyrian palestinian factions just 
south of beirut and in hills overlooking the coastal town of damour 
midway between beirut and sidon at least one guerrilla was wounded 
the israeli strikes followed two foiled palestinian guerrilla 
attempts to infiltrate into northern israel from south lebanon on 
tuesday the attempts were uncovered by israeli troops and the 
predominantly christian sla militiamen who patrol israels 
selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
israel warplanes struck bases in lebanon on friday and sunday in 
retaliation for a suicide car bombing in the security zone last week 
in which eight israeli soldiers were killed and nine people wounded 
twentyone people were killed and 34 wounded in the two strikes 
which were directed against palestinian and lebanese shiite moslem 
bases in south and southeast lebanon 
the proiranian shiite hezbollah or party of god had claimed 
responsibility for the suicide bombing

democrats and republicans traded 
recriminations after condemned multiple murderer john wayne gacy 
apparently criticized the use of his name in gop campaign leaflets 
as disgusting and exploitive 
gacy through a spokesman for the illinois department of 
corrections confirmed wednesday that he sent a letter to gop 
officials about leaflets that say gacy would have been eligible 
for weekend passes had he committed his 33 murders in 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis home state 
the republican leaflets were labeled garbage earlier this 
month by dukakis the democratic presidential candidate and gop 
presidential candidate george bush said saturday he disapproved of 
them 
but judith erwin illinois communications director for dukakis 
campaign suggested wednesday that republicans might have somehow 
concocted gacys letter 
it is really right up their alley and an alley is where they 
are trying to conduct the campaign she said 
the language in that letter is language out of a campaign 
brochure tell me how a man on death row is so well informed about 
the inner workings of a presidential campaign 
earlier stuart piper executive director of the illinois 
republican party had characterized the letter by saying here 
again we have another example of a criminal who is apparently 
supportive of mike dukakis 
later he denied any party involvement 
we dont condone such campaign tactics or those remarks from 
the dukakis campaign he said we held this letter for two days 
and it wasnt until gacy apparently sent this letter to a news 
organization that this story came about we had nothing to do with 
it and didnt feel that it merited any further public discussion due 
to the source 
in a onepage typewritten letter received monday at state 
republican headquarters gacy wrote it is an insult to the voting 
public that the illinois republican state central committee has to 
drop to such a sleazy level by exploiting the name of john wayne 
gacy in order to scare people into voting for george bush 
a virtually identical letter dated oct 23 was mailed to the 
associated press after a request from the ap gop officials 
provided a copy of the letter they received 
the letter sent to the republicans called the campaign literature 
disgusting and exploitive and said cant bush run on his own 
record and the truth instead of all this scarey sic fantasy 
the state gop mailings refer to a furlough program for prisoners 
carried on under dukakis administration and to a convicted killer 
willie horton who brutalized a maryland couple while on furlough 
from a massachusetts prison 
if john wayne gacy had committed his atrocious crimes in boston 
instead of chicago he would be eligible for weekend passes under 
michael dukakis furlough program the leaflets said 
gacy was convicted in 1980 in the killings of 33 young men and 
boys 29 of whom were found buried in his home near chicago 
he was sentenced to death and is imprisoned at the menard 
correctional center in southern illinois but appeals are pending

an 8yearold girl who was allegedly beaten to 
death by members of a commune founded by her father was mourned by 
about 150 people including her uncle who said he hoped others 
could learn from the tragedy 
dayna lorea broussards uncle henry webb was the only speaker 
at the funeral wednesday at the angelus crenshaw chapel to refer 
directly to the circumstances surrounding the girls death 
this is an experience that weve never experienced before 
webb told the mourners as daynas body lay in a pink embossed 
casket through this experience may we learn to love one another 
better and to experience life more 
the girls parents did not attend the service 
dayna who would have turned 9 on monday died oct 14 allegedly 
from beatings and whippings administered by members of the ecclesia 
athletic association a group formed to help innercity children 
the girls parents stayed away from the funeral because of the 
media attention it has attracted said the childs maternal 
grandmother viola grant who arranged the service 
daynas father eldridge broussard jr a former college 
basketball star in oregon organized the athletic commune in sandy 
ore as a training center and an extension of the watts christian 
center founded by his father 
authorities in clackamas county ore have alleged that the 
children found at a home there were forced to watch as adults using 
paddles or electrical cords administered ritualistic beatings to 
children 
broussard was in los angeles at the time of his daughters death 
but has since returned to sandy 
broussard has maintained that ecclesia no longer exists 
sabotaged by biased news media portrayals that likened his group to 
a cult he also has blamed the media for his daughters death 
four people have been charged with firstdegree manslaughter in 
the ecclesia case and the oregon childrens services division has 
taken more than 50 children into protective custody 
the four people charged in the girls death have pleaded innocent 
meanwhile a misdemeanor complaint alleging child endangerment 
and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed wednesday in 
los angeles against alvin elvis broussard the 25yearold brother 
of eldridge 
the complaint stemmed from a police visit to the watts christian 
center on oct 16 that was prompted by news reports of daynas death 
in oregon said mike qualls a spokesman for city attorney james 
hahn 
officers at the center found a 10yearold boy with bruises who 
said he had been struck by alvin broussard hahn said in a statement

a young japanese woman had the trip of a lifetime 
on a flight from tokyo to london a choice of 353 seats six 
movies a gourmet menu and the exclusive attention of 15 cabin 
attendants 
british airways said today that the woman identified only as 
mrs yamamoto was the lone passenger on the 8000mile flight 008 
of the boeing 747 which arrived at heathrow airport tuesday 
afternoon 
the jumbo was delayed going into tokyo and by the time it set 
off for london all the other passengers had been rebooked on to 
other flights said a british airways spokesman who by custom was 
not identified 
mrs yamamoto had actually arrived early at the airport for 
another british airways flight which was leaving later but since 
she was there she was offered the opportunity for the flight of a 
lifetime the spokesman said 
we had to come back empty because the jumbo was due back in 
britain to get back into its schedule 
mrs yamamoto on her way to join her husband who is studying at 
salford college of music had paid the standard 2975 economy fare 
for the 11hour trip but she sat in business class dined on 
poached salmon and watched goldie hawn in overboard 
the daily express estimated the flight cost at least 22750 
17500 for fuel and 5250 in wages for the cabin attendants and 
six flight deck crew 
were certainly not aware of it ever happening before and im 
sure mrs yamamoto saw british airways inflight service at its 
best the spokesman said 
in geneva thomas pyle spokesman for the international air 
transport association said its the first time we have heard of 
something like this it must be extremely rare if not the only 
occasion she certainly got a good deal

personal trips taken by secretary of state 
george shultz on his military aircraft over a 30month period cost 
the government nearly 19 million with shultz paying only the 
price of economyclass airfare a congressional report says 
the general accounting office report says shultz took 23 personal 
trips during the 30 months ended last july most of them visits to 
family homes at stanford university in palo alto calif and 
cummington mass most of the time shultz was accompanied only by 
his wife helena 
the total bill for those trips came to 1892214 gao told the 
house government operations committee in a report released 
wednesday most of the money was spent for shultz military plane 
its sophisticated communications equipment and the secretarys 
security personnel the review said 
shultz reimbursed the government for less than 1 percent of the 
cost basing his repayment rate on the economy air fare rate to a 
destination plus 1 state department officials told the gao 
the total amount shultz reimbursed the government was 18783 
the gao said 
shultz annual cabinet salary is 99030 his net worth is 
unavailable but his financial disclosure form filed earlier this 
year shows that a blind trust created from his holdings had income 
last year in excess of 100000 
state department spokesman charles redman said shultz used the 
military plane because the secretary of state is the secretary of 
state 24 hours a day 365 days a year no matter where he is 
redman said shultz has followed the practice used by other 
secretaries of state for the past 15 or 20 years many other cabinet 
members also use military aircraft for reasons of improved security 
and communications he said 
redman added the fact of the matter is that the security 
threat doesnt disappear just because the secretary happens to be on 
vacation nor does the need for communications 
the bulk of the 189 million cost for the 23 trips went for 
military aircraft 797219 the gao said hotel accommodations for 
security personnel and other aides cost 336414 overtime for those 
personnel cost 256205 per diem food costs were 183030 and 
141464 was spent to install telephone lines 
in addition to the 23 personal trips the study listed a series 
of other trips by shultz between 1982 and 1986 that were listed as 
official travel but which also included a private component those 
trips werent among the 23 whose expenses were totaled by the gao

president reagan said today the united states 
has no choice but to tear down the nearly complete us embassy 
in moscow because the facility is riddled with eavesdropping devices 
reagan walking toward his helicopter to begin a campaign trip to 
arkansas missouri and california was asked if he had decided the 
embassy must be demolished 
yes he replied because theres no way to rid it of the 
many listening devices that were built into it 
we have to do it we have no choice reagan said asked where 
the money would be found for a replacement he replied well take 
it away from something else 
were going to start and have an americanbuilt one he said 
of the embassy 
the washington post reported today that reagan will recommend to 
congress that the embassy be razed and rebuilt at a cost estimated 
at 300 million 
the newspaper said it could take five years to build a 
replacement eightstory embassy on the same site with materials 
imported from the united states 
state department sources have said secretary of state george 
shultz recommended the move to reagan after the unfinished building 
was inspected by a congressional delegation and a private 
engineering firm 
the first eavesdropping bugs in structural elements built 
elsewhere by soviet workers and transported to the site were 
discovered by us inspectors in the spring of 1987 
one member of congress who toured the facility rep olympia 
snowe rmaine said in september that 38 million remained in 
previously approved enbassyconstruction appropriations to dismantle 
the unoccupied embassy 
but rep snowe said that bdm corp which inspected the facility 
for the state department said the dismantling could cost 160 
million construction of the bugriddled embassy and studies about 
its future have cost nearly 60 million 
the post said officials now plan to fabricate the buildings main 
elements in the united states ship them to the soviet union keep 
them under heavy guard and have the building assembled by us 
workers taken to moscow for the construction project 
state department officials said that until a new us embassy is 
occupied soviet officials in washington will be barred from using 
their longcompleted but unoccupied embassy office building 
the united states and the soviet union agreed in 1972 to build 
new larger embassies in each others capital

prices of imported goods dropped 11 percent 
from july through september the first quarterly decline in more 
than two years the government reported today 
the labor department said the decline which followed a 26 
percent second quarter increase reflected widespread drops in a 
variety of imported goods only the cost of chemicals showed an 
increase for the quarter rising by 27 percent 
by contrast crude oil and other imported fuels fell by a steep 
71 percent while the cost of imported food dropped 11 percent and 
imported machinery prices dipped 05 percent 
without the big drop in energy prices all imported goods still 
would have registered a 06 percent price drop during the quarter 
after a 24 percent rise in the previous quarter 
it is the first drop in import prices since the first quarter of 
1986 when prices fell 33 percent part of the price decline 
reflected the fact that the dollars value on foreign exchange rates 
rose during the quarter 
even with the july through september decline import prices are 
still 41 percent higher than they were a year ago 
the price of us exports rose 2 percent during the third quarter 
and now stands 87 percenting 
the impact of the summer drought in the farm belt as grain prices 
rose sharply food exports had risen by 86 percent in the second 
quarter and are now 368 percent higher than a year ago 
in contrast prices of crude materials which had been rising 
rapidly edged up just 06 percent in the third quarter the 
smallest increase in two years 
the category of machinery and transport equipment which 
constitutes nearly onehalf of us exports rose by 05 percent in 
the third quarter following a 08 percent rise in the second quarter

us customs service inspectors are protesting a computer system 
that they say allows more drugs to enter the country because it 
tells them how thoroughly to search or not to search cargo 
shipments 
seven years ago customs agents say they examined about a 
quarter of all cargo imported through miami international airport 
but now 90 percent of the items pass through untouched under the 
program that has computers target likely contraband shipments 
they have created an honor system for importers said reta 
grant presidentelect of the national treasury employees union in 
miami instead of being on site to inspect merchandise we are 
sitting behind computers its like taking a policeman off the beat 
and putting him in an office and expecting him to do his job 
but agency administrators say that the nationwide computer system 
that was the target of the protest wednesday was responsible for 
recent seizures of large amounts of cocaine and that any problems 
with the system were being corrected 
we know that incidents have happened and where we can make a 
change or an adjustment we do that said robert murphy deputy 
assistant regional commissioner of commercial operations for the 
customs service in chicago if it was not for the system there 
would be a lot more incidents and shipments of drugs getting 
through 
about 20 customs workers picketed outside the miami airport 
carrying signs bearing slogans such as customs computer system is 
a welcome mat for drug smugglers and customs commissions 
computers create chaos 
federal workers also demonstrated outside the customs services 
regional office in chicago and similar demonstrations were held at 
other large ports of entry 
the customs service began using the computer system in 1984 and 
it is now operating at all of the 300 official ports of entry in the 
united states said spokesman ed kittredge in washington 
the system targets specific cargo shipments for thorough searches 
based on various criteria including whether the shipment is a 
firsttime import to a particular company whether the merchandise 
comes from a drugrelated country and whether people suspected by 
the customs service handled the goods he said 
anthony hartnett a customs inspector at chicagos ohare 
international airport said the agency was relying too much on the 
computers 
computers are good but they should be a tool and not the sole 
thing the agency relies on and thats whats happened said 
hartnett when the computer and the inspector disagree the final 
vote should go to the inspector 
while inspectors technically may ignore the computers advice 
weve been told that when the computer said an extensive search 
was not necessary we should go along with it hartnett said 
kittredge said the computer is only a tool any inspector is 
encouraged to look at any cargo he or she suspects he said 
in at least one case drugs were discovered by inspectors who 
disregarded the computers determination that a shipment needed only 
a cursory check said george king a union spokesman in chicago 
in that incident in july the computer said a shipment labeled 
coffee that arrived at newark international airport in new jersey 
did not need to be checked thoroughly he said but the inspector 
was suspicious because the shipment weight a lot more than others 
the importer had received he said 
the inspector searched intensively and found 6000 pounds 
of cocaine concealed in blocks of chocolate he said the 
computer said let it go the person said wait a minute

the republican designation next to a 
candidates name in nebraska usually means an election winner but 
democrat bob kerrey has emerged as the leading contender for the 
states us senate seat 
in this state george bush will win if all he is doing is 
breathing that day state sen ernie chambers the new alliance 
party candidate for the senate said referring to the gop 
presidential nominee 
only one democratic presidential candidate lyndon b johnson 
has carried nebraska since franklin d roosevelts win in 1936 
this is a republican state said rep virginia smith rneb 
the 77yearold grand dame of nebraska politics nebraskans 
philosophy is a relatively conservative philosophy 
but the 45yearold kerrey former governor of nebraska leads 
republican sen david karnes by more than 20 points in recent 
statewide polls and political observers are hardpressed when asked 
for clear reasons 
some cite kerreys record in the vietnam war where he lost part 
of his leg and received the medal of honor others attribute his 
success to good looks and star quality kerrey attracted national 
attention when he dated actress debra winger 
still others believe kerreys independence from the democratic 
party makes him appealing to nebraskans 
at a recent rotary club speech kerrey was asked if he could 
provide one good reason other than his party affiliation for 
supporting democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
no kerrey replied sending his audience into peals of 
laughter 
he later explained to the group that he supports the democratic 
ticket but that he and the white house contender dont agree on 
everything 
bob kerrey is a unique individual who personifies certain 
traits that nebraskans respect said dave heineman an adviser to 
rep hal daub rneb he is uniquely different 
to make matters worse for republicans karnes has encountered a 
series of problems since his appointment by gop gov kay orr to the 
senate after the death of ed zorinsky 
many republicans believed daub deserved the appointment and 
although karnes and his backers say the wounds have healed others 
say bad feelings still exist 
there is a deep wound a deep split in the republican party 
said sen j james exon dneb a former governor now in his second 
term in the senate 
hal daub had done his homework and carried the water for the 
elephants for a long time he was entitled more to the job and then 
he was hit in the head with a twobyfour by the republican 
governor exon said 
daub challenged karnes in a heated may primary and was favored 
but karnes scored an upset win 
in the one and only debate between kerrey and karnes the 
republican candidate elicited boos from some in the crowd of 2000 
when he said we need fewer farmers at this point in time 
karnes who has an interest in a family farm in central nebraska 
and whose commercials have portrayed him as a farmer senator 
later said he misspoke 
i obviously dont support that statement he said 
karnes also encountered some difficulties when he noted that the 
list of hollywoodtypes supporting kerrey include jane fonda 
who came under attack for her wartime visit to north vietnam 
kerrey angrily denied any association with fonda saying her trip 
during the war hurt him and his fellow soldiers the democrats 
staff pointed out that while kerrey was earning the medal of honor 
karnes was using college draft deferments 
i have not gone through dave karnes campaign list and said 
gee youre going to be beholden to donald trump because he holds a 
fundraiser for you kerrey said its just old politics and the 
anger that i feel toward jane fonda is that i and a lot of other 
vietnam vets suffered as a result of her actions 
i understand she is connected to this political action 
committee but she has made no direct contribution to me and i 
wouldnt accept it 
karnes says his ideals are more in tune with those of the late 
zorinsky than are kerreys 
ed zorinsky was a conservative he voted a number of times with 
president reagan thats why he was popular it wasnt because he 
dated a movie star karnes said

a federal judge today delayed indefinitely the 
arraignment of ferdinand marcos on racketeering charges but ordered 
the wife of the deposed philippine president to appear in new york 
on monday 
i am adjourning sine die without date the arraignment of 
president marcos said us district judge john f keenan after 
defense lawyers presented him with doctors letters saying marcos 
was too ill to travel the 5000 miles from hawaii 
but keenan refused to delay the arraignment of imelda marcos 
who like her 71yearold husband was indicted last week for an 
alleged scheme that looted their homelands treasury of more than 
100 million 
i see no reason at all to delay her arraignment said keenan 
despite pleas from marcos attorney richard a hibey about the 
lengthy flight to new york from honolulu where the marcoses have 
lived since fleeing the philippines in february 1986 
the marcoses were indicted friday in us district court in new 
york 
in honolulu lawyers had said a private jet owned by a tobacco 
heiress was at the ready to fly marcos and his wife to new york if 
the arraignment was to be held there 
doris duke 74 who owns a mansion in the exclusive honolulu 
oceanfront neighborhood of black point had agreed to lend marcos 
her specially equipped boeing 737300 if federal officials rejected 
his lawyers request to move mondays arraignment from new york 
we have asked mrs duke for the use of her plane and she 
graciously agreed said marcos attorney john bartko the 
government knows that we had to tell them what arrangements were 
being made 
marcos lawyers contend the 71yearold marcos is too frail to 
make the trip for such a simple proceeding 
marcos is prohibited by the us immigration and naturalization 
service from leaving the island of oahu without filing a written 
application

the citys legal director jailed on contempt of 
court charges says detroit officials broke no laws in spending 
421 million to assist in an industrial development project 
wayne county circuit judge james rashid this week ordered 
corporation counsel donald pailen held indefinitely in the county 
jail after pailen refused to supply the detroit news with public 
records related to its 1987 purchase of 15 acres of riverfront 
property for construction of a chrysler corp assembly plant 
but mayor coleman a young praised the citys top lawyer 
wednesday for defying rashids order and going to jail 
i think hes a hero young said i think hes standing up 
for all of our rights and im proud of him the principle here is 
how much license does the press have to destroy peoples 
reputations thats why don pailen is in jail 
other city officials had joined pailen in arguing that the 
documents should be withheld while a federal grand jury investigated 
the transaction 
we of course take the position that there is no criminal 
wrongdoing associated with anything related to this deal pailen 
said tuesday after calling a wxytam talkshow host collect from his 
cell 
in this case the grand jury convened to look into this issue 
they should be the ones to determine the truth of the matter he 
said this is not a situation in our view that should be dealt 
with and tried on the front page of the press 
detroit officials have asked the michigan supreme court to stay 
rashids order to release the documents and to stay the judges 
decision to hold pailen in civil contempt of court the court had 
not acted on those requests by wednesday afternoon clerk monica 
kohmetscher said 
i make no apologies and no excuses for refusing to release 
the documents pailen told wxyt it is my principle of law and i 
think its one the courts will ultimately have to recognize as 
having validity until that happens im content to be here 
pailen is segregated from other inmates in the 1551bed facility 
and has been conducting limited office work officials said

the five british deaths included a family of four 
no date was set for the five to hang jalal aly lutfy the chief 
defense lawyer said he would file an appeal within the required 40 
days 
court records identified the palestinians as imad ahmed huello 
hassan gasim nimir sharif ismat atwa mustafa arif and ibrahim ali 
the sentencing hearing had been postponed four times 
after the third postponement oct 17 the united states expressed 
concern over reports in khartoum that abu nidal a palestinian 
terrorist whose group has been linked to many terror attacks was 
trying to buy lenient treatment for the accused in exchange for 
money to help flood victims 
sudanese security sources said in may that two of the convicted 
men told investigators they were members of abu nidals group 
the sources quoted the two men as saying the attacks were meant 
to avenge the assassination of khalil wazir or abu jihad a close 
adviser to palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat

of tunisia by commandos which arab and other sources linked to 
israeli intelligence

terry anderson the longestheld foreign 
hostage in lebanon turned 41 today and spent a fourth consecutive 
birthday in captivity 
proiranian militants holding him again denied any links to a 
woman who was arrested in italy carrying a photograph of the 
american journalist 
the statement by islamic jihad or islamic holy war was 
delivered to a western news agency and accompanied by an old photo 
of anderson 
the statement did not provide any information on anderson or 
another american the group is holding thomas sutherland 
it was devoted to denying links to the lebanese woman aline 
rizkallah 36 who was arrested at milan airport last week a 
photograph of anderson another american hostage alann steen and a 
third picture of an unidentified man were found in her luggage along 
with a letter purportedly from steen 
police in milan said today the letter appears to be a fake they 
say the photos and the letter were supposed to go to a us 
organization through an italian arms dealer police said the woman 
also was carrying heroin 
another underground faction called the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine has claimed steens abduction but western 
and lebanese intelligence services say the two groups are linked 
operating under the umbrella of hezbollah or party of god irans 
main proxy force in lebanon 
the italian police and reporters who saw the pictures found with 
ms rizkallah have said andersons picture appeared to be a 
reproduction of an old one released by the kidnappers in 1987 that 
of steen apparently was taken off a video tape his captors had 
released of him 
todays statement by islamic jihad said her photo of anderson was 
a reverse print of a one they released on aug 2 1987 the 
group has issued 13 photographs of anderson since his abduction 
march 16 1985 he is the longestheld of the 14 foreign hostages in 
lebanon 
the statement was 22 lines long it was typewritten in arabic to 
prove its theory of the reproduced photograph the envelope 
contained an original copy of the old photograph of anderson and a 
photocopy of a reproduction the reproduction looked identical to 
what was found with ms rizkallah 
anderson wearing a bushy beard appeared in the original 
photograph looking straight into the camera with the head slightly 
inclined to the right in the reproduction the head appeared 
inclined to the left 
the italian government is held responsible for publishing all 
the details about this case it is also accused of complicity with 
the socalled aline rizkallah in coordination with the israeli and 
american intelligence services until proven otherwise the 
statement said 
we renew our warning to all local and foreign news agencies 
against manipulating and trading with the photographs and documents 
which we attach to our statements and which we hope they will be 
published in full in line with journalistic honesty the statement 
added 
anderson of lorain ohio is chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press sutherland 57 a native of fort collins 
col is acting dean of agriculture at the american university of 
beirut 
in its statement on monday islamic jihad denied links with ms

a playboy magazine photographer will not 
be allowed to screen providence college students for a women of 
the big east pictorial at either the roman catholic college or a 
providence hotel officials said 
photographer david mecey had planned to meet with providence 
college students for part of a big east athletic conference layout 
scheduled for the april 1989 issue playboy spokeswoman cindy 
rakowitz said from new york 
mecey who planned to stay in providence from wednesday through 
friday intended to interview and photograph women in various 
locations including the providence marriott inn where he had a 
reservation the planned feature would include nude and seminude 
photos 
the hotels name and number were listed on a playboy leaflet and 
in a quarterpage advertisement to appear in todays edition of the 
newpaper said anne trumbore an employee at the weekly alternative 
newspaper 
but stephen mccarthy the hotels resident manager said that 
when officials realized wednesday morning who mecey was they 
decided not to allow him to conduct business at the hotel mecey was 
told by hotel officials when he arrived wednesday night that he 
could not conduct interviews on hotel property 
if he wants to stay here he can he has rented a room and we 
are in the business of renting rooms said general manager rene 
neidhart but he did not have our authorization to use our name in 
any advertisements and he cannot interview or photograph in the 
hotel 
im not entirely taken aback but i think thats pretty 
drastic said rakowitz when informed of the marriotts decision 
thats sort of eliminating the rights of the individual to make a 
freedom of choice but a hotel is private property 
playboy also was banned from interviewing or staying at the 
sheraton tara in braintree mass when it interviews boston college 
students in midnovember said jeff cohen playboys managing photo 
editor 
some people who arrived at the marriott looking for mecey were 
escorted off hotel property by security guards said mccarthy he 
said several people both women and men were removed from the lobby 
and floors 
playboy had decided against seeking the cooperation of 
administrators at any of the schools it will visit deciding instead 
to advertise offcampus and in college newspapers 
playboy had hoped to run an ad in the cowl the student newspaper 
at the 3800student college but students and administrators 
decided against it said a school spokesman the rev john mcgreevy 
officials at st johns university in new york another catholic 
school decided earlier this month against running an article about 
the playboy feature in its student newspaper 
im still confident that we will recruit our women said 
rakowitz who said about 20 women were wanted for the feature 
ive never come into a problem at a hotel i think its sort of 
repressing 
other schools in the big east conference are villanova 
university in villanova pa washingtons georgetown university 
seton hall university in south orange nj the university of 
connecticut the university of pittsburgh and new yorks syracuse

heeding arguments by attorney general dick 
thornburgh president reagan is vetoing a whistleblower bill to 
protect government workers who report wrongdoing 
the justice department contends the measure approved by congress 
without a single dissenting vote has constitutional problems and 
would interfere with legitimate discipline of employees justice 
department spokesman loye miller said today 
the president said wednesday he will exercise his pocket veto 
power of killing a bill by refusing to sign it while congress is not 
in session 
it had passed the house by 4180 and the senate by a unanimous 
voice vote 
the measure would have given major new protections to federal 
workers who expose fraud and mismanagement reagan said it would 
have allowed employees who are not genuine whistleblowers to 
manipulate the process to delay or avoid proper discipline 
i regret that the congress did not present me with 
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections 
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report 
fraud waste and abuse they discover in federal programs reagans 
memorandum said 
the interests of both employees and managers should be fully 
protected the president said he pledged to submit his own bill 
in january when congress returns 
the justice department under both thornburgh and his predecessor 
edwin meese iii has consistently opposed the bill said miller 
thornburghs spokesman 
miller said thornburgh presented the departments case at a white 
house meeting wednesday 
thornburgh in a statement released by his office said that 
while the bill contains some worthwhile elements some of which we 
would urge be introduced next session it also contained elements 
which would violate provisions of our constitution 
the bill would have resulted in the executive branch filing 
suit in federal court against itself this it cannot do just as no 
person can file suit against himself said thornburgh 
rep frank horton rny a member of the house government 
operations said he was surprised by the veto because he had only 
agreed to bring the bill to a floor vote after the white house had 
given its approval but the administration reneged on what was 
agreed to horton told the washington post 
sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the 
office of special counsel established to represent the interests of 
whistleblowers was not doing its job 
the bill was designed to reverse decisions of courts and the 
merit systems protection board a federal judicial agency that made 
it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases 
the bill would have made the office of special counsel an 
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of 
protecting whistleblowers the office now is part of the merit 
systems protection board and at times it has acted against 
whistleblowers who came to the office for help 
reagan said he opposed provisions in the bill that would have 
altered the burden of proof in whistleblower cases the measure 
would have required an employee to show only that the agencys 
knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her 
punishment rather than a significant or dominant factor as 
required under current law 
agencies also would have had to show by clear and convincing 
evidence that the same disciplinary decision would have occurred 
in the absence of any whistleblowing 
the change essentially rigs the boards process against agency 
personnel managers in favor of employees the president said 
reagan also said the bill would have caused constitutional 
problems because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to 
go to court against each other the president has the power to 
resolve disputes between his subordinates he said 
however tom devine legal director of the government 
accountability project nonprofit group said the veto is 
equivalent to endorsing continued reprisals against whistleblowers 
who challenge bureaucratic abuses this issue isnt going to go 
away well be back next year arguing for a stronger 
whistleblower protection law and well win 
devine whose group provides aid to whistleblowers said there 
was precedent for federal agencies to challenge executive branch 
decisions he said the bill would have imposed whistleblower 
standards that now are in use in private industry 
those same legal burdens havent interfered with private 
industrys ability to fire incompetent workers devine said

democrat presidential nominee michael 
dukakis declared today that this election is up for grabs and 
ridiculed republican rival george bushs assertion that his proposal 
for cutting the capital gains tax would create new jobs 
whos he kidding dukakis asked supporters in this chicago 
suburb what are they going to do with the extra money hire a 
second butler a lifeguard for the pool 
the massachusetts governor said bushs plan to reduce the top 
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent was not a jobs 
program but a huge tax break for the vice president and his wealthy 
friends bush says it would spur business investment and generate 
new jobs 
its halloween come early dukakis said a treat for the 
wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us 
one day after the gop nominee touted his tax plan before detroit 
business leaders dukakis said bush really was proposing to give 
the the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off for 
the rest of us 
he also rebuked bushs vice presidential running mate sen dan 
quayle of indiana for opposing legislation that would require 
employers to give workers 60 days notice of mass layoffs or plant 
closings 
the democratic nominee struggling to reverse his slide in the 
polls in the nations industrial heartland cloaked himself in the 
memory of harry trumans upset victory over republican thomas e 
dewey in 1948 
harry truman was a fighter and so am i dukakis said my 
friends this election is up for grabs 
from evergreen park he headed for rockford in northern illinois 
and was ending the day with a town meeting in independence mo 
trumans birthplace dukakis also was appearing on the cbs evening 
news tonight 
at a town meeting monday night in the chicago suburb of 
naperaville dukakis delivered a broad swipe monday at what he 
called bushs nasty campaigning and distortions of his positions on 
defense the environment crime and gun controls the session was 
broadcast nationally on the cspan cable tv network 
this is not a campaign about furloughs and flag factories 
dukakis said at a high school in this chicago suburb this is a 
campaign about the future of america and especially about young 
people 
he also sought to lay claim to the high ground in the campaign a 
position dukakis hopes will sway undecided and soft bush supporters 
in the 12 days before the election 
i dont think politics ought to be an enterprise in which all 
we do is cut the other guy up dukakis said obviously mr bush 
disagrees i think its a disservice to the american people 
the latest statewide survey in missouri showed bushs late august 
ninepoint lead cut to one as the vice president led dukakis 4443 
percent according to todays editions of the kansas city times 
the survey of 550 likely voters conducted sunday and monday had 
a margin of error of plus or minus four points 
dukakis has blamed his slide in national polls on a litany of 
unfounded gop allegations left unanswered but his audience in 
naperville and three other cities asked questions that allowed 
dukakis to respond to the salvos in addition to the cspan 
broadcast the session was shown simultaneously at meetings in 
rochester ny johnstown pa and green bay wis 
at the naperville forum dukakis said a bush ad showing dukakis 
riding in an army tank misrepresented his position on several 
weapons systems and also accused the vice president of proving he 
lacked leaderhip credentials by failing to outline weapons systems 
he would select at a time when both candidates project stable 
defense spending 
mr bush has never met a weapons system he didnt like 
dukakis said 
in an interview with the washington post published in todays 
editions dukakis conceded that he may have erred at the democratic 
national convention when he said this campaign is not about 
ideology its about competence 
the democratic nominee said that he might have used his first 
speech to a national audience to lay out values and philosophy 
fundamental differences between me and george bush 
should the speech in atlanta have been more explicit more of a 
statement of philosophy positions he said perhaps 
at a rowdy noontime rally wednesday in pueblo colo dukakis 
also accused the national rifle association of distoring his 
position on gun control 
dukakis said he supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to 
own guns and for homeowners to purchase guns to protect their homes 
he then chided bush for not taking a position on legislation to 
provide a sevenday waiting period to allow police to conduct 
background checks before approving gun sales

the jury is deliberating in the 
manslaughter trial of a faithhealing church deacon branded by a 
prosecutor as a fanatic for failing to seek medical treatment 
before his 10yearold diabetic son died 
bobby da norman 43 is charged with firstdegree manslaughter 
for failing to get treatment for his son aaron who died dec 20 of 
untreated juvenile diabetes a similar charge against his wife 
judith was dropped before the case went to trial 
the normans were members of a nameless christian sect that 
rejected conventional medicine demanded strict discipline of 
children and adults and viewed its leaders as prophets 
jurors got the case late wednesday and deliberated about 3 hours 
before being sent home for the night they were to resume their work 
later today 
in closing arguments wednesday deputy spokane county prosecutor 
clark colwell said norman a deacon in the sect got wrapped up in 
this just like the rest of them he became a fanatic just like the 
rest of them 
a parent has a duty to provide medical care for a dependent 
child and norman recklessly failed to meet that obligation colwell 
said 
defense lawyer roger peven argued that normans religious fervor 
blinded him to the danger his son faced 
peven said norman was steeped in fellowship teachings for seven 
years and was unable to break free of that doctrine in the four days 
his sons illness became apparent 
spanking the boy the day before he died ostensibly to get him to 
confess to some sin that sect leaders believed was making him ill 
exacerbated the juvenile diabetes that made him look like a 
concentration camp victim colwell said 
weve all experienced different kinds of discipline in our 
lives but this was outside the bounds of any reasonable case 
he said this was a sick child this was a child who was dying 
peven conceded that the boy died of diabetes that he would have 
lived if medical treatment had been sought and that norman failed to 
seek medical treatment 
sect leaders including founder doug kleber who helped spank 
aaron during a confrontive questioning session the day before he 
died exerted tremendous influence over members lives peven said 
kleber and former spokane pastor jeffrey siegel both 34 pleaded 
guilty earlier to seconddegree criminal mistreatment three other 
former elders of the fellowship which disbanded shortly after the 
boy died face trial on similar charges next year

an official of the french pharmaceutical company 
that suspended distribution of the abortion pill ru 486 said today 
the pill could become available again if public opposition to it 
subsides 
a communique issued by the company wednesday said distribution of 
the drug worldwide was stopped in response to an outcry of public 
opinion at home and abroad the story was frontpage news in 
french and us newspapers 
the companys decision to suspend distribution was hailed by two 
antiabortion groups in france but criticized by government 
michele andre the cabinet minister responsible for womens 
rights told a news conference the drug companys decision was a 
disagreable blow 
i think that all of a sudden this company gave in to pressure 
from a large number of people she said often questions 
involving morals and women bring about a backlash 
she indicated she would contact the ministry of health to see 
what could be done about getting other pharmaceutical companies to 
produce the drug 
pierre joly vice president of the pharmaceutical company that 
makes the pill rousseluclaf said today on french radio we 
could resume distribution of ru 486 if the atmosphere returns to 
normal 
joly denied reports the company halted distribution because it 
feared a threatened boycott of its other products 
a boycott could only be carried out by doctors who have to put 
the interests of their patients above everything else he said 
when the french government last month authorized use of the 
antihormone substance in registered abortion clinics joly said a 
controversy developed 
public opinion was unleashed we witnessed an orchestrated 
campaign that grew in strength he said referring to 
antiabortion groups in the united states france and west germany 
one french antiabortion group the committee to save infants to 
be born called for the destruction of all the stocks of this 
chemical weapon ru486 another the national circle of european 
women said the decision to halt distribution was a great victory 
for women and for families who mobilized to bring about suppression 
of the drug and everyday acceptance of abortion in favor of prolife 
measures 
the socialist party and communist parties protested the decision 
the socialists denounced the companys action as a new attack 
on the freedom of women to choose a new medical method the 
statement said the socialists who lead the present french 
government were astonished at the move announced one month after 
the ministry of health authorized the drug 
the marseille daily le provencal said in an editorial that when 
the pill was invented the world health organization welcomed it 
china was enthusiastic and the united states said it met all medical 
specifications 
it is true that the religious authorities and the righttolife 
groups were shocked by this progress the paper said but all 
the same are we going to be without a voice when confronted with 
these fundamentalist manifestations of faith against science and 
against the law 
the companys decision was hailed by cardinal albert decourtray 
head of the french roman catholic conference of bishops 
at the ministry of health which authorized prescription of the 
drug sept 23 subject to strict medical supervision an official 
said the decision makes one wonder about whos in charge at 
rousseluclaf 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
regretted that the company decided to stop distribution after all 
the research medical trials and other steps necessary to get the 
pill to the market 
he said he was surprised by the reasons the company gave because 
in france anyway the protests were pretty weak and did not lead 
to either catastrophe or strong feelings the company acted to 
preserve its image abroad 
the official said the government could not reverse the decision 
because it was a minority shareholder in the parisbased company 
the majority shareholder is the west german chemical group hoechst 
the pill also known as mifepristone is an antihormone that 
acts by blocking the action of progesterone a hormone essential in 
all phases of pregnancy researchers say it is highly effective in 
the first seven weeks of pregnancy particularly when used in 
conjunction with a second product called sulprotone or 
prostaglandine e 
the new drug is not a doityourself morning after pill that can 
be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home 
it must be used under medical supervision

sen dan quayle said today that democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis has tried to keep his ideology 
from the american people in a cynical political move 
quayle addressing a breakfast of several hundred supporters at 
the grove park inn resort said the republicans are the party of 
the future were the ones that are out there talking about 
ideas 
recalling dukakis statement at the democratic convention that 
the election is about competence rather than ideas quayle said i 
can tell you ideology is important ideas are important and to 
think you can fool the american people by not talking about ideology 
was a cynical political move that will not work 
keeping up the republican strategy of portraying the 
massachusetts governor as a liberal who is out of step with 
mainstream america quayle said liberalism is a philosophy of the 
past it is a philosophy that failed 
on another subject quayle said to reporters in asheville that 
homelessness in america is not due to a lack of lowincome housing 
i would guess that theres adequate lowincome housing in the 
country today but that doesnt mean that is the only answer or the 
solution to the problem thats one of them and if we can find out 
it is not adequate lowincome housing well have to see what we can 
do about it quayle said 
its a problem that were going to have to identify first who 
are the homeless what are their needs are they on the streets 
because they dont have adequate housing 
he added i bet you will find maybe in some cases that there is 
some housing are there some volunteer shelters that can be used 
later quayle was heading to charlotte nc for a rally at the 
university of north carolina and then traveling to campaign stops 
in new jersey and new york 
a day earlier in fort lauderdale fla quayle noted the recent 
frequent television appearances by dukakis and democratic running 
mate lloyd bentsen 
actually i think its their swan song he said talking to 
reporters as he left a fundraising event a nice way for michael 
dukakis to say goodbye to america 
i think sen bentsen has a different agenda hes been very 
good at pumping himself up he hasnt been too good at pumping up 
michael dukakis as a matter of fact he talks more about himself 
than he does the top of the ticket i dont blame him 
quayle made the comments as a new cbsnew york times poll showed 
bush with a 13point lead over dukakis a los angeles times poll 
gave bush an 11point lead in the critical state of california 
in florida quayle also stumped in miamis little havana district 
on wednesday and he was enthusiastically received at a rally of 
about 400 cubanamericans 
he told them that being in the cuban community i have been 
able to feel the spirit of america 
he said he and bush will invest in our people quality 
education job opportunity family neighborhood and yes a thing 
we call america a thing we call america because this country is 
still the beacon of hope for millions around the world 
earlier at miami high school which quayle aide jim ciccone said 
has a high dropout rate and a 90percent hispanic student body 
quayle promised that a bush administration would make sure anyone 
who wants to has the opportunity to go to college 
answering a question on immigration quayle told the students 
the united states of america will always have an open door policy 
we all are from somewhere he told them his own ancestors were 
from the isle of man 
in his home state of indiana the state supreme court rejected on 
wednesday two requests to open his application to the bar 
a wisconsin attorney and the indianapolis news had made separate 
requests for the application under the indiana public records law 
the application contains several questions asking whether the 
applicant has been dishonest or had academic difficulties 
supreme court administrator karl mulvaney said the court cited a 
provision allowing exemption of records declared confidential by 
or under rules adopted by the supreme court of indiana

soviet officials said today they will start 
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the 
nations economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach 58 
billion next year 
a number of enterprises are on the brink of being eliminated 
finance minister boris gostev told the 1500 deputies of the supreme 
soviet legislature they gathered today at the grand kremlin palace 
in moscow for a twoday session on a 1989 development plan and 804 
billion government budget 
gostev who presented the deficit budget to the lawmakers 
admitted the government of mikhail s gorbachev is finding it 
difficult to bring deficit spending under control the overspending 
began in previous soviet regimes 
he said the deficit is a problem that has not emerged just now 
but is a result of the unbalanced economy of the policy of 
extensive subsidizing and huge losses of all that was brought 
about by extensive methods of economic management parasitic 
attitudes and a passive financial policy 
the economic report presented to the deputies painted a gloomy 
picture of soviet life with cramped housing food rotting en route 
to stores jammed trains during vacation periods and massive 
amounts of new equipment lying unused on factory floors 
however the 1989 plan promised dramatic improvements in what 
yuri maslyukov head the state planning committee acknowledged was 
a response to criticism in the press and legislature 
he said central planning will be slashed by restraining what 
ministries can do this year the state bought and redistributed 86 
percent of production but it will buy just 25 percent next year 
everything else must be sold on a new open market according to 
consumer demand 
the state will cease to be the sole distributor of resources 
maslyukov said 
in another bow to public pressure he listed several development 
plans dropped due to environmental concerns including twothirds of 
50 planned water projects 
gostev promised that pensions and payments to lowincome families 
will rise and that planned price reform will not lower the standard 
of living 
the new emphasis under gorbachev on consumer goods and the 
standard of living mark a major turnaround in communist policy 
as the deputies convened for the parliaments regular fall 
session one seat on the leadership dais was vacant politburo 
member yegor k ligachev who is believed to be the major 
conservative force was separated by the empty chair from gorbachev 
and prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov 
the arrangement of seats could symbolize a diminished role for 
ligachev who was moved from communist party ideology chief to 
agriculture minister earlier this month 
gostev in presenting the state budget for next year said the 
deficit would be 58 billion or 7 percent of the total budget the 
official tass news agency said 
the united states budget carries a deficit of about 100 billion 
the 1989 draft budget which is customarily approved by the 
supreme soviet in a unanimous vote also allocates 328 billion to 
the countrys armed forces the same amount as in 1988 gostev said 
however western experts say the soviet military budget is many 
times that figure because the armed forces also receive money 
allocated for science industry and other purposes the cia 
estimates that the soviet military budget is actually 15 percent of 
the nations total economy

the government will give to its academy of sciences 
a radar station that the united states contends is in violation of 
the antiballistic missile treaty a soviet spokesman said today 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman also 
said the government has offered to eliminate radar at two other 
sites both of which have been challenged by the united states 
however gerasimov said the moves do not constitute an admission 
the radar equipment violates the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the pact bars the two superpowers from developing new defenses 
against missiles 
the united states has rejected anything short of dismantling the 
giant radar station at krasnoyarsk which gerasimov said will 
instead be given to the academy of sciences washington says such 
facilities must be located on the periphery of the soviet union not 
in the interior 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev previously offered to turn 
over it over to a civilian agency gerasimov said it will be turned 
into an international center for the study of space as promised 
he also said today the kremlin was acting on us complaints 
about two other radar sites 
we meant to use those elements for economic purposes which is 
not against the clauses of the abm treaty he said at todays 
briefing for soviet and foreign reporters 
being guided by the interests of preservation and strengthening 
the abm treaty we are prepared to make another constructive step in 
that regard that is to eliminate the radar elements of flat twin 
and pawn shop in the regions of gomel and moscow he said 
a us state department report in december 1987 charged the 
locations of flat twin and pawn shop fall outside a permitted 
deployment area or test range under the treaty asked later what he 
meant by the offer to eliminate the radar components gerasimov 
said eliminate them physically 
the spokesman repeated a call on the united states to take 
similar measures with two radar sites the soviets contend violate 
the treaty one in greenland and one under construction in britain

the governing national party 
and its farright rivals claimed success today in white municipal 
elections but archbishop desmond tutu said a boycott of separate 
black voting succeeded 
only a tiny fraction of the countrys 26 million blacks voted in 
wednesdays segregated elections which the white government 
described as the most significant extension of democracy in south 
african history an estimated one third of 15 million registered 
blacks came to the polls 
manipulate statistics whichever way you like said tutu who 
advocated an election boycott the reality remains that black 
south africans reject apartheid and government attempts to give it a 
coat of new paint said the winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the predominant blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate muncipal councils schools and health services 
the farright conservative party campaigning for stricter 
enforcement of apartheid laws had predicted victory in pretoria 
the countrys administrative capital it narrowly missed its goal 
winning 19 council seats to 22 for the nationalists 
it also fell short of its targets in the orange free state the 
most rural of four provinces 
but the conservatives swept to power in farming and industrial 
towns of transvaal the most populous province where they won at 
least 67 of 105 municipalities 
the nationalists for the first time gained outright control in 
johannesburg the nations largest city but the conservatives also 
won seats on the council for the first time 
both the conservatives and nationalists said the results boded 
well for their prospects in a general election expected by early 
1990 
these were the first nationwide municipal elections contested by 
the conservative party which was established in 1980 by 
disenchanted nationalists 
the elections also were the first in which south africans of all 
races voted on the same day a total of 7229 seats were contested 
most of them in white communities of the 1839 seats available on 
black councils only 905 had more than one candidate 
the white government declared itself satisfied with black turnout 
and said some of the elected blacks might be asked to negotiate on 
national issues blacks normally have no say at the national level 
a significant percentage of blacks voted for peaceful 
evolutionary change said constitutional development minister 
chris heunis 
staterun radio south africa estimated the black voter turnout at 
about onethird nationwide that would mean over 400000 blacks cast 
votes compared to just under 300000 in the last black municipal 
elections in 1983 
however the population increased about 15 percent since then 
indicating only a minimal increase in black voter turnout 
the black tournout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small 
rural towns but it was 115 percent in soweto the largest black 
community 
in many townships there were no candidates or the number of 
blacks eligible to vote was so low that the voting represented only 
a fraction of the population in soweto the votes cast represented 
28 percent of adult residents 
i see they the government are claiming today that hundreds of 
thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid 
mandate tutu said at todays news conference how can there be 
a solid mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even 
contested for the lack of interest how does a 10 or 12 percentage 
poll in soweto constitute a solid mandate 
governmentrun television said 25 percent of black registered 
voters in cape province cast ballots 33 percent in transvaal 46 
percent in the orange free state and 29 percent in natal 
antiapartheid activists including many prominent clergymen 
said voting for separate local authorities represents an 
entrenchment of the system of racial segregation 
in the white elections antiapartheid candidates kept control of 
durban

two men were convicted thursday of 
hijacking a jetliner with 118 people aboard from china to taiwan in 
may and they were sentenced to 3 years in prison 
chang chingkuo said he and fellow hijacker lung kueiyun will 
appeal their conviction to the taiwan high court because 
anticommunist defectors should not be guilty 
chang 27 told the court he and lung 26 hijacked the boeing 
737 of chinas staterun civil aviation administration of china on 
may 12 to defect to taiwan stronghold of the rival nationalist 
chinese government he said they had not intended to harm the 
passengers 
the hijackers appeared surprised at the sentence because 
prosecutors had urged leniency for the freedomseekers they 
could have been sentenced to death 
they used a toy gun and fake explosives to force the pilot to fly 
to an air base in taiwan shortly after the jetliner took off on a 
domestic flight from xiamen across the taiwan strait to canton in 
southern china 
the nationalist chinese government granted them political asylum 
and allowed the plane and its other passengers to return to china 
five hours later

the fall of a 16ton steel sculpture that pinned 
two art gallery workers to the floor crushing one mans leg was 
the second accident involving one of artist richard serras massive 
and sometimes controversial works 
the accident wednesday at the leo castelli gallery in soho 
occurred as the workers were removing the piece reading cones 
after an exhibition a set of heavyduty jacks collapsed and dropped 
the artwork in the firstfloor gallery said fire department 
spokesman efrain parrilla 
in the early 1970s a worker in minneapolis was killed when part 
of a serra sculpture collapsed 
at the castelli gallery the sculpture knocked down two of nine 
castiron structural support columns in the fivestory loft 
building the building was evacuated for the remainder of the day 
while city inspectors assessed the damage 
police officers were able to free one of the workers daniel 
hafner almost immediately but joseph gallo 30 was pinned for 
three to six minutes police said 
surgeons were unable to save gallos right leg which was 
amputated below the knee according to a bellevue hospital 
administrator john clark who said gallo was admitted in serious 
but stable condition 
hafner in his 30s was taken to beekmandowntown hospital 
complaining of shoulder and leg injuries and was treated and 
released said a hospital spokeswoman maureen flatley 
a spokeswoman for the gallery susan brundage said the sculpture 
was being placed in storage following a show 
the curved piece of steel is 3 inches thick 14 feet high 17 
feet long and weighs 32000 pounds she said 
it was one of two identical pieces by serra at the gallery she 
said the two combined are priced at 200000 
another serra sculpture tilted arc has been the center of 
controversy at a federal building in lower manhattan 
critics including more than 1000 government employees who 
signed a petition want it moved they say the 12foothigh 
112footlong rusting curve of metal obstructs views sunlight and 
traffic flow 
in the early 1970s a worker was killed while helping install a 
twopiece serra sculpture at the walker art center in minneapolis 
one of the sculptures steel plates fell over 
in a subsequent lawsuit the jury found that the fault was with 
the steel fabricator for poor technique in making the piece and 
with the rigger for failing to follow instructions 
serra and the art center were absolved of any blame

naacp executive director benjamin hooks 
today ordered the head of the columbus chapter to retract an 
endorsement of republican presidential candidate george bush or face 
immediate suspension 
columbus chapter president melanie mitchell said in a statement 
wednesday that the national association for the advancement of 
colored people does not give political endorsements but we 
must offer support to those persons who hold political offices or 
are seeking such offices whose ideals activities practices or 
policies are in the best interest of minorities 
in a news release issued from naacp headquarters in baltimore 
today hooks said ms mitchell has been directed to issue a public 
statement repudiating in its entirety this position immediately 
failure to do so will result in your immediate suspension 
she was given until the end of the day to comply 
ms mitchell was not available for comment today but chapter 
vice president cornell mccleary said wednesday night that the 
decision to support bush was made because the overwhelming black 
allegiance to the democratic party has been totally 
counterproductive 
bush believes in affirmative action he always has believed in 
it he has sent a signal that there is a place for blacks in the 
republican party mccleary said 
bushs ohio campaign chairman keith mcnamara said today the 
campaign is delighted to have won this endorsement it shows what 
we have been saying all along that bush has a good track record with 
blacks and that he will win a larger portion of the black vote this 
fall than even president reagan did 
danette palmore deputy manager of michael dukakis democratic 
presidential campaign in ohio said the naacps support of bush 
threatens the groups nonprofit status 
i think theyre skating on thin ice ms palmore said

michael dukakis renewed his attack today on george bushs plan to 
reduce capital gains taxes suggesting it would merely help the rich 
hire a second butler bush accepted the endorsement of a 
maritime union and praised us and soviet teams that worked to free 
two icetrapped whales 
campaigning less than two weeks before election day and four 
days before halloween dukakis said today in evergreen ill that 
bushs tax plan was like halloween come early a treat for the 
wealthiest one percent and a trick for the rest of us 
the plan dukakis said would give the people at the top the 
money and hope the crumbs fall off for the rest of us 
bush has proposed reducing the top tax rate from 33 percent to 15 
percent for capital gains such as profits from sales of stocks 
bonds or real estate the republican presidential nominee has 
defended his plan as a potential boon to the us economy 
contending people benefiting from the tax reduction would then 
increase their investing 
whos he kidding dukakis asked supporters in evergreen park 
a suburb of chicago what are they going to do with the extra 
money hire a second butler a lifeguard for the pool 
bush spaking at a rally in tacoma wash said today this 
election is all about creating jobs and opportunity and he said 
his administration would be committed to keeping the economic 
expansion going 
bush received the endorsement of the 50000member national 
marine engineers beneficial association at a rally where four 
protesters were pulled from the hall and more than a hundred 
demonstrators paraded outside 
campaigning on the west coast where environmental issues are 
always important bush expressed gratitude to american and soviet 
teams who worked to free the two whales trapped by ice off the coast 
of alaska 
every once in a while something comes along that captivates the 
american spirit transcends politics captivates the attention of 
the world as a matter of fact and emphasizes the goodness of the 
human race he said 
the fact that despite all of our problems we can still reach 
out and help it really did move me bush said 
dukakis trailing in national public opinion polls referred in 
his remarks to democratic president harry trumans 1948 comeback 
victory he was campaigning late in the day in trumans home state 
of missouri where a statewide poll indicated that bushs late 
august lead of nine points had dropped to one 
harry truman was a fighter and so am i dukakis said my 
friends this election is up for grabs 
president reagan meanwhile was out seeking votes for his vice 
president in remarks prepared for a rally in little rock ark he 
noted that the democrats have complained about negative gop 
campaigning and he said on nov 8 go into that polling booth 
and do some negative campaigning of your own the right kind of 
negative campaigning say no to new taxes and yes to the 
republican ticket 
wednesday night dukakis used a nationally broadcast town meeting 
in naperville ill to dispute gop allegations that he is soft on 
crime weak on defense favors gun control and ignores environmental 
problems 
the vice president campaigning in detroit sioux falls sd 
and billings mont told voters wednesday that the democrats 
version of prosperity is higher interest rates similar to the 215 
percent rate near the end of the carter administration 
we dont need that kind of democratic prosperity bush said 
we need the kind that ronald reagan has brought to this country 
the latest national poll by abc newswashington post showed bush 
holding an eightpoint lead over dukakis a somewhat smaller 
advantage than the doubledigit margin the gop nominee had in two 
polls earlier this week 
the survey of 1242 likely voters put the contest at 5244 
percent closer than the 13point gap in a cbs newsnew york times 
poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a gallup poll released 
tuesday 
the abcpost poll was conducted during the seven days ending 
tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage 
points 
in hopes of turning the tide dukakis was continuing his series 
of television appearances with an interview tonight on the cbs 
evening news 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen who 
appeared on the program wednesday night said the republicans had 
run a miserable campaign of distortions which dukakis did not 
address until after it hurt the ticket 
they started immediately after that democratic convention and 
frankly i thought they should have been answered then bentsen 
said but my friend mike dukakis was incredulous he just didnt 
believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick 
but they have and they have hurt and thats one of the reasons 
were in the kind of a race were in now 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle campaigning in 
florida dismissed the television appearances by the democratic 
ticket 
actually i think its their swan song he said a nice way 
for michael dukakis to say goodbye to america

americans personal incomes rose a moderate 05 
percent in september while consumer spending turned in its weakest 
performance in almost a year the government said thursday in 
reports that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing 
the commerce department said personal consumption spending which 
accounts for twothirds of overall economic activity was unchanged 
in september following a 06 percent august rise 
it was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 02 
percent drop in october 1987 that decline had been blamed in part 
on consumer anxiety from the record stock market plunge 
when the rise in prices is taken into account consumer spending 
actually fell 05 percent last month the department reported the 
05 percent rise in incomes was also completely erased by rising 
inflation it said 
analysts said the weakness in consumer spending and the modest 
income advance in september showed that the economy is likely to 
slow in coming months 
consumers are being more tightfisted because their incomes are 
going nowhere said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill 
lynch brokerage they already have so much debt that they are 
unwilling to borrow any more 
steinberg predicted that consumer spending which has been the 
driving force behind the current economic expansion would show only 
modest gains over the coming year and that this would contribute to 
an expected overall economic slowdown 
the government reported wednesday that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product rose at an annual rate of 
just 22 percent from july through september it was the slowest 
pace in almost two years and followed gnp growth of 32 percent in 
the first half of 1988 
many economists believe this slowdown will continue over the next 
year with the biggest question being whether growth will become so 
weak that it could topple the country into a recession 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group said she 
believed consumer spending while slowing would remain strong 
enough to support economic growth of about 25 percent 
consumer confidence remains reasonably strong they are 
spending at a rate equal to their income growth it is just that 
income growth has been weak she said 
income rose 199 billion in september to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 41 trillion before taking inflation into account 
the commerce department said that 05 percent rise followed gains 
of 03 percent in august and 07 percent in july 
personal income was held back by a 65 billion decrease in farm 
income as the widespread summer drought cut output farm subsidy 
payments were unchanged 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income were up 
at an annual rate of 141 billion in september that 06 percent 
increase followed a lackluster 02 percent august gain 
the weakness in personal consumption spending which was stuck at 
an annual rate of 326 trillion reflected a 31 billion drop in 
purchases of durable goods such as autos and appliances 
purchases of services rose 34 billion less than onethird of 
the increase in august analysts said the services category which 
includes housing costs had been inflated in previous months by 
higher electricity bills because of the summer heat wave 
purchases of nondurable goods items not expected to last three 
years showed a small increase of 400 million 
disposable or aftertax incomes rose by 05 percent in 
september following a 03 percent august increase personal tax 
payments in september one of four payment months for taxpayers 
filing quarterly returns were up 36 billion after an increase of 
2 billion in august 
with spending showing no growth while incomes were rising the 
savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable income climbed 
to 42 percent last month the highest level since may the savings 
rate was 38 percent in august 
in another economic report the labor department said the price 
of imported goods fell by 11 percent from july through september 
the first such decline in more than two years 
the price decrease reflected a drop in crude oil prices and the 
fact that the dollar strengthened somewhat against foreign 
currencies during the summer a stronger dollar lowers the cost of 
imported goods to americans however economists say the dollar will 
need to fall still further for the united states to make more 
progress in reducing its huge trade deficit 
the price of us exports which have been booming this year 
rose by 2 percent in the third quarter and are now 87 percent 
higher than they were a year ago

all major factions ranging 
from black activists to hardline white segregationists claimed 
success thursday after the countrys largest and most divisive 
municipal elections 
president pw bothas national party although beaten by the 
farright conservative party in dozens of white towns triumphed in 
several major battlegrounds and claimed that a 33 percent turnout in 
contested black wards was a rebuff to activists who had urged a 
boycott 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu one of the leading boycott 
proponents said the governments claims were quite hilarious 
and noted that only a small fraction of blacks were eligible to 
vote he and other antiapartheid leaders urged the government to 
ignore white extremists and negotiate to give blacks full voting 
rights in national affairs 
manipulate statistics whichever way you like said tutu 
the reality remains that black south africans reject apartheid and 
government attempts to give it a coat of new paint 
the conservative party campaigning for stricter enforcement of 
apartheid laws fell short of some of its own bold predictions it 
narrowly missed taking power in pretoria the adminisrative capital 
where it won 19 council seats to 22 for the nationalists and it was 
beaten back in much of the range free state the most rural of the 
four provinces 
but the conservatives swept to power in farming towns and small 
cities of transvaal the most populous province winning at least 67 
municipalities to 30 for the national party 
the nationalists for the first time gained outright control in 
johannesburg the nations largest city and the conservatives won 
their first seats on the council 
both the conservatives and the nationalists said the overall 
results boded well for their prospects in a general election 
expected to held by early 1990 
andries treurnicht the conservative leader said his party now 
was in a stronger position to oppose government programs aimed at 
desegregating business districts and channeling more tax revenue to 
black areas 
however constitutional development minister chris heunis said 
the results would give greater momentum to the process of 
constitutional reform aimed at giving black moderates a limited 
role in central government 
the conservatives campaigned on many national issues over which 
local councils have no jurisidiciton such as residential 
segregation laws but municipal councils do have power to evict 
squatters and segregate public amenities 
through representation on regional councils city councils also 
can influence how much of their tax money goes to help develop 
nearby black townships 
these were the first municipal elections contested nationmwide by 
the conservative party which was established in 1980 by 
disenchanted nationalists who felt the government was conceding too 
much to blacks 
the elections also were the first in which south africans of all 
races voted on the same day there were 7229 seats at stake most 
of them in white communities of the 1839 seats available on black 
councils only 905 had more than one candidate 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp estimated the 
black voter turnout at about onethird of those eligible that would 
amount to more than 400000 black votes compared with about 283000 
in the last black local elections in 1983 when a 21 percent turnout 
was recorded 
the black turnout ranged as high as 80 percent in some small 
rural towns wednesday but was 115 percent in soweto the largest 
black community where about 28000 of an estimated 1 million adults 
cast ballots 
in many townships there were no candidates in others there 
were allegations that some blacks were coerced into voting andor 
induced by promises that were unable to be fulfilled 
i see they the government are claiming today that hundreds of 
thousands have voted and that the people elected have a solid 
mandate tutu said in a statement how can there be a solid 
mandate when half the seats for blacks were not even contested for 
the lack of interest how does a 10 or 12 percentage poll in soweto 
constitute a solid mandate 
antiapartheid activists including many prominent clergymen 
said voting for separate local authorities was an entrenchment of 
the system of racial segregation 
the government banned most major black antiapartheid groups in 
february and outlawed calls for a vote boycott 
in the white elections antiapartheid candidates kept control of 
durban although rightwingers opposed to intergation of beaches won 
three seats the liberal progressive federal party kept control of 
cape town the countrys legislative capital and won 18 of the 51 
wards in johannesburg

nearly 20 percent of children in the united 
states have no health insurance and youngsters in poor working 
families are less likely be covered than are children of the 
unemployed a research group reported thursday 
the employee benefit research institute in an analysis of data 
collected by the census bureau found that the higher rates of 
coverage for children of the unemployed occurred because it was 
easier for those families to qualify for medicaid 
despite greater rates of employer coverage poor children in 
worker families are about 38 percent more likely than children in 
poor nonworker families to be uninsured the institute said in 
its report uninsured in the united states 
it said that among children in poor singleparent families 
headed by a fulltime worker 531 percent had no health insurance 
either public or private among poor singleparent families headed 
by an unemployed adult 301 percent of children were not covered 
overall the report found that 88 percent of the 37 million 
americans who were uninsured in 1986 either were workers themselves 
or lived in families that included workers nearly 18 percent of the 
civilian population under age 65 reported no health insurance from 
any source 
deborah chollet the senior research associate who completed the 
study said that even among workers where family income was four 
times or more of the poverty level there were 52 million 
individuals without health insurance 
a surprising number of them have family incomes that are quite 
high and that at least you would expect they would both value and 
buy health insurance and they dont for some unknown reason she 
said 
ms chollet said some of these people may think they cant afford 
health insurance but havent thoroughly checked around for 
affordable coverage some may be uninsurable because of certain 
health problems and others may not be educated about the need for 
coverage 
ms chollet said both presidential candidates health insurance 
proposals still would leave millions of americans uninsured but 
that democrat michael dukakis plan would cover far more than 
georges bushs 
dukakis proposal to expand employerprovided health insurance 
could extend coverage to 23 million uninsured individuals at a cost 
of 22 billion to employers and 5 billion to workers she said 
bushs proposal still sketchy would allow more lowincome 
people to buy in to the medicaid program but his plan to spend 
400 million in the first year and 200 million thereafter is 
inadequate to bring in very many people ms chollet said 
the institute is a nonpartisan research organization

an auctioneer examining a collection of 
papers in preparation for an estate sale found the absolute dream 
of every autograph collector a letter written by george 
washington 
the onepage letter dated dec 10 1796 was addressed to a 
richard peters and concerned a suggestion peters had made about 
agricultural policy 
i havent slept a lot since saturday night phil riner said 
about his discovery made when he examined documents in the estate 
of an ailing lakeland resident whose hobby was collecting 
historical documents 
the family of the collector whom riner refused to identify had 
asked riner to inventory items for an estate sale 
some documents written by washington have recently brought as 
much as 19000 riner said wednesday they vary in value depending 
on their importance and when they were written washingtons 
autograph has brought 3000 he said 
the brief letter to peters referred to documents washington was 
enclosing with a suggestion that they might be of interest to 
congressional committees peters address was not listed and riner 
did not disclose the text of the letter 
i have not had a chance to do any research on it but i would 
assume it had something to do with congressional business riner 
said the letter was written about three months before washingtons 
second term ended 
riner who heads phil riner auctions jewelry and estate 
liquidators in nearby winter haven said the auction for the letter 
probably within 60 days would be widely advertised 
i will of course have it thoroughly authenticated 
beforehand he said

a minnesota law banning exit polls used to 
project election winners within 100 feet of a polling place 
violates free speech a lawyer for the three major television 
networks argued thursday 
the networks are seeking a court order blocking the law through 
the nov 8 election us district judge david s doty took the 
request under advisement and said he would rule before election day 
floyd abrams a new york attorney representing cbs abc and nbc 
told doty the 1984 law would prevent family members from asking each 
other how they voted if they were within the zoned area 
here is an amendment on its face which makes it illegal for 
my daughter to ask me how i voted he said 
peter ackerberg a special assistant state attorney general 
noted that the state has imposed other restrictions on activities 
near the polling place such as distributing political literature 
voters should not be required to run a gauntlet of 
questioners ackerberg said they should be allowed to walk away 
in peace from this sanctified place 
he added election day is not an event staged for the media 
exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear 
after polls closed in the east that ronald reagan would defeat 
president jimmy carter by a landslide many westerners were still 
voting when the networks declared reagan the winner 
the three major networks say this year they will project winners 
of the presidential race statebystate as polls close but will 
refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the 
west coast cast their ballots 
abrams said the networks have successfully fought similar exit 
polling restrictions in florida georgia kentucky montana 
washington and wyoming he said minnesota is the last state where 
such a law is being challenged 
abrams said the state has a legitimate interest in passing laws 
to alleviate congestion around polling places but this is a 
blunderbuss way of dealing with that problem he said 
the intent of the law he argued is to prevent the networks from 
conducting exit polls 
what they legislators were after is speech they didnt like 
and thats simply offlimits to them he said 
abrams said the law prevents anyone from approaching a voter 
within 50 feet of a polling place and prevents the voter from being 
asked how he or she voted within 50 feet to 100 feet of the polling 
place 
theres no evidence one could do exit polling that works at 
that distance he said

two marine corps helicopters probably 
collided before each crashed killing nine marines and one air force 
officer while on a desert training mission marine officials said 
today 
we feel confident enough to say a midair collision was more 
than likely said gunnery sgt hal wheeler a spokesman at the 
marine corps air station at yuma 
wheeler said the two helicopters that crashed tuesday night a 
boeing ch46 and a bell uh1n flew from the yuma base but neither 
were actually stationed there the ch46 was from the marine corps 
air station in new river nc and the uh1n was from camp 
pendleton calif he said 
wheeler also said that though spokesmen initially said four men 
were aboard the ch46 and six aboard the uh1n there was 
uncertainty about the actual distribution of the men between the two 
aircraft 
the crash site about 16 miles southeast of here on the goldwater 
air force range was in an area so rough that fourwheeldrive 
vehicles had trouble reaching it said 1st lt mary baldwin public 
affairs officer at the marine corps air station in yuma 
the last body was not recovered until late wednesday afternoon 
said baldwin 
the men were participating in the final training exercise of a 
weaponsandtactics instructors training course taught twice a year 
at the marine corps air station in yuma 125 miles southwest of the 
crash site 
the course is an advanced program in battle tactics including 
moving personnel from place to place rescuing wounded and 
countering enemy weapons and aircraft 
the crash was the second in the courses history in 1984 two 
marines were killed when their light observation plane crashed on 
the range 
the twinrotor ch46 sea knight which boeing stopped building in 
1971 is the marines main assault helicopter three marines were 
killed in may when a ch46 crashed during a test flight from kaneohe 
marine corps air station in hawaii 
a marine ch46 carrying 21 men crashed in 1986 killing eight 
during a nato exercise off norway in one of the worst crashes 
involving the helicopter 14 marines and a navy chaplain were killed 
in 1985 when a ch46 crashed into the atlantic off north carolina 
on monday a uh1h helicopter hit a power line and crashed near 
the usmexico border in california killing five lawmen and three 
national guardsmen during the first mission of a joint antidrug 
smuggling program 
the identify of one marine killed tuesday was being withheld 
pending notification of next of kin

graying veterans of harry trumans 1948 
presidential campaign celebrated anew the triumph the experts said 
was impossible but offered scant hope to democrats looking for a 
repeat in 1988 
they were wild about harry all over again at wednesday nights 
reunion at the national press club where they gathered to watch a 
public television documentary on the great upset of 48 
the show will air nationally tuesday night 
thomas e dewey the governor of new york was so confident of 
victory and so far ahead in the polls he didnt begin campaigning 
until sept 19 he skirted issues prompting reporters to speculate 
that his middle initial stood for elusive 
deweys confidence was such that he had been negotiating the 
purchase of a suit to be inaugurated in recalled author robert j 
donovan who covered the race for the new york herald tribune 
truman the onetime haberdasher from missouri had inherited the 
oval office when franklin d roosevelt died in 1945 but the 
democratic party was splintered with henry wallace running on 
trumans left and dixiecrat strom thurmond then governor of south 
carolina on his right 
the incumbents campaign got off to a hapless start with truman 
addressing a halfempty hall in omaha neb dedicating an airport 
in idaho to the wrong person and pronouncing josef stalin a decent 
fellow in oregon 
but truman also relentlessly pummeled the donothing 
republican congress vetoed the tafthartley bill to shore up labor 
support appealed to farmers and stood fast for civil rights 
truman picked up an endorsement from a movie actor named ronald 
reagan president of the screen actors guild who said in a radio ad 
he was more than a little impatient with those promises the 
republicans made before they got control of congress a couple of 
years ago 
so daunting was deweys lead that the roper organization did not 
bother to survey after early september 
the polls were completely wrong said eric sevareid then a 
cbs radio reporter who recalls the big crowds that turned out as 
trumans train the ferdinand magellan covered 31000 miles across 
america 
we began to think something is going on here but none of us 
had enough guts to go bet even at 91 said sevareid 
clark clifford trumans counsel recalled that if someone didnt 
spontaneously shout give em hell harry in the first minute of 
trumans speeches the campaign staff would dispatch someone to do 
the job 
it was called priming the pump said clifford 
after the severelooking dewey was ridiculed by tarttongued 
alice roosevelt longworth as the little man on the wedding cake 
campaign manager herbert brownell urged the new york governor to 
shave off his mustache 
but mrs dewey said no she thought that was trimming his sails 
for political purposes brownell told the documentarymakers 
newsweek magazine canvassed 50 top political writers and every 
one picked dewey truman laughed it off saying he knew all 50 and 
not one of them has enough sense to pound sand in a rat hole 
on election night nov 2 1948 legendary nbc radio announcer 
hv kaltenborn assured americans that despite an early lead for 
truman dewey would prevail when the outlying districts are 
reported 
when editors at the chicago tribune heard that broadcast they 
ordered the presses to roll with the headline dewey defeats 
truman and created a collectors item that truman held up in 
jubilation the next day after his 2 millionvote victory 
is there a lesson in all this for the 1988 race when most polls 
now point to a big lead for george bush over michael dukakis 
if truman were alive hed be giving hell to both candidates 
for waging one of the sorriest campaigns of this century said 
paul duke the narrator of the documentary and host of public 
televisions washington week in review 
donovan observed the trouble from dukakis point of view is 
that bush knows the dewey story too a lot of people have learned a 
big lesson from tom dewey george bush is one of them

proposed changes in the way medicare payments to 
physicians are calculated should be studied carefully before they 
are put into practice say editorials in the latest journal of the 
american medical association 
the recommendations made last month would sharply increase the 
amount of money physicians are paid for office visits and reduce 
fees for surgery and other procedures such as installing pacemakers 
the plan developed by economist william hsiao at the harvard 
university school of public health needs to be reviewed by the 
medical profession dr james todd wrote in an editorial appearing 
in fridays jama 
there must be external review and validation of the studys 
credibility reliability and validity todd wrote no less 
important will be the consideration of whether and how this academic 
research should be translated into the cold hard realities of 
medicare policy 
the proposal is certain to stir controversy among physicians 
and should be examined further dr philip lee chairman of the 
physician payment review commission and paul ginsburg the panels 
executive director wrote in a second editorial 
the washingtonbased organization was created by congress in 1986 
to advise it on reforms in medicares methods of paying physicians 
it commissioned the harvard study 
todd said the american medical association would work closely 
with specialty societies and state medical associations to 
evaluate the harvard proposal 
the plan places a nonmonetary value on tasks doctors perform 
for example a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a general 
practitioner is 248 while a wellbaby visit is 64 and a triple 
coronary bypass is 2871 
the value would be multiplied by a monetary conversion figure 
determined by congress for medicare or by insurance companies to 
figure out how much doctors should be paid 
under current medicare policies physicians are paid less for 
daytoday management of their patients than they are for exotic 
tests and other procedures the new proposal would not penalize 
doctors for spending time with patients 
todd said the values were based on averages and cannot 
recognize differences among physicians in patient mix quality or 
practice costs 
a properly working fee schedule will require the 
flexibility that comes with physicians ability to determine their 
own charges using the value scale as a foundation he wrote 
lee and ginsburg said the proposal should not be the only 
criteria in determining new fee schedules for doctors other 
components should include geographic multipliers that determine how 
payments would vary from one locality to another they wrote

students at a school for the deaf asked to 
be tested for the aids virus after learning that a former school 
worker had contracted the virus and that there may have been sexual 
activity between staff and students 
the mississippi school for the deaf will ask parents of students 
age 12 and over if they want the state health department to test 
their children for exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
superintendent alma alexander said wednesday that she had called 
a meeting of students after hearing that most had learned of a 
possible problem from news reports the day before 
some of them asked if they could be tested alexander said 
so i asked what their feeling was if i could have a show of hands 
on who would like to be tested and almost all of them raised their 
hands 
dr ed thompson state epidemiologist said the youths would be 
tested as soon as they have the parents permission for it 
results probably would come a few weeks later 
the state had received information earlier that a former employee 
had contracted the aids virus and that there had been sexual 
activity between staff members and students 
the first allegation was verified thompson said while there was 
no hard evidence of sexual misconduct he said there was sufficient 
evidence to warrant testing 
about half of the schools 160 students are 12 and older 
alexander said the former employee left the school in the summer 
she said she is confident the employee who resigned had not had 
sexual relations with anyone on campus

west germany has promised the united states 
that it will reject domestic pressures and prevent the sale of 
militarily sensitive technology to the soviet union us officials 
said thursday 
the assurances were made last week in bonn in advance of this 
weeks trip to moscow by chancellor helmut kohl and a group of 30 
businessmen who have signed deals estimated at over 1 billion said 
an official 
the west germans consulted with the united states about the deals 
they intended to sign and we could see they were being very 
careful said the official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
at the same time the united states has warned west germany and 
other allies in the coordinating committee for multilateral export 
controls or cocom against being lulled into a false sense of 
security by recent soviet reforms the official said cocom 
determines which technologies members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and japan can sell to the soviet bloc 
we have received assurances from west germany that it will 
observe established cocom procedures when it comes to carrying out 
the various commercial agreements reached by german firms in 
moscow said state department spokesman charles redman 
the west german assurances were given last week to ambassador 
allan wendt the state departments specialist on export controls 
who held talks in bonn paris rome and london as part of regularly 
scheduled consultations on cocom 
the parisbased organization has been seeking to streamline its 
complex list of banned technologies in response to the economic 
liberalization of several soviet bloc countries 
the next full round of consultations on the changes is not 
expected until next spring when the new us administration is in 
place 
we and our allies sometimes can and do differ on specifics or 
exactly what needs to be done to ensure that we have strong 
barriers around critical technologies redman said 
as allies we settle these differences on an ongoing basis 
within cocom he added 
but the other official said some people within cocom have 
been urging a wholesale lifting of controls on exports to the soviet 
bloc he declined to name names but indicated that west german 
officials were among those to whom he referred 
there are domestic political pressures in some countries to 
relax cocom restrictions this official said if you are living 
across the border from east germany for example the temptation to 
believe the soviet threat is over is great 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has been 
advocating greater trade with moscow as a way of stimulating the 
stagnant economy and creating jobs 
but wendt made it clear to the allies that the soviet threat 
has to change before cocom can relax its rules the official said

an appeals court has ordered a new 
trial for a girl sentenced to life at age 15 for the murder of her 
grandfather ruling that evidence should have been allowed 
undermining a confession she later recanted 
it noted for example that she had used drugs for 12 years 
the 4th district court of appeal on wednesday overturned the 1986 
murder conviction of cara mcintosh of pompano beach now 17 who is 
serving a life sentence with a mandatory minimum of 25 years 
when i called her at the prison she just cried she was so 
happy said her attorney keith krasnove shes been waiting for 
so long to hear some good news and i think she was starting to 
think wed lost 
cara her mother paulette and one of her mothers friends dean 
dameron were convicted of murder in the death of paulettes father 
emmett richardson his body was found in a canal may 30 1986 all 
three were sentenced to life in prison 
in a confession she later recanted cara told police that she was 
present during the crime and had held a sock to her grandfathers 
mouth while others tied and gagged him while stealing money for 
drugs from his business 
the jury believed the tape and didnt believe what she said on 
the stand said prosecuting attorney jack coyle 
the appellate ruling said the trial court should have allowed 
testimony about paulette mcintoshs psychological grip over her 
daughter and about caras drug addiction 
cara was introduced to marijuana at the age of 3 by her parents 
the news and sunsentinel reported thursday 
testimony regarding caras mothers control and domination 
over cara was a circumstance surrounding caras confession 
because her mother was being interrogated in a nearby police room 
and had told cara to go along with whatever she said the appeal 
court opinion said 
during caras interrogation the police told her that her 
mother had said certain things and that if she agreed with them she 
could go home 
the opinion also said she was coming down from a high at the 
time of the confession 
the state has two weeks to file a motion for a rehearing or it 
could proceed with a new trial

the united states is trying to encourage 
political liberalization in eastern europe by holding out the 
prospect of the eventual full integration of these countries into 
the western economic system 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead who returned recently 
from a visit to the six soviet allies in that region said the 
united states would be prepared to welcome these countries into 
the western world provided they continue on their reformist path 
in an interview wednesday whitehead outlined his impressions of 
his 11day trip which took him to poland hungary east germany 
czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania 
with the exception of romania whitehead said there is 
dramatic change going on in eastern europe resulting from public 
dissatisfaction with stagnant or declining economies he said poland 
and hungary are at the forefront of change romania is lagging 
behind and czechoslovakia bulgaria and east germany are somewhere 
in between 
whitehead said he expects the sovietled warsaw pact military 
alliance to remain in tact but added there is a strong desire for 
the departure of soviet troops in the four countries where they are 
stationed 
there are an estimated 380000 soviet troops in east germany 
80000 in czechoslovakia 65000 in hungary and 40000 in poland 
i think the countries are becoming more independent of the 
soviet union whitehead said they are beginning to return to 
their historical position where they were independent countries 
part of europe associated with the west economically politically 
and i believe they are beginning to return to historically their 
more normal position 
as the liberalization process continues whitehead said he 
envisions greater east european participation in the world bank and 
the international monetary fund two pillars of the western economic 
system 
he also foresees increased us government involvement in 
encouraging trade with and private investment in eastern europe 
whitehead has made six trips to eastern europe in his role as 
secretary of state george p shultzs principal liaison with 
countries in the area part of his assignment is to encourage the 
changes now taking place 
the administration has felt that with the ambitious political and 
economic reform movement in the soviet union under president mikhail 
gorbachev change was inevitable in eastern europe and officials 
have been monitoring developments there far more closely than before 
whitehead said he does not foresee popular uprisings taking place 
in eastern europe 
but zbigniew brzezinski a polishborn former white house 
national security adviser wrote recently that several countries in 
eastern europe are potentially ripe for revolutionary explosion 
it is not an exaggeration to say this could happen in more than 
one at the same time brzezinski said 
a major exception to the reform movement now under way is romania 
where whitehead said an absolutely outrageous human rights 
situation exists as a result of a government plan to demolish up to 
7000 villages under an agricultural modernization project 
he said the people in these villages are being moved to 
cementblock barrackslike structures with no running water and 
no toilets 
you can imagine living in an apartment house with no toilets 
its pretty atrocious whitehead said 
he called the forced resettlement policy an atrocious violation 
of human rights that i have never seen before anywhere in the world 
a government destroying the homes of its citizens and forcing them 
to move into what look like military barracks

palestinians buried the 19 people killed in 
israels most destructive air raid of the year and subsequent ground 
fighting then fled thursday as israeli warplanes streaked low 
overhead but did not attack 
the dead were taken by small funeral processions to the main 
cemetery of this ancient southern port and a palestinian graveyard 
in the nearby village of darb elseem after moslem noon prayers 
sirens wailed as mourners started home to the mieh mieh refugee 
camp target of the air raid guerrillas and civilians scattered 
ducking for cover as two jets flashed past 
the palestine liberation organization originally planned mass 
funerals for the 15 people killed at mieh mieh on sidons southern 
fringe and four guerrillas killed in fighting east of the city with 
militia allies of israel 
a guerrilla officer who would not give his name said plans were 
changed because we just couldnt risk mass gatherings with 
israels appetite for attacking at its peak we figured its prudent 
to keep a low profile 
in washington the state department urged all parties to hold 
their fire 
those involved must keep in mind that the pattern of action and 
reaction and the continuing violence in lebanon has a negative 
impact which serves the interests of no one spokesman charles 
redman said restraint would serve the interests of all and 
contribute to security and stability 
wednesdays rocket attack destroyed 30 buildings of a guerrilla 
base in mieh mieh police said rescuers searched the rubble all 
night and dug out nine bodies 
they said the bodies were of three guerrillas and a family of six 
parents and four children two sons and two daughters aged 6 to 
15 six people were reported killed and 40 wounded immediately after 
the raid on the base which belonged to the fatah guerrilla group 
led by plo chief yasser arafat 
fighting began in hills east of sidon soon afterward the south 
lebanon army a predominantly christian militia that acts as 
israels surrogate attacked positions held by palestinians and 
leftist lebanese militiamen for the first time since 1985 
a statement by the militia said its fighters captured a strategic 
hill overlooking jezzine the largest christian town in south 
lebanon and killed four guerrillas of the fatahrevolutionary 
council faction led by terrorist abu nidal 
it acknowledged one militiaman killed and one wounded and said 
the attackers captured three followers of abu nidal whose real name 
is sabry albanna 
palestinian sources at sidons ein elhilweh refugee camp 
confirmed the losses and said abu nidals commander east of sidon 
known by the code name abu rabie was among the dead 
guerrillas had used the outpost to to harass jezzine 11 miles 
west of sidon with mortar and sniper fire 
only one of the 19 israeli air raids into lebanon this year 
killed more people than the strike at mieh mieh the first attack 
jan 3 took 26 lives and wounded 30 people at a guerrilla base 
north of sidon 
both police and plo spokesmen said wednesdays raid was the worst 
in terms of destruction and guerrilla casualties 
mieh mieh has suffered the most severe destruction since 
israels 1982 invasion of lebanon said a police spokesman in 
sidon whose name cannot be used because of regulations 
the air raid on the refugee camp and a later strike wednesday at 
a guerrilla base outside beirut were the third and fourth since a 
shiite moslem driver detonated a car bomb last week in an army 
convoy in the security zone israel maintains just north of the 
border 
eight israeli soldiers were killed and seven soldiers and two 
local women wounded 
israeli fighterbombers struck palestinian and shiite guerrilla 
bases friday and sunday killing 21 people and wounding 34 
on tuesday israeli troops and their militia allies foiled two 
attempts by palestinian guerrillas to infiltrate northern israel

two whales that held the worlds attention 
for weeks swam away from their icy trap but remained today in a 
slushy channel cleared by soviet icebreakers the coast guard said 
rescuers still hoped the leviathans would follow the ships out into 
open sea 
you break a path and its like a snocone behind you it 
freezes overnight said ray massey a coast guard spokesman 
in alameda calif theyre probably going from hole to hole in 
small pools behind the icebreaker 
after dawn broke this morning helicopter crews headed out in 
hopes of better determining the status of the two california gray 
whales whom scientists had dubbed crossbeak and bonnet were 
going to have to do a nose count said sgt ian robertson of the 
alaska national guard he said at least two helicopters were being 
sent up 
masseys coast guard post was receiving messages from a us 
guardsman assigned as liaison aboard one of the two soviet 
icebreakers that continued to clear the way for the whales the day 
after the breakthrough that got the whales out of their solidice 
trap 
its in natures hands now gary hufford a national weather 
service ice analyst had said earlier 
the whales swam wednesday on what was hoped would be a long 
journey to their winter home off baja california but officials said 
there were still some ways from the open sea in the path cleared by 
the icebreakers earlier and already partially refrozen 
my understanding is that the whales were still in the channels 
and that they icebreakers were going to have to do more cutting 
massey said 
theyre going to open a path to real open water and hope they 
follow them out if we just walked off and left them now i 
dont think they could get out on their own if the breakers go out 
then they should be able to follow to go to open water 
the fate of the whales may never be known scientists involved in 
the rescue that cost more than 800000 didnt attach radio 
transmitters to the whales in part because of concern that the 
devices would only add to the animals stress said federal marine 
mammal biologist jim harvey 
a whale that was trapped with the pair nearly three weeks ago 
apparently died last week 
but a major factor in the decision against the transmitters was 
that a lot of people really didnt want to know the surviving 
whales fate harvey said 
in a final frenzy wednesday eskimos using chain saws cut 50 new 
breathing holes into the ice nearly as many as they had cut in two 
weeks the whales which grew accustomed to the cutting repeatedly 
surfaced in the new holes before the last block of ice was removed 
the animals moved to less than half a mile from a channel carved 
through the 18inchthick ice by two soviet icebreakers late tuesday 
and early wednesday then the eskimos were ordered to retreat so 
the icebreaker vladimir arseniev could reopen the channel already 
partially refrozen 
scrambling to safety on nuvuagluak spit the rescuers were joined 
by a press corps that nearly outnumbered them 
after two hours and no movement by the icebreaker the eskimos 
grew impatient their years of experience with the arctic ocean told 
them that a rising wind could begin stacking up the ice and undo all 
the progress 
faced with a near revolt rescue coordinators allowed the natives 
back onto the ice and they quickly moved the whales to within 
onequarter mile of the channel the soviets had cut tuesday 
finally the icebreaker appeared out of the snowy squall line 
ahead 
just after 4 pm 9 pm edt rescue coordinator ron morris 
reported from his helicopter that the whales had surfaced in a small 
pool in the old channel 
one was bleeding enough to stain the ice and surrounding water 
they then slipped beneath the surface moments later the whales 
appeared about 25 feet away in open water left by the icebreaker 
the crowd cheered 
as darkness fell the whales were moving along the channel which 
the arseniev continued to clear at least two miles from any 
significant open water 
theyre in the main lead and i cant help but think theyll 
keep on truckin morris said i dont know how much more we can 
do 
i learned a lot said craig george a north slope borough 
wildlife biologist who babysat for the whales from the time they 
were found trapped i learned that with persistence clear 
thinking and proper chain saws you can do anything 
the rescue effort initially bogged down with an attempt to move a 
185ton icebreaking barge from the prudhoe bay oil field 200 miles 
away the barge progressed just six miles in about as many days 
the alaska national guard then donated a huge helicopter that 
dropped a 5ton concrete cylinder through the ice but it proved to 
be of little value 
a 600000 device known as an archimedes screw tractor mounted 
on augerdriven pontoons was loaned by the oil industry but a test 
run showed the slushy trail it left made it unsuitable 
the rescue finally came down to a few dozen eskimos working from 
dawn until dark cutting holes to keep the whales alive and the 
soviet icebreakers whose help was solicited last weekend 
the endangered california gray whales have one of the longest 
migration routes of all mammals 6000 to 8000 miles from the 
arctic to the warm water off baja california 
their population has risen to about 20000 growing at an annual 
average of 25 percent for the past decade officials said 
the human persistence and determination by so many individuals 
on behalf of these whales shows mankinds concern for the 
environment president reagan said from the white house it has 
been an inspiring endeavor 
precise figures on the cost of the rescue effort werent 
available but an estimate of at least 800000 was compiled from 
estimates of a variety of governmental and private agencies and 
businesses that took part rear adm sigmund petersen of the federal 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said this morning on 
abcs good morning america that the cost to the federal 
government was relatively small

denouncing what it called one of the great 
scandals of american conservation the wilderness society on 
thursday chose 10 national wildlife refuges as most endangered to 
spotlight threats to the refuge system 
these 10 refuges are just the tip of the iceberg said george 
frampton president of the society from florida to alaska the 
refuge system is threatened by poisonous agricultural runoff 
containing heavy metals toxic chemicals and pesticides by wetlands 
drainage and water diversion by overcrowding and offroad vehicles 
by oil drilling and other incompatible activities 
a report from the society describing the 10 said without 
prompt action some of them may die 
in no particular order these are the 10 most threatened 
national key deer in the western florida keys loxahatchee in 
floridas everglades swamp stillwater near reno nev chincoteague 
on the virginia coast yazoo in mississippi arctic on alaskas 
north slope lower rio grande texas kesterson in californias san 
joaquin valley upper mississippi river along the wisconsin iowa 
minnesota and illinois shores of the river and great swamp in new 
jersey 25 miles from manhattan 
kesterson is so contaminated by irrigation runoff that many ducks 
stopping there are killed and most of the staffs time is spent 
trying to keep waterfowl from landing the society described the 
refuge as in a coma 
frampton said the 445 refuges managed by the fish and wildlife 
service have taken a back seat to the national parks which have 
major legislation spelling out protections a huge supporting 
constituency derived from 300 million annual visitors and a history 
of being carved out of the wilderness decades ago 
by contrast many of our refuges are mere remnants designated 
during development projects as a sop to environmentalists to protect 
the few remaining fragments of habitat within a much greater area 
destroyed frampton said 
the society called on congress to spell out goals and philosophy 
of the system something no statute now does to appropriate more 
money for land purchase and for the service to use more of its funds 
for protection and less for bureaucratic overhead 
also the service must do more to protect water quality and 
should renegotiate agreements with landowners often other federal 
or state agencies so that refuge managers have more control over 
the quality of the habitat in many cases the best solution is 
probably to transfer title to the fish and wildlife service 
all of these threats are mancaused frampton said almost 
all of them could be mitigated or controlled by intelligent 
management 
frank dunkle director of the fish and wildlife service said in 
a statement the situations cited by the wilderness society are 
not new nor are they being ignored the society seems to think we 
can build a moat around each of our 445 refuges to protect them from 
pollution and other external threats unfortunately that just is 
not possible 
i wish however the society had given us and the congress more 
credit for what we are doing to combat the problems identified in 
the report 
the society said these refuges didnt make the top 10 but had 
serious problems anyway fallon nevada bowdoin montana hakalau 
forest hawaii upper souris and j clark salyer north dakota

here are the choices of the wilderness society 
for the nations 10 most threatened wildlife refuges some problems 
listed by the society at each and some of the societys 
recommendations 
there is no significance to the order of listing 
national key deer florida 
as many as 20 percent of the deer are killed by cars each year 
with more mauled by pet dogs of residents and visitors construction 
continues to gobble up lands vital to a healthy deer population 
domestic waste is polluting refuge waters 
additional land must be bought 
loxahatchee florida 
nearby development has made water flow patterns much more 
variable and heavy fertilizer use is contaminating the refuge a 
solid waste disposal plant has been proposed on adjacent land 
water flow and quality should be improved and the waste plant 
abandoned 
stillwater nevada 
it has become the dumping ground for arsenic boron selenium 
lithium and other toxins that are in the pesticideladen runoff and 
return flows from a nearby irrigation project 
water flow must be increased possibly through purchase of 
water rights from farmers several of whom are willing to sell 
them 
chincoteague virginia 
a million visitors a year are putting pressure on wildlife 
nesting 
an offroad vehicle ban last summer was a dramatic success in 
helping restore the endangered piping plover and should be 
continued land acquisition should be stepped up and auto traffic 
reduced 
yazoo mississippi 
agricultural runoff is bringing in heavy concentrations of 
pesticides and there is significant doubt that a segment of 
drainage projects by the army corps of engineers will be able to 
ease runoff and siltation damage as claimed 
the drainage projects should be stopped 
arctic alaska 
oil companies and the interior department want to explore for 
oil which congress has not permitted 
congress should make it a wilderness area where all development 
is banned 
lower rio grande texas 
nearby pesticide spraying and runoff waste water discharges and 
planned real estate development are the major threats 
land acquisition must be accelerated since only a fifth of what 
was planned has been incorporated into the refuge 
kesterson california 
in a coma because of selenium poisoning from irrigation 
runoff that has killed thousands of ducks and other waterfowl 
because the area is critically important to migrating birds 
nearby land should be bought to replace the lost habitat 
upper mississippi river wisconsin iowa minnesota and illinois 
soil erosion is damaging habitat and reproduction wastewater and 
pesticideloaded agricultural runoff is polluting refuge waters and 
heavy recreation use is hurting habitat 
the service should acquire the half of the refuge owned by the 
corps of engineers and should add staff 
great swamp new jersey 
population growth is straining two sewage treatment plants whose 
outflow eventually reaches the refuge road salt fertilizer and 
pesticides are reaching the refuge and old toxic dumps threaten 
contamination 
water quality monitoring should be improved and dumps should be 
cleaned up

you could call bill biamonte a political junkie 
but dont bore him with talk about george bush or michael dukakis 
he wears his loyalty on his lapel on a brownandwhite button that 
says it all 
we need jerry brown back again 
that is not perhaps the message youd expect to hear this year 
especially not from a long island man whos been to california just 
once in his life and then for only a brief vacation 
this is a man who ranks himself as the worlds foremost collector 
of jerry brown political memorabilia who once ran for college 
president on the jerry brown ticket who has followed the former 
california governor through the political wilderness and sees the 
promised land ahead 
biamonte who tracks reluctant witnesses for the nassau county 
district attorney and is a local political consultant started an 
organization earlier this year called jerry brown watch and 
published the first issue of what he hopes will be a regular 
publication the brownie journal 
the publication reprinting newspaper articles goes out to 180 
former brown campaign contributors whose names were on a list 
biamonte bought from the federal election commission 
all along i think his strength has been that he has a very 
dedicated constituency biamonte said of brown 
biamontes fascination dates to 1976 when brown first ran for 
president his interest waned a bit in the succeeding few years but 
when he met brown during the 1980 presidential campaign the spark 
was rekindled in a hurry 
thats when i got the idea that he was the candidate for the 
future he said 
brown the son of a former california governor was embraced by 
many as a sort of newage democrat an exseminarian a student of 
zen buddhism companion of singer linda ronstadt and enthusiast of 
alternative energy sources like windmills he often was accused of 
blowing with the political wind as well opposing tax cuts but 
then embracing them and pushing through his own cuts 
brown lost a bid for us senate in 1982 and retired from 
politics biamonte followed his subsequent international wanderings 
from afar and began to establish a network of fellow brownies who 
fed each other information 
now biamonte believes his patience may be paying off brown 
recently announced his candidacy for chairmanship of the california 
democratic party 
what does brown think of this unsolicited support the former 
governor reached at his los angeles law office seemed momentarily 
nonplussed by the question 
um he said uh he hes someone who met me several 
years ago and hes been an enthusiastic supporter ever since hes 
got a lot of energy and a lot of enthusiasm and he keeps a lot of 
people who supported me together 
hes a completely independent operator in all this brown 
added 
biamonte acknowledges that his is strictly a unofficial effort 
but he dreams of a more official role in some future brown campaign 
thats one of my fantasies he said having a really good 
job working for brown 
such dedication prompts expressions of wonderment from some 
former brown supporters such as 1980 campaign official josiah 
beeman 
the guy is just a dedicated 100 percent brownie beeman said

two men accused of violating us law by illegally 
aiding the nicaraguan contra rebels regularly briefed the fbi and 
intelligence agencies about their activities according to documents 
released in a criminal case 
the documents also show miami police informed the fbi in 
september 1984 of the existence of the contrasupporting group 
civilian materiel assistance and that drugtrafficking money was 
being used to finance the contra cause 
the fbi in turn was sending its reports to oliver north at the 
national security council 
fbi spokesman paul miller in miami said thursday he had not seen 
the documents but added i doubt we will be able to comment 
because it concerns a matter before the courts 
he did however say that the miami police intelligence report 
which told of drug money going to contra supporters and said 
dynamite was shipped to them on commercial airliners had been 
investigated and found vague 
the fbi miami police national security council and defense 
intelligence agency reports were contained in a motion by defense 
attorney john mattes accusing the government of selectively 
prosecuting his client jack terrell 
terrell and six other men including cma founder thomas posey and 
his miami coordinator jose coutin were indicted in fort lauderdale 
in june on charges of violating the us neutrality act in 1984 and 
1985 they are accused of illegally recruiting mercenaries and 
shipping weapons to aid the contras 
the documents clearly show the fbi acquiesced in all this 
conduct mattes said they detail the exact persons their 
names their property and even the exact air strips the contra 
supporters were working from 
a declassified report from military intelligence agent franklin 
camper showed the dia not only knew of the activities in april 1984 
but outlined for posey and a contra official a plan for deep 
penetration raids into nicaragua by us volunteers and nicaraguan 
rebels 
as early as january 1985 posey and coutin were both reporting 
regularly to fbi agents in miami birmingham ala and other 
places advising them of their plans to aid the contras their 
contacts in washington and their frequent trips to central america 
according to the documents 
both the fbi and the two men were aware the network might violate 
us neutrality laws which bar launching military activities 
against a government with which the nation is at peace 
a jan 23 1985 fbi report from birmingham quoted posey as 
saying that on a trip to washington he was told that the 
neutrality matter would be closed 
posey told fbi agents in alabama he had been assured he would not 
be prosecuted if he continued to cooperate and to provide 
intelligence info re current developments in central america the 
fbi report said 
a jan 8 1985 fbi report from miami concludes with a note that 
the national security council had asked to be given all information 
on the case 
fbi headquarters is requested to disseminate above information 
to oliver north national security council white house it says 
in all coutin and posey talked to fbi agents in miami and 
birmingham at least six times in january 1985 and posey also spoke 
to agents in new orleans 
coutin also talked in september 984 to a miami police unit 
investigating a bombing at a bank and mentioned his procontra 
activities the miami police report said 
the report also said coutin told the police that alleged cocaine 
trafficker francisco chanes was giving money to anticastro and 
contra groups and that the monies comes from narcotic 
transactions 
it said a police source jose sosa claimed chanes spent 
thousands on the rebels and that rene corvo indicted this summer 
in an associated neutrality act case put dynamite in his luggage 
on a commercial flight to costa rica for delivery to the contras 
miller said a full fbi investigation cast doubt on sosas account

the financial health of the nations farmers at 
the beginning of 1988 was the best in years agriculture department 
economists said thursday 
higher incomes lower operating costs a 45 percent increase in 
government payments and a modest rise in farm product sales 
contributed to the improvement the departments economic research 
service said in an annual review 
the 176page analysis did not forecast 1988 financial returns or 
assess the impact of this years drought although other reports 
have pointed to net cash income levels at near the record 1987 level 
however those reports emphasized that thousands of farmers have 
been hurt severely in 1988 by drought losses to crops and livestock 
while others have prospered because of the reduced supplies and 
higher prices 
the latest report said that real net income in 1987 reached 38 
billion after adjusting for inflation the highest level since the 
mid1970s and was on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s 
rising land values which represent 70 percent of all farm 
assets and lower debt boosted the equity or net worth of farmers 
as of jan 1 1988 to 571 billion from 537 billion a year 
earlier the report said that reversed a sixyear decline 
the most dramatic farm financial change in the past few years 
has been the improvement in the solvency position of farms the 
report said 
solvency or the ability to pay debts is one of the measures of 
financial health in the farm sector others include liquidity or 
the capability of making payments when they come due and 
profitability or net farm income 
higher net farm income in 1987 helped farmers reduce or pay off 
debt and provided more farms with enough capital to avoid new debt 
financing than in previous years the report said asset values 
rose 3 percent over those of 1986 while debt fell 8 percent to 143 
billion in 1987 the fourth annual decline in a row leaving the 
sector in the best position at any time in the 1980s to meet debt 
service obligations 
according the an annual survey of farm costs and returns nearly 
80 percent of the nations farms were profitable in 1987 up from 70 
percent in 1986 the report said that nearly 44 percent of all farms 
were free of debt at the beginning of 1988 compared with less than 
39 percent a year earlier 
there was a large variation however in debt owed by different 
size farms only 16 percent of the largest those with sales of 
more than 500000 a year were free of debt at the start of this 
year compared with almost 60 percent of the smallest farms or 
those with sales of less than 10000 annually

the federal communications commission took a 
step thursday toward shoring up struggling radio stations by voting 
to allow common ownership of stations located closer together but 
still in different markets 
by relaxing its ownership rule the fcc said it would enable more 
station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale 
and cost savings that result from joint ownership of stations 
the new rule would reduce by about half the distance required 
between two stations owned by the same person or company it also 
would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets under 
the new rule commonly owned stations could be as close as 25 miles 
the commission had planned also to consider changing other rules 
that limit common ownership in the same market to amfm combinations 
but allow waivers for some uhftv and radio combinations but 
commissioners could not agree on the proposed changes 
the fcc also agreed to recommend that congress require cable 
companies to negotiate with outoftown tv stations for the rights 
to carry their signals the commission is expected to extend that 
recommendation to cover local tv signals before it issues a final 
order in the matter 
currently cable companies have a compulsory license granted 
by congress in 1976 giving them the right to carry local and 
distant broadcast signals for what is often a bargain price the 
system of low prices was established because cable companies were 
required to carry local tv signals 
but fcc chairman dennis r patrick said the current system 
amounts to an undue and unwarranted subsidy for the cable 
industry particularly since cable companies are no longer 
required to carry local broadcast signals 
requiring cable companies to negotiate with copyright holders 
would establish a system of prices that more closely reflects the 
value of programming to viewers he said 
it also would raise of price of some programming which would 
likely increase the rates paid by cable subscribers fcc officials 
could not estimate the financial impact but they said that while 
prices might rise the cable menu of programs would likely be more 
attractive to viewers 
the national cable television association opposes elimination of 
the compulsory license and in a statement noted that before 
congress adjourned last week it extended the license for distant 
signals to backyard dish owners 
the recommendation was reached with some difficulty by the three 
sitting fcc commissioners 
commissioner james h quello refused to go along with patrick to 
expand the recommendation to cover local tv signals and commissioner 
patricia dennis withheld her vote on the entire matter until she was 
fully satisfied with the tone and conclusions of the agencys report 
she said however that once her concerns are met she would 
probably vote that the recommendation cover both local and distant 
signals

courtroom custody battle if necessary their lawyer said thursday 
on wednesday robert mays a 43yearold sarasota roofing supply 
salesman revealed that he has told his 9yearold daughter 
kimberly michelle of the claims of regina and ernest twigg of 
langhorne pa

infant at hardee memorial hospital in wauchula and then hospital 
records were altered to cover up the babyselling scheme 
the child they took home from the hospital arlena died of a 
heart defect in august after genetic testing that revealed she 
could not have been their biological daughter 
john blakely the couples florida attorney said if kimberly 
is their daughter they do not know of any fact at this time that 
would cause them not to pursue custody of their child 
they are simply driven by their natural paternal and maternal 
instincts to pursue and protect their own offspring 
the twiggs already have asked a sarasota court to order a genetic 
blood test a sophisticated scientific means of determining 
parentage no hearing has been set 
mays has vowed to fight any effort to remove the child

that he held a news conference and publicly revealed their 
identities blakely said mays identity had been known to 
reporters who withheld it in order to protect the girl 
mr and mrs twigg are upset that mr mays talked to kimberly 
without first talking to them at this point they believe kimberly 
is their daughter their attorney said if theres been no 
genetic testing done why expose her to that news before 
confirmation is obtained 
mays whose first wife kimberlys mother died and who is 
divorced from his second wife said he told kimberly about the 
dispute because he was afraid shed learn of it from a stranger

authorities detained dozens of 
dissidents in predawn raids and tightened security in prague 
thursday at the first official communist celebration of 
czechoslovakias prewar independence 
hundreds of policemen and members of the peoples militia a 
paramilitary force cordoned off the center of wenceslas square 
where tens of thousands massed behind red flags and in organized 
groups for the official rally to mark the anniversary of 
independence 
authorities banned an independent rally called for friday by 
signatories of the human rights document charter 77 and four other 
dissident groups 
a dissident source who asked not to be identified said about 50 
activists were detained in police raids early thursday including 
dissident playwright vaclav havel roman catholic activist vaclav 
benda and petr uhl a monitor of political harassment in 
czechoslovakia 
at least 15 other activists were reported under house arrest the 
source said 
in frankfurt west germany the international society for human 
rights quoted czechoslovak activists as saying 122 people were 
detained throughout czechoslovakia that report could not be 
independently confirmed in prague 
to mark the 70th anniversary of czechoslovakias independence 
authorities announced a limited amnesty freeing prisoners serving 
less than two years or less than three years in the case of crimes 
committed through negligence 
the state news agency ctk did not specify whether the amnesty 
included the estimated 70 political prisoners in czechoslovak jails 
but a legal source suggested the measure could apply to some 
firsttime political offenders 
the ban on the unofficial rally followed a protest march by 
thousands of people in august on the 20th anniversary of the warsaw 
pact invasion that crushed reforms prague residents said the march 
had clearly unnerved the authorities 
prague communist party boss miroslav stepan delivered a stern 
warning at thursdays rally that unofficial groups will not be 
tolerated 
we wont allow the process of restructuring and democratization 
to be abused by those who dont care for socialism and their 
homeland those who are trying to destabilize society stepan 
said 
there is no dialogue here he added 
his warning echoed similar speeches by communist party leader 
milos jakes and chief ideologist jan fojtik at a communist party 
meeting oct 1012 that signaled czechoslovakia will not make 
sweeping political or economic reforms or follow neighboring hungary 
into toleration of independent groups 
earlier thursday hundreds of people joined an american tribute 
to thomas garrigue masaryk the president and founder of the 
democratic republic which was set up on oct 28 1918 
communist authorities proclaimed friday a national holiday this 
year reviving a custom in force for three years in the late 1960s 
but otherwise ignored in four decades of socialist rule the 
authorites scheduled the mass rally for thursday in order to allow 
citizens to enjoy a threeday weekend 
about 300 people jammed the front of the us embassy to sing 
anthems and listen to an emotional rendering of a patriotic poem 
afterward they burst into applause and shouted thank you thank 
you to us ambassador julkian niemczyk and other american 
diplomats 
dozens of people stuck bouquets on to wall plaques showing 
masaryk his slovak ally milan rastislav stefanik and president 
woodrow wilson who backed their campaign for dzechoslovak 
independence 
officials representing the presidency the national assembly and 
the communistled national front laid wreaths on masaruyks grave 
for the first time since the liberal era of 1968 only about 100 
people attended the barely publicized ceremony at lany 30 miles 
west of prague 
masaryk and other czechoslovak nationalists proclaimed the 
democratic republic in the waning days of world war i 
a respected philosopher masaryk was four times elected president 
of democratic czechoslovakia before his death in 1937 in 1938 the 
nation he built was dismembered when the munich pact between 
britain france and adolf hitler allowed the nazis to occupy 
czechoslovakias germanspeaking territories 
once reviled by the communists masaryk remains a potent national 
symbol 
president gustav husak lauded him briefly in a ceremony at 
pragues hradcany castle saying masaryk was respected at home and 
abroad but he did not mention masaryks achievements as a 
democratic philosopher nor say what kind of state he headed 
the official celebrations of national day appeared to be an 
attempt to tap popular sentiment and swing it behind the communist 
government 
but the tough police operation mounted for the occasion indicated 
the ruling politburo doesnt intend to swerve from the course it has 
charted in the 20 years since soviet and warsaw pact tanks crushed 
the prague spring reforms 
the security operation was believed to be the work of interior 
minister frantisek kincl who gained his post in a government 
reshuffle two weeks ago kincl formerly was police chief in northern 
and central moravia two areas which have the reputation as being 
among the toughest on dissidents

you thank you

slovak ally milan rastislav stefanik and president woodrow wilson 
who helped them win independence for czechoslovakia 
dozens of people crowded round us ambassador julian niemczyk

wreaths on masaryks grave at lany 30 miles west of prague

which unlike other official events was little publicized in 
advance

americanborn wife charlotte and their son jan a former foreign 
minister who died under mysterious circumstances just after the 
communist takeover in 1948 
with the backing of the united states britain and france 
masaryk and other campaigners for czechoslovak independence 
proclaimed a democratic republic on oct 28 1918 
world war i was coming to an end and the giant austrohungarian 
empire of which slovakia and the czech lands of bohemia and moravia 
were part was on the verge of breaking up 
masaryk was four times elected president of democratic 
czechoslovakia before his death in 1937

which allowed the nazis to march into czechoslovakias 
germanspeaking territories 
at a ceremony at pragues hradcany castle the current president 
gustav husak lauded masaryk as a figure of authority at home and 
abroad in his time 
but according to a text of his speech from the state news agency 
ctk he made no mention of masaryks role as a democratic 
philosopher and did not refer to the kind of government masaryk and 
his colleagues founded 
western diplomats invited to the ceremony had said communist 
party leader milos jakes would speak but ctk said no speech by 
jakes was expected

the local naacp president threatened with 
suspension by her national headquarters reluctantly retracted on 
thursday her dayold endorsement of republican presidential nominee 
george bush and sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people had disavowed the 
endorsements by columbus chapter president melanie j mitchell and 
demanded a retraction by late thursday 
hooks said the naacp is a nonpartisan organization whose bylaws 
forbid political endorsements 
ms mitchell said she stood by her endorsements but agreed to 
hooks demand for a retraction to avoid jeopardizing the chapters 
taxexempt status as a nonprofit organization 
i felt that a message needed to be sent to the black community 
of the impending danger of supporting one political party she 
said in an telephone interview i believe that in order for 
progress to take place for blacks they must be intricately involved 
in the entire political process which includes involvement in both 
political parties 
hooks said ms mitchell was told in a telegram and a telephone 
call thursday to issue a public statement repudiating in its 
entirety this position immediately upon receipt of this 
communication 
failure to do so will result in your immediate suspension 
she was told 
ohio naacp president james daniels also condemned the 
endorsements made in a news release issued wednesday under the 
naacps letterhead 
in that statement ms williams said the naacp does not give 
political endorsements but we must offer support to those 
persons who hold political offices or are seeking such offices 
whose ideals activities practices or policies are in the best 
interest of minorities 
cornell mcclearly vice president of the columbus chapter told 
the columbus dispatch on wednesday that the decision to endorse bush 
and metzenbaum was prompted by a belief that loyalty solely to the 
democratic party was totally counterproductive 
before ms mitchells retraction keith mcnamara the ohio 
chairman of the bush campaign said he was absolutely delighted 
by the endorsement which he said supports gop expectations that the 
vice president will win a larger portion of the black vote this 
fall than even president reagan did

sudden infant death syndrome continues to be a 
leading cause of premature mortality and an increase among white 
male infants may signal an important trend federal health officials 
said thursday 
sids which strikes about one in 500 us infants ranks seventh 
among causes of premature mortality in the centers for disease 
controls tabulations of years of potential life lost 
unintentional injuries rank first 
the cdc measures the loss of potential life in deaths 
before age 65 as a means of gauging the effects of premature 
mortality age 65 is a statistical benchmark actual us life 
expectancy today is higher 
during 198083 sids robbed white male infants of potential 
life at the rate of 97 years per 1000 births while the rate for 
females was 65 by 198485 the rate for white male babies had risen 
to 100 while the females rate had fallen to 61 
the rate for black males fell from 185 to 167 and the rate for 
black females fell from 151 to 134 
the slight increases among white males should be 
monitored to determine a possible emerging trend the 
atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
the increase might be attributed to one of two factors said dr 
jose becerra a sids specialist with the cdc it could be due 
either to increased incidence of sids or a decrease in age at 
death in this white male group he said 
if white male sids babies were for some reason dying younger 
than other sids babies their years of potential life lost 
before 65 would thus be higher becerra explained 
in actual terms sids would also seem to be on the increase among 
white males in 1984 2295 sids deaths were reported among white 
baby boys rising to 2390 in 1985 over the same period white 
female sids cases increased by just six from 1361 to 1367 black 
male cases fell from 799 to 775 and black female cases fell from 640 
to 582 
overall 5245 us sids cases were reported in 1984 and 5315 in 
85 the cdc noted 
the mystery surrounding sids defined as the sudden death of 
an infant unexpectedly and without an adequate cause of 
death also contributes to the uncertainty in studying it becerra 
said in 1985 about 93 percent of us sids deaths were confirmed 
by autopsy but that leaves a substantial number where no autopsy 
was made so the diagnosis is in doubt he said

two murder convicts took a counselor and a 
teacher hostage today in the library of northern state prison but 
released both of them unharmed and surrendered within several hours 
authorities said 
the incident ended about 4 pm when the inmates released the 
second hostage joan mason 51 of newark about 2 hours earlier 
the two men had freed annette martin 46 also of newark 
capt robert baker of the state department of corrections said 
the women were uninjured and that inmates angel guzman 26 and 
edward robinson 27 surrendered peacefully after releasing their 
hostages they had been armed with homemade spearlike weapons 
martin a teacher assistant and mason a counselor were taken 
hostage shortly after 9 am while they conducted a teaching session 
in the library of the yearold northern state prison 
james stabile spokesman for the corrections department said the 
two inmates only demands were that they be transferred to a federal 
prison outside new jersey and that officials take no reprisals 
because of the hostage taking 
stabile described the inmates weapons as long metal rods with 
sharpened points 
earlier negotiators talked through a meshed metal window to the 
inmates who used martin as a shield 
the hostage was right in front of the window between the inmate 
and the window with a metal rod pointed right at her head or her 
neck stabile said 
guzman formerly of woodbine nj was sentenced in 1982 to 17 
years in prison for shooting his uncle to death over a 70 debt in 
cape may county robinson formerly of camden nj was sentenced 
to life in prison in 1979 for a murder in camden county prison

mason is a vocational counselor who has worked at the prison for 
about a year martin is a teaching assistant who started working at 
the prison in march both women are from newark 
the 18 million northern state prison opened last year making it 
the newest prison in the state the medium security prison houses 
about 1000 inmates at the 18 million prison in individual cells

release all political prisoners by the end of the year may refer 
only to a small group of people perhaps as few as 20 the state 
department said thursday 
spokesman charles redman said the two superpowers continue to 
disagree on the definition of exactly what constitutes a political 
prisoner 
he said moscow insists the term fits only those actually charged 
with political offenses while washington says it also should 
include those jailed on trumpedup charges 
weve long pressed for the release of soviet political 
prisoners redman told reporters the soviets finally accept 
that there are such prisoners but we continue to disagree on a 
definition 
he said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told us 
officials during a visit to the united states last month that there 
were only about 40 such prisoners all of whom had been convicted 
for violations of the political and religious articles of the soviet 
criminal code 
but redman said us officials have raised with the soviets the 
names of some 200 prisoners including those jailed on fabricated 
charges 
west german chancellor helmut kohl told reporters in moscow on 
wednesday that he had been assured in talks with soviet officials 
that all political prisoners would be released within 10 weeks 
however the foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
refused to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is 
imminent saying there are only about two dozen such prisoners 
the recent remarks made to chancellor kohl are an indication 
that all political prisoners will be released redman said but 
mr gerasimovs statement which followed that leads us to believe 
that the soviets may be referring only to the 40some prisoners 
raised during shevardnadzes visit in september here 
responding to questions redman said he believed that about half 
of those 40 prisoners had been released in recent weeks leaving only 
about 20 or so on the soviet list

lenore 25 tips the scales at 230 while her 
friend terra weighs in at 275 pounds these simian grand dames 
need a fat farm and fast say medical experts at lincoln park zoo 
but just how do you tell a lady gorilla shes too fat very 
carefully 
an even trickier question how do you get her to eat lowfat fare 
while the rest of her pals are getting the usual 
veterinarians borrowing from the human fitness craze are using 
body composition analysis and blood tests to determine just how big 
is too big for six lowland gorillas that call lincoln park their 
home 
the study is spurred by concerns that a matronly gorilla may have 
some difficulty becoming a mom chief zoo veterinarian thomas meehan 
said this week 
members of the zoo staff noticed that the youngest slimmest and 
trimmest of the female gorillas were better reproducers but until 
the veterinarians finish analyzing test results in several weeks 
they arent sure whether other gorillas are fat because theyre old 
not conceiving offspring because theyre fat or old or all of the 
above

demands for improved safety procedures at us 
nuclear weaponsmaking plants mounted thursday as 31 members of the 
house armed services committee appealed directly to president reagan 
this crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period and 
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance safety and 
operating conditions the lawmakers said in a companion letter to 
energy secretary john s herrington 
the letters drafted by rep john spratt dsc and signed by 
committee chairman les aspin dwis urged reagan to appoint 
quickly the fivemember nuclear facilities safety board which 
congress ordered created this fall to oversee the troubled weapons 
complex 
the lawmakers expressed particular concern over the savannah 
river plant at aiken sc where the energy departments last three 
operational weapons production reactors have been shut down for 
safety reasons the first will not resume producing nuclear weapons 
material until january energy department officials have said 
we will expect the department not to restart a reactor befor 
assuring our committee that the applicable operating procedures 
assure an adequate margin of safety they said in the letter to 
herrington 
national security adviser colin powell answering questions 
thursday during an appearance at the national press club said 
resolving the problems was a top priority in the reagan 
administration but he added that this is going to take more than 
a few slogans its going to take a lot of money 
there are no magicbullet solutions he said these 
problems developed over a long period of time we did not make the 
necessary investment during the 50s and 60s to upgrade these aging 
facilities 
four of does 17 sites have been partially or wholly shut down 
this year over safety concerns prompting hearings before house and 
senate panels on wednesday a nationwide antinuclear group 
physicians for social responsibility said the problems constitute 
a public health emergency and urged medical studies on cancer 
rates among workers and neighbors of the plants 
in other developments government documents obtained by the 
associated press show that the energy department gave a manager of 
the savannah river plant 59750 in awards for excellence despite 
continuing problems there 
the manager robert morgan who retired early this year is one 
of many individuals and organizations that received cash bonuses 
totaling millions of dollars despite a steady decline in safety at 
savannah river which is a weapons production facility run by the 
energy department for the pentagon 
a doe spokesman will callicott said he was not aware of any 
plans to review the system of awards 
morgan received the bonuses in 19811987 despite growing safety 
problems which finally forced the department this year to shut down 
the reactors at savannah river according to energy department 
documents and capitol hill testimony the three reactors began 
operating in 1954 
memoranda in 1987 and 1988 document the failure of department 
officials to persuade morgan to implement safety guidelines 
on oct 16 1987 mary l walker then the assistant energy 
secretary for environment safety and health wrote morgan and troy 
wade then deputy assistant secretary complaining they were not 
heeding an order for stricter operating procedures and evaluation of 
potential damage from an earthquake at savannah river 
the cited inability of sr savannah river to adequately 
implement its safety oversight program including sufficient 
daytoday surveillance and deficiency followup is unacceptable 
wrote walker who has since left the job 
on march 21 1988 morgan sent a letter to walkers temporary 
successor garry w gibbs saying that his office considers that 
the concerns raised are unfounded and feels that much 
misunderstanding exists within the office of environment safety and 
health in the area of sr seismic design and criteria 
on may 20 1988 richard w starostecki who has assumed walkers 
duties wrote a blistering letter to morgans successor paul w 
kaspar 
it appears that the seismic upgrading that has been 
accomplished and is now under way has been a piecemeal largely 
reactive response and that planning control and documentation have 
been seriously neglected starostecki wrote 
criteria analytical methods and analyses appear fragmented 
incomplete and inconclusive he wrote 
morgan was of many individuals and contractors who received cash 
awards for excellence at energy department nuclear facilities 
despite mounting problems other such individuals cited in an oct 
26 1983 letter from rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house subcommittee on oversight and investigations included 
herman roser then assistant secretary received 36917 in 
bonuses 198083 although according to dingell he killed the 
independent assessment program which had been severely critical of 
his security program when he ran the departments regioffect when longerterm 
loans 
are agreed to economic forecaster jonathan heath said the agreement 
would help mexico out of a shortterm economic trap 
an official of the department of energy mines and stateowned 
companies said mexico has lost at least 2 billion in anticipated 
1988 revenues because of the depressed oil market last years oil 
revenues totaled about 86 billion 
mexicos firsthalf merchandise trade surplus through june was 
24 billion well below 1987s firsthalf surplus of 476 billion 
according to the center for private economic studies 
the price of isthmus a major grade of light mexican crude 
dropped from 1377 a barrel in august to 1280 in september for 
us customers it was as high as 1700 in december 1987 in 1985 
and 1986 isthmus went from 25 a barrel to 10 
pemex the government oil monopoly has sharply criticized the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries for overproduction and 
for indulging in an undeclared price war especially in the us 
market pemexs largest customer 
mexico the worlds sixthlargest oil producer doesnt belong to 
opec but usually follows its pricing policies pemex however said 
it didnt plan to join in price cutting and would not try to produce 
more to make up for lost revenue

the philippines will sue westinghouse 
corp for building a 23billion nuclear power plant that never 
went into operation because of alleged safety defects a top 
presidential aide said thursday 
adolfo azcuna president corazon aquinos legal adviser told 
reporters the suit was likely to be filed in the united states 
within a month 
we are suing for damages and breach of contract azcuna said 
he said other parties may be sued too but he declined to identify 
them 
construction of the plant began in the mid1970s with completion 
delayed by scandals involving alleged kickbacks to thenpresident 
ferdinand marcos and questions about its safety 
the plant was completed nearly three years ago but mrs aquinos 
government decided to junk it for reasons of safety officials said 
the plant would have required hundreds of millions of dollars more 
for safety guarantees which her financially strapped government 
coult not afford 
in addition to questions about its design opponents of the 
plant located on bataan province 50 miles west west of manila say 
it sits on an earthquake fault and is near a volcano 
after being rocked by the kickback scandal in 1978 construction 
was suspended for nearly a year while the plants design was studied 
following the three mile island accident the reevaluation ended in 
design modifications that further bloated the plants cost 
much of the money for the plant came from foreign loans 
aquino administration officials often cite the plant as an 
example of the needless expenses incurred during the administration 
of marcos which burdened the philippines with a 28 billion foreign 
debt 
officials said that interest alone on the loans for the nuclear 
power plant totalled more than 300000 a day 
azcuna told reporters the government decided to sue westinghouse 
failing to reach a settlement with the pittsburghbased company 
the legal panel is studying the alternatives of filing the case 
either in the united states or in the philippines and the 
probability is that it will be filed in the united states he 
said we have engaged us counsel to help us in doing this and 
the timing would be very soon 
pressed by reporters for a date azcuna replied it was about 
to be foiled last month so i would say within a month 
he refused to give more details of the suit other sources said 
the complaint wont cite any specific amount in damages and would 
leave it to the us courts 
the aquino government was under pressure two years ago to 
repudiate loans to the nuclear project but it refused to do so for 
fear of possible backlash from foreign banks with which she is 
renegotiating her countrys outstanding debts 
officials who asked not to be identified said that litigation was 
the safest way to deal with the problem especially because the 
government has convincing evidence that the plant is unsafe and its 
construction characterized by fraud

aviation said methods are being worked out by the international

israel has a new nightly tv show and it can get 
pretty violent with its rioting hooligans masked stonethrowers and 
battling tanks 
it isnt the latest american cop show but the nightly string of 
political campaign ads a crucial tool in reaching undecided voters 
unlike in the united states where the presidential campaign is 
waged via the nightly news and periodic commercials israeli law 
bars staterun radio and television from covering candidates in the 
final month before the vote 
instead the 27 parties competing for 120 parliament seats are 
given free access to prime time tv to get their message across 
since the beginning of the month the twominute spots have been 
running backtoback in 40minute periods after the evening news 
the commercials ranging from slick to amateurish feature some 
serious political debate but more often use gimmicks fancy 
graphics and recently nasty attacks on political rivals 
leaders of both the leftleaning labor party and the rightwing 
likud bloc the main political rivals say the rhetoric may get 
rougher before tuesdays vote 
in one ad this week labor called likud leaders liars for 
allegedly forging polls described their supporters as primitive 
hooligans and tried to show the party as hopelessly divided 
to make the point the spot showed shouting likud supporters 
smashing equipment at a rally in the same ad rival party leaders 
yitzhak shamir david levy and ariel sharon were seen barking 
insults with these clips intercut with cartoons of medieval knights 
charging at each other 
the spot closed with a cartoon of a sinking ship interspersed 
with shots of a fistpounding shamir who called likud a movement 
that fights for its existence 
ronnie milo head of likuds tv campaign watched that ad 
wednesday night and then told reporters well get a little 
tougher in the next couple of days 
likud kept its promise thursday night with a sharp attack on 
labor leader shimon peres yesterday labor showed what it thinks 
about likud said an announcer we dont want to tell you what 
we think about shimon peres but what labor people say about him 
the spot then flashed across the screen uncomplimentary quotes 
about peres attributed to former labor prime ministers including 
founding father david ben gurion who allegedly said of his protege 
dont believe him dont get close to him 
as the quotes were splashed across the screen peres image 
appeared in a corner his face contorted in various grimaces 
in addition to personal attacks the ads often appeal to the 
viewers emotions especially on the issue of middle east peace and 
how israel should deal with the palestinian uprising 
this week labor showed a middleaged widow who pleaded for a 
peace settlement so her teenage son would not be killed in a war 
like his father 
the next day likud hit back with an elderly israeli viktor 
eldad azkirelli who lost a son in war addressing the war widow 
azkirelli said i felt you were being used im against 
involving bereaved families in the election campaign 
to work out these responses both parties employ focus groups 
voters representing the political spectrum who rate the ads every 
night 
likud invites a different focus group of about 50 voters to its 
campaign headquarters every night after viewing each ad the voters 
push buttons ranking them on a scale of one to five 
likud campaign strategist binyamin netanyahu said the party 
decided to bring on the bereaved father because the focus group felt 
the spot with the war widow was a manipulation of grief 
the big parties dominate the nightly show because air time is 
alloted according to representation in the knesset or parliament 
but the smaller parties get their shot too 
some of the seven religious parties feature wailing ram horns and 
bearded rabbis speaking with almost evangelical fervor against the 
moral decay of israeli society 
one ad by the liberal citizens rights party featured puppets 
arguing campaign issues and a commercial for the rightwing 
crossroads party used a graphic in which the star of david on the 
israeli flag turns into the party symbol 
other ads have shown masked palestinian stonethrowers israeli 
tanks in the field and even plo leader yasser arafat toting a gun 
some are critical of the ads whose production costs use up a 
large chunk of the 30 million the parties spend on the campaign 
they the ads are based on a common denominator of viewing the 
potential voter as infantile and retarded wrote the daily yediot 
ahronot 
the ads may not be making their point either considering that 
viewership dropped from more than 70 percent earlier this month to 
about 43 percent 
but the commercials are still the most direct way to reach 
undecided voters estimated at 8 percent of the electorate of 29 
million who are considered crucial to the outcome by both major 
parties

politicians have come to understand that 
you have to be pretty quick to a punch line to hold a crowd and on 
thursday dan quayle fell victim for just a moment to an 
overenthusiastic supporter 
in his stump speech the republican vice presidential candidate 
usually mentions that michael dukakis has linked himself to former 
president harry truman this gives quayle a chance to parody lloyd 
bentsen and poke some fun at himself by delivering the remark but 
hes no harry truman 
the reference is to bentsens debate putdown when quayle compared 
his experience to that of president kennedy bentsen said he had 
known kennedy and told quayle youre no jack kennedy 
at a fundraising breakfast quayle said dukakis had been 
referring again to truman but before he could deliver the punch 
line a man in the audience shouted out hes no harry truman 
that provoked laughter and left quayle momentarily stymied but 
he barely missed a beat before pointing to the man and said that 
man he doesnt know michael dukakis he has never even served with 
michael dukakis but hes right michael dukakis is no harry 
truman

quayle shrugs off lingering questions about his national guard 
service as side events but has not entirely escaped the 
vietnamera issue 
along with admirers as quayle stumped through the south this 
week there were naysayers signs reading chickenhawk or why 
did quayle cross the road to get to the national guard have 
greeted him at rallies throughout the fall and the resentment even 
spilled over to a selfdescribed republican who served among his 
local police contingent in miami on wednesday 
the policeman told a reporter hed intended to vote for george 
bush until bush tapped quayle as his running mate now the officer 
said he will simply not vote on nov 8 he said he couldnt 
believe he had to protect quayle whom he called a draft 
dodger 
quayle enlisted in the indiana national guard during the vietnam 
war when many of his peers were being drafted quayle has said he 
was not trying to avoid the draft but simply chose a course that 
would allow him to attend law school while fulfilling his military 
obligation

at an earlier stop in florida quayle let reporters know he had 
not forgotten the drubbing they gave him over his military service 
his record as a mediocre student and other aspects of his background 
he was given a blue static jacket to wear during a tour of a 
tampa fla honeywell plant where highly sensitive components for 
the space shuttle and trident missile are made 
outside the indiana senator still had the jacket on when he 
addressed a rally 
i was given this static jacket and im going to use it when i 
hold my next news conference joked the senator who currently 
enjoys mostly friendly relations with the press and often comes back 
on the plane to chat with them 
later as he climbed the steps of his campaign plane quayle 
laughed down at the reporters watching him from the tarmac and waved 
the jacket pointing to them 
by the time most of the reporters came aboard from the back of 
the plane the jacket was hanging from above the first row of press 
seating

republicans and democrats cried foul thursday 
after president reagan despite a written pledge of support from his 
budget office said he would veto a bill that would protect federal 
employees who blow the whistle on government wrongdoing 
its outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion 
because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no 
longer have that an administrations word is good said the 
chief senate sponsor of the bill sen carl levin dmich 
the president said he would pocket veto the bill let it die 
by refusing to sign it while congress is out of session 
while the budget office pledged support for the bill attorney 
general dick thornburgh whose objections led to the veto decision 
said the justice department had expressed its concerns about the 
legislation to congress as recently as a week or two ago 
the constitutional objections that the department of justice 
conveyed to president reagan had been consistently conveyed to the 
congress throughout the course of consideration of this bill 
thornburgh told reporters 
but on oct 3 joseph r wright jr deputy director of the 
office of management and budget wrote rep frank horton rny 
and chief house sponsor rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
i would like to congratulate you on the fine work you have done 
over the last eight months to develop the whistleblower protection 
act of 1988 wright wrote horton while this bill does not 
include everything we wanted it will significantly improve 
protection for whistleblowers a goal which the administration 
shares with you 
after citing specific strengths of the bill wright concluded 
these new authorities are significant and i would like to thank 
you personally for the repeated efforts you have made to work with 
the administration on developing s508 
the house and senate had passed the bill without a dissenting 
vote following months of negotiations between congressional sponsors 
and the administration disgruntled lawmakers said thursday they 
thought the talks had produced a bill satisfactory to the 
administration 
asked whether the justice department had signed off on any 
compromise bill thornburgh said not to my knowledge 
asked whether wright got approval to make any deals with 
congress thornburgh said i dont know 
horton said he supported the bill only when i was assured of 
the administrations support 
horton called reagans decision a reprehensible act 
orchestrated after adjournment of the congress to prevent an 
override 
we worked with the administration far too closely for 
thornburgh and company to now suggest there are unresolved 
constitutional questions said sen charles grassley riowa 
but then this administration hasnt exactly a sterling record 
where whistleblowers are concerned 
grassley said he was outraged though not completely 
surprised 
one federal whistleblower nancy kusen of pittsburgh said of 
reagans decision i really thought it was a very bad move on his 
part it makes me sick 
she said the current lack of strong protection keeps people 
like myself from speaking out on fraud waste and abuse theres a 
lot of it around i mean a ton of it 
ms kusen a contract administrator for the defense contract 
audit agency said she was harassed and passed over for promotion 
after reporting some 8 million in overpricing by a contractor 
selling ship propulsion equipment to the navy 
she said the office of special counsel which investigates 
federal whistleblower cases took more than a year to investigate 
the retaliation she said that before the inquiry could be 
completed those she had accused of harassment left the agency and 
she dropped the complaint 
reagan said wednesday the bill would have allowed employees who 
are not genuine whistleblowers to manipulate the process to delay 
or avoid proper discipline 
reagan said the bill would have caused constitutional problems 
because it would have allowed executive branch agencies to go to 
court against each other the president has the power to resolve 
disputes between his subordinates he said 
i regret that the congress did not present me with 
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections 
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report 
fraud waste and abuse they discover in federal programs the 
president said in a statement 
the interests of both employees and managers should be fully 
protected the president said he pledged to submit his own bill 
in january when congress returns 
sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the 
office of special counsel established to represent the interests of 
whistleblowers was not doing its job 
the bill would have made the office of special counsel an 
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of 
protecting whistleblowers the office now is part of the merit 
systems protection board and at times it has acted against 
whistleblowers who came to the office for help

president reagans national security adviser 
colin powell on thursday credited soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev for pushing economic reform but said it remains to be 
seen how much improvement can be made under a communist oneparty 
system 
powell an army lieutenant general said it has become clear 
however that the soviets have chosen to pursue a policy of 
declining adventurism in foreign policy so they can focus energies 
and resources on internal economic reform 
the bold new leadership in the kremlin has candidly 
acknowledged the problems the soviet system faces powell said in 
a speech prepared for delivery to the national press club but the 
problems are fundamental even structural 
soviet officials in moscow on thursday said they will begin 
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the 
nations economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach 58 
billion next year 
finance minister boris gostev told the supreme soviet legislature 
that gorbachevs government is finding it difficult to bring deficit 
spending under control 
in his speech powell took his audience on a tour of world 
trouble spots saying resistance forces fighting communism and 
totalitarians have made great strides in afghanistan angola and 
cambodia but powell said the push for freedom in nicaragua has 
lagged at least in part because of divisions within the united 
states on support for the contra rebels 
he said a principal lesson to be learned from the various 
regional conflicts is that american foreign policy has tended to 
succeed in instances in which us support was unquestioned he said 
this included afghanistan where the soviets have begun pulling out 
forces that have occupied the southwest asian nation since 1979 but 
were fought continuously by the mujahedeen resistance 
the soviets are correctly reassessing their past foreign 
policy including their adventurism in the 1970s as a series of 
mistakes powell said because they and their allies were unable 
to consolidate their gains 
one lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see 
the futility of war to see diplomatic solutions he said but 
the deeper lesson is that effective resistance to aggression is what 
demonstrates the futility of war 
of the changing political climate in the soviet union he said 
essentially perestroika is an acknowledgment of the failure of 
the soviet system to provide for its people whether it can be fixed 
as long as it remains a communist oneparty system remains to be 
seen 
but powell also said that gorbachev who recently took on the 
additional title of president of the soviet union with the 
retirement of andrei gromyko is facing problems with restive 
nationalities in the soviet union and around the soviet empire 
this he said is going to preoccupy moscow more than anyone 
anticipated 
there is little we can do to affect the soviet unions internal 
evolution said powell who plans to resume his active duty 
military career when reagans term ends jan 20 we can encourage 
steps that are clearly improvements in soviet internal political 
practice even if they do not correspond fully to what we know as 
democracy 
reagan on wednesday voiced hope that gorbachev would free 
remaining political prisoners in the soviet union as west german 
chancellor helmut kohl had indicated following talks with kremlin 
officials 
our adversaries face a systemic crisis powell said they 
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it 
without changing it wholesale it is not yet clear whether they can 
succeed 
the immediate problem theyre facing is an economic system that 
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century he 
said in answer to a question from the audience 
powell said the soviets will be left behind in global 
economic competition unless they make the necessarty adjustments

seven latin american presidents on 
thursday demanded a new dialogue with the united states and 
other developed lands on foreign debt drug trafficking strife in 
central america and other topics 
all suggested that foreign debts be renegotiated brazil alone 
owes 121 billion 
speaking forcefully and at times with bitterness and anger the 
presidents said in separate speeches that their calls were prompted 
by economic stagnation at home and rising public discontent 
they said they believe the developed countries particularly the 
united states either contribute to their problems or can help in 
some way they have not so far attempted 
president alan garcia of peru got a standing ovation when he 
said the american people should know that a latin america that is 
disunited is not a good neighbor that a latin america that is 
impoverished is not a good market 
garcia spoke before an inaugural ceremony audience of about 500 
diplomats and guests at the second meeting of the socalled group of 
eight now only seven minus panama 
mexican president miguel de la madrid declared budget 
adjustments austerity programs and economic stagnation have made

in the closing days of the 
presidential race george bush keeps telling audiences im running 
like im 10 points behind actually hes running the 
playitsafe nosurprises campaign of a frontrunner 
major polls indicate bush is well ahead of democratic rival 
michael dukakis and bush is not tampering with what has proven to 
be a successful formula of bashing dukakis as a diehard liberal who 
is weak on crime soft on defense and apt to raise taxes 
this election is far from over bush told an audience of 
several hundred people at a stockyard rally in sioux falls sd 
youve seen those national surveys but let me tell you something 
i am going to continue to run like i am 10 points behind right down 
to the wire standing on the issues 
bush added i am determined to win this election i am not 
going to let up i am not going to refuse to campaign ill keep 
going as far and as fast as is required 
at the same time hes apparently also working to maximize 
republican chances in several races for the senate where democrats 
are trying to protect their current 5446 advantage 
hes visiting nebraska on saturday a state where he holds a huge 
lead over dukakis but where gop sen david karnes trails in his 
reelection bid 
he went to montana on wednesday where hes in a close race but 
for a payoff of only four electoral votes republican senate 
challenger conrad burns is trailing narrowly in private gop surveys 
there 
and bushs stop in washington on thursday was designed not only 
to boost his own chances in a tight state but also to help senate 
candidate slade gorton who is also locked in a tight race 
bush acknowledges hes not going to try anything new in the 
homestretch of the campaign and he hasnt hell probably keep 
talking about the same themes that hes been talking about said 
craig fuller who is bushs chief of staff 
among the states where bush is making appearances this week are 
ohio michigan california and illinois electoral giants crucial 
to the outcome of the nov 8 contest 
were going to focus on states where we think the support is 
soft where the margin isclose said fuller 
were pleased and encouraged by the polls but we are going to 
continue to work to make sure weve locked up the necessary 
electoral votes fuller said 
yet bush also shows up in places like williston vt where he 
told a firehouse rally things look pretty good nationally 
the very fact that he was spending time in vermont which offers 
a total of just three electoral votes suggests bush is not worrying 
too much he could have spent that time in big battleground states 
bush also went to connecticut 8 electoral votes south dakota 
3 and montana 4 not because he needed them but at least partly 
because they are states in michael dukakis calculus of how to win 
the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the white house 
why not wreak havoc with that stratgy said rich bond bushs 
national political director and deputy campaign manager he 
dukakis has to take some states out of our political base and i 
would be hardpressed to name one 
talking about his visit to billings mont after a stop earlier 
in the day in sioux falls bush said it shows that we are taking 
absolutely nothing for granted 
at a strategy meeting after the oct 13 presidential debate in 
los angeles bush campaign chairman james a baker iii told the 
senior staff that their biggest problem was to avoid overconfidence 
nevertheless while dukakis was busy on the campaign trail last 
sunday bush was resting at home in washington so too was his 
running mate sen dan quayle 
tentative plans call for bush to be in washington again this 
sunday relaxing for the final eightday push 
uncharacteristically bush made an effort in one speech this week 
to respond briefly to dukakis charges of lies and distortions in 
gop campaign advertisements usually bush just ignores duckakis 
attacks 
having dealt with the issue once bush quickly turned the job of 
responding over to a team of campaign advisers at a washington news 
conference 
unlike dukakis bush turned down an invitation to appear on a 
90minute session of abcs nightline bush also has ignored 
similar interview bids from cbs and nbc which were grabbed up by 
dukakis bush spokeswoman sheila tate says the cbs and nbc offers 
are good until the election but she doubts the vice president will 
accept them 
borrowing a chapter from president reagans campaign book bush 
has largely insulated himself from the press minimizing chances for 
miscues and gaffes that would detract from his campaign message 
typically bush makes three campaign appearances a day the first 
event usually is the one that provides the latest twist on a 
wellworn book of political rhetoric and attack lines 
the second and third events of the day usually are rallies where 
bush delivers his timetested stump speech with lines such as the 
liberal governor is simply out of step with the american people my 
values are your values 
bush quickly follows up by attacking dukakis on hotbutton 
issues gun control the death penalty abortion the pledge of 
allegiance and dukakis membership in the american civil liberties 
union

workers stayed away from their jobs at two banana plantations owned 
by the united brands fruit company

were met 
the workers want raises paid vacations job security christmas 
bonuses and an extra months pay every year the union has not said 
how large the raises should be for its members who now are paid an

michael dukakis campaign said thursday it is 
doubling its budget for hispanic ads with most of the money 
earmarked for a radio blitz in seven states with large and still 
fluid hispanic voter populations 
the announcement from rep bill richardson dnm heading the 
democratic presidential nominees drive for hispanic votes came the 
same day jesse jackson began urging a vote for dukakis in spots on 
radio stations with black listeners 
the dukakis campaign is spending about 3 million 10 percent of 
its media budget on blackoriented television and radio 
advertising which began three weeks ago jackson has recorded five 
radio ads 
we have the power to make mike dukakis president lets use 
it he says in one of them more people have fallen into the 
deep hole of poverty because of republican policies he says in 
another 
dukakis who is fluent in spanish started running tv ads in 
spanish on two national hispanic networks univision and telemundo 
last week one stresses education another drugs and a third his 
immigrant heritage all three end with the tagline he speaks our 
language 
richardson said thursday the hispanic ad budget will be expanded 
from 500000 to 1 million he said threequarters of the new money 
will go for radio saturation in texas california new mexico 
colorado illinois new york and new jersey the three new spots 
were scheduled to start friday 
the dukakis campaign believes hispanics can provide the margin of 
victory nov 8 if they turn out in force and vote democratic but 
republican george bush is counting on cubanamerican support in 
florida and is not ceding hispanic votes elsewhere 
the new dukakis radio offensive does not include florida where 
bush holds a huge lead and richardson said dukakis has had trouble 
making inroads with cubanamerican voters 
and bush was scheduled friday to receive the endorsement of el 
informador hispano a hispanic newspaper in fort worth the 
endorsement editorial praised bush for being tough on crime and 
drug dealers it also says that like most hispanics he believes 
abortion is wrong except in case of rape or danger to the mothers 
life 
bush is running a texas tv ad featuring his hispanic 
daughterinlaw columba who is married to his son jeb and the 
couples three children the ad running in both english and 
spanish concludes with the vice president saying hell have a lot 
of reasons to help hispanics everywhere because ill not only be 
answering to my grandchildren ill be answering to history 
in other media developments 
four new dukakis spots unveiled earlier this week combining a 
populist on your side pitch with the vow that the best america 
is yet to come started thursday in spot markets across the 
country 
the california democratic party said it had begun airing two ads 
aimed at turning out younger voters for the democratic ticket the 
spots in markets around the state attack the gop record on education 
and the environment 
bush spokesman mark goodin said the campaign had temporarily 
shelved a 60second version of a 30second tank ad mocking 
dukakis tank ride photo opportunity as a narrator lists weapons 
systems allegedly opposed by the democrat goodin called the 
expanded version devastating and said bush who holds a 
doubledigit lead in most polls would not bring out the heavy 
artillery unless it is needed

solidarity leader lech walesa demanded 
thursday that talks between the government and opposition begin 
without preconditions and called on the authorities to clarify the 
prospects for union pluralism 
we demand that talks begin without preconditions and without 
intervention but we cannot open the talks at any price walesa 
said at a news conference 
walesa met earlier with three of his most senior solidarity 
advisers one of whom expressed doubt over the future of the talks 
which are to consider the future of the banned union and broader 
issues of political and economic reform 
i must say that today i am very pessimistic i could say that 
perhaps the round table is over without a start but you know that 
in all countries everything can change said andrzej 
stelmachowski a law professor and opposition mediator 
government objections to two members of the solidarity delegation 
delayed the start of the talks but walesa said again thursday he 
would not change his team 
walesa on tuesday refused a government demand he meet with 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak to clear final obstacles to 
the talks the government said they could begin friday if walesa 
agreed to meet kiszczak 
stelmachowski said kiszczak was asked thursday to make a 
statement declaring the governments intentions on the prospects for 
pluralism and the future of solidarity 
this morning they refused to make such a declaration the 
situation is very bad stelmachowski said 
walesa noted a change in the authorities attitude toward the 
talks i see a lack of political will to solve the problems that 
divide us he said 
he agreed to take part in the talks at a meeting with kiszczak on 
aug 31 while strikes continued in polands worst labor unrest in 
seven years 
after being guaranteed the talks would include the subject of 
solidaritys future walesa called a halt to the strikes he had 
joined striking workers at the gdansk shipyard during the first 
strike wave in april and again in august 
walesa accused the authorities of bad faith by failing to 
reinstate more than 100 miners fired in the silesia region after 
strikes in midaugust 
the official news agency pap carried an interior ministry 
statement saying kiszczak had urged managements to rehire dismissed 
workers and asked prosecutors to drop proceedings against strike 
leaders 
it said he was urgently collecting information about 
individual cases brought to his attention by the roman catholic 
church 
this proves that no political repressions are being used 
and the appeals of gen kiszczak are being gradually implemented 
the ministry declared 
in response to questions walesa said more strikes are possible 
unless the workers are rehired and the promise of roundtable talks 
is fulfilled 
people who were fighting then are ready now again he said 
i am ready to jump over the fence for the third time although we 
dont want it 
walesa also complained about government attempts to interfere in 
the composition of solidaritys delegation 
the government has objected to the participation of regime 
critics adam michnik and jacek kuron whom it says do not respect 
polands constitutional order which guarantees a leading role of 
the communist party 
government spokesman jerzy urban on tuesday called on the two men 
to publically declare their respect for the constitutional order 
walesa has refused to drop the two men from his team 
walesa met thurdsay with historian bronislaw geremek and 
journalist tadeusz mazowiecki in addition to stelmachowski 
the advisers say it seems the real obstacle is not the 
particpants but the authorities lack of clarity on the future of 
solidarity 
what walesa said at the beginning means all the problems are 
blocked because there is no answer to the basic question its not 
the pretext but the question of the lack of political will to solve 
the central problem of the legalization of solidarity geremek 
said 
walesa and his advisers appear worried that chances for the talks 
are diminishing as time elapses 
we have no time and we dont want empty words talks are 
already late walesa said 
a communique earlier this week said the politburo was committed 
to the talks and expressed hope that remaining controversies will 
be quickly removed in the course of preparatory talks 
urbans office did not return a phone call requesting comment on 
the future of the talks

the yearold northern state prison 
mrs martin was released at 134 pm and ms mason was taken 
from the library on a stretcher at 406 pm ending nearly seven 
hours as a hostage 
negotiators spent hours talking through a metal mesh window to 
the inmates who used the women as shields 
there were repeated threats that they were prepared to do 
violence to the hostages said gary hilton deputy corrections 
commissioner he said the women were emotionally battered but 
not physically harmed 
the only demands from inmates angel guzman 26 and edward 
robinson 27 were that they be transferred to a federal prison 
outside new jersey and that officials take no reprisals for the 
hostage taking said corrections spokesman james stabile 
the negotiators agreed that the grievances of the two inmates 
would be reviewed hilton said robinson also asked to be allowed 
to call his mother a demand hilton said would be granted 
he said guzman and robinson will be transferred thursday to 
another state prison 
mrs martins husband isaac said in a telephone interview that 
he learned of his wifes plight from a noon radio broadcast i 
just had to pray that it would come to a happy ending martin said 
hilton described the inmates as longtime friends who had been 
imprisoned at riverfront state prison in camden before being 
transferred to northern state prison about two weeks ago 
guzman of woodbine was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1982 
for murdering his uncle during an argument over 70 robinson of 
camden was sentenced to life in prison in 1979 for shooting his 
victim in the back of the head prison records did not give details 
of the case

about 1000 inmates in six twostory units the 18 million complex 
opened in may 1987 
newark mayor sharpe james who went to the prison after learning 
of the hostage taking said he was unaware that the lockup housed 
murderers the state has two maximum security prisons near rahway 
and trenton 
hilton said it was not unusual for murderers to be kept at a 
medium security prison

robert strauss cochairman of the national 
economic commission has told business executives that he believes 
his panel will support a 120 billion deficit reduction package 
split evenly between budget cuts and increased taxes one of the 
executives said thursday 
john sloan president of the national federation of independent 
business said strauss told the business leaders at a dinner in new 
york city on wednesday that he thinks he has nine votes on the 
12member commission for a combination of 60 billion in government 
spending cuts and 60 billion in tax increases to close the budget 
gap 
however james hildreth a spokesman for the commission quoted 
strauss as terming sloans version of the meeting totally 
inaccurate 
all he said at the dinner was that the most support he could 
hope to get for any program would probably be eight or nine votes 
out of the current 12 members hildreth said but he denies 
saying in any way shape or form what the final package will be 
the commission was created by congress to come up with 
recommendations on eliminating the federal budget deficit which 
totaled an estimated 150 billion for the fiscal year which ended 
sept 30 
the commission hopes to begin taking votes on different options 
after the nov 8 election when the presidentelect will name the 
final two members to the panel the panel has set a deadline of 
finishing its work by dec 21 
sloan president of an association of 500000 small businesses 
told reporters at a briefing thursday that strauss had indicated he 
believed the commission would approve a deficit reduction package 
amounting to 120 billion split evenly between increased taxes and 
budget cuts 
sloan said strauss said he personally supported a vale added tax 
as a way of raising revenues 
the vat which has been adopted by several european countries is 
a form of sales tax the tax is added to a product at various stages 
of the production process a 5 percent value added tax could raise 
an estimated 50 billion in new revenues annually 
sloan said his group was adamantly opposed to a vat in part 
because of the added paperwork burdens involved in administering 
such a tax 
however he said he believed it would be one of the options the 
commission would seriously consider because of the strong backing it 
has among lobbyists for big corporations who believe such a tax 
would ease the pressure on congress to boost corporate taxes 
but hildreth said strauss has not expressed any preferences for a 
vat or any other type of tax

democrat michael dukakis drew 
inspiration from that feisty little guy harry truman on thursday 
and charged george bush with trying to masquerade a tax break for 
the rich as a jobs program 
the democratic presidential nominee invoked trumans battling 
underdog memory across the midwest as he pressed his argument that 
bush is an elitist whose proposal to reduce the federal tax on 
capital gains would benefit primarily the wealthy 
he said it was a jobs program dukakis said whos he 
kidding 
what are they going to do with the extra money hire a second 
butler a lifeguard for the pool 
dukakis spoke to supporters in the chicago suburb of evergreen 
park ill and in machesney park outside rockford ill before 
flying to kansas city mo for a live interview on the cbs evening 
news 
the interview was part of dukakis effort to revive his 
struggling campaign by taking advantage of opportunities to speak 
directly to the voters through television he was also taping an 
interview with david frost to appear later 
he had a questionandanswer session with citizens in 
independence mo hometown of the late former president whose 
victory in the 1948 election over republican thomas dewey confounded 
the pollsters 
were going to kansas city and then to independence to draw 
inspiration from that feisty little guy dukakis said 
harry truman was a fighter and so am i and so are you he 
said the republicans are trying to do in this campaign exactly 
what they tried to do to harry truman and jack kennedy distort the 
record try to put labels on people but were not going to let them 
do it 
dukakis after several days of discouraging polls appeared 
energized by large enthusiastic crowds and by a reunion with his 
wife kitty who had been campaigning separately for several days 
bushs tax proposal has become an object of dukakis scorn at 
every campaign stop as he depicts it as providing a 30000 tax 
break for someone making more than 200000 a year although the 
benefit would depend on an individuals capital gains such as 
profits from the sale of stock or property 
he focused on bushs assertion a day earlier that a reduction in 
the maximum rate on capital gains to 15 percent would encourage the 
investment of capital and thus create jobs 
dukakis said the proposal was halloween come early a treat 
for the wealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us 
thats not the way were going to create good quality jobs in 
this country dukakis said 
this is classic republican trickledown economics he said 
give the people at the top the money and hope a few crumbs fall 
off the table for the rest of us 
dukakis aides distributed a statement saying bushs claims for 
the tax cut grow more fantastic and calling his assertion a 
lie dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach later said the 
campaign based its statement on an associated press report wednesday 
that report erroneously quoted bush as saying most capital 
gains are realized by people who earn less than 50000 a year a 
statement about the value of gains realized rather than the number 
of people claiming such gains in fact bush said the majority of 
capital gains recipients earn less than 50000 a year and the cut 
will create jobs 
in illinois dukakis leveled new criticism at bush for a 
regulatory relief task force that the vice president headed and 
which dukakis said sought to roll back worker safety regulations he 
cited the death of a chemical worker after the task force told 
osha to ease up on the kind of inspections being made in plants like 
his 
and they talk about a kinder gentler nation dukakis said 
using a favorite bush line in a dukakisbentsen admininstration 
were going to put safety first and people first

the us decision to rebuild its embassy in moscow 
is based on unsubstantiated charges that the facility is riddled 
with listening devices the official soviet news agency said 
thursday 
tass said in a dispatch from washington that both countries will 
suffer because opening new embassies in both capitals will be 
delayed 
earlier thursday president reagan said he recommended that the 
new us embassy in moscow be razed and rebuilt because theres no 
way to rid it of the many listening devices that were built into 
it 
were going to start and have an americanbuilt one reagan 
said of the embassy 
tass in the first soviet reaction to the us decision said the 
spying allegations were unproven 
the soviet side was again presented with groundless obviously 
farfetched charges of us state sovereignty having been 
outraged the news agency said 
just as in previous cases however the us administration did 
not provide any material proof to back up those claims this time as 
well 
us state department spokesman charles redman repeatedly 
declined to tell reporters what devices the united states discovered 
in the new structure or how they were installed because its never 
in anyones interest to let the other guy know what you know 
tass said the american taxpayer will suffer because of the extra 
cost of rebuilding the moscow diplomatic outpost 
without giving figures redman said tearing down the existing 
structure and building a new one under high security conditions will 
involve a very elaborate and costly process 
us inspectors first discovered eavesdropping bugs in

the federal aviation administration received 
permission thursday to offer pay bonuses next year to air traffic 
controllers and other personnel at hardtostaff facilities in 
chicago new york and los angeles 
the office of personnel management has approved what the faa 
described as a demonstration project testing whether incentives 
will attract qualified employees to unattractive assignments 
about 2000 faa employees in the three metropolitan areas will be 
eligible to receive an additional allowance of up to 20 percent of 
their basic pay under the fiveyear test program transportation 
secretary james burnley said 
the faa cited bonuses as part of its plans to ease pressure on 
overworked controllers at the nations busiest airport ohare 
international in chicago 
ohare controllers have had 30 flighthandling errors this year 
compared with 12 mistakes in all of 1987 and their previous record 
of 22 in 1986 
this project should make it possible for the faa to achieve 
full staffing at facilities where living costs highly complex 
operations or other factors have made them less attractive locations 
for employees to move to burnley said 
the law under which opm approved the bonuses requires a 180day 
waiting period to give congress time to review its decision so the 
incentives cannot begin until may said the agencys director 
constance horner 
however sen paul simon dill said he would introduce 
legislation in january to waive the waiting period because more 
experienced controllers are needed at ohare 
more than 60 percent of the employees eligible for the bonus pay 
will be controllers the faa said the rest are safety inspectors 
and the technicians who service and maintain airtraffic control 
computers and other equipment 
the faa said facilities chosen for incentives include air route 
traffic control centers at chicago and new york control towers and 
terminal radar approach control centers at ohare and los angeles 
international airport terminal radar approach centers at new york 
and santa anna calif and flight standards district offices at los 
angeles farmingdale ny valley stream ny and teterboro nj

the americansoviet rescue of two whales off alaska 
was an example of superpower cooperation that should include helping 
people government spokesman gennady i gerasimov said thursday 
two soviet icebreakers cut a channel in thick ice off northern 
alaska on wednesday allowing the whales to start their long journey 
to their winter home off baja california 
millions of soviets learned of the success on the evening 
television news program vremya which has covered the story for at 
least a week 
in a report sandwiched between news of sports and the weather an 
announcer said 
and one more piece of news soviet ships with the assistance 
of american specialists and numerous volunteers freed two gray 
california whales who had been taken prisoners of ice off the shores 
of alaska 
television showed the whales swimming freely the soviet 
icebreakers and helicopters overhead 
the announcer then said the whales had stopped moving apparently 
because slivers of ice blocked their way and the soviet ships would 
try to clear the channel friday 
us officials said the whales still were some distance from open 
sea in the path cleared by the icebreakers admiral makarov and 
vladimir arseniev 
at an earlier news briefing that focused on the weightier matters 
of arms control and civil war in afghanistan gerasimov turned 
attention to the whales 
the united states and us weve saved those unfortunate 
whales he said theres now a path broken down in the ice and 
we hope that the whales will go the way theyre supposed to that is 
towards the gulf of mexico the coast of mexico although the 
reports show that they now seem to be very dependent on the 
foodstuffs they get there 
while reporters chuckled he praised the international rescue as 
an example of superpower cooperation 
weve done all we could to save them and it would be good if 
the united states and the soviet union acted in such a concerted way 
when whats involved is the saving of human life gerasimov said 
the concern for the whales is a change of position for the soviet 
union which killed hundreds of the mammals in violation of 
international agreements 
in april the soviets followed up on informal pledges and 
officially notified the united states it had stopped commerical 
whaling the international whaling commission to which the soviet 
union belongs ordered commercial killing of whales to stop in 1986

natos defense ministers tried to 
unravel a snag in talks thursday after belgium balked at joining a 
call for modernizing shortrange nuclear weapons 
the recommendation is contained in a report prepared by 
highlevel defense officials from nato nations the study details a 
continuing need for shortrange nuclear arms now that the 
superpowers have agreed to scrap mediumrange nuclear weapons 
in december the united states and the soviet union signed the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty that pact will eliminate 
in three years all us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges 
from about 300 miles to 3400 miles 
officials said participants at this weeks talks were trying to 
gain belgian endorsement of the classified report presented to us 
defense secretary frank carlucci and defense chiefs from 14 other 
nations in the north atlantic treaty organization they were meeting 
at a resort outside the hague netherlands 
belgian defense minister guy coeme told a belgian radio station 
wednesday night he intended to ring the alarm bell about the 
report 
foreign minister leo tindemans said in an interview with a 
brussels daily the report might set the stage for a final decision 
to moderize shortrange nuclear arms i think we can wait with 
that he said 
dan plesch director of the british american security information 
council said the report by highlevel defense officials was 
worrisome 
just when you thought you were safe with the 
intermediaterange treaty along comes a lot more missiles and the 
idea that you can have limited nuclear war he said 
the issue of modernizing shortrange weapons is controversial in 
europe where critics argue the weapons would likely be used on 
their soil because of their range under 300 miles 
however several ministers at the talks said thursday that 
belgiums objections were minor and that it would eventually approve 
the report 
british defense minister george younger said the belgian position 
was extraordinarily close to the other positions 
a summary of the report made available by the security 
information council said it outlined several options for 
restructuring natos nuclear forces 
copies of the summary also were released by the campaign fpr 
nuclear disarmament based in london which opposes nuclear weapons 
and led the fight against deploying mediumrange missiles in britain 
efforts to reach belgian officials for comment were not 
successful 
the report generally recommends a continued role in nato strategy 
of shortrange nuclear forces 
it calls for continuing support for us and british efforts to 
develop a new longer range tactical airtosurface missile that 
could be fired at soviet air defenses from fighter planes 
the report also backs us efforts to develop a replacement for 
the lance surfacetosurface nuclear missile which military 
analysts say will be obsolete by 1995 
the defense ministers gather twice a year to discuss nuclear 
strategy fourteen of natos 16 members take part with iceland 
attending as an observer france operates outside natos military 
structure 
no final decision on modernization of the weapons was expected 
until next year at the earliest officials said

horseshoelike game with a cousin outside a neighbors house the 
object of the game is to toss the darts which have 4inchlong

ordering the government to ban the sale of lawn darts a game that 
is blamed for the deaths of three children and injuries to thousands

the leading us citizens group on the 
united nations said thursday that the world body is in need of major 
changes and that the next administration in washington should make 
un reform a top priority 
the report released by the united nations association of the 
united states and its chairman elliot l richardson lamented that 
usun relations are in disarray and urged the next 
administration to pay us arrears of more than 400 million 
with the un enjoying renewed credibility as it brings some of 
the worlds most bitter conflicts to an end the prospects for 
un purposeful global action are brighter than at any time in 
recent history it said a new realism in both the third world 
and the soviet union has created new opportunities for international 
cooperation in the un but also americas own relations with the 
un are in disarray richardson a former us attorney general 
and defense secretary noted in the report 
the disarray results from us nonpayment and withholding of its 
budget dues which the united states is legally obliged to pay 
in addition the reagan administration has been estranged from 
the organization for nearly eight years accusing it of antiwestern 
bias a bloated bureaucracy and wasteful spending reagan has balked 
at giving up any us prerogatives to act for itself in favor of 
multilateral solutions 
the administration acknowledged however that the 159member 
world body has instituted major reforms and made dramatic 
contributions to conflict resolution from afghanistan to the 
iraniraq war 
the united nations association of the united states is a 
nonpartisan nationwide organization with more than 20000 members 
its recommendations are based on public meetings in about 100 
communities 
its report made about 85 specific recommendations including 
changing the general assembly voting system and enlarging security 
council membership 
it said the next us administration should increase us 
participation in the united nations and should not try to reduce its 
25 percent share of the budget it should instead use its financial 
leverage to make the united nations more effective in promoting both 
us interests and world peace 
the report found many un decisionmaking bodies too unwieldy to 
be effective forums for negotiations it said washington should 
insist on reforms that would enhance the un system as the center 
for resolving global problems 
the study said the united states should make sure that un 
budgetary reforms adopted in 1986 are implemented and result in 
greater efficiency in use of un resources 
it said the united states should renew its campaign for 
weighted voting on budgetary issues in the general assembly 
effectively giving the united states and major donors a greater say 
in how their funds are spent but it said weight also should 
consider a nations population 
the report said the 15member security council should be 
restructured to include a category of semipermanent members 
representing major powers in each region this might warrant an 
increase of up to four members in council size 
the council also should meet at least once a year at foreign 
minister level and defense ministers also should meet periodically 
it said 
the councils military staff committee should be revitalized and 
oversee limited joint military exercises among the five permament 
members a sign of their willingness to collaborate in guaranteeing 
international peace and security the five are the united states 
the soviet union china britain and france they traditionally play 
no part in peacekeeping operations 
the study proposed that the council look into establishment of a 
training program for countries that contribute troops to un 
peacekeeping forces it said un members should establish a reserve 
fund under the security council to cover initial outlays of new 
peacekeeping missions 
among other recommendations 
creation of a multilateral drug enforcement assistance unit 
within the united nations 
establishment of a un elections commission to monitor and 
conduct free elections at the request of individual nations 
an international ban on chemical weapons with the united states 
and soviet union assuming the bulk of verification 
an international convention on environment and development 
an international tribunal to rule on disputed drug trafficking 
cases 
a ministerial board at the helm of the economic and social 
council to oversee un responses to emerging economic 
environmental and social problems 
and it said the un secretarygeneral should guard against 
demands by member states for political appointments 
the report is entitled pulling together a program for america

yorkbased association 24 years ago to foster better understanding

when colonial patriots tossed 342 chests of tea 
into boston harbor they thought they had rid the city of the 
symbols of tyranny but now an explorer says he has located the 
dump site and wants to salvage the chests 
barry clifford who located the first pirate ship found in the 
new world four years ago appeared thursday before the state board 
of underwater archaeological resources for permission to survey the 
tea party site 
boston harbor is an archaeological site clifford said in his 
presentation to the board in this day and age when we have 
knowledge of whats at the bottom of the harbor its too bad not to 
plan so we dont put a tunnel through a 17th century shipwreck 
the board however tabled his bid for a reconnaissance permit 
which would have awarded clifford and his team exclusive rights to 
survey a nautical square mile in boston harbor officials asked 
clifford to return for the boards next session dec 1 with more 
details about the site 
acting board director jim bradley said the explorer must provide 
more specific proof that he has found the location of the tea party 
chests before the board awards him exclusive rights until then 
bradley said clifford and his team are free to electronically scan 
the harbor but will not be given an exclusive right to the area 
clifford said at the meeting that he did not include specific 
data about the site in his permit application because of a security 
risk in publicizing the area 
clifford president of maritime explorations inc in chatham 
surprised skeptics when he found the treasureladen whydah off the 
coast of cape cod in 1984 and brought up the ships bell 
still experts have doubts about cliffords latest venture 
paul johnston curator of marine history at the peabody museum in 
salem and a maritime archaeologist is dubious about cliffords 
claim that the tea crates were elaborate chinese chests johnston 
said the museum has similar ornate chinese boxes but said that they 
were gift boxes he said he doubts that the british would have 
exported tea in fancy containers 
they were probably standard wooden crates said johnston 
johnston also said that he recently learned the site of the tea 
dumping was at griffins wharf which lies considerably inland from 
todays boston harbor the wharf is now located beneath a concrete 
pad under a boston edison substation he said 
it seems unrealistic to think he could find the tea chests 
now said johnston the whole landscape of the harbor has 
changed since then 
clifford and his team have been researching the harbor for 18 
months and hope to look for shipwrecks as well as the tea party 
chests he wants to examine what he believes is the tea party site 
with the maritime explorer his 166foot excavation ship 
the boston tea party commenced just after dusk on dec 16 1773 
when 30 patriots angered over king george iiis threepenny tax on 
a pound of tea raided three ships the eleanor the dartmouth and 
the beaver 
disguised as indians the patriots located the crates in the 
ships hold brought them on deck opened them and pitched them 
overboard

airing negative campaign commercials to divert attention from 
reaganbush administration failures 
the pollsters daily tidings were good once again for bush who 
was reported leading 51 percent to 42 percent in a nationwide survey 
taken for nbc and the wall street journal new polls also showed a 
tight race in new york one of the countrys most democratic 
bastions 
dukakis made his way toward harry trumans home town of 
independence mo likening himself to the feisty little guy who 
won the white house four decades ago in a storied upset harry 
truman was a fighter and so am i he said 
in a 14minute live interview on the cbs evening news 
dukakis said again and again he wants to put the government on the 
side of average americans 
the democrat also conceded that bush commercials depicting him as 
weak on crime defense and the environment had done him political 
harm but he said they were also intended to to divert public 
attention from the fact that this administration has probably had 
more corruption and malfeasance than any in recent memory if not in 
history 
this is not about who puts together the best commercials or 
best advertising he said its about which one of us mike 
dukakis or george bush has the strength and the values to run this 
country 
bush continued his weeklong emphasis on economic issues as he 
made his way down the pacific coast from washington to california 
along the way he accused dukakis of trying to fan the flames of 
protectionism in comments on trade and of trying to scare the 
american people by putting japanese flags on these american 
commercials of his 
bush won the endorsement of the 50000member marine engineers 
beneficial association at a rally interrupted by protesters four 
were hustled away including one whose nose was bloodied and bush 
paused in his speech long enough to remind them of the high interest 
rates that prevailed at the end of the carter administration 
this election is all about creating jobs and opportunity he 
said promising to keep the economic expansion alive 
he briefly added an endorsement from the columbus ohio naacp to 
his union support but that was before the groups president 
reluctantly reversed course under pressure from national 
headquarters melanie j mitchell said she was acting to avoid 
jeopardizing the chapters taxexempt status as a nonprofit 
organization 
the ninepoint lead found for bush in the nbcwall street journal 
poll was in keeping with what sources said were private soundings 
taken for the two candidates only 35 percent of those reponding to 
the public survey said they were pleased with their choices and 61 
percent said they wished other candidates were running the survey 
taken from 1285 likely voters had a margin of error of three 
percentage points 
dukakis campaign announced it would double its budget for 
advertisements targeted at hispanic voters to 1 million with most 
of the money earmarked for seven key states texas california new 
mexico colorado illinois new york and new jersey the 
announcement came the same day that radio stations began carrying 
paid democratic commercials in which jesse jackson urged a vote for 
dukakis 
both candidates filed reports with the federal government showing 
huge warchests going into the final few days of the election each 
candidate received 461 million in federal subsidies for the fall 
campaign and as of last week bush had 143 remaining while 
dukakis had a balance of nearly 199 million 
the campaign surrogates and understudies joined the chorus 12 
days before the election 
president reagan hailed the true grit of george bush and dan 
quayle as he embarked on a weeklong campaign swing aiming to help 
make sure the white house stays in republican hands 
you and i and george bush worked much too hard to cut your 
taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over 
again he said in little rock ark 
gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle was in north carolina 
where he renewed his pledge to assure college opportunity for all 
who want it but he offered no specifics saying he had spoken with 
bush about education issues in general but they havent sat 
down and discussed detailed proposals 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen told an 
audience in los angeles that us allies in europe and japan should 
pay a greater share of defending their own borders he also said 
dukakis was firmly committed to maintaining americas defense and 
said republican had twisted the truth to suggest otherwise 
dukakis campaigned in illinois and missouri and he ridiculed the 
idea thatbushs proposed capital gains tax cut was a jobs program 
he said bush wanted to give the people at the top the money and 
hope the crumbs fall off the table for the rest of us 
whos he kidding the democrat said what are they going to 
do with the extra money hire a second butler a lifeguard for the 
pool 
bush repeatedly emphasized his opposition to federal gun controls 
as he campaigned in the west his aides distributed copies of a 1976 
statement in which dukakis called for tight handgun restrictions 
the vice presidents morning appearance in washington state was 
interrupted by shouts of homes for the homeless and no more 
lies 
the vice president shrugged off the disruptions telling his 
cheering supporters that america needs a strong defense and a 
vibrant economy not the policies of the governor of 
taxachusetts

lloyd bentsen said thursday he wanted us 
allies in europe and japan to pick up a bigger share of the free 
worlds defense costs within the next four years 
bentsen speaking before the world affairs council said that the 
united states spends 65 percent of its output on the military that 
it can no longer afford to carry the burden for other nations and 
that allies strapped after world war ii can now afford to do more 
afterward at a news conference bentsen said it cost 35 
billion to protect japan they could pick up that tab he said 
though he does not support rearming japan 
european allies should also spend more to equalize the burden he 
said although he added that they were now doing more with their own 
troops 
in his speech bentsen said he and democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis were firmly committed to us defense 
strength but the republicans had twisted the truth to imply that 
governor dukakis is an apostle of military weakness 
thats just not so he said both parties plan to spend the 
same amount of money on defense but the democrats recognize that 
there are other threats to national security he said 
i would suggest that it will profit america little to gain the 
whole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of our 
economic capacity he said it will profit us little to be 
military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles and we 
are sitting ducks 
republican policies have turned the united states into an 
international debtor dependent on foreign investors to sustain an 
economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits he said 
the united states must be able to compete not only militarily 
but economically if it intends to maintain leadership in the free 
world and set an example for developing nations he told the 
council a private group of business and academic people 
taking questions from the group afterward bentsen said he 
supported some forgiveness of the international debt owed to us 
banks by mexico on a case by case basis but not as a nation as a 
whole mexico needs to be treated like a company that went 
bankrupt that pays part but not all on its obligations he said 
the council a los angeles based group is scheduled to hear 
president reagan on friday bentsen joked that he was warming them 
up for the president 
but he complained the republicans have found it useful to shape 
the discussion as if military strength were the sole touchstone of 
national strength they have twisted the truth to imply that 
governor dukakis is an apostle of military weakness 
the american people need to understand that michael dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen are firmly committed to us military strength he 
said any implication to the contrary is not just negative 
campaigning it is a misrepresentation of fact 
bentsen called for tough enforcement of the new trade bill which 
he helped push through the senate to open up new markets for us 
goods 
in addition he said investment in nonmilitary research and 
development needed to increase after being cut 23 percent during 
the reagan years 
while following a passive policy on trade our government 
unfortunately has countenanced retreats on other fronts as well 
he said our industrial and academic research base once the 
worlds foremost is losing ground he said 
in chico with a little help from actor rob lowe bentsen drew 
the biggest crowd of his campaign so far at a rally at california 
state university 
a crowd police estimated at 7000 students and local citizens 
heard bentsen continue his attacks against republican negative 
campaigning and call for the election to be a national referendm 
against mudslinging 
were going to turn this election around he said saying the 
democrats were coming back in the polls 
lowe told the crowd including young women who were 
enthusiastically screaming at the sight of the celebrity that the 
67yearold bentsen was a man for the young people the two were 
mobbed as they left the outdoor stage and the texas senator shook 
hands gave highfives and even kissed one woman student as he 
worked his way through the crowd 
local people said it was the first appearance there by a national 
candidate since john kennedy in 1960

an organization that monitors hate groups says 
neonazi skinhead gangs are a growing threat to minorities and 
homosexuals with the number of such gang members nearly doubling in 
the united states last year 
skinhead gangs found in 21 states also are increasingly 
establishing ties with such groups as the ku klux klan and the white 
aryan resistance the antidefamation league of the bnai brith 
said wednesday in a national report 
skinheads youths who shave their heads and preach hatred of 
minorities have taken part in virtually every recent important 
hate movement rally march and conference the report said 
skinhead membership nationally has swelled to 2000 according to 
the report with the majority of members as well as the most 
violent found in california skinheads have been blamed for the 
racially motivated killing of a san jose man and attacks on 
homosexuals in laguna beach 
the report hate crimes policies and procedures for law 
enforcement agencies was released in conjunction with a 
conference in los angeles sponsored by the league 
the organization an outgrowth of the jewish fraternal group 
bnai brith has surveyed antisemitic vandalism since 1960 and 
broadened its approach in 1979 with publication of an annual audit 
of antisemitic incidents based on information reported to league 
regional offices 
the report said all kinds of hate crimes should be identified and 
tallied nationwide so law enforcement agencies can determine whether 
special units and procedures are needed 
crimes motivated by hatred or bias because of the victims race 
religion sexual orientation ethnicity or national origin can have 
a more devastating effect than other crimes the report said 
hate crimes can have a special emotional and psychological 
impact thereby creating the potential for escalating violence 
and turmoil it said 
the report was written by midwest civil rights director michael 
lieberman steven m freeman director of the adl legal affairs 
department and associate director jill l kahn 
lieberman said in an interview that the most important question 
about hate crimes is whether the number is increasing stable or 
decreasing 
we believe that one of the real problems in addressing that is 
the lack of hard comparable and comprehensive data on the issue 
he said 
there are only a handful of law enforcement agencies in eight 
states that are required to keep statistics on hate crimes he said 
adding its anyones guess as to whether the numbers are going up 
or down

sen dan quayle is promising the chance 
for a college education to anyone who wants it under a george bush 
administration but admitted thursday he did not know how the 
republican presidential contender plans to make it happen 
i havent sat down and talked with george bush on this he 
told local reporters in asheville so i cant go in and tell you 
anything 
later thursday quayle campaigned in a hightechnology part of 
new jersey visiting an atampt long distance headquarters in 
bedminster 
there he spoke by satellite hookup to employees at 29 atampt 
facilities in the state 
on the way to the appearance a campaign staff bus collided with 
a school van and a number of children were taken to a local 
hospital for observation quayle arranged to visit the children 
he said the company represents the technological changes of the 
future adding anyone prepared to lead us into the 1990s and then 
into the 21st century must be prepared to harness this change to 
capture its spirit its momentum and its excitement so that we turn 
challenge into achievement 
quayle also told reporters asking him about homelessness he 
thinks there is enough lowincome housing in the country and the 
number of lowincome housing units has increased under reagan but 
that doesnt mean that is the only answer or solution quayle said 
he said he government should identify other factors contributing 
to homelessness and then work with state and local governments and 
the private sector on solutions 
on the question of higher education quayle repeated a comment 
that he made a day earlier in miami were going to make sure that 
a student that wants to go on to higher education will have that 
opportunity 
but he could give no specifics when reporters asked him what he 
dould do toward that goal 
he said he has spoken to bush about education issues in 
general but they havent sat down and discussed detailed 
proposals 
the remarks came on a campaign day in which he kept the 
rhetorical heat on democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
joked to a charlotte nc audience that dukakis was like the 
california whales that got trapped beneath an alaskan ice floe 
he said one eskimo told another the whales were named dukakis 
know what dukakis means the eskimo said hopelessly stuck 
in the ice 
although quayle generally dealt skillfully with hecklers 
throughout the day some supporters seemed to think he was going a 
bit too far in putting down a group of them by referring to the 
severely polluted boston harbor in dukakis home state of 
massachusetts the harbor is a centerpiece of bushs attack campaign 
against dukakis 
ever hear of boston harbor quayle asked the campus rally 
matter of fact i think boston harbor is right over here he 
said pointing to the produkakis signs 
ouch said one quayle supporter as a couple nearby groaned 
he dealt with a more boisterous crowd in syracuse ny where 
hecklers forced him to interrupt his speech the noise level rose 
when quayle supporters in the civic center tried to shout down the 
produkakis hecklers

president reagan returned to his home 
state on thursday and predicted that vice president george bush will 
win fair and square in the nov 8 election 
now that the game seems to have turned against them the 
liberals have started squealing that hes running a negative 
campaign reagan told a republican rally at the san diego sports 
arena 
well i hope the people of oakland will forgive me but that 
would be a little like the as complaining that the dodgers ran a 
negative world series the president said 
they didnt he told his southern california audience the 
dodgers won fair and square and come nov 8 the republicans are 
going to win fair and square too because they know we stand for the 
future and they know the opposition is liberal liberal liberal 
the crowd which assistant white house press secretary ben 
jarratt said was estimated at 11000 interrupted with frequent 
cheers and applause and waved small american flags as the president 
spoke a large banner reading we love nancy hung prominently in 
the center of the arena although mrs reagan traveled separately to 
california and missed the rally 
the san diego stop was the presidents first in california during 
a weeklong campaign swing he and first lady nancy reagan will take 
a weekend break at their ranch near santa barbara before he resumes 
campaigning the white house said reagan would vote by absentee 
ballot during the trip 
republicans count on the californian in the white house as a 
major factor in their hopes of garnering the states 47 electoral 
votes 
earlier at little rock ark reagan said americans should vote 
for the gop ticket as an act of selfdefense because democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis favors gun controls 
at springfield the president who once was a democrat courted 
votes for sen john danforth and other gop candidates in president 
trumans home state 
today harry trumans party is the republican party and its 
time to give that party a bigger stick in the congress and cut the 
liberals down to size reagan said 
we dont want a president who would raise taxes why elect a 
congress that would he asked we dont want a bigspending 
president why should we want a bigspending congress we dont want 
a president who would cut our defenses why vote for a congress that 
wants to do that 
the san diego speech marked the presidents second visit to his 
home state since the gop national convention in new orleans in 
midaugust during his previous visit in august reagan campaigned 
in orange county a center of gop conservatism south of los angeles 
nothing is more important in the california race than the 
turnout in orange county and northern san diego county and the 
inland empire said alan heslop a specialist in california voting 
patterns 
those are the great voterich areas for republican candidates 
in this state and to wheel reagan through the southland is to give 
encouragement to the party workers it is to gear up the turnout and 
the getoutthe vote drive he said 
it is also to raise money 
before his current swing reagans 21 political appearances in 13 
states since labor day had raised an estimated 88 million for 
national and state gop campaign treasuries 
before he returns to washington next wednesday he will rest at 
his santa barbara area ranch over the weekend and then speak in 
reno nev milwaukee and in another state the white house has not 
identified 
in arkansas with its six electoral votes reagan told his 
airport audience that america needs the strength the vision and 
the true grit of george bush and dan quayle 
reagan a former movie actor had previously evoked the memory of 
the john wayne film classic true grit in extolling his vice 
president but in little rock he extended the remark to include the 
youthful indiana senator who is bushs vice presidential running 
mate 
it was the only reference to quayle in the speech which was 
devoted largely to praising bushs record as vice president 
i have come to know george bush very well reagan said and 
i also know what is required to be president of the united states i 
know who should be the man at the desk and ladies and gentlemen 
george bush is the man 
you and i and george bush worked much too hard to cut your 
taxes to let our opponents come into office and raise them all over 
again he said so on nov 8 go into that polling booth and do 
some negative campaigning of your own the right kind of negative 
campaigning say no to new taxes and say yes to the republican 
ticket 
bush like reagan has vowed to oppose tax increases dukakis 
who has not said he will raise taxes has accused the bush campaign 
of negative campaigning that distorts his record

jessica hahns former pastor was indicted 
thursday on charges that he skimmed 90000 from his congregation 
and then tried to persuade ms hahn the churchs secretary to lie 
about it to a grand jury 
the rev eugene profeta 51 used the money to buy life 
insurance buy stocks in his wifes name pay for family functions 
and finance gambling junkets to atlantic city in a churchowned 
plane according to the charges handed up by an albany county grand 
jury 
profeta to whom ms hahn said she turned for guidance after her 
1980 sexual encounter with ptl founder jim bakker was charged with 
tax evasion perjury and tampering with a witness 
he pleaded innocent and was released on 25000 bail he was 
ordered to surrender his passport pilots license and gun license 
and also ordered to stay away from ms hahn 
ms hahn welcomed the court order of protection but said she was 
still afraid of profeta who she alleged had threatened her in the 
past 
he has asked me to lie for him i didnt lie theres a lot of 
reason to believe that hes more than angry ms hahn said in a 
telephone interview from the playboy offices in los angeles he 
blames me for the entire investigation 
yeah i am afraid she said i feel there are too many of 
his people floating around ive been threatened in the past 
ms hahn who has been living in phoenix while doing a radio 
show declined to say what she had told the grand jury other than 
to repeat allegations that profeta had asked her to help him conceal 
wrongdoing 
ms hahn in text accompanying a nude pictorial in the september 
issue of playboy said profeta showered her with attention and 
convinced her that heavy petting with the pastor was part of her 
role as church secretary babysitter and consort and would leave her 
still technically a virgin 
the text noted that profeta mesmerized young jessica with a 
combination of fire brimstone money and sex 
in july 1981 profeta persuaded jessica to have sexual 
intercourse with him for the first time the magazine said 
he said im going to prove to you that im not like jim and 
john ms hahn said in the article he was going to show me how 
women should be treated 
the magazine said she later began a fullfledged romance with 
profeta 
the charges allege that between 1984 and 1986 profeta and his 
wife glenda used as their personal funds money taken from the full 
gospel tabernacle church in massapequa ny a nondenominational 
christian church where profeta was the pastor the indictment also 
alleged that the profetas failed to declare the income on their new 
york state tax returns 
the indictment charged that profeta tried to persuade ms hahn to 
lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him including 
fur coats casino trips hotel stays jewelry apartment rent and 
automobile payments 
the grand jury had been investigating profeta since the summer of 
1987 shortly after the bakkerhahn scandal broke 
a year ago ms hahn appeared before the grand jury and told 
reporters afterward that profetas church group was a world just 
as disturbed as that of bakker and his ptl television ministry 
since the publicity about her involvement with bakker ms hahn 
has been featured in playboy interviews and nude pictorials and has 
stayed at the playboy mansion in california 
albany county judge joseph harris issued the protection order for 
ms hahn at the request of assistant attorney general peter crusco 
despite contentions by profetas lawyer that it would add to a 
media circus surrounding the case and deprive profeta of a fair 
trial 
the attorney john gross said the order implied that the 
tampering allegations against the minister were true harris 
responded there was no such implication and profeta would receive a 
fair trial 
these charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all 
lawabiding taxpayers said attorney general robert abrams but 
more importantly rev profeta allegedly abused the notforprofit 
status of a religious organization for his own personal gain 
gross refused to discuss the case with reporters 
in setting the 25000 bail harris said he wanted assurances 
from gross that the money wasnt from church funds crusco had asked 
for 100000 bail while gross had argued that no bail was needed 
because of profetas position in the community 
this man has been a minister for over 30 years gross said 
hes got a congregation of over 1000 there is no proof to these 
charges 
profeta was charged with three counts of offering a false 
instrument for filing two counts of tax evasion six counts of 
falsifying business records one count of attempted perjury three 
counts of witness tampering and three counts of criminal 
solicitation 
mrs profeta 44 was indicted on three counts of offering a 
false instrument for filing and two counts of tax evasion her case 
was postponed until next month because she is recuperating at home 
from an infection she contracted after surgery gross said 
the profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison if 
convicted of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing 
the most serious charges

the former deacon of a faithhealing sect 
was convicted thursday of manslaughter in his sons death from 
untreated juvenile diabetes 
bobby dan norman 43 quietly hugged his wife judith following 
the verdict by a spokane county superior court jury that deliberated 
about 10 hours after nearly three weeks of testimony 
the normans were members of a nameless christian faith healing 
sect that eschewed conventional medicine and practiced strict 
discipline of children and adults 
witnesses testified that the normans 10yearold son aaron was 
spanked and harshly interrogated by his father and sect founder doug 
kleber the day before he died at the familys home near spokane on 
dec 20 1987 
the beatings were an effort to get the boy to confess sins which 
the men believed were making him ill witnesses testified 
a doctor testified that the beatings could have worsened the 
boys illness norman admitted under questioning by colwell that he 
was responsible for his sons death 
deputy spokane county prosecutor clark colwell declined to say 
whether he will ask for a sentence outside the standard 31 to 
41month range for firstdegree manslaughter 
normans lawyer roger peven said its too early to consider an 
appeal noting that the normans originally were both charged with 
firstdegree murder but only bobby norman was tried for 
manslaughter 
in closing arguments colwell depicted norman as a fanatic 
who recklessly failed to seek medical attention for his son 
peven argued that norman was a man whose life was controlled by 
sect leaders and said religious fervor blinded his client to the 
boys illness 
sect leaders were seen as prophets and were consulted on matters 
ranging from car purchases to sexual relations testimony indicated 
kleber and former spokane pastor jeffrey siegel both 34 and from 
champaignurbana ill pleaded guilty earlier to seconddegree 
criminal mistreatment three former elders face trial on similar 
charges next year 
before the sect disbanded in february it claimed about 300 adult 
members in washington illinois texas and new jersey

president reagan recommended thursday that the 
new us embassy in moscow be razed and rebuilt from the ground up 
because it is riddled with listening devices that cannot be removed 
reagan told reporters the united states has no choice in the 
matter because theres no way to rid it of the many listening 
devices that were built into it 
were going to start and have an americanbuilt one reagan 
said of the embassy 
meanwhile a state department source disclosed late thursday that 
the united states has filed claims against the soviet union for 29 
million in connection with defects and delays in the 
construction of the embassy 
in april 1987 administration officials said the united states 
had filed such a claim but the preliminary total at that time was 
only about 10 million the claims are to be negotiated by an 
arbitration panel in stockholm sweden 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that the 
29 million does not include possible reparations by the soviets for 
the installation of eavesdropping devices in the building or the 
eventual costs to replace the building 
were talking to the soviets now in an attempt to settle how 
much such reparations might be the source said explaining that 
before that issue can go before the arbitration panel we have to 
show good faith that the soviets and we have tried to work this 
out 
national security adviser colin powell during an appearance at 
the national press club said it will be a very expensive 
proposition a very very difficult task to put up a building in 
moscow 
powell said us officials would have to discuss the situation 
with soviet officials and said he was hopeful something could be 
worked out in light of the improving relations with the soviet 
union 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said reagan 
will urge congress to permit the virtually completed embassy to be 
demolished and reconstructed with americanmade components to be 
shipped from the united states and stored in moscow warehouses under 
the tightest possible security he said the building will be 
assembled by us workers taken to moscow for that purpose 
the soviets will not be permitted to move into their newly built 
embassy in washington until the united states can occupy its 
facilities in moscow redman said 
he said that tearing down the existing structure and building a 
new one under high security conditions will involve a very 
elaborate and costly process 
obviously were talking years redman said 
but he said the final cost cannot now be estimated because 
entirely new engineering and architectural plans will have to be 
drawn up 
he said reagans proposed demolition and reconstruction plan was 
recommended by secretary of state george p shultz following several 
reviews of the project by us experts 
this option offers the best overall solution to the problem 
redman said 
he said the rebuilt eightstory embassy will occupy the same sit 
but will be different than the one recommended for demolition the 
new structure will incorporate features to take into account what 
we have learned about soviet eavesdropping capabilities he said 
every precaution will be taken to assure the security of the 
process redman said 
but he repeatedly declined to say exactly what devices the united 
states had discovered in the new structure or how they had been 
installed because its never in anyones interest to let the other 
guy know what you know 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass said the spying 
allegations were groundless obviously farfetched and just as 
in previous cases the us administration did not provide any 
material proof 
redman said that although the cost will be high it will be worth 
it to assure a secure and safe working place for us diplomats in 
moscow one that will be expected to serve for at least the next 
half century 
meanwhile he said the united states will continue to renovate 
the turnofthe century embassy building it has used since the 
1930s to make it safer and more secure until a new building can be 
occupied 
the first eavesdropping bugs in structural elements built by 
soviet workers and transported to the site were discovered by us 
inspectors in the spring of 1987 the united states and the soviet 
union agreed in 1972 to build new larger embassies in each others 
capital 
one member of congress who toured the facility rep olympia 
snowe rmaine said in september that 38 million remained in 
previously approved embassyconstruction appropriations to dismantle 
the unoccupied embassy 
but rep snowe said that bdm corp which inspected the facility 
for the state department said the dismantling it could cost 160 
million construction of the bugriddled embassy and studies about 
its future have cost nearly 60 million to date

something strange is going on in this years 33

bobbing in the big oldfashioned 
tub toes hooked over a water spout to keep from capsizing as tiny 
bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine its hard to worry 
whether this is just what the doctor ordered 
if you dont have anything wrong with you if you lead a 
strenuous life its just for relaxation says bathhouse attendant 
gertrude zorn 
otherwise says zorn who for 15 years has been drawing the water 
for the tub then coming back to wrap the client in a hot sheet when 
its time to get out the bubbly float on naturally carbonated water 
is good for arthritis rheumatism and bad backs 
the bathhouses with their white tile walls ceilingfans and 
small individual suites with the giant tubs look as though they 
havent changed from the 1930s when the state decided the areas 
carbonated waters were a natural resource 
nothing trendy here especially the price 875 for the soak 
room and attention 
but elsewhere spas are an oldfashioned idea gone yuppie and a 
multimilliondollar business for many now spa means the chrome and 
glass spot where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard it 
can mean being floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal 
wrap 
jeffrey joseph a new york entrepreneur who jumped in just as the 
water was heating up says his travel agency has tripled in both 
staff and bookings since he began specializing in spa vacations a 
year and a half ago 
joseph owner of spafinders travel arrangements ltd estimates 
that in five years the number of spas in this country has increased 
from 30 to 150 and is still growing 
about 12 million americans spend 700 million to 800 million 
annually going to spas joseph estimates the majority of his 
clients who spend about 1000 for a weeks retreat are lowlevel 
female executives in their 30s 
but is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad or 
is it really good for your health 
are you ready for this a 10003500 week at a spa can be as 
healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower 
say both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist 
does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral 
bath of course it feels good says psychologist eric margenau of 
new york city 
does it serve a medicinal purpose i havent seen any evidence 
of that 
what about stress management thats the new buzz word says 
joseph 
the experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if 
you plan for it and do it regularly if you go off once a year 
expecting an expensive vacation to be your lifeline for the next 12 
months youre in trouble 
i like spas theyre great but ive been to great dude ranches 
that ive come back from just as refreshed says margenau the 
author of a new book called sports without pressure 
dr james m rippe the cardiologist who heads the exercise 
physiology laboratory at the university of massachusetts medical 
school in worcester echoes that he says people mustnt delude 
themselves that they can go twice a year and make up for the 
excesses of the rest of the year 
joseph whose agency has sent nearly 4000 clients to spas around 
the world since march 1987 says the better resorts work on behavior 
modification in other words they dont just put you in an aerobics 
class or stick you on a diet they have a whole program on stress 
management and healthy living things to take home with you 
spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as 
the romans 
in europe and japan people have been spaminded for centuries 
one town in japan beppu known for boiling ponds that shoot mud 
into the air gets 12 million visitors each year joseph said 
in this country traditional spas with a chic clientele were 
booming before the turn of the century places like mineral wells 
texas hot springs ark white sulphur springs wva and 
calistoga calif which stands for californias saratoga 
this new york town the granddaddy of american spas whose 
medicinal springs were discovered in the late 18th century was long 
a social hot spot with its added cache of a thoroughbred racing 
season 
nowadays morgenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a 
burgeoning stress industry 
the whole business is blown up way out of proportion there is 
a whole economy built up around stress reduction the new american 
fads spas contraptions a 1000 worth of vitamins 
instead of those remedies he recommends altering daytoday 
patterns to defuse pressure slow down he says take a longer 
lunch schedule exercise 
yes stress exists it always has but most of the stresses are 
very easily remedied 
every mans spa is his shower says rippe the author of many 
medical and fitness books 
the medical school professor cites his own studies and those of 
colleagues that indicate showers and sitting in a recliner can 
reduce tension and anxiety and that blood pressure as well is 
reduced by regular programs of walking 
barbara sloan a confirmed spagoer isnt interested in hearing 
she could have stayed home and taken a shower 
it was wonderful she said of a posh florida spa a massage 
was part of every day the food absolutely out of this world 
josephs catalog says a week at the resort mrs sloan visited 
also included greens fees herbal wrap saltglo loofa scrub 
hairdo makeup manicure pedicure and lectures all for 1970 
a spa said mrs sloan president of a new jersey public 
relations firm means attention and luxury 
plush towels beautiful locker rooms pampering if you have to 
wait for an massage appointment they give you a cup of bouillon 
she said 
i cant imagine it was not good for you

antipersonnel mines designed to maim 
an enemy remain scattered about afghanistan and must be cleared 
before more than 5 million refugees in pakistan and iran can return 
home united nations officials say 
the mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of 
thousands to 5 million some look like toys and are small enough to 
fit in the palm of a persons hand if picked up they can blow away 
a hand if stepped on a victim can lose a foot 
zia rizvi spokesman for the un economic and humanitarian 
program for afghan refugees said the landmines have to be found and 
defused before a billiondollar rebuilding program can begin 
the devices are believed to have been laid by soviet and afghan 
government forces during their nineyear war against moslem 
insurgents the insurgents also have laid a number of antitank 
devices 
teams of mineclearing experts from the united states britain 
france and turkey have been in pakistan to plan a training program 
designed to show afghans how to locate identify and defuse the 
mines 
a 9million training program is scheduled to begin shortly 
rizvi said 
clearing the mines is a prerequisite to any rebuilding 
activity said rizvi 
the soviets are not a contributor to the mineclearing effort 
but they have assured us of their total cooperation said rizvi 
since the april signing of an accord providing for the withdrawal 
of more than 100000 soviet troops from afghanistan the united 
nations has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee 
movements in its history 
rizvi said the widespread use of the landmines is a comment on 
the people who make sell buy and use them 
the usbacked moslem guerrillas known as the mujahedeen have 
been fighting the afghanistans marxist government since it seized 
power in 1978 the soviet union entered the conflict in december 
1979 
fifteen different types of antipersonnel mines have been 
identified along with five models of antitank mines rizvi said 
in addition to the antipersonnel devices that resemble toys are 
are scattered around villages another common type is a bright green 
plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the palm of 
a hand 
rizvi said unexploded ordnance of other kinds such as dud bombs 
also are scattered around the afghan countryside 
the first task of foreign minedetecting experts will be to make 
afghans aware of what to look for rizvi said children will be 
educated to the dangers as well 
foreign experts will train afghans who in turn will pass on their 
knowledge to others he said 
eventually said rizvi an afghan mineclearing team would be 
established in most villages or cluster of villages

unlike the title character in his latest film 
madame sousatzka john schlesinger doesnt see himself as a 
teacher the director would rather have audiences make up their own 
minds 
i hope theres plenty of irony in all my films thats the very 
thing i look for said the british director of midnight 
cowboy marathon man and other acclaimed movies 
it could all be disaster but it isnt thats kind of my 
attitude to life most of the endings ive had there is a question 
mark theyre often about people determined to carry on 
madame sousatzka based on the novel by bernice rubens takes 
place in london and stars shirley maclaine as a demanding emotional 
piano teacher whose philosophy i teach how to live is the 
cause of much conflict with her students 
schlesinger originally sought a european actress to play the 
russianborn teacher but wanted maclaine after deciding to cast an 
american 
i liked the fact that she was willing to take risks he said 
i thought she brought quite a lot to terms of endearment 
looking dreadful shes not worried about her shirley maclaine 
image i got to know that very fast 
schlesinger credits maclaine whose work in terms of 
endearment earned her an academy award for best actress in 1985 
with making the eccentric sousatzka believeable 
sometimes when i worked on the script id say oh god shes 
too monstrous but she had a way of playing the eccentricities so 
that it was totally part of her the director said she doesnt 
play to the audience at all i think its a most extraordinary 
performance 
for the part of manek sen the 15yearold prodigy who endures 
sousatzskas violent mood swings schlesinger auditioned hundreds of 
actors before choosing newcomer navin chowdhry who makes his film 
debut in the movie chowdhry had no musical training but 
schlesinger nevertheless found him perfect for the part the 
youngster worked with musical advisor yonty solomon 
in a way irina sousatzka can be likened to nora desmond the 
aging actress in sunset boulevard both are flamboyant on the 
surface and lonely underneath desmond falls in love with a young 
screenwriter sousatskza with manek 
its a love story shes created something and now she falls in 
love with him schlesinger noted 
shes a survivor even if shes angry or upset i believe it 
isnt so removed from people even if the subject is about music 
its all about perfectly common human experience 
the 62yearold schlesingers own musical background attracted 
him to the story his father was a cellist his mother a violinist 
and schlesinger himself was an accomplished pianist as a child 
schlesinger was a character actor in the 1950s appearing on 
stage in television and films he also made documentary shorts his 
first commercial film terminus won the golden lion for best 
documentary at the 1961 venice film festival 
a kind of loving his first feature film was released the 
following year starring a then unknown alan bates the film won the 
golden bear award at the berlin film festival and established 
schlesinger as one of englands most talented young directors 
he then directed billy liar and darling which earned 
julie christie the best actress oscar in 1965 midnight cowboy 
his first film made in hollywood earned academy awards for best 
picture director and best adapted screenplay in 1969 
with jon voight as a texan hustler and dustin hoffman as a 
tubercular bronx con man midnight cowboy typified schlesingers 
fascination with characters who are up against it 
schlesinger sees that theme running strongly in madame 
sousatzka 
in the case of manek hes up against the promise of success 
and the possibility of failure which she has been up against he 
said shes up against her past shes up against it in many ways 
it makes her behave a certain way 
theyre all up against something changing london changing 
values 
schlesinger has also directed glenda jackson in sunday bloody 
sunday and hoffman and sir laurence olivier in marathon man 
enthusiasm the director says is what he looks for from his 
actors maclaine he said loved the role she didnt care 
about the money was charming to everyone particularly the boy the 
fact thats shes out banging the drum about the movie proves shes 
enthusiastic 
and so is schlesinger hes merged his great loves film and 
music and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels 
its communicating he said youre trying to invoke an 
emotional response to something to make them laugh or make them 
angry as well as just telling a story

in an adventure with almost as many twists and 
plot turns as the movie itself ann rands we the living is 
about to make it to american theaters the 46yearold film was 
thought to have been destroyed by mussolini 
we the living was made in wartime italy in 1942 and was 
based on the novel of the same name by ayn rand whose 
objectivism philosphy in such works as the fountainhead and 
atlas shrugged made her a cult figure in the 1970s 
the movie has caused such a stir over the years and has 
repeatedly won critical acclaim from the venice festival of 1942 to 
the fourth annual boston film festival last month 
a surface indictment of communism the lushly photographed 
romantic saga is set in russia as the tidal wave of revolution 
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the 
way people lived and loved and survived 
rossano brazzi costars as a tubercular aristocat who cant get a 
job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of 
fashion he said he made arrangements for rand to get her first look 
at the film when he met her in hollywood after the war however he 
didnt think italys fascist government had ordered the movie to be 
destroyed 
it went out of circulation because the natural life of the film 
was over brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home in 
rome 
but massimo ferrarasantamaria a rome lawyer who was general 
manager of the studio where the movie was made said he was called 
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and 
copies of the film and was stripped of his position at the studio 
and as lecturer at italian universities for his role in making the 
movie 
in the tragic italian war situation the film was called by the 
public noi morti we the dead he said in an interview 
adding that nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels banned the film 
in germany after ferrara personally showed it at goebbels berlin 
home in october 1942 
at the end of the screening goebbels told me that the russians 
were habitually presented to the german public in a much more 
negative way than in this picture and therefore it was no good for 
germany he said 
erika and henry mark holzer the movies producers were rands 
lawyers in the 1960s mrs holzer said the author believed the 
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two 
attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives it 
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with a 
bunch of italian films for sale 
they rode through the bumpy back streets of rome with a load of 
potentially explosive nitratetreated film in the back of an old 
truck including the negative for we the living they had the 
movie transferred to safety film before flying it back to new 
york 
mrs holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative 
which ferrara had hidden 
ferrara and others say italys ministry of culture ordered the 
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds 
that though the message might purport to be anticommunist it could 
also be taken as antitotalitarian a strong statement for 
individualism regardless of political coloration 
the fascists didnt want that kind of propaganda message playing 
on the homefront with italys axis troops stretched from north 
africa to stalingrad and the allies storming the beaches of sicily 
rand had a hardline libertarian philosophy it was best 
exemplified by gary cooper in the fountainhead who played an 
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be 
desecrated by the whims of popularism 
mrs holzer said rand liked the film version of we the living 
even more than the fountainhead although the author had written 
the latters screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for 
the italian film 
brazzi said it was a socalled war movie well worry after the 
war about paying for it he said rand eventually did receive 
compensation from scalera the producing studio 
mrs holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an 
original nitrate negative rand went through the film frame by frame 
to identify exactly how she wanted it edited the italian version 
was made in two parts and ran over 4 hours the project was set 
aside when rand had other commitments and was not picked up until 
after the authors death in 1982 the film was restored by duncan 
scott 
the epic was shot entirely on indoor elaborately built italian 
wartime sets recreating russian country scenes trains ships and 
petrograd 
im told almost the entire white russian community in italy was 
used as extras mrs holzer said 
the new version distributed by angelika films is under three 
hours and is set for release nov 5 in boston nov 11 in los 
angeles and nov 25 in new york it will play to other major us 
markets before january 
the film also stars a young and radiant alida valli the female 
lead in the 1949 british thriller the third man and fosco 
giachetti who was the no 1 boxoffice draw in italy when the movie 
was made according to its producers 
we the living has a bit of soap opera in it beautiful kira 
loves leo the tubercular aristocat andrei of the dreaded secret 
police loves kira because she has the courage to be independent and 
defiant of the new order 
but underneath the suds is a hard reality kira forsakes her love 
when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line andrei kills 
himself when he realizes first that kira used him to get leo a spot 
in a sanitarium and that his adored party leaves no freedom for 
individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint 
kira goes forward wiser but unbowed a testimony to the strong 
and the living and the survival of the toughest 
rand who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered 
capitalism and rational selfishness held individual freedom as 
the highest ideal she said alturism was weakness and blamed it for 
much of the worlds woes but she also attacked libertarians of the 
right who often identified with her philosophy

after dazzling a nightclub audience 
with his work on an ultramodern electronic wind instrument michael 
brecker went to his dressing room to audition a 40yearold 
saxophone that a friend had offered to sell 
such paradoxes make up the music of brecker a popular sessionman 
who has played on more than 500 albums but is guiding his solo 
career through its infancy 
brecker has lent his licks to albums by such diverse artists as 
frank sinatra parliamentfunkadelic and dire straits but his two 
solo records are filled with lengthy improvisations and traditional 
jazz sounds he is known primarily for his studio work but loves to 
perform live 
as a horn man his influences begin with the masters jazz 
saxophonists such as john coltrane and charlie parker a recent 
favorite is blues guitarist robert cray who won critical acclaim 
last year with his hit record smoking gun 
but to go from pop to funk to rock from bebop to blues is not 
unusual for the 39yearold brecker my music is always heading in 
a bunch of different directions he said 
with his brother randy who plays trumpet the tenor saxophonist 
was onehalf of the brecker brothers who recorded several 
successful albums of fusion pop in the 1970s but michael was 20 
years into his career before he released a solo album last years 
michael brecker the current tour that brought his quintet to 
fort lauderdale is in support of his new record dont try this at 
home 
the two albums are somewhat different but coming from sort of 
the same place brecker said theyre both not at all commercial 
in a pop sense 
i really wanted to make a jazz record basically an acoustic 
type record that was played fairly live in the studio with tunes 
that were open to allow for a lot of improvisation i wasnt trying 
to employ gimmicks i just wanted the music to speak for itself 
on stage and on his new record brecker brings a contemporary 
flavor to the otherwise traditional sound with his electronic wind 
instrument synthesizer or ewi pronounced eewee 
the ewi is the length of a clarinet but fatter and rectangular 
it has 10 octave keys and terrific dynamic range brecker can make 
it sound like a keyboard a guitar cattle in distress and even a 
saxophone 
the ewi is likely to appall conservative jazz fans brecker likes 
it for several reasons 
im kind of a gadget freak ive always liked electronic things 
and was into synthesizers long before i was playing the ewi its 
just a lot of fun to play he said and i use it as a writing 
tool its just opened up another creative door for me 
but brecker will always go back to the sax 
its become part of me he said 
brecker hasnt done much session work lately and plans to 
continue concentrating on his solo career he likes the independence 
and plans to make the most of it 
the next recording is probably going to be somewhat more 
electric a little more funky thats subject to change but if i do 
do something different i expect to get a degree of lambasting he 
said with a chuckle 
hopefully the records are going to sell but im not trying to 
let that affect what i record

seething hatred of the jews 
fanned by adolf hitlers propagandists exploded 50 years ago in the 
nazis wellcoordinated night of ransacking torching and beating 
called kristallnacht 
boastfully dubbed crystal night by the nazis because of the 
sparkling shards of glass from thousands of smashed windows that 
single night of terror was also the dawn of the murderous sevenyear 
holocaust 
the nazis eventually killed an estimated 6 million jews and 
hundreds of thousands of others they labeled undesirables 
throughout the third reich on the night of nov 910 1938 nazi 
rampaged against jews in major cities as well as those few left in 
small towns after years of persecution 
the balance of the terrifying destruction according to official 
nazi count 195 synagogues and 7500 businesses destroyed thousands 
of homes ransacked officially 36 jews were slain some as they 
fled burning buildings other accounts however indicate that at 
least 1118 synagogues were vandalized and as many as 1000 jews 
were killed or committed suicide 
thousands more jews men women and children were beaten more 
than 30000 were arrested and shipped off to concentration camps in 
the first major step in the systematic nazi campaign to annihilate 
european jews 
the action which became known as the night of broken glass 
in english stunned the outside world and bluntly heralded the 
nazis intentions to aryanize society and business 
germans in both east and west have for months been making 
elaborate plans to mark the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht 
including solemn ceremonies panel discussions and new publications 
even half a century later the memory of the terror haunts its 
victims 
alfred jachmann was an 11yearold in the town of arnswalde now 
choszczno in northern poland 
we were sleeping behind shutters with the windows closed 
jachmann recalled in an interview we were jerked out of our sleep 
by the crashing glass we heard the screams the synaogue is 
burning 
my father screamed yes the skys all red we lived just 500 
meters from the synagogue we were hiding behind him for three 
hours we were shaking from fear and terror uniformed nazis rushed 
into our house they arrested my father without saying a word he 
said 
my sister gerda and i were crying terribly added the 
61yearold jachmann now head of the jewish home for the elderly in 
frankfurt my sister mother and i had to leave arnswalde within 
three days 
jachmanns mother father and 13yearold sister all died in the 
auschwitz concentration camp jachmann also sent to auschwitz 
later saved himself by plunging into the snow when nazi 
machinegunners mowed down prisoners in january 1945 
in what the nazis called spontaneous antijewish 
demonstrations kristallnacht raged across the german reich 
including austria and the recently annexed sudetenland region of 
czechoslovakia in addition to homes businesses and synagogues the 
nazi gangs ransacked jewish hospitals orphanages and homes for the 
elderly 
in the city of erfurt near weimar all jewish men aged 18 to 80 
were rounded up and forced into a local gymnasium 
some of the nazis especially took to task jews whom they 
personally knew to vent their fury on them said local bnai 
brith president harry stern 
we had to line up and march around to the sounds of the 
horstwessel song a nazi favorite then we were commanded to 
scream death to the jews and we had to do it said stern some 
were savagely beaten with whips he said 
then we were loaded into buses and brought to buchenwald where 
we arrived at dawn stern recalled in historian wolfgang benzs 
recently published book the jews in germany 193345 
in other cities jews were herded into courtyards before the men 
were separated from their families and sent to concentration camps 
valentin senger then a nonpracticing jew from a staunchly 
communist family witnessed the outcome of kristallnacht in 
frankfurt where some of the worst violence took place 
on the morning of the 10th i went to the factory where i 
worked and on the way to the factory i ran into a secretary she 
said have you heard the synagogue is burning he recalled 
senger described the mushroom cloud of smoke coming from the 
direction of the boerneplatz when he reached the synagogue he said 
smoke was billowing from the roof flames leaping through the 
windows 
hundreds of people were standing nearby he said the area 
was blocked off by police the fire department was there but they 
werent trying to put out the fire they had instructions to let the 
synagogue burn but to keep nearby buildings from burning 
i stood there and never heard any words of approval or applause 
or bravos the people looked stiffly and silently into the fire no 
one critcized it either the fear was too great 
that was the first time i felt i belonged to them i belonged 
there thats my people my synagogue was burning i really felt 
that i was a jew the 69yearold retired journalist told the ap 
in an interview i saw they were rounding up the jews and putting 
them on trucks that same day the jews were being mistreated and 
beaten 
senger survived in frankfurt by hiding from the nazis and using 
false documents 
much to the annoyance of nazi finance chief hermann goering 
kristallnacht had an unforeseen and nearly disastrous impact 
the damage calculated at 25 million reichsmarks worth about 
625 million shocked german insurance companies they noted that 
just replacing the broken glass would hurt the third reich since 
the glass had to be imported with muchneeded hard currency 
i wish you had killed 200 jews instead of destroying so many 
valuables goering told reinhard heydrich the nazi fanatic who 
gave the teletyped orders for kristallnacht 
eventually the nazis confiscated the insurance proceeds and 
slapped the jews with a 250 million fine 
fifty years later the anniversary is still creating conflict 
including debate over the best way to mark the day and the extent to 
which government leaders should participate 
roman catholic bishops from east germany west germany and 
austria last month issued a joint statement that sharply questioned 
christian leaders failure 50 years ago to publicly condemn the nazi 
night of terror the bishops implied that christian failings 
were partly responsible for the holocaust 
in september ignaz bubis leader of the frankfurt jewish 
community stunned the government when he publicly urged chancellor 
helmut kohl to have president richard von weizsaecker write kohls 
speech 
kohl has occasionally upset west german jews with what they 
consider insensitivity toward their concerns weizsaecker on the 
other hand has gained the jews admiration for urging germans to 
face the nazi past 
west german jews also frequently object to the word 
kristallnacht saying it minimizes the atrocities that followed the 
rampages they prefer the term pogrom night 
when the nazis came to power in 1933 germany had 530000 jews 
about 32000 jews live in west germany today in east germany the 
estimated number of practicing jews is 450600 with no permanent 
rabbi

targeting jews for persecution trying to force them out of the 
third reich by november 1938 they were looking for an excuse to 
crack down more savagely

by his familys deportation to poland shot and mortally wounded

as in hundreds of other towns across 
nazi germany terror struck jews in this picturesque village on the 
infamous kristallnacht a halfcentury later students there are 
still confronting the nazi past 
last month the 23 students in stephan kolbs history class heard 
a former jewish resident describe the tensions that led up to the 
brutality of nov 910 1938 
later in a roundtable discussion with the associated press 
students in this town of 11400 people north of frankfurt discussed 
the night when thugs ransacked the homes of the 10 to 15 jews who 
lived in usingen then a rural village 
martin stenzel 18 said kristallnacht named for the sparkling 
shards of broken glass that littered streets and sidewalks after the 
vandalism was a channeling of aggression against the jews 
asked about constant reminders of kristallnacht and other nazi 
atrocities he said there is the danger the nazi era could be 
disposed of or settled in a way but this history should always be 
alive 
stenzel also sees sharp differences among generations in west 
germany which has paid more than 80 billion marks 44 billion at 
1988 values to nazi victims and their families 
the older generation has kept the prejudiced view of jews he 
said adding that this wasnt true with younger generations 
sonja moses 20 said i can well imagine there were feelings 
of jealousy because the jews were merchants and in general were 
better off financially but i just dont think it could happen 
again people are more broadminded now they wouldnt do it again 
none of the six students taking part in the oct 13 discussion at 
the christianwirth school was jewish all are working toward the 
abitur the examination which grants a prestigious diploma roughly 
equivalent to a junior college degree in the united states 
ms moses like her classmates also said the older generation 
views the nazi era far differently from todays younger germans 
my grandmother tells me that hitler brought order to the 
country said ms moses adding that her grandmother dwells on the 
chaos that plagued the weimar republic after world war i she says 
after hitler came to power it wasnt that way anymore you could 
walk down the street without being afraid 
albrecht pachl 18 agreed the biggest danger was that the 
legacy of the nazis could eventually be put aside 
but he too noted that some germans think it is time to stop 
dwelling on the past 
many people feel under attack including from people outside 
the country pachl said of holocaust reminders 
he said he remembered watching television documentaries as a 
child 
i had the feeling it was aimed at me as a german pachl said 
kerstin dumke 18 said of kristallnacht violence i can 
imagine that some people were swept up by what was happening even 
if they didnt have any hatred for the jews beforehand 
like the others interviewed ms dumke has traveled to other 
countries and she said the nazi past comes up there too 
theres less interest in what is happening today than what 
happened in the past its something that you drag around with you 
all the time she said 
the students had heard from ernst lilienstein 67 an usingen 
native who emigrated a year before that terrible night a retired 
new york city educator lilienstein studied at the christianwirth 
school more than 50 years ago according to the 42yearold kolb 
for some of them it was the first time theyd ever seen a jew 
knowing it was a jew certainly it was the first time many had 
really talked to a jew kolb said 
in a telephone interview from his home in new york city 
lilienstein said of his meeting i was amazed both at their lack 
of knowledge about what really happened but also at their interest 
in questioning me

the scope of death and destruction in the 
kristallnacht pogrom against the jews of the third reich 50 years 
ago was much broader than widely believed an israeli researcher 
says 
vandals torched synagogues and smashed jewish property the night 
of nov 910 1938 the next day nazi officials announced that 36 
jews had been killed and 195 synagogues destroyed these figures are 
still widely used in history books 
but jerusalem professor meier schwarz says he has uncovered 
evidence that about 1000 jews were killed or committed suicide and 
that at least 1118 synagogues were vandalized 
kristallnacht is considered the start of the holocaust the 
systematic destruction of european jewry by nazi germany by the end 
of world war ii the nazis had killed 6 million jews 
for german jews it was the final sign that they no longer had 
a place there said the germanborn schwarz the only member of 
his family to survive the holocaust after the kristallnacht we 
all understood what it means to be a target 
schwarz said he began his research four years ago after being 
angered by official indifference on a visit to his birthplace the 
southern german city of nuremberg once a hotbed of nazism 
i was at city hall and asked some official why there was no 
plaque to commemorate the adasisroel synagogue where my family 
prayed said schwarz they told me it never existed 
schwarz was 12 when he saw adasisroel go up in flames on 
kristallnacht later that night five brown shirts trashed the 
schwarz family apartment with axes and knives 
the newspaper nuernberger zeitung wrote about the destruction 
of adasisroel an ornate threestory building with tall arched 
windows a heap of broken benches and ritual equipment was set up 
in the middle of the building which was then set on fire the entire 
building burned down 
scenes like this were repeated throughout the reich mostly in 
germany and austria 
in nuremberg 15 stormtroopers broke into the apartment of else 
dormitzer and her husband sigmund smashing furniture 
later several bandits returned and beat us both they broke my 
husbands nose with a steel rod mrs dormitzer wrote in an 
account kept at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem we 
were pushed out into the street our bodies covered with blood 
hertha hurtig said she had just seen a nelson eddyjeanette 
macdonald movie and was riding home on a streetcar in breslau 
todays wroclaw in poland when she saw brown shirts smash display 
windows 
they spared my husband for two days but on the third day he 
did not return from work mrs hurtig who now lives in ramat gan 
near tel aviv said in a telephone interview 
mrs hurtigs late husband was one of 30000 jews rounded up in 
the days after kristallnacht and sent to concentration camps 
according to schwarz 500 jews died on kristallnacht either 
killed or pushed into suicide and 500 more perished in 
concentration camps in the following days 
in addition at least 1095 synagogues were torched or vandalized 
in germany and 23 others in austria schwarz said in an interview 
the figures are the result of painstaking research using a 1932 
guide to jewish communities in germany schwarz and a few volunteers 
wrote letters to german municipal officials asking for information 
about the local synagogue and an account of what happened in each 
town and village on kristallnacht 
about 60 percent of the municipalities responded schwarz also 
received information from germanborn jews now living in other 
countries 
the nazis tried to portray the rampaging as the result of popular 
anger over the assassination of ernst vom rath third secretary at 
the german embassy in paris by hershel grynszpan a polish jew vom 
rath was shot nov 7 and died two days later 
but schwarz and other historians say a largescale pogrom had 
been planned for several months with the nazis waiting for the 
right time to carry it out 
still schwarz said german jews the most assimilated and 
secular in europe were taken by surprise 
they said we are germans and this will pass schwarz 
recalled they said the world will not keep quiet 
as history knows they were wrong

the flames that consumed synagogues across the 
third reich 50 years ago still burn within hearts at congregation 
habonim where survivors of the nazi assault on the jews rebuilt 
their lives and their faith 
an altar is built of stones from synagogues demolished the night 
of nov 910 1938 kristallnacht or the night of broken glass a 
charred torah scroll hangs on the wall its hebrew characters 
twisted as if in agony 
the congregation is a monument as well rabbi bernhard n cohn 
who escaped germany as a teenager in 1937 estimates that more than 
65 percent of the synagogues members are survivors of the nazi era 
the synagogue was founded on the upper west side of manhattan on 
nov 9 1939 precisely a year after kristallnacht its name hebrew 
for the builders was a defiant answer to those who had 
destroyed the synagogues the shops the homes and the comfortable 
lives of german jewry 
still after 50 years one cannot believe that any civilized 
nation could do what was done lotte marshall habonims executive 
director said in an interview 
she remembers seeing the synagogue of mannheim aflame she 
recalls streets littered with glass days spent hiding in her 
familys home the subsequent arrest of her brother and his 
transport to the dachau concentration camp 
mrs marshall gained her brothers release with forged papers 
she herself spent time in a concentration camp in france before 
fleeing to america 
lotte kahn 76 also remembers 
she and her husband were awakened by a 230 am call from her 
motherinlaw get out of your apartment right away the furniture 
is flying through the windows 
mrs kahn took shelter with her parents while her husband set out 
in search of a safer place hoping the violence was isolated to 
dortmund but chaos and nazi hooligans were everywhere he holed up 
in a protestant church and returned two days later 
all the jewish men of dortmund were arrested including mrs 
kahns husband father and uncle her menfolk were released in a 
fortnight if you ask me why they were let out i cannot tell 
you to this day she said 
ludwig boettigheimer remembers the melancholy among jews in 
america 
too many of our people lost so much their parents relatives 
friends were caught in germany and it became more and more obvious 
that there was no way to get them out said boettigheimer 80 a 
habonim founder who arrived in the united states in 1936 but 
there was also a sense of hope we were alive 
that hope was marshaled by hugo hahn a charismatic rabbi who had 
watched as nazi marauders wrecked his essen synagogue hahn and his 
followers were determined that german judaism would endure 
habonim started with three dozen founding members and services at 
manhattans central synagogue it drew some of germanys leading 
intellectuals people like martin buber and leo baeck to lecture 
and teach a prominent bible expert from frankfurt eduard strauss 
came to habonim and resumed his lessons at the precise point where 
he had been interrupted by the nazis 
it grew by leaps and bounds like wildfire said 
boettigheimer there was a need for prayer there always is in 
time of trouble 
membership swelled to 1200 separate services were conducted in 
queens and town hall was rented for the high holy days 
the german jews began to assimilate the amount of german spoken 
at services diminished until it was eliminated in the 1950s board 
minutes were recorded in german for only a year or two we tried 
to hide our language boettigheimer explained 
the end of the war brought numbing news of what had happened to 
those left behind memorializing the dead became a major priority 
each year a holocaust memorial service is held near the anniversary 
of kristallnacht 
a wall of plaques records names of the dead tilly jacobsen 
perished in theresienstadt march 1943 emil and lima hertz 
adolph rudolf and herman hertz perished in europe 194045 
stones were collected from the synagogue ruins after the war 
nearly 30 years later artist emanuel milstein incorporated them in 
an altar as a monument to victims of the holocaust 
the charred torah scroll was discovered in the gutter outside the 
essen synagogue the night after it was destroyed it was sent for 
safekeeping to a relative in princeton nj who gave it to 
physicist albert einstein 
einstein who had emigrated from germany in 1933 displayed it 
when he spoke on behalf of refugee relief eventually it went to 
habonim 
in a queens cemetery habonim is about to dedicate a marble 
column etched with victims names a brochure says we will never 
forget them but let us be sure that those who come after us will 
remember them too 
the synagogue has had its struggles hahn the synagogues 
founder and its heart died in 1967 replaced by cohn his 
soninlaw and an associate rabbi membership dropped to 600 and 
religious school enrollment once as high as 250 fell to 50 it is 
60 this year 
habonim has attracted new younger members but they are in the 
minority 
these people dont die cohn said of the older members 
fiftieth wedding anniversaries are a dime a dozen in my 
congregation 
but they do die of course and the congregation shrinks some 
each year the names of those who perished in europe are read at the 
annual memorial service they are removed when their survivors die 
this year there will be about 100 names 
this does not sadden boettigheimer 
it is much sadder he said if you have a tremendous list

compared to the nazi genocide that virtually 
wiped out europes jews a night of windowsmashing and arson would 
seem a pale subject for a documentary 
but kristallnacht the journey from 1938 to 1988 spotlights a 
moment in history when history could have been changed the world 
was shocked but did nothing and hitlers destruction of the jews 
went forward 
the onehour film will air over the public broadcasting service 
on nov 9 the 50th anniversary of crystal night when 
widespread nazi attacks on synagogues and jewish businesses and 
homes littered the streets with shattered glass 
it was hitlers last test to see how the world would react and 
the world reacted with silence said ronald lauder who underwrote 
the film through his robert s lauder foundation a philanthropic 
organization that aims to preserve european jewish history and 
culture 
lauder heir to the estee lauder cosmetics fortune served as 
ambassador to austria from 198587 and was an outspoken critic of 
antisemitism at a time when austrians were electing former un 
secretarygeneral kurt waldheim as their president in spite of his 
nazi background 
lauder told a small group that gathered for a preview screening 
of the documentary that its purpose was to teach us a lesson that 
we have to speak out speak out whenever there is any type of 
bigotry governmentsponsored any type of religious persecution 
the film describes the events through rare pictures including 
neverbeforeseen amateur movies of the burning of a synagogue and 
interviews with survivors and witnesses it later catches up with 
presentday austrians and germans who have varying opinions on their 
connection to the past 
kristallnacht is wellknown in europe but lauder said he was 
chagrined to find out that only about 10 percent of americans polled 
by his foundation had ever heard of it 
it became part of me when i was in vienna he said in an 
interview i began to realize all the different currents why they 
were happening i also saw in vienna there were very few synagogues 
left one of the major ones is today a parking lot i realized 
that this was a center of jewish life and theres a parking lot 
what happened 
after nov 9 1938 the world was never the same lauder 
said there was something different people couldnt put their 
finger on it but it was different it affects your life it affects 
my life it affects all our lives and thats why i did it i wanted 
people to understand it and no matter how much i explained to 
people when i travel what happened i couldnt get it across 
for producer robert frye a former abc news producer making 
lauders film was a difficult project since little visual material 
was available 
the nazis didnt want any evidence of the widespread nature of 
this frye said he held little hope for film footage until 
someone tipped him there was an amateur film sitting in a museum in 
germany 
that began a threefourmonth process frye said no one 
would tell us who owned the film after leaving austria on the 
actual shoot we drove to munich and on the way found out that 
the woman who owned the film lived near so we knocked on the door 
and completed the deal it is as far as i know the only footage 
that shows in motion picture terms what happened 
the film sets the scene through interviews with witnesses who 
lived in germany in 1935 as hitler was rising to power and finding 
little resistance to his propaganda campaign against jews 
a polish family forced to leave germany wrote a plaintive letter 
to a son in paris to protest the persecution of his family 
17yearold herschel grynzspan walked into the german embassy and 
shot a minor german official ernst vom rath retribution for vom 
raths death became an excuse for kristallnacht 
this was for good we knew the end of our normal life 
recalls witness paul grosz 
in presentday west germany fryes cameras follow israeli 
professor meier schwarz on his quest to find evidence of the jews 
who once lived in the germany of his boyhood in ansbach he watches 
workmen restoring a magnificent synagogue 
the main thing is to restore what happened here schwarz 
says to make a memory for our parents but he acknowledges 
there is no one to worship in the synagogue no jews live in ansbach 
anymore

the nissan sentra is a tough little car with a 
tough assignment 
it has to battle both similarly priced subcompact cars and 
lowerpriced competitors it works to attract both young singles of 
moderate income and upscale parents and couples nissan says and 
as the bestselling auto in the nissan family its working to 
bolster sales 
the sentra which is imported from japan for buyers in the 
western united states and is shipped from nissans smyrna tenn 
plant to buyers in the eastern part of the country has done a 
commendable job 
redesigned for the 1987 model year it was the eighth 
bestselling nameplate in the united states with sales of more than 
239000 also in the 1987 model year it was rated no 1 in quality 
among subcompacts by the auto marketing research firm jd power and 
associates of westlake village calif 
for 1988 the sentra continues to be a quality leader in 
subcompacts though it fell behind the chevrolet nova toyota 
corolla and plymouth colt in the 1988 jd power survey of owners 
who had their cars for 90 days 
also a nissan spokesman reports that sales are nearly flat for 
calendar 1988 through july 123625 sentras were sold vs 124468 
in the same period in 1987 
the test car a 1988 sentra gxe sedan had fine fit and finish 
inside and out except for the plastic fuelcap holder on the fuel 
filler door 
the holder came right off when i tried to use it but it also was 
easy to put back on i ignored it and put the cap on the car roof 
while refueling 
the cars interior was spartan and easy to live with dashboard 
gauges were simple to read and seats were comfortable because it is 
a subcompact however the sentra offers a snug fit for three adults 
in back and legroom there also was tight 
the trunk was flat and sizable though it was covered with a thin 
layer of material that tended to bunch up under luggage road noise 
was moderate and you can count on getting decent fuel economy 
the engine a 16liter fuelinjected four cylinder teamed with 
threespeed automatic transmission was a bit sluggish there were 
times when it chugged and the car jerked trying to get in the right 
gear this was also when the air conditioner was on full blast 
base price for the gxe sedan with automatic transmission is 
10844 competitors include the honda civic sedan which is priced 
around 11000 with automatic transmission and the hyundai excel 
sedan which is priced around 7400 with automatic transmission 
nissan says sentra buyers have median age of between 30 and 39 
median income is from 30000 to just under 50000 many buyers are 
couples and parents and there also are a number of single females 
who earn more than 50000 annually the company says 
from 198286 the latest years available consumer reports 
trouble survey of owners showed sentras having average better than 
average or much better than average ratings

george bush relaxing on air force two as it 
raced across california summed up his campaign strategy in just six 
words im not going to mess up 
once twice three times four times he said it over and over 
within a period of a minute it was as if he had been reciting the 
same sentence to himself for months rehearsing a simple formula for 
winning the white house 
i cant look back and i cant look forward beyond nov 8 
either unifocus bush said 
by all appearances the man given to gaffes has succeeded in not 
messing up 
a loser in iowas firstinthenation caucuses he rallied to 
bring the primary season to a surprisingly early close 
down by 17 points in the polls in late july he climbed back up 
methodically following a game plan that eventually gave him a wide 
lead over his rival 
he didnt loose his focus either simply put it was to paint 
dukakis as an incorrigible liberal an inexperienced governor whose 
leadership could not be trusted 
do not gamble on another liberal democrat coming out of 
nowhere bush warned audiences 
emphasizing that republicans have brought peace and prosperity 
bush said dukakis wasnt up to dealing with the soviet union and he 
was sure to raise taxes 
bush concentrated his time and resources on nine battleground 
states california texas ohio illinois new jersey michigan 
pennsylvania wisconsin and missouri 
in the process he surprised a lot of people 
once considered weak and awkward on the stump he instead was 
tough and aggressive willing to wage what was widely viewed as a 
negative campaign 
he wasnt a wimp 
he seemed confident and poised in televised debates with 
dukakis bush came across as steady and relaxed a far cry from the 
nervous hyperactive performance he turned in four years earlier in 
a debate with then democratic vice presidential nominee geraldine 
ferraro 
of course there were occasional foulups his biggest miscue was 
saying that sept 7 instead of dec 7 was the anniversary of the 
japanese attack on pearl harbor mixing up his words on another 
occasion he said i hope i stand for antibigotry antisemitism 
antiracism he quickly had aides assure people he was not an 
antisemite 
george herbert walker bush scion of the late connecticut senator 
and new york financier prescott bush and dorothy walker bush was 
born to a life of privilege in greenwich conn 
bush amassed a fortune in his own right in the oil fields of 
texas and then followed his fathers lead and built up an 
impressive resume of public service member of congress ambassador 
to the united nations chairman of the republican party director of 
the central intelligence ageny vice president still bush had not 
won an election in his own right since 1968 
he lost badly in the first event of the 1988 presidential 
campaign the iowa caucuses but then regrouped and came back in new 
hampshire then after losses in south dakota and minnesota bush 
jumped ahead of the pack and virtually locked up the gop 
presidential nomination with 16 primary wins on super tuesday 
lingering questions about bushs role in the irancontra affair 
threatened to derail his presiential aspirations as did a 
perception that he was not his own man 
even his selection of a running mate created controversy and 
bush was forced to defend dan quayle throughout the fall campaign 
in the end though it didnt seem to matter 
bushs aides said the turning point was the republican convention 
in august when there was in effect a transfer of leadership and 
bush stepped out of president reagans shadows 
bush played two roles sweet and sour good cop and bad cop he 
slashed deeply at dukakis at the same time he portrayed himself as 
a family man interested in family values and a gentler kinder 
nation 
like ronald reagans campaign before his bushs was not loaded 
with bold new initiatives he did not veered from the course of the 
last eight years when you have to change horses in midstream 
doesnt it make sense to switch to the one whos going in the same 
way bush asked 
there were few specifics about how a bush administration would 
work 
bushs answer to the huge budget deficit a flexible freeze 
that provided no clues about where he would cut spending 
his campaign was loaded with feel good themes balloons 
children sundrenched wheat fields similar to those reagan used 
indeed his commercials were made by the same team that produced 
reagans successful morning in america advertisements in the 
1984 presidential race 
and if bushs speeches sometimes sounded like reagans no 
wonder the vice president hired former white house speechwriter 
peggy noonan one of reagans top wordsmiths for his own campaign 
bushs commercials hammered dukakis as soft on crime weak on 
defense and on the wrong side of environmental issues such as the 
cleanup of the boston harbor echoing themes that bush sounded on 
the campaign trail 
pollster lou harris said the bush commercials have had an 
enormous impact really more than the debates more than anything 
else they have determined the set of the election up until now 
ben wattenberg an american enterprise institute senior fellow 
said they went after dukakis on all the lword liberal stuff 
which they had some nice symbols for prison furloughs and pledge of 
allegiance and aclu and stuff like that 
republican political consultant david keene said bush seized 
on issues of little substance such as the pledge of allegiance 
prison furloughs that created a caricature dukakis couldnt 
escape from in this way keene said bush changed the public 
perception of dukakis 
democrats accused bush of fanning racial tensions by emphasizing 
the case of willie horton a black man who raped a white woman after 
escaping from a massachusetts prison while on furlough as governor 
of massachusetts dukakis had defended granting furloughs to 
murderers 
there isnt any racism bush said 
bush also hit dukakis for being in favor of gun control and 
abortion 
by focusing on the hotbutton issues bush hoped to win over the 
swing voters the democrats who voted for reagan in 1980 and 1984 
but might go home in 1988 
as the race drew to a close polls showed bush significantly 
ahead of dukakis 
guy asked me yesterday are you overconfident theres no 
sense of overconfidence its more you know keep on moving bush 
said im going to run like im 10 points back all across this 
country

washington ap dan quayles vice presidential campaign has been 
haunted by his past doubts about his qualifications and the 
perception he has led an easy life in which the truly tough problems 
were solved by mom and dad 
controversy marred his elevation from relative obscurity to the 
national spotlight as george bushs running mate and it stymied his 
attempt to show the country he was more than just a pretty face 
the notion that the indiana senator was born with the proverbial 
silver spoon never having to struggle for money or power is borne 
out by his past as quayle once told an interviewer life has been 
very good to me i never had to worry about where i was going to 
go 
quayle 41 has constantly had to defend himself against charges 
he is unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency in 
response he touts his chief accomplishments in 12 years in 
congress coauthorship of a job training act and detailed work on 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty and other armscontrol 
issues 
before his oct 5 debate with democratic vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen quayle frequently added another point saying 
he has about the same legislative experience that john f kennedy 
had when he sought the presidency in 1960 that line was dropped 
after bentsens devastating rebuke senator youre no jack 
kennedy 
quayle denounced as sideevents questions about his military 
service academic record and personal life but his campaign has 
never completely escaped them signs reading chickenhawk who 
died in your place danny and sissy rich kid confront him 
from one state to another 
quayles grandfather was the conservative selfmade publishing 
magnate eugene c pulliam in 1955 at the age of 8 quayle and his 
family moved from his native indianapolis to phoenix where his 
father james ran pulliam newspapers and joined the john birch 
society the quayles returned to indiana in 1963 and his father 
became publisher and young dan eventually became associate 
publisher of the huntington heraldpress 
quayle has spent a good part of the campaign of 1988 explaining 
how he spent the 1960s drugs were totally unbeknownst to me he 
said and while that may seem a sheltered life thats a life 
in the midwest a life in a small town in indiana 
his performance at depauw university was average graduating in 
1969 during the vietnam war quayle would have been eligible for the 
draft but instead sought admission to the national guard he 
explained to reporters that he did what any normal person would do 
call home to mother and father and say id like to get in the 
national guard 
one of congress more ardent hawks quayle insists he wasnt 
trying to dodge the draft just to be able to attend law school 
and that no undue pressure was applied to get him into the guard 
guard officials said there were openings even in the public 
relations unit he joined but a retired major general acknowledged 
that he asked that a space be held for quayle after a retired guard 
commander a pulliam employee called to recommend him 
the future politician also had to do some explaining about how he 
managed to get into indiana university school of law when his grades 
clearly were lacking 
james quayle said his son was able to convince the law school 
that he was qualified on grounds his undergraduate education at the 
small private depauw was more intense than might have been 
available at a public institution 
young quayle was accepted into law school after meeting with the 
admissions dean a republican judge in lebanon ind where the 
family owns the local paper the same judge would later marry quayle 
and his wife marilyn tucker who met in law school and wed after a 
10week courtship 
after questions were raised this summer about his academic 
background quayle acknowledged he had never been an exemplary 
student but refused to release his law school records he deemed 
them irrelevant to the campaign and contended no rules were 
broken to get him admitted 
during the campaign quayle was peripherally touched by an old 
scandal former washington lobbyist paula parkinson claimed he had 
propositioned her on a 1980 golf outing in florida when she was 
staying in a vacation house with several lawmakers including 
quayle quayle angrily denied the accusation and said he had been 
there only to play golf 
his oftenstilted delivery and early avoidance of the press 
contributed to the image of a shaky political newcomer tightly 
controlled by bush headquarters his wife was especially protective 
pulling his sleeve or abruptly saying thank you senator to end 
press encounters 
when two months into the campaign quayle declared his 
independence from his handlers reporters were skeptical the 
candidate turned affable and accessible but he didnt abandon the 
mission that the party had laid out for him to portray democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis as a liberal out of touch with 
mainstream america 
while democrats have preyed on voter doubts about quayles 
qualifications polls suggested he was a drag on the ticket he 
did not attempt to dispel the idea he could be president one day in 
fact quayle says that at one point he talked with his wife about 
running for president himself this year 
it was a very casual discussion he added

texas sen lloyd bentsen knew what it was to 
run against the liberal label and tough negative advertising 
long before he was chosen to be michael dukakis running mate he is 
using that experience in a late effort to take the edge off the 
bushquayle campaign 
bentsen a 67yearold native texan was at first shy about 
directly attacking gop presidential nominee george bush whom he 
considered a friend now judging that two months of negative 
republican advertising has damaged the democrats bentsen has taken 
off the gloves 
in an oct 18 speech in los angeles he made the gop ads the 
central focus of his own campaign unleashing a blistering attack on 
the republicans and their effort to destroy dukakis character 
what happened almost without notice is an utterly vicious 
assault of distortion and character assassination carried out by 
republicans spending millions of dollars on television cutting him 
up bentsen said they dont seem to mind if what they say is 
untrue misleading downright mean 
little of the gop fire has been directed at bentsen instead 
bush and running mate dan quayle have zeroed in on dukakis taunting 
him at every turn as a liberal bentsen hre a grand jury in suffolk county 
where profetas church is located and answered questions about her 
former pastor her lawyer said that the grand jury was investigating 
matters that included a breakin at her long island apartment last 
year and the whole jim bakker thing 
according to todays indictment profeta tried to get ms hahn to 
lie to the grand jury about gifts she received from him including 
fur coats casino trips hotel stays jewelry apartment rent and 
automobile payments 
since the publicity about her involvement with bakker ms hahn 
has been featured in playboy pictorials and interviews and stayed at 
the playboy mansion in california 
albany county judge joseph harris issued the protection order for 
ms hahn at cruscos request despite contentions by profetas 
lawyer that such an order would add to a media circus 
surrounding the case and deprive profeta of a fair trial 
attorney john gross said the order implied that the witness 
tampering allegations against the minister were true 
harris replied there was no such implication and that profeta 
would receive a fair trial 
profeta dressed in a pinstripe suit lavender shirt striped tie 
and anklehigh boots offered no comment as he was led out of the 
courtroom and taken to a holding cell in the courthouse his lawyer 
refused to discuss the case 
these charges represent a scheme to cheat the state and all 
lawabiding taxpayers said state attorney general robert abrams 
but more importantly rev profeta allegedly abused the 
notforprofit status of a religious organization for his own 
personal gain 
in setting 25000 bail harris said he wanted assurances from 
gross that the money wasnt from church funds gross had argued that 
no bail was needed while crusco asked for 100000 bail 
this man has been a minister for over 30 years gross said 
hes got a congregation of over 1000 there is no proof to these 
charges 
glenda profeta 41 had her case postponed until next month she 
is recuperating at home from an infection she contracted after 
surgery gross said 
the profetas each face a maximum of four years in prison on 
charges of tax evasion and offering a false instrument for filing 
the most serious charges against them

whether campaigning around the country or 
hosting an official white house event president reagan is seizing 
on every opportunity to plug george bushs candidacy and warn 
americans against sending a liberal to the white house 
academics and political experts differ on the extent to which the 
presidential race between bush and democrat michael dukakis is a 
referendum on reagans nearly 8yearold presidency and they 
disagree about reagans impact on the electorate 
but no one questions the 77yearold presidents sincerity in 
waging a tireless campaign on behalf of his vice president 
i think hes made the whole republican party learn and remember 
the experience of 1960 said larry sabato a university of 
virginia governmental studies scholar hes doing for bush what 
dwight d eisenhower wouldnt do for richard m nixon 
since labor day reagan has traveled to 13 states the bulk of 
them in the tossup midwest and has raised 88 million for local 
and state republican parties and congressional candidates hes 
picked up the tempo in the waning days of the campaign with a 
whirlwind tour of california and visits to such border states as 
arkansas maryland and missouri 
wherever he goes reagan delivers a standard stump speech 
telling americans theyd be risking their future by electing dukakis 
as his successor he sprinkles stump speeches with the word 
liberal 
most of all reagan has reveled in the many appearances he has 
made at high schools and college campuses predictably invoking gen 
george c marshalls quote about the best blanketyblank kids in 
the world 
standing in a corner of the hardwood floor in the western 
kentucky university fieldhouse on oct 21 reagan launched a gift 
basketball in the direction of a basket while some 12000 young 
people roared he missed missed again and then bounced one in off 
the backboard 
his most enthusiastic receptions have come from young people such 
as those in kentucky many of whom flashed we love ronnie and 
thanks mr president signs 
he has an infectious way about him mused kentucky republican 
party chairman bob gable clearly they understood him i have to 
think the kind of exuberance you saw there will translate into bush 
as his successor 
i think he loves it said white house political aide frank 
lavin who said reagan has appeared at 21 campaign events since 
labor day including one with bush in houston and has appeared at 
several events for republican senate candidates 
reagans top aides have said that the election of bush is just 
one of reagans campaign goals he believes that it must be 
accompanied by some major gop strides in congress 
white house chief of staff kenneth m duberstein discussing 
reagans political role before a chamber of commerce audience said 
the president wants to push gop candidacies at the local level to 
encourage fair reapportionment by increasing republican 
representation in state legislatures 
speaking of reagans influence in the campaign brookings 
institution presidential scholar stephen hess said we cant have 
a controlled experiment because we dont know what it would be like 
if he sat on the sidelines but clearly theres an awful lot of 
referendum in this election 
hess said that bush has not taken policy stands that are 
measurably different from reagans and thus the president has a 
right to claim credit in fact most of the credit if bush beats 
dukakis on nov 8 
to that degree hes reagan an important factor because hes 
incredibly popular its phenomenal for a president in his eighth 
year to have 60 percent approval ratings 
richard wiener chairman of the democratic party in michigan 
disagreed 
unimpressed by reagans foray earlier this month to the 
bluecollar enclave of macomb county and by the presidents appeal 
to the socalled reagan democrats wiener said i dont think 
the visit made much of a difference once way or another 
we saw that in both 1984 and 1986 when he had no coattails 
here wiener said 
but michigan gop chairman spencer abraham said he thought reagan 
had been fortunate to be able to take such a highprofile role in 
bushs presidential campaign noting that lyndon johnson in 1968 
had become a political liability and that he likely could not 
have been used in hubert h humphreys behalf even if both men had 
wanted that

judging by some of the television ads the 
presidential candidates are running americans have a choice this 
fall between a dangerously naive fringe liberal and an incompetent 
liar with bad judgment 
this years television drive with each candidate planning to 
spend more than 30 million is not only the most expensive but 
arguably the most negative in the modern history of presidential 
campaigning 
on the sunny side massachusetts gov michael dukakis is vowing 
that hes on your side while vice president george bush swears 
that hes ready on day one to be a great president 
but republican bush is also asserting in his ads that america 
cant afford the risk of a dukakis presidency and democrat 
dukakis is belittling not only bushs competence and judgment but 
lately his veracity as well 
while the 30second spot reigns supreme as election day 
approaches particularly in battleground states the candidates are 
also purchasing network time for longer appeals to the nations 
couchpotato contingent 
dukakis gave two fiveminute tv speeches in october and planned 
two more for nov 1 and nov 5 he and bush each have bought a 
halfhour of time on the three major broadcast networks on election 
eve 
dukakis the underdog also was seeking opportunities for 
extended television interviews in an attempt to persuade voters to 
give him another look before making up their minds in one fourday 
period he appeared on two network morning news programs larry 
kings talk show on cable news network for 90 minutes on abcs 
nightline and for 14 minutes of cbs evening news halfhour 
newscast 
bushs advertising has taken a doublebarreled approach from the 
start 
one set of ads presented the softsell bush the family man with 
his grandchildren bush the leader with foreign affairs experience 
bush amid balloons and cheers at the gop convention insisting he 
wants a kinder and gentler nation 
the vice president spelled out his vision of america and we 
reinforced it said veteran media consultant roger ailes who 
heads the bush ad team 
a second set of ads was used in an attempt successful polls 
indicate to demolish the positive impression many voters had of 
dukakis immediately after the democratic national convention 
one ad charged that dukakis made a 6 billion mistake by failing 
to clean up boston harbor another said he gave weekend passes to 
firstdegree murderers who were not even eligible for parole 
opposes the death penalty and vetoed mandatory jail sentences for 
drug dealers 
morerecent spots attacked dukakis tax and furlough policies as 
well as his stands on various defense matters one showed inmates 
walking in and out a revolving door and said that while out many 
committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and many are still 
at large another showed dukakis riding on a tank while a narrator 
said he opposed virtually every defense system we developed 
the tank ad implied dukakis opposed a long list of weapons some 
of which he is on record as supporting and provoked an unusually 
quick response from a campaign widely criticized for failing to 
defend itself 
full of lies and he knows it dukakis said of the tank ad in 
an ad of his own i want to build a strong defense im sure he 
wants to build a strong defense so this isnt about defense issues 
its about dragging the truth into the gutter 
dukakis also struck back on the furlough front with several radio 
and television ads one of them charging that bush has taken a 
furlough from the truth the spot notes that the massachusetts 
program was started by a republican governor and says thousands of 
drug kingpins were released under a federal furlough program while 
bush led the war on drugs including one exinmate who raped and 
murdered a pregnant mother of two 
along the way dukakis has also released tv spots attacking bushs 
record on drugs education social security and the environment his 
role in the irancontra affair and his choice of indiana sen dan 
quayle as his running mate he has released ads of himself talking 
simply into the camera about day care education and americas 
economic status in the world and hes run a series of packaging 
of george bush ads designed to depict bush as a creature of his 
handlers 
the disjointed nature of dukakis media campaign has reflected 
confusion and friction in his advertising ranks as well as the lack 
of a basic message for his candidacy but his ads have become 
feistier and more focused as his poll standings fall honing in on 
economic populism and championing middleclass causes 
there is an overarching theme maintains dukakis ad chief 
david dalessandro michael dukakis is on the side of the majority 
of the people his theme is that we must regain our stature and 
our ability to perform as a country

the morning of nov 10 1938 fritz 
kleinmann saw synagogues aflame by afternoon the 15yearold boy 
and his father had been arrested and beaten by nazis within months 
fritz his father and thousands of other austrian jews were deported 
to the buchenwald concentration camp 
in april 1945 kleinmann was freed from the dreaded mauthausen 
the third death camp in his ghoulish odyssey through nazi terror he 
weighed just 77 pounds 
today kleinmann 65 a slender quickwitted man sits in his 
apartment in a nondescript tenement bloc in suburban vienna and 
recalls how his terror began on the night now called kristallnacht 
in the morning of nov 10 we saw two synagogues burning in the 
leopoldstadt then a largely jewish district of vienna then we 
waited for the knock on the door 
in the afternoon i was arrested so was my father after i was 
maltreated at police headquarters i was allowed to go home 
because i was only 15 
a day later police released kleinmanns father who two decades 
earlier had been seriously wounded and decorated as a soldier in the 
austrohungarian army 
those world war i decorations did not impress the nazis when 
kleinmann and many of his family were deported the next year 
half of my family were gassed including one sister and my 
mother kleinmann said another sister and a younger brother 
escaped and ended up in the united states where they still live 
they burned synagogues and other places of worship it was 
terrible howling people were standing by screaming 
antisemitic slogans kleinman recalled 
the firefighters arrived all right but they were under orders 
not to extinguish the synagogue fires they protected nearby 
buildings from catching fire until the jewish temples were burned 
out 
speaking the broad german dialect of the viennese working class 
kleimann said the officially endorsed pogrom was a welcome 
opportunity for many viennese to vent their antisemitism they 
looted and stole from jews humiliated and mistreated them 
the terrible thing was that our neighbors my friends my 
fathers friends were among those beating us vilifying us 
spitting at us young people who had been my playmates were suddenly 
nazis who turned against us he said 
unlike in germany the nazis in vienna then home to some 200000 
jews did not wait for kristallnacht to start burning and 
ransacking existing nazi documents and data in viennas fire 
department show numerous jewish temples were devastated in october 
that year 
on oct 16 firemen were called to extinguish a fire involving 
the community temple records show 
according to a report on kristallnacht by austrian jews some 
7800 people were arrested and an unknown number killed in vienna 
alone the detained were taken to socalled collection camps and 
brutally treated while 4083 vienna shops were plundered the 
report found 
some 680 people many of them jews committed suicide on nov10 
and subsequent days said the report by intellectuals camp 
survivors and members of the jewish community 
many synagogues some of them local landmarks were completely 
gutted with mobs throwing hand grenades to set them ablaze 
it was only this year that vienna city authorities unveiled 
plaques to mark remind citizens of the sites where synagogues stood 
50 years ago but kleinmann and the few who survived the holocaust 
never forgot 
it took only three weeks after the nazi anschluss of march 1938 
for kleinmann to lose his apprenticeship in house decorating his 
fathers trade 
like tens of thousands of others he was jobless because he was a 
jew his family was too poor to emigrate and survived on meals from 
a jewish relief service 
at first aryan friends helped kleinmanns father survive 
slipping him illegal work soon the help turned to scorn and 
insults 
kleinmanns two sisters were often picked up by nazi patrols 
mostly former friends for rubbing the practice of forcing jews 
to rub walls pavements and cobblestone roads to remove painted 
slogans predating the nazi annexation 
i remember that one day i asked a former friend why he was 
picking up my sister kleinmann said he said he was ordered to 
get hold of the girl by a nazi cell foreman whom she had once 
refused to kiss in the doorway

demonstrations is an economic crisis blamed in large measure on the 
plummeting price of oil 
almost 95 percent of algerias export earnings come from 
petroleum and the value of these exports has fallen by more than 40 
percent since 1981 from 141 billion to 84 billion last year 
if movements in the dollars value and world inflation are taken 
into account the real purchasing power of these earnings now is 
barely onethird of what it was eight years ago 
the drop in prices was particularly hard on this north african 
nation because it was in the middle of several huge development 
projects the current account balance which had shown a surplus of 
more than 1 billion in 1985 fell 148 billion into the red in 
1986 
meanwhile algerias population is among the fastest growing in 
the world since 1980 the country has grown by 256 percent from 
187 million people in 1980 to nearly 24 million today the 
population has more than doubled since the country won independence 
from france in 1962 
about 60 percent of the country is younger than 20 and many of 
these people took to the streets in october to protest the falling 
standard of living rising unemployment inflation and food 
shortages all related to the sharp drop in oil revenue 
more than 150 people were killed hundreds were injured and an 
estimated 3000 people were arrested in nearly a week of 
demonstrations that rocked the capital and many smaller towns 
the riots prompted apparent government reforms president chadli 
bendjedid who came to power in 1979 announced a nov 3 referendum 
on what reporters describe as broad democratization 
algeria is only the latest victim of violence prompted by falling 
oil prices other countries including egypt nigeria and tunisia 
have suffered similar unrest and upheaval 
an international monetary fund report published in 1987 noted 
that the drop in the prices of oil and other raw materials cost 
third world countries nearly 100 billion in 1986 the loss of 
revenue came against a backdrop of sharply declining international 
lending to developing countries 
algeria is committed to a program of trade not aid and is 
seeking to win back revenues by substitute other exports such as 
uranium 
the country has declined rescheduling payments on its 20 billion 
foreign debt servicing costs swallow up nearly 60 percent of its 
export revenue 
algeria also imports most of its food at a cost of more than 1 
billion a year

the three major networks will project a winner in 
the presidential race statebystate as polls close but refrain 
from declaring a winner overall until west coast voters cast their 
ballots unless there is a landslide 
if one candidate racks up enough electoral votes for victory 
based on projections in states where polls have already closed the 
networks will not refrain from stating the obvious 
were not going to tell the viewer that she has to sit there 
with a calculator and add it up said michael gartner the new 
president of nbc news 
abc cbs and nbc will preempt entertainment programming on 
election night nov 8 and begin coverage with their 7 pm est 
newscasts 
cnn which as a policy does not project election winners will 
run its election coverage from 5 pm until 5 am pbs will have 
updates throughout the evening 
the controversy over network projections arose in 1980 when 
california residents reportedly walked off lines at polling places 
when they heard the networks project ronald reagan as the winner 
over jimmy carter theoretically the outcome of close state and 
local races could have been affected 
in fact carter conceded the election hours before polls closed 
on the west coast 
but the controversy prompted congress to consider legislation 
setting a national uniform pollclosing time the heads of the news 
divisions of abc cbs and nbc testified in 1985 in favor of the law 
and gave its sponsors a handshake agreement that they would not 
project winners until polls closed 
nbc reignited the controversy this year when it characterized 
the outcome of the new hampshire primary before the polls had 
closed lawrence k grossman then head of the news division said 
the network might not abide by the agreement come november if 
congress did not enact the pollclosing legislation which it has 
not done 
under gartner who took over the news division this summer nbc 
has the same policy as the other networks and all refuse to 
withhold projections of winners statebystate 
a common pollclosing time would solve it because the only 
other way to do it is to say to a news organization what you know 
you cannot report what you know as a fact you cannot report and 
thats a bad thing david burke cbs news new president said 
recently 
assume at 11 oclock at night i have the whole eastern 
seaboard as a fact it isnt a projection i cant withhold it even 
if i wanted to

safety problems at aging federal nuclear 
weapons plants are reaching a critical mass 
production has stopped at major sites and energy department 
officials face a firestorm of criticism from congress the pentagon 
and angry citizens in the 13 states where the complex operates 
tell the truth an irate crowd shouted last week as the 
manager of the energy departments rocky flats plant near denver 
argued that the plants plutonium reprocessing facility was closed 
because of a single contamination incident investigators from 
congress and the environmental protection agency had found very 
serious and repeated safety violations 
we may sometimes not be good at explaining everything 
responded the manager earl whiteman but we damn well tell the 
truth 
department officials are likely to face a lot more disbelief as 
they struggle to restart nuclear reactors that produce the plutonium 
and tritium needed for the nations nuclear arsenal 
neither is being produced now and tritium a radioactive isotope 
of hydrogen may be in critically short supply as early as next 
summer according to congressional sources 
federal officials also are likely to face rising anger as they 
grapple with the daunting task of cleaning up 45 years worth of 
radioactive contamination a job the energy department says could 
cost 110 billion 
if the manahattan project which produced atomic bombs at the end 
of world war ii was an example of what the united states can do 
when it focuses its technological genius then the current mess in 
nuclear weapons production may epitomize what can happen when such 
activities are shrouded for decades in secrecy and bureaucracy 
this crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period and 
it stems from inadequate attention to maintenance safety and 
operating conditions 31 members of the house armed services 
committee said in a letter thursday to energy secretary john s 
herrington 
the national academy of sciences in a report requested by 
congress described the complex last year as a looseknit system 
of largely selfregulated contractors under little control of the 
energy department 
the complex comprising many potentially dangerous elements 
operated under a regime dictated not by safety concerns but by the 
need to produce nuclear weapons for the arms race the academy said 
not only were the reactors and other facilities older than those 
in the civilian sector the report said but they were free of the 
strict controls imposed by the nuclear regulatory commission on 
utilities after the neardisaster at three mile island on march 28 
1979 
the energy department is the latest in a line of civilian 
agencies that have built and managed the plants that turn out an 
estimated 1800 nuclear weapons a year for the pentagon under a 78 
billion budget 
the complex which now employs about 90000 people in 13 states 
at three laboratories two test sites two reactor complexes and 13 
other sites was born in 1943 in the desert at los alamos nm 
where manhattan project scientists labored in remote secrecy 
two other weapons laboratories were added at livermore calif 
and sandia nm and the government began operating two reactor 
complexes the hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash in 
1944 and the savannah river plant in aiken sc a decade later 
other materials are produced at the feed materials production 
center in fernald ohio the ashtabula plant ashtubula ohio the 
y12 plant and oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant at oak ridge 
tenn the idaho national engineering laboratory idaho falls 
idaho the paducah gaseous diffusion plant in paducah ky and the 
portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in piketon ohio 
at the next step the rocky flats plant near denver processes 
plutonium and assembles primary devices the y12 plant manufactures 
secondstage components the mound facility in miamisburg ohio 
makes detonators and firing circuit components the kansas city 
plant in kansas city mo makes nonnuclear parts and the 
pinellas plant in st petersburg fla makes neutron generators 
according to the nuclear weapons databook written by tom b 
cochran of the national resources defense council 
all the components are shipped to the pantex plant near 
amarillo texas assembled into warheads and given to the defense 
department according to the nrdc a private environmental group in 
washington 
nuclear devices are tested underground at two sites in nye 
county nevada the nevada test range and the tonopah test range 
congress has ordered that the energy department review all the 
sites and produce a report by middecember on which to modernize and 
which if any to close said department spokesman will callicott 
energy department plans do not call for the construction of a new 
generation of nuclear weapons reactors until well into the next 
decade a 32 billion facility at savannah river and a 36 billion 
facility in idaho budget austerity could cause further delays or 
cancellation of one site 
the public and congress began to complain of serious problems in 
the nuclear weapons production complex years ago although most 
attention has focused on problems at hanford savannah river 
fernald and rocky flats an energy department report issued in june 
cited problems at nearly every facility and said remedying them 
would cost 66 billion to 110 billion 
the biggest expense will be at the hanford reservation where all 
nine reactors have been closed down in january 1987 engineers 
placed the last of them the nreactor in cold standby 25 
years after it entered operation 
the energy department in 19000 pages of documents released in 
february 1986 detailed significant spills of radioactive material 
over 43 years particularly during the cold war years when secrecy 
was the byword and the health hazards of radiation were not as well 
understood as they are today 
the cost of upgrading and decontaminating the hanford reservation 
was forecast by the energy department at 24 billion through 1995 
with further corrective actions forecast as high as 46 billion over 
50 years 
department officials have estimated that it could take 18 months 
to restart nreactor if it were needed 
the other reactor complex savannah river faces problems that 
are almost as serious all three reactors there have been shut down 
none will be allowed to run at above 50 percent power in the future 
and a select team of engineers is trying to design new safety 
procedures for a monthlong phased startup of one reactor 
starting no earlier than december 
the cost of correcting problems at savannah river and cleaning up 
contamination is expected to run to 36 billion through 1985 and as 
high as 88 billion thereafter

another alarming situation exists at fernald about 20 miles from 
cincinnati workers struck the plant nearly a month ago 
interrupting production 
the state of ohio on behalf of the 14000 people living near the 
plant has filed a 300 million lawsuit against the federal 
contractor there national lead based on admissions by the energy 
department in january 1985 that the facility spewed at least 200000 
pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the air the 
department also said the plant leaked radioactive waste into the 
ground possibly endangering the great miami river aquifer which 
supplies water for communities throughout southwestern ohio 
ohio gov richard celeste earlier this month demanded that the 
energy department close down the plant but thought better of the 
idea last monday and asked the feds to stick around to clean up the 
mess 
i shudder to think what would happen if the department of 
defense washed its hands of this facility said celeste we know 
that a cleanup can be accomplished and the people best to do it 
are the people who work here 
the cleanup and corrective costs at fernald have been estimated 
by the energy department at 11 billion through 1995 and 12 
billion thereafter 
lesser problems have been reported at two nearby plants in 
dayton and portsmouth and the department envisioned no cleanup 
costs for the remaining ohio plant at ashtabula 
meanwhile problems at the rocky flats plant are snowballing 
building 771 where plutonium is reprocessed was closed down after 
two workers suffered lowgrade contamination sept 29 
pat echart a spokesman for contractor rockwell international 
said the 6000 employees at the plant have continued working at 
other buildings on the site among their jobs processing plutonium 
for nuclear triggers 
last august it was disclosed that energy department officials 
had considered shutting down rocky flats because of repeated safety 
violations and lax attitudes charges that were repeated in a 
congressional study released earlier this month 
safety complaints at the plant jumped sixfold from 1982 to 1987 
officials of the united steel workers local 8031 announced in march 
1987 
the environmental protection agency meanwhile reported last 
june that 103 wastedisposal sites needed to be cleaned up the 
energy department has estimated the cost of cleanup and correction 
there at 576 million to 900 million through 1995 plus 185 
million subsequently 
at other facilities 
the pinellas plant on central floridas gulf coast grabbed 
national headlines in 1983 when the house energy committee reported 
that its security system failed in a series of mock attacks 
security has been tightened there but investigators have 
reported that radioactive and toxic wastes from the 100acre site 
had seeped into boca ciega bay a popular residential and 
recreational area the cost of cleaning and correcting the seepage 
and coping with other waste problems is forecast to cost 424 
million through 1995 and up to 9 million thereafter 
environmental improvement at the oak ridge site in tennessee is 
expected to cost 13 billion through 1995 with much of the money 
going to locating buried nuclear waste and cleaning up sediment 
ponds four research reactors at oak ridge have been closed down 
early atomic weapons tests at the nevada test site were 
conducted above ground residents of nearby southern utah contend 
the tests caused increased incidences of cancer in their communities 
and among veterans who watched the explosions tests are conducted 
belowground now although there have been reports of venting in 
which radioactive material escaped to the surface 
environmental costs at the test sites are estimated at 634 
million through 1995 and up to 750 million thereafter

beetlejuice warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated pg 
 
if a newlydeceased yuppie couple finds their laura ashleyesque 
new england home occupied by a new family with decorating taste so 
bad it could awaken the dead who ya gonna call 
beetlejuice 
and not a bad call at that with a hilarious michael keaton 
starring in the title role of this wacky film which pokes fun at 
life and death in the 1980s and leaves you puzzled whether theres 
any important difference between those two states 
beetlejuice opens with adam and barbara maitland perishing 
when they drive their standardissue yuppie volvo stationwagon off a 
wooden bridge upon dying the first thing they learn is that the 
crucial difference between life and death is that ghosts seem to 
assume pastel tones and dress more flamboyantly 
they then learn that they are to spend the next 125 years 
haunting the home they so lovingly decorated that sounds ok at 
first but that fate turns hellish when an upscale manhattan couple 
named deetz and their deathobsessed daughter move in and threaten 
the decor with the most tacky taste imaginable 
the rest of the film describes how the maitlands played in 
lowkey fashion by alec baldwin and geena davis fail miserably in 
their efforts to scare the deetzes out and finally enlist the help 
of the oversexed supersleezy poltergeist beetlejuice 
for all its zaniness the film isnt as funny as the plot 
suggests especially in the long dry spells when keaton isnt on 
screen 
but see beetlejuice for three reasons catherine ohara of 
sctv fame who plays mrs deetz to tacky perfection film great 
sylvia sidney who has a terrific cameo as the maitlands guidance 
counselor from the other side and above all keaton 
beetlejuice is rated pg for mildly racy language

news that the economy expanded during the summer at the slowest 
pace in nearly two years has driven the dollar to its lowest point 
since late june 
the commerce department said wednesday taht the gross national 
product the broadest measure of the economy grew at a modest 22 
percent annual rate in the third quarter financial market forecasts 
widely expected a 3 percent to 35 percent rise 
slower growth reduces the chance that the federal reserve will 
raise interest rates to cool off inflation and lower us rates 
would reduce demand for dollars 
the dollar was quoted in late new york trading at 12571 japanese 
yen down from 12680 yen late tuesday 
by contrast the bond market which usually rallies at signs of 
slower growth rose only modestly the yield on the treasurys 
closely watched 30year bond slipped to 890 percent from 893 
percent late tuesday 
in other economic developments wednesday 
the labor department reported that family earnings increased a 
median 23 a week or 4 percent slightly less than the consumer 
price inflation rate of 42 percent in the past 12 months 
the census bureau said nearly 19 billion changes hands in the 
united states yearly as family members help one another such as 
children aiding aging parents or mom and dad helping offspring start 
a household 
the government said firstyear base wage increases excluding 
costofliving adjustments averaged 33 percent in major union 
contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year 
the reagan administration hoping a buoyant economy will propel 
george bush into the white house played down the significance of 
the new gnp report blaming much of the sluggishness on temporary 
factors such as the drought 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner predicted economic growth 
would pick up again in the final three months of the year 
reflecting further improvement on the trade front and continued 
consumer and business spending 
private economists generally agreed with that assessment saying 
the slowdown was a welcome development because it should help to 
ease inflationary pressures that had been building because of tight 
labor markets and high factory operating rates 
a price index tied to the gnp indicated inflation moderated in 
the third quarter the index which reflects changing consumption 
patterns rose at an annual rate of 44 percent down from a 55 
percent rate of increase from april through june 
the reagan administration has been forecasting the overall 
economy would expand at a 35 percent annual rate in 1988 giving 
the country the best performance since 1984 also a presidential 
election year gnp grew 34 percent last year

the man who soon will take the helm of 
beleaguered brokerage smith barney inc says the firm can succeed in 
the hotly competitive investment business by serving specific 
markets instead of the masses 
smith barney is a really sound organization it has been around 
for 114 years frank g zarb said in a recent interview there 
is room in this business for a highquality firm that is in selected 
areas and is not trying to be all things to all people 
zarb 53 a prominent wall street figure who served as energy 
czar under president gerald ford will be working for oldtime 
acquaintance sanford i weill effective nov 1 as chairman and 
chief executive of smith barney 
weill is chairman of commercial credit group inc which is 
acquiring smith barneys parent primerica corp weill 55 will be 
chairman president and chief executive officer of the merged 
company while gerald tsai jr chairman of primerica will be a 
director and chairman of the executive committee 
weill created the brokerage firm that now is shearson lehman 
hutton inc and zarb worked in various capacities at its predecessor 
firms in addition to serving as president fords chief energy 
administrator zarb currently is an adviser to congress and several 
foreign governments 
smith barney a midsize investment bank specializing in retail 
brokerage and municipal finance disbanded its arbitrage department 
which essentially speculated on takeover stocks after losing 43 
million in last years stock market crash smith barney posted a 15 
million profit in the first quarter of this year and a 3 million 
loss in the second quarter 
analysts say zarb has his work cut out for him 
greenwichbased primerica acquired smith barney last year for 
750 million loading itself up with new debt just months before the 
stock market crash and subsequent slowdown in the securities 
business 
the success of smith barney is regarded as a swing factor for the 
profit of the entire corporation 
the key to success there is to control the operating expenses 
and try to generate additional revenues from high margin 
businesses said david hochstim equity analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton in san francisco 
hochstim said smith barney needs a strong merger and acqusitions 
department to boost its earnings 
thats not something that is easily built overnight he said 
in a telephone interview from his san francisco officethey have a 
good retail sales force a good equity research department but they 
are not a real force in mampa mergers and acqusitions or investment 
banking and thats where the money is being made 
but he also said the announcement of the merger between primerica 
and commercial credit already had benefited smith barney 
one of the key points is that since the announced merger 
morale at smith barney has improved dramatically and thats worth a 
lot he said you no longer have people worrying about their 
jobs and future theyre back to work 
other analysts say smith barney needs to be a fullservice firm 
right now it doesnt offer a full line of financial products but 
zarb disagrees 
full service implies a large warehouse that does everything for 
everyone whether they do it well or not zarb said thats not 
what were going to do 
i want to build on what has been a very old and fine reputation 
and built it into a firm in the 1990s that will be an important 
participant in the upper ends of the marketplace he said 
weill and tsai say zarbs record and leadership qualities are 
what smith barney needs 
frank has two characteristics that i think are key weill 
said in an interview earlier this week number one he is a leader 
and i think a leader is a person who knows how to listen and get the 
most out of people and move something from point a to point b 
number two frank is a winner he started in shearsons back 
officeand take that through his success in government he was 
assistant secretary of labor and left as energy czar on the 
presidents federal energy administration weill said 
im convinced he will bring in new talent and motivate the 
current management team tsai said in an interview wednesday 
its a difficult market and if everybody is having a tough time 
and you have a new breath of fresh airi think he will do a lot

corporate takeovers financed with debt produce 
shortterm profits on wall street but handicap us manufacturers as 
they battle foreign competitors the chairman of steelmaker usx 
corp says 
its absolutely critical that we strengthen our manufacturing 
sector david roderick said wednesday 
in leveraged buyouts where the targets assets and future 
earnings are often pledged as collateral for loans you load those 
companies with debt the head of the steel and oil company said 
that meansyou have to cut all spending in order to service 
the debt you cut the research you cut the capital spending he 
said at usx managements quarterly news conference 
is it desirable in a competitive world where we are fighting 
for our manufacturing lives the answer is no its going to make us 
progressively less competitive in those sectors that are being taken 
over with the use of debt 
even in light of the recent takeover frenzy involving 
multibillion dollar battles for such huge manufacturers as rjr 
nabisco inc and kraft inc roderick does not favor regulating 
corporate takeovers even though he believes they reflect 
shortsightedness 
usx itself could be a takeover target roderick said the stock 
market has undervalued the companys stock which closed at 28 a 
share down 50 cents on wednesday in new york stock exchange trading 
takeover strategist carl icahn who has held an 114 percent 
stake in usx since 1986 seems content with his investment and has 
not renewed his threat to make an offer for the company roderick 
said 
the usx chairman who dines occasionally with icahn said icahns 
apparent reluctance to make a run at the company is not the result 
of any personal courtesy to roderick who will retire next spring 
i would assume that mr icahn will ultimately do what he thinks 
is good for mr icahn roderick said 
i remember carl told me at one pointif you want a friend on 
wall street you buy a dog 
the shift in the us economy from manufacturing to service 
industries should not be allowed to go too far roderick said 
you canthave manufacturing disappear how do you defend the 
country and lead the world in freeworld defense by knowing how to 
make hamburgers he said 
ninetytwo percent of the nonmedical research done in this 
country is done by manufacturing roderick said you dont have 
to research a lot if youre talking about travelers checks or 
barbers

pending sales of two governmentowned 
copper mines could bring debtridden mexico 2 billion a government 
spokesman says 
the winning bidders for mexicana de cobre and compania minera de 
cananea will be announced next tuesday the government said 
wednesday bidding on the two mines in northern sonora state closed 
today 
the announcement ended speculation that the government had 
changed its mind on the controversial sale 
jose romero contente of the government development bank nacional 
financiera said he expects mexicana de cobre will be sold for at 
least 11 billion while not less than 910 million will be accepted 
for compania minera de cananea mexicos most historic mine 
the two companies have debts totaling about 2 billion romero 
contente said but are considered good investments mainly because of 
the price of copper is rising in world markets 
under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help mexico 
overcome its economic crisis president miguel de la madrid has sold 
many governmentowned companies most of them money losers to 
private investors most of mexicos 104 billion foreign debt is 
owed by the government 
romero contente said the mine sales would be the crowning 
achievement in de la madrids reprivatization plan 
either one of those is the biggest sale by any government in 
latin america in history romero contente said by telephone 
wednesday from mexico city 
they signify an important part of de la madrids pledge to 
reduce the size of the public sector said romero contente 
coordinator of the mine sales for nacional financiera or nafinsa 
but the sale has met opposition in cananea 25 miles south of the 
arizona border where the martyrs of 1906 have not been 
forgotten 
a bloody strike at what was then the americanowned cananea 
consolidated copper co 82 years ago has come to symbolize the birth 
of mexicos nationalistic spirit and union movement 
at least 11 men died in the strike launched by mexican miners 
who got paid less than american workers at the mine 
joaquin quijano salazar general secretary of the powerful 
national miners union section 65 that represents the 3000 unionized 
workers at cananea said in a recent interview that the union would 
oppose the sale 
they can sell a company but they cant sell workers quijano 
said in a telephone interview last month we hope they dont find 
someone to sell it to 
calls to quijanos office at the mine did not go through 
wednesday 
romero contente said nafinsa has had no problem with the union 
it knows the federal governments policy 
two companies have bid on cananea penoles and protexa which is 
based in this northern nuevo leon state capital 
protexas 910 million finanincing package was rejected this 
summer by nafinsa which led to speculation that the mine would not 
be sold during the current administration that ends dec 1 
romero contente said four companies have put deposits of nearly 
11000 for the right to bid thursday on mexicana de cobre

the management of wickes cos inc 
who failed in their own bid to buy the company have approved the 
sale of the retail and manufacturing conglomerate to two new york 
investment groups for 27 billion 
the agreement by blackstone capital partners and wasserstein 
perella partners to buy wickes followed by 12 days the termination 
of the managementled effort to put the company under private 
ownership 
wickes announcement wednesday suggested the agreement would 
result in the departure of chairman sanford sigoloff who brought 
the company out of bankruptcy in 1985 and organized the failed 
management buyout 
the agreement calls for blackstone and wasserstein perella to pay 
1125 a share in cash for 80 percent of wickes 498 million 
shares the remaining stock would be converted to preferred stock in 
wci holdings corp the company formed to handle the purchase 
the buyers would also assume wickes debt bringing the total 
value of the deal to 27 billion 
wickes stock closed at 937 a share on the new york stock 
exchange wednesday up 150 from tuesdays close 
the management offer of 12 per share was withdrawn after wickes 
lowered its 1988 earnings forecast by 40 million 
analysts said it appeared the blackstonewasserstein perella 
agreement would end speculation about potential buyers and the 
possibility the company could be broken up and some pieces sold 
these are reputable people and it looks like a real deal 
said anthony pearcebatten who tracks wickes for the investment 
firm legg mason wood walker inc in baltimore

cochairmen of wickes according to a company release which did not 
address sigoloffs future 
wickes spokesman michael sitrick refused to discuss sigoloffs 
status and said the executive was declining interviews

builders emporium home improvement stores in southern california and 
has groups that make automotive fabrics wallpaper and aircraft 
parts 
cochairmen will be james r birle 52 a blackstone partner and

great western bank the nations 
third largest savings and loan says it wants to leave the troubled 
federal system that bails out failed thrifts and to join the 
insurance system for commercial banks 
the move would save great western at least 27 million a year in 
insurance premiums and send a message to congress that the nations 
healthy thrifts are fed up with paying to rescue faltering often 
badly managed sampls analysts said 
this is a very important statement said peter treadway an 
analyst for the investment firm of smith barney harris upham in new 
york this is a signal that great western is not going to put up 
with any more nonsense and have its net worth stolen without a 
fight 
great western said wednesday it has applied for permission to 
drop federal savings and loan insurance corp coverage of deposits 
in its 263 retail branches in california florida and arizona in 
favor of insurance by the federal deposit insurance corp which 
covers most banks and some thrifts 
at least one other big california thrift san diegobased home 
federal savings amp loan association was considering pulling out of 
the fslic but was prevented from doing so immediately by its 
charter 
most savings institutions are barred by congress from leaving the 
fslic although great western says it is exempt from that rule 
great westerns action appeared unlikely to mark the beginning of 
a mass exodus from the fslic which faces 50 billion to 100 
billion in bailout costs but the move was seen to have great 
symbolic significance as members of congress are expected this 
session to put a high priority on the issue of thrift bailouts 
this is sure to get the attention of the federal home loan bank 
board and congress said norman coulson chief executive of 
glendale federal savings amp loan association congress has got to 
address this problem sooner or later they cant continue tapping 
the healthy thrifts forever 
james montgomery chairman of parent great western financial 
corp said the application was made to protect the firms 
stockholders from special insurance levies 
the insurance switch if approved wouldnt affect customers or 
employees but would save the parent company and its stockholders 
about 26 million a year in special fslic premiums said spokesman 
ian campbell 
great western is among about 40 of the nations 3200 sampls that 
filed documents making them eligible for exemptions from the ban on 
defections from the fslic that was imposed by congress in august 
1987 and renewed aug 10 
about 10 sampls none of them as large as great western have left 
the fslic to be insured by the fdic while retaining their savings 
and loan charters 
what irks healthy thrifts are the high fslic premiums they are 
charged to offset the losses of a minority troubled thrifts those 
premiums run about 2 times more than those assessed by the fdic 
both the fslic and the fdic insure customers accounts up to 
100000 but while the thirft insurer is insolvent the fdic 
expects to have at least 15 billion in reserves by the end of the 
year 
great western financial based in beverly hills is the nations 
no 3 thrift holding company with 31 billion in assets and 900 
offices nationwide it focuses its business in industrys 
traditional area of home mortgages as opposed to aggressive and 
sometimes shaky thrifts that have made commercial loans 
great western said it would accomplish the insurance switch by 
merging its california florida and arizona retail operations into a 
small thrift subsidiary in washington state that already has fdic 
insurance 
in california defections from the fslic are hampered by state 
thrift laws which dont allow statechartered sampls to carry fdic 
insurance

textile giant west pointpepperell inc facing a 
takeover fight with farley inc has created a financial cushion for 
more than 14 percent of its employees who might find themselves 
without a job under a new owner 
however pepperell said tuesday the severance pay package has 
nothing to do with the 14 billion tender offer announced monday by 
farley one of the nations largest privately held conglomerates 
d michael roark pepperells vice president of human resources 
said the severance plan was adopted by the board last week 
this is not something we did in response to bill farley 
roark said william farley heads the conglomerate which owns 
underwear manufacturer fruit of the loom and other companies 
we had been talking about the plan in the management group 
for several months roark said in a telephone interview from the 
companys pepperell ga headquarters 
this was not and we dont now consider it shark 
repellent he said referring to jargon used to describe tactics 
companies use to fend off corporate raiders 
a farley spokesman said the company would have no comment on the 
provision 
roark said the plan which guarantees at least three months pay 
to some 5900 salaried and clerical employees would not involve 
enough money to dissuade a suitor however he had no estimate on 
the amount of money involved saying it would depend on how many 
employees were involved and their level of seniority 
the decision fits in with a series of moves pepperell has taken 
this year to strengthen its ability to fight a takeover 
in june the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which 
would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a 
dividend to current stockholders the poison pill plan would 
take effect as soon as a tender offer is launched or if someone 
purchases 10 percent of pepperell stock 
farley notified the company in may it was seeking up to 25 
percent of pepperell stock and so far has spent 88 million for 98 
percent of the stock 
the company is also one of the first to adopt georgias new 
antitakeover law enacted by the legislature principally at the 
urging of textile industry lobbyists the main provision of the law 
which took effect in march limits a new owners ability to sell off 
parts of a company for five years 
pepperell also has had in place for some time socalled golden 
parachutes for executives including a 139 million payout to 
chief executive officer joseph l lanier jr if he were to be fired 
by new owners 
the new state law and the poison pill plan have been 
challenged by farley in federal court and a pepperell stockholder 
who filed a suit in state superior court tuesday claiming 
stockholders are deprived of the highest possible stock price 
the severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled 
clerical workers 
pepperell is the nations largest publicly held textile and 
apparel company earlier this year the company and the investment 
group odyssey partners inc jointly acquired jp stevens amp co inc

cents a share on sales of 701 billion during the julyseptember 
period this year during the threemonth period last year chrysler

billion

of incentives which the company used extensively to lure buyers 
into showrooms and the closing for the entire period of the newark 
del assembly plant the company had a heavier proportion of fleet 
sales over more profitable individual car sales 
general motors corp was expected to announce its thirdquarter 
results today a day after no 2 ford motor co posted a 218 
percent rise in its thirdquarter earnings its 10th straight 
report of record quarterly profits 
for the first nine months of this year chryslers earnings fell 
344 percent to 6166 million or 277 a share from 9395 
million or 433 a share last year sales for the first nine 
months of 1988 amounted to 2317 billion compared with 1861 
billion in 1987 a 245 percent increase

166 million it earned during the januaryseptember period last year

or 853 a share on sales of 609 billion up 122 percent from 
earnings of 37 billion or 717 a share on sales of 529 billion 
during the januaryseptember period last year 
david mccammon fords vice president for finance and treasurer 
said the company continued to do well overseas especially in europe 
and south america 
we do have a declining profit margin in the united states and 
thats been the case all year he said the overseas margin has 
been increasing because of outstanding results this year in europe 
and also latin america has come back substantially 
ford said it earned 384 million from its overseas operations in 
the third quarter of 1988 up 249 percent from the 110 million 
earned overseas during the period last year 
the company earned 472 million from its us operations down 
204 percent from the 593 million it earned in the julyseptember 
period last year 
because of the depressed us results profit sharing for 
unionized workers will be down this year compared with last 
mccammon said although he wasnt specific about just how much a 
worker would receive he said it would fall somewhere between the 
3700 average per worker in 1987 and the 2100 average the year 
before 
mccammon blamed much of the us decline on development of new 
products lower earnings by the companys financial services group 
and higher production of lowerprofit cars 
he said that during the quarter ford produced 30 percent fewer 
of its highprofit thunderbirds than it did last year and made more 
lowerprofit ford tempos and mercury topazes

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co took its 203 
billion takeover offer directly to rjr nabisco incs stockholders 
today after managers of the consumer products giant ended talks 
with the investment firm 
nabiscos management said it would continue to work with its 
investment adviser shearson lehman hutton inc on its own buyout 
proposal 
in an advertisement appearing in the wall street journal 
kohlberg kravis said its offer was conditioned on nabiscos board 
supporting the bid but corporate america was watching the fight 
closely to see how far the firm would go to protect its position as 
the nations premier leveraged buyout firm 
since its founding in 1976 kohlberg kravis has not acquired a 
company without the support of the targets board although the firm 
gradually has become more aggressive in its deal making 
kohlberg kravis had announced monday that it might begin the 
90ashare tender offer that was just four days after nabisco said 
its top managers were considering trying to buy the company for 75 
a share which would be worth 17 billion 
nabisco stock edged up 12 cents a share to 8487 in early 
trading today on the new york stock exchange 
the sheer size of kohlberg kraviss bid for nabisco has forced 
corporations to reassess their own vulnerability 
theres been a gradual awakening over the past week that if 
deals above 10 billion are successful it gives credibility to even 
larger deals and its getting down to almost a handful of companies 
that are secure based on sheer size alone said one top takeover 
lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to one takeover specialist who spoke on condition he 
not be identified kohlberg kravis is attempting to keep bidding 
on bigger and bigger deals so other people in leveraged buyout 
business cant compete with them theyd like to be thought of as 
the only ones that come to mind when its a superbig deal 
the stakes are high with nabisco not only are the potential 
financial rewards astronomical but there is the cachet that comes 
with succeeding in a deal that carries a gargantuan price tag and 
on a more subtle level are the egos of those who are driven to 
establish new benchmarks 
supervising the firms proposal is henry kravis as prominent on 
the new york social circuit as he is in the takeover game he is 
widely expected to go the distance to protect his companys lockup 
of megasized leveraged buyouts 
kravis was particularly miffed that nabisco was working with 
shearson because he had been interested in the atlantabased food 
and tobacco conglomerate for some time kravis first broached the 
subject of leading a nabisco buyout a year ago over dinner with 
nabiscos johnson 
nabiscos decision to stick with shearson even after meeting with 
kravis pits him against his onetime skiing partner shearson 
chairman peter cohen 
the sometimes abrasive cohen has let slip in the press his 
astonishment that kravis would be such a tough competitor after 
skiing and socializing with him but those who know them wonder just 
how close the pair was 
they are competitors in the same arena they know one another 
but i dont know if they are good friends theyre both very cool 
individuals a takeover specialist said 
cohen is benefiting from shearsons more subtle ties to nabisco 
in addition to having the support of the management team nabiscos 
johnson is said to be a close friend of james robinson chairman of 
american express co shearsons parent 
in an earlier era kohlberg kravis worked on the same side of the 
fence as shearson within the past year kohlberg kravis acquired jim 
walter corp for 243 billion as shearson served as the boards 
banker and shearson served in the same capacity when kohlberg 
kravis acquired stop amp shop cos for 12 billion

britains merchandise trade deficit narrowed 
sharply and unexpectedly in september partly helped by erratic 
items such as exports of aircraft repairs and precious stones the 
government said thursday 
the pound and british stock prices shot up on the news which 
somewhat eased growing concerns about britains ballooning trade 
shortfall the pounds jump in turn diminished fears that interest 
rates would head even higher 
the trade deficit narrowed to 106 billion pounds or 187 
billion in september from 181 billion pounds in august the 
department of trade and industry said 
the financial markets had expected the deficit to widen slightly 
the current account deficit narrowed to 560 million pounds from 
131 billion pounds the department said 
the current account includes invisible trade such as 
services overseas investment earnings and official transfer 
payments which the government estimated to be in surplus of 500 
million pounds in the most recent month 
exports totaled 756 billion pounds in september up from 675 
billion pounds in august imports totaled 862 billion pounds in 
september up from 856 billion pounds in august 
explaining the erratic items the department said planes brought 
here for repair counted as imports in august and became exports last 
month when the work was done 
excluding these items the merchandise trade deficit was 149 
billion pounds in september compared with 166 billion pounds in 
august 
the pound gained almost 15 cents to 17735 in very active 
dealing minutes after the report was released 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index off 56 
points before the report later was up 8 points at 18587 
although markets were heartened by the report david simmonds an 
economist at midland bank said it was too early to conclude that 
britains trade deficit is narrowing significantly he pointed out 
that chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson has said the trade 
deficit could remain large until 1990 
the governments economic policies have come under criticism in 
recent months as inflation has heated up prompting authorities to 
push up interest rates sharply at the same time the trade deficit 
outstripped government forecasts to hit record levels 
opposition labor lawmaker bryan gould party spokesman on trade 
called the latest figures a freak 
since the beginning of 1988 britains merchandise trade balance 
has been in deficit by 139 billion pounds compared with a 
688billionpound deficit a year earlier 
in march lawson predicted the trade deficit for the latest year 
would total 4 billion pounds

americans personal income rose 05 percent in 
september despite a drop in farm income while spending growth was 
the slowest since the october stock market crash the government 
said today 
the commerce department said income rose 199 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 410 trillion last month 
following a weak 03 percent increase in august and a strong 07 
percent jump in july 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt was flat in september at an annual rate 
of 326 trillion following a 06 percent gain in august and a 04 
percent increase the month before that 
it was the weakest month for spending since october 1987 when it 
fell 02 percent analysts had attributed that drop to the shock 
from the stock crash 
the spending data fits in with other statistics showing the 
economy growing more slowly at the end of the third quarter retail 
sales fell in both august and september and overall economic growth 
as measured by the gross national product was an anemic 22 percent 
in the third quarter 
with spending holding steady and income rising americans saved 
more in september than in any month since may the personal savings 
rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 42 percent 
last month up from 38 percent in august 
personal income was held back by a 65 billion decrease in farm 
income an apparent effect of the summer drought even though 
government subsidy payments were unchanged 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income were up 
141 billion or 06 percent in september led by a 08 percent 
jump in manufacturing payrolls 
disposable or aftertax income was up 05 percent last month

four payment months for taxpayers filing quarterly were up 36 
billion compared with an increase of 20 billion in august

the chairman of mcorp a dallasbased bank holding 
company says there is a high probability the company will file for 
reorganization in bankruptcy court or be forced into that action by 
creditors 
i think everybody recognizes that there is a high probability 
that we will be in chapter 11 bankruptcy within 30 days 
chairman gene bishop told the dallas times herald wednesday its 
obvious that we can be forced and that we may not have any choice 
in the interest of protecting our assets and our creditors 
its really the only alternative he said 
there had been recent speculation that the bank holding company 
texas secondlargest behind ncnb texas national bank was forcing 
the reorganization issue to advance its own plan to recapitalize 
chapter 11 protection would free the corporation from the threat of 
creditor lawsuits until it could develop a plan to put its finances 
in order 
mcorp announced earlier this week it would stop paying dividends 
to preferred shareholders and would cease payments on about 470 
million in debt that action effectively put the companys creditors 
on notice that they could push mcorp into bankruptcy court after 
nov 21 
when we made the decision last week to quit paying dividends 
and interest on debt that gives us 30 days from that date which 
is nov 21 bishop said 
its sometimes very hard to get the governments attention and 
i do think now that weve got their attention bishop said the 
time clock is running now 
mcorp proposed a recapitalization package earlier this month that 
would include 400 million from the bank holding company itself 
400 million raised from investors and shareholders and an 
undisclosed amount of aid from the federal deposit insurance corp 
analysts have estimated the company would need at least 1 
billion in federal money 
mcorp has set aside 400 million for the rescue and the fdic 
wants the company to spread that money around to its ailing banks 
the regulators are saying we should use our money and 
put it down in the banks and then theyll see what they can do for 
us bishop said they will give us no assurance they will do 
anything 
bishop said mcorp attorneys have told the company to leave the 
money where it is partly for the recapitalization and partly so the 
board wont be sued by creditors upset that the holding company was 
putting all of its assets into its subsidiary banks 
what we hope is that well be able to use that 400 million 
belonging to the holding company in connection with the 
recapitalization of all of the mcorp banks bishop said 
the company could work out its differences with creditors 
preferred shareholders and the fdic in bankruptcy court he said 
mcorp depositors customers and suppliers would not be affected 
by a reorganization proceeding a spokesman said 
the deposits would still be insured by the fdic and it would 
be business as usual the spokesman said

a judge has dismissed fines totaling 690000 
against john morrell amp co for safety problems at its sioux falls 
sd plant the company says 
the fines recommended by the occupational safety and health 
administration in april 1987 were at that time the thirdlargest in 
oshas history they resulted from charges by osha that morrell the 
nations fifthlargest meatpacker had willfully failed to record 
accidents at the sioux falls plant 
but the company which is based here said in a news release 
wednesday that administrative law judge james a cronin ruled 
against osha saying the statute of limitations governing the 
violations had expired 
the company said the judge he added that even if time had not run 
out he would have reduced the fines should to only 11000 
cronin a judge with the osha review commission in denver said 
the agency was incorrect to fine morrell 10000 for each of the 69 
safety violations 
the review commission in the past has said it is fundamentally 
unfair to assess multiple penalties for similar violations 
osha representative terry mikelson said the agency probably will 
appeal cronins ruling to a higher review panel further appeals 
could take the case into the federal court system 
osha is investigating morrell for repetitive motion injuries 
sustained by its workers as well as other alleged physical hazards 
repetitive motion injuries include tendonitis various postural 
strains and carpal tunnel syndrome a debilitating nerve disorder 
they occur when workers repeat the same motions over and over 
steve crim senior vice president at the sioux falls plant said 
we have always felt the fines were grossly unfair and we would win 
our appeal to have them overturned 
morrell chairman milton schloss has said he implemented a safety 
program that sharply reduced injury rates in the past few months

dallas billionaire ross perot has withdrawn a 
request for a temporary order prohibiting electronic data systems 
corp from interfering with his new data processing company perot 
systems 
with wednesdays action perot dropped part of his countersuit to 
a claim filed by eds which argued that by founding the new firm 
perot was violating a noncompetition clause in the agreement he 
signed when he left eds 
in a hearing last week on eds suit a virginia judge ruled that 
perot systems does not violate the agreement as long as it is 
operated on a nonprofit basis until december 1989 
fletcher yarbrough perots attorney said the ruling negated the 
need to seek the preliminary injunction 
eds officials called the move a retreat from a nonsense 
lawsuit 
ross has just got to quit being so mad eds spokesman william 
wright told the dallas times herald theres just so long that you 
can carry on a vendetta like that before it becomes detrimental to 
business 
perots attorneys have contended that eds has tried to put perot 
systems out of business by interfering with pending contracts 
intimidating prospective clients of perot systems and intimidating 
eds employees who might be considering joining perot 
the development is the latest in an ongoing legal battle 
involving perot eds and general motors corp eds parent company 
the dispute centers around several paragraphs of a december 1986 
buyout agreement between perot and gm in which perot promised not 
to compete for profit with eds until december 1989 
eds had sought to prevent perot from operating any competing 
business until the terms of the contract expired the full trial is 
set for april in virginia

thursday he plans to split up the chemicals unit of his 
pittsburghbased koppers co and sell them by january

indicated it would be more than the 660 million offered earlier 
this year by a managementled group 
the number of employees at koppers pittsburgh headquarters 
which has dropped from 500 to 280 since koppers was acquired in

received at least three serious bids for each section of the 
chemical division which has been split along product lines 
we would expect to receive sales proceeds higher than if it had 
been sold as one unit last june he said at the present time 
we are negotiating with seven individual buyers we consider it in 
the best interests of all concerned 
beazer plc a bath englandbased homebuilding and construction 
materials company purchased koppers in june for 18 billion after 
a bitter struggle by koppers management beazers stock will be 
listed on the new york stock exchange starting friday

dallasbased giffordhill amp co inc which makes cement and builds 
houses in several states 
since the purchase of koppers beazer has sold four of its units 
for 90 million and is in the process of selling two others for 60

contracting for new construction will fall 4 
percent next year to a total of 241 billion an economist said 
thursday 
continuing high vacancy rates in offices and apartments and 
rising mortgage interest rates will bring a decline in both 
commercial and residential building said george a christie vice 
president and chief economist of mcgrawhill information services co 
in the first nine months of this year new building contracting 
declined about 3 percent from the 1987 level according to 
mcgrawhill 
the state of the construction industry as we near the close of 
1988 is best described as one quarter in decline another quarter in 
limbo and the remaining half in jeopardy christie told the 
building products executives conference 
contracting is off 40 percent in the overdeveloped commercial 
building sector where high vacancy rates persist christie said 
he said public works construction is in limbo because of the 
drive to cut the federal budget deficit 
singlefamily housing and institutional construction are in 
jeopardy christie noted since they are sensitive to interest rates 
rising mortgage and bond rates pose a threat in the near future 
to at least half of all construction activity he said 
christie predicted that rising interest rates will produce a drop 
in singlefamily housing starts to 900000 units in 1989 from 
975000 this year 
the economist forecast that an 18 percent drop in retail 
building to 189 billion will help fuel an anticipated 8 percent 
decline next year in commercial construction

elderly people who are house rich and cash 
poor will be able to apply for governmentbacked reverse mortgages 
that could pay them up to several hundred dollars a month for the 
rest of their lives under a plan announced thursday 
the demonstration project sponsored by the department of housing 
and urban development and backed by federal lending institutions 
will provide 2500 home equity conversion mortgages beginning next 
april the reverse mortgage in effect gives the elderly income in 
exchange for a lien on their property 
this is another option to help older people survive and thrive 
in our country said carol fraser fisk national commissioner on 
aging who appeared with housing officials at a news conference 
announcing the plan 
to be eligible applicants must be at least 62 years old either 
own or have a very low mortgage on the home in which they live and 
undergo counseling by hud housing experts such counseling 
ordinarily would include potential heirs to the property who likely 
would have to sell the house to pay off the principal interest and 
mortgage fees after the borrower dies officials said 
the reverse mortgages will be available from regular lending 
institutions but will be backed by the government so there will be 
no risk of payments being cut off or of loss to the lender said 
kenneth j beirne assistant housing secretary by pooling the risk 
lenders will be protected against the small percentage of cases in 
which borrowers might live long enough to collect more than the 
value of the house he said 
too many americans who work most of their lives to pay off 
their mortgages wake up one morning to find that they are house rich 
and cash poor said rep george c wortley rny who worked on 
legislation setting up the program 
the project effectively will double the number of reverse 
mortgages available in the united states about 2000 have been 
issued by private lenders in about seven states most of them 
allowing the lender to share in the increased value of the home hud 
also may insure such loans but lender profits generally would be 
limited to interest on the loan and a possible coinsurance 
arrangement where they absorb some of the risk involved officials 
said 
it will be possible for the elderly to take out a reverse 
mortgage without putting out a penny said judith v may hud 
policy analyst who helped design the program 
she said borrowers can either receive monthly payments that will 
end only if they die or sell the house or they may get payments for 
a set term or a line of credit that can be drawn upon as they need 
it 
the amount available will depend on the interest rate age of the 
youngest borrower value of the house and the maximum federal 
housing administration loan available for the area where the house 
is located 
the maximum ranges from 67500 to 101250 monthly payments on 
a 10 percent mortgage would range from 81 for a 62yearold 
borrower in a house valued at 50000 to 662 for an 85yearold in 
a house valued at 100000 or more the older the applicant the 
higher the amount of money available 
some adjustments could be made before final rules are adopted 
following a 60day period for public comment officials said 
the limited number of loans to be available initially will be 
distributed by regions of the country according to the number of 
elderly home owners living in the area officials said 
representatives of the federal national mortgage association 
fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corp freddie mac 
announced they would purchase loans under the plan 
hud says 73 percent of americas 189 million elderly own their 
own homes and 83 percent of those or 115 million owe nothing on 
them 
that creates a potential reverse mortgage market of 700 billion 
said william a schainker fannie mae senior vice president

decision time may be near for the detroit free 
press a spokesman for the newspaper said as lawyers for and against 
its partial merger with the detroit news prepared to go back to 
federal appeals court 
newspapers officials are hoping a victory before the us circuit 
court of appeals in washington dc scheduled to hear arguments in 
the case friday convinces opponents of a joint operating agreement 
to forgo a supreme court challenge 
that would allow the newspapers to merge advertising circulation 
and business operations while keeping separate news and editorial 
departments a move they have said is vital if the free press is to 
survive 
an adverse ruling by the threejudge panel could force 
knightridder inc owner of the 157yearold free press to decide 
whether it wants to pursue a lengthy supreme court battle 
thats such a hypothetical question i dont see any value in 
speculating on something like that knightridder spokesman frank 
hawkins jr said 
gannett co inc owner of the news has said it will operate the 
news with or without a joa 
knightridder has said if a joa were denied it would close the 
free press putting its 2200 employees out of work 
but hawkins said he didnt know if the chain would choose to ride 
out another year or more of uncertainty and newspaper losses that a 
supreme court battle would involve 
the options are beginning to narrow now he said 
former attorney general edwin meese approved a joa in an aug 8 
ruling but hours before it was to take effect opponents obtained 
an order from the appellate court barring the newspapers from 
enacting it 
federal law provides for a limited antitrust exemption to permit 
a joa if it would preserve competing editorial voices in a community 
administrative law judge morton needelman recommended last 
december after hearings in detroit that meese deny a joa saying the 
newspapers failed to prove they would fail without the merger 
the opponents include michigan citizens for an independent press 
a group of more than 500 readers advertisers and newspaper 
employees and public citizen a washingtonbased group founded by 
ralph nader 
arguing the newspapers case will be washington attorney clark 
clifford and justice department lawyer douglas letter 
arguing against a joa will be public citizen lawyer william 
schultz 
each side will be allotted 20 minutes there is no deadline for a 
ruling by the panel of judges laurence h silberman ruth bader

canadian auto parts maker magna international inc 
said thursday it has formed a new unit to build smallvolume 
specialty vehicles or niche cars for its large automaker customers 
the new vehma international inc will prove its capabilities by 
unveiling a highperformance concept car at the society of 
automotive engineers international congress and exposition in 
february in detroit manfred gingl magna president said at a news 
conference 
it will measure up to anything which is running on four wheels 
today gingl said 
he said the car wont compete with the big manufacturers 
the aim is to show them that the design styling engineering 
tooling manufacturing and testing capabilities magna already uses 
to supply parts can be combined to produce entire cars gingl said 
vehma is negotiating with one or more auto companies for such 
contracts he said 
he said depending on the outcome vehma may build one or more 
assembly plants in canada or the united states 
magna currently employs 13000 people at 120 plants in canada 
the united states and europe and makes more than 6000 products for 
the global automotive market it had sales of 12 billion in its 
1988 fiscal year which ended july 31 
magna is made up of four subsidiaries cosma international 
making body parts atoma international making interior assemblies 
decoma international making exterior trim and tesma international 
making drivetrain systems 
gingl said vehma would carry out assembly operations involving 
8000 to 15000 cars a year a moderately sized plant operated by a 
major automaker produces volumes in the 250000ayear range 
vehma could build one of its specialized plants for 40 million 
to 70 million he said 
auto analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors in new york said 
an automaker could save by contracting with vehma to assemble a 
vehicle aimed at a small marketing niche rather than interrupting a 
highvolume assembly line for such a project 
profits would have to be high to justify contracting out the 
work sudol said 
it could make sense to farm them out if they were upmarket 
vehicles with large profit margins and limited runs i dont think 
you could build econoboxes that way she said 
gingl said the operation would not resemble companies that take 
manufacturers finished vehicles and modify them to make 
convertibles or custom vans for example im not talking about a 
conversion factory here he said

the price americans pay for imported goods fell 
11 percent from july through september the first decline in more 
than two years the government reported thursday 
the labor department attributed the quarterly drop to a fall in 
crude oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar against 
overseas currencies 
a stronger dollar boosts americans purchasing power for foreign 
goods and also tends to make us exports more expensive us 
export prices rose 2 percent during the julyseptember quarter the 
department said 
the report said the dollar after falling in value for three 
years rose by 42 percent on a tradeweighted basis against other 
currencies during the third quarter it had edged up by 03 percent 
in the second quarter 
despite these increases the dollar is still 288 percent lower 
than its high point reached in march 1985 according to the currency 
index used by the labor department 
many economists contend that further improvement in the us 
merchandise trade deficit will require further declines in the 
dollar with some suggesting a drop of 20 percent may be needed 
the united states ran a record 1703 billion merchandise trade 
deficit for all of 1987 for the first eight months of this year 
the deficit has been running at an annual rate of 139 billion 
the 11 percent drop in import prices from july through september 
was the first since a 33 percent decline in the first quarter of 
1986 that was attributed primarily to a fall in energy prices 
lower oil prices also played a large part in the julyseptember 
drop without a 71 percent plunge in the price of imported energy 
the overall import decline would have been a smaller 06 percent 
there were also declines in other areas including a 11 percent 
drop in imported food prices and a 05 percent redcution in 
machinery prices 
even with the julyseptember decline import prices are still 41 
percent higher than they were a year ago 
the 2 percent rise in export prices followed a 28 percent 
increase in the apriljune quarter export prices are now 87 
percent higher than a year ago 
food exports led the list of thirdquarter price increases 
shooting up 148 percent in reflecting the impact of the summer 
drought in the farm belt 
food exports had risen by 86 percent in the second quarter and 
are now 368 percent higher than a year ago 
the category of machinery and transport equipment which 
constitutes nearly onehalf of us exports rose by 05 percent in 
the third quarter following a 08 percent rise in the second quarter 
prices of crude materials which had been rising rapidly edged 
up just 06 percent in the third quarter the smallest increase in 
two years

the federal trade commission has subpoenaed the 
owners of a partnership making a 27 billion hostile takeover bid 
for interco inc in connection with an investigation of possible 
antitrust violations the partnership disclosed thursday 
steven m and mitchell p rales city capital associates limited 
partnership and others were served with subpoenas on oct 24 
requiring the raleses to produce documents said cindy carpenter a 
spokesperson for the brothers 
ms carpenter an employee of df king amp co said neither her 
company nor the raleses who are washington dc businessmen 
would comment regarding the subpoena 
the rales brothers lead an investor group that controls about 87 
percent of intercos stock and has offered to pay 74 a share to 
acquire the st louisbased furniture and apparel company 
in august interco charged in a lawsuit that the group violated 
various provisions of the hartscottrodino federal antitrust law 
sens john c danforth rmo and christopher bond rmo then 
asked the ftc to expedite its investigation of the hostile bid for 
interco 
a statement issued thursday on behalf of the raleses reiterated 
the partnerships previous contention that it believed it had not 
violated the antitrust law in connection with the purchase of 
interco shares 
it also noted that the delaware district court on sept 23 1988 
concluded that interco failed to prove that antitrust laws were 
violated in connection with the purchase of its shares by the rales 
group 
interco rejected the rales offer on sept 20 and countered with a 
multibilliondollar defensive restructuring that includes special 
25ashare dividend to its stockholders 
the company is the maker of london fog rainwear ethan allen 
furniture and florsheim shoes among other products 
interco said it was considering alternatives to the rales offer 
including the possible sale of the company to other parties in a 
securities and exchange commission filing interco said confidential 
information had been given to unnamed parties that agreed not to buy 
interco stock or make an offer for three years without intercos 
permission 
the rales brothers own congressional construction corp which 
markets home siding for sears midsouth building supply and easco 
hand tools inc which makes the craftsman line of hand tools in 
august the rales won regulatory approval to take over local radio 
station wgms in partnership 
the ftc scrutinizes bidders in takeover attempts to ensure that 
companies comply with various disclosure provisions and waiting 
periods that give the agency information to determine if companies 
violated antitrust and disclosure laws 
if an investor group led by the rales brothers were found guilty 
of violating antitrust laws the ftc could impose fines bar future 
purchases of interco stock and force the divestiture of interco 
shares 
but ms carpenter issued a statement thursday saying the 
purchaser believes that the investigation will have no impact upon 
the offer
