the naacp said friday it had pulled out of a suit 
against the new york times that charged the newspapers real estate 
advertisements promote racial discrimination by featuring white 
models 
director dr benjamin hooks said the naacp suspended its 
participation because the organization had not held direct 
negotiations with the times prior to filing the suit contrary to 
longstanding policy 
the suit was filed thursday in us disrict court by the new york 
open housing center and four individuals along with the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
while other members of the coalition met with representatives 
of the times the naacp was not represented and hence the times 
publisher arthur ochs sulzberger was correct when he complained 
that the lawsuit was filed without any discussion with the naacp 
hooks said in a news release 
hooks said the failure to hold direct talks occurred through an 
adminstrative oversight hooks said the suit had not been dropped 
and a meeting with times officials would be sought 
we regret any confusion that might have arisen over this matter 
and have taken steps internally to see that such an oversight does 
not occur again hooks said 
on thursday the times issued a statement maintaining that its 
advertising conforms with antidiscrimination laws and saying the 
complaint appeared at first reading to be without merit 
the plaintiffs said photos and drawings that accompany real 
estate ads in the times depict whites almost exclusively as 
potential residents thus indicating a preference based on race

jan lewczenko hasnt mastered english yet but 
he reached a pinnacle in the dwindling art of deepcut crystal 
glassmaking when he cut the bowl congress will give george bush on 
inauguration day 
it was like a dream come true the shy polish immigrant said 
from his job at the lenox crystal inc plant in mount pleasant 40 
miles southeast of pittsburgh 
lewczenko 39 is one of fewer than 25 master deep cutters in the 
country and of four on the lenox staff his experience cutting 
difficult designs nominated him for the bowls ordered by the joint 
congressional committee on the inauguration plant superintendent 
randy eshland said friday 
lewczenko pronounced levchenko is not known as a talkative 
man he did little more in a telephone interview than express his 
pride in the assignment and the finished piece 
hes excited and bashful about all the publicity going on 
around him hes not comfortable about it hes a rather quiet 
man his wife krystyna 33 said from their home in mount 
pleasant 
this is like american dream come true especially coming to 
this country with 3yearold kid without language and 100 on 
hand she said 
lewczenkos pride was infectious said barbara handyside the 
33yearold lenox designer who interpreted the congressional 
committees ideas and worked sidebyside with lewczenko 
the enthusiasm was just overwhelming that was part of the 
excitement in working with him miss handyside said from lenox 
headquarters in lawrenceville nj 
the first gift bush receives jan 20 and the only one hes 
scheduled to get at the inaugural luncheon will be congresss 
crystal bowl of nearly 20 pounds and nearly 9 inches in diameter 
according to lenox vice president dan quayle will receive a smaller 
version of the bowl which lwwczenko also cut lenox declined to 
reveal the price of the bowls 
blossoming cherry trees engraved on the front of each bowl frame 
a transparent area through which the west face of the capitol is 
visible engraved on the far side of the bowl 
the presidents bowl rests on a 14pound beveled lead glass 
plinth or flat base it is inscribed with bushs name and the words 
bicentennial inauguration jan 20 1989 
rendering an architectural scene on a curved surface complicated 
the cutting which was accomplished by holding the hefty piece 
against diamondand carborundumtipped cutting tools 
it makes it even more difficult seeing through the glass to 
cut said john potts vice president of manufacturing for lenox 
the skill is to make sophisticated and accurate cuts when yourre 
holding a heavy piece such as this 
to hand hold this thing absolutely steady through the hours 
that it takes to polish this thing is absolutely unimaginable 
miss handyside said 
lewczenko showed an aptitude for skilled work while sculpting 
clay as a child his wife said he studied at a glasscutting school 
in poland then spent 20 years cutting glass there 
he and his wife and son matthew now 10 immigrated to the 
united states in april 1983 two weeks before huge antigovernment 
protests at the lenin shipyards 
lewczenko worked as an maintenance man while building a 
glasscutting machine at home to create pieces to prove himself as a 
cutter 
a oneyear stint at a new jersey glass studio led to his job at 
lenox

state that lasted six weeks while hospitalized

new research indicates blacks have less access to 
medical care than whites 
according to a 1986 nationwide telephone survey one in 11 blacks 
reported not seeing a doctor for economic reasons compared with one 
in 20 whites and blacks who did go to a doctor may not have been 
treated as well as whites the study said 
the report which appears in todays journal of the american 
medical association also said blacks were less likely to have 
health insurance 
another study in the journal reviewed 50 medical studies of 
trials of new drugs published from 19841986 and found that blacks 
were included in less than twothirds of them 
a third study looked at racial inequities in use of medical 
procedures for heartdisease patients in massachusetts and found 
that whites were 138 times more likely to undergo angiography a 
technique for taking xrays of the heart and 226 times more likely 
to undergo bypass operations

treatments for ulcers both work by blocking the bodys secretion of 
hydrochloric acid 
after one month of treatment ulcers had healed in 80 percent of 
those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving zantac after two 
months 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85 percent of the

the us centers for disease control recommends 
two significant changes in the routine for measles vaccinations 
infants under 15 months old in areas where recurrent measles 
is a problem should get two measles shots instead of one a shot 
of measles vaccine alone at 9 months and a second dose at 15 months 
of the commonly used measlessmumpsrubella vaccine 
in schools with measles outbreaks and in nearby schools where 
the disease might spread all students whose measles shots came 
before 1980 should be revaccinated along with their siblings 
measles specialists have discovered two major outbreak patterns 
in recent years outbreaks among infants under the 15month 
vaccination age and outbreaks among schoolage children who have 
been vaccinated but still got measles anyway as much as 10 percent 
of all vaccinations dont provide the intended protection

infections showed that outbreaks of the disease were virtually 
eliminated for about half of those taking acyclovir twice daily the 
others who took the drug experienced milder shorter outbreaks 
although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective 
temporarily against herpes baker said the trial was the first to 
demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over many months 
a report on the study was published this month in the journal

an automobile magazine that couldnt resist the 
trademark battle between general motors corp and an italian gun 
maker did a road test comparison of beretta the pistol and 
beretta the chevy 
car and driver its editorial tongue planted firmly in its cheek 
has a story in its current issue with the headline weve shot 
from the hip before but never like this 
fabbrica darmi p beretta spa the gun company sued gm for 250 
million in federal court in new york last july claiming that the 
car infringes on the pistols trademark the case is pending 
the car and driver comparison was thought up by editor william 
jeanes and was written by new york contributing editor bruce mccall 
for our test we chose a 1989 beretta v6 gtu twodoor 
notchback coupe and a 1989 beretta 16round model 92f 9mm 
parabellum the spiffiest models in their respective lineups 
mccall wrote 
the magazine listed these details 
curb weight beretta the pistol 25 pounds beretta the chevy 
2847 pounds 
top speed beretta the gun 878 mph at the barrel end 
beretta the sedan 114 mph 
price as tested beretta the semiautomatic 596 beretta the 
car with an automatic transmission 15428 
along with the facts and figures there are some performance 
opinions in the article 
the beretta 92f the pistol hates corners more than any 
device cd has tested since the 1964 amc marlin 
we liked the solid heft and natural feel of the italian 
lightweight it falls easily to hand no such provision is 
designed into the fivespeed getrag shifter fitted to our us test 
sample perhaps because while the italian aims to be on the hip of 
everybody in uniform the american aims only to be uniform among 
everybody hip 
you can fieldstrip the italian in minutes without tools 
while the same task performed on the chevy would require countless 
hours and untold broken fingernails

a generation ago when this was 
saigon american officers lived and played in the rex hotel a 
sandbagged fortress frequently silhouetted against the night sky by 
flares and tracer bullets 
today sedans instead of jeeps drive up to its doors and 
uniformed doormen rather than military guards greet them 
the rex now beckons foreign businessmen and tourists not 
soldiers 
this is the new vietnam leaving its course of economic 
selfdestruction opening its doors courting capitalism its young 
are attuned more to american jeans pop music and the good life than 
to a war with america they never really knew 
in 1975 at that time i was just seven i dont know 
anything said thu an a 20yearold classical violinist studying 
at the ho chi minh conservatory of music it was in april of 1975 
that the long war ended 
in the fifth floor restaurant of the rex beneath the 
chandeliers thu an entertains american tourists with such ballads 
as i left my heart in san francisco and the shadow of your 
smile as they dine on lobster and chateaubriand 
there even was a happy birthday salute that venerable bit 
of americana for jackie gershen a san diego travel agent who 
turned 47 blacktied waiters brought a birthday cake decked with 
lighted candles 
for the masses things remain the same at least for the moment 
they struggle to survive along with their proud and stubborn 
country which exiled itself and waited in vain for what it 
considered its due from the world for standing up to the giant of 
the west 
throngs of unemployed wander the streets of ho chi minh city 
once the boisterous capital of south vietnam vietnams unemployment 
rate is about 25 percent and the cost of living increased in 1988 by 
7 percent to 11 percent a month 
like the violinist thu an many young vietnamese have no 
emotional attachment to the war in which the united states took 
part from 1961 to 1975 
they are restless impatient looking to personal futures of 
education jobs and travel abroad they envy affluent asian 
neighbors and countrymen who went to america as refugees and 
prospered 
some older southerners live in the past the good old days when 
millions of american dollars propped up the economy and brought 
saigonese the luxuries they no longer can afford 
more workers and government officials are speaking out about the 
hardships 
nguyen van thuong maitre dhotel at the ramuncho restuarant 
favored by americans in the war years is unhappy with the measly 
50 a month he is paid for the same job at the rex 
i do not have enough food for my family said thuong who is 
53 and has six children i work much but i receive nothing at 
ramuncho i was happy 
he looked around the room and added there are government 
officials everywhere but we dont scare because our life go down 
some officials agree with him one is nguyen xuan oanh a 
harvardeducated economist for the old saigon regime who advises the 
communist government in hanoi and serves in the national assembly 
it has deteriorated he said we try very hard to keep some 
of the hotels in a decent state so the foreign investors can come 
in we need capital we need more industrial ventures we need 
technology we have plenty of labor 
the vietnamese look to the united states for these necessities of 
transition from failed central planning to a marketoriented economy 
that allows free enterprise competition and foreign investment 
oanh said it does not mean the end of communism or socialism as 
it is called here he explained 
socialism is not an end in itself there are so many variations 
of the same thing we try very hard to keep away from ideology 
whatever the americans the europeans have done this is the 
result of thousands of years of experience lets just take that 
dont say this belongs to capitalism or what take the best of both 
worlds and build the economy of vietnam 
in keeping with the new approach oanh was blunt in evaluating 
the economy 
we have had a lot of state enterprise but these guys are no 
good because they just wait for the government they dont care 
whether what they make can be sold or not 
now its different we now allow the private businessman to 
really worry about production so they have to watch their step they 
have to worry about marketing everything just like any other 
businessman 
vietnam now imports three times more than it exports but 
officials hope the united states will help by providing financial 
aid and lifting its trade embargo once diplomatic relations are 
established they say that should happen within a few years 
a major sticking point is the vietnamese occupation of cambodia 
which began with an invasion in december 1978 occupation troops and 
the government vietnam installed are fighting a civil war with 
cambodian guerrillas 
if there is a political solution vietnam will withdraw all its 
troops at the latest by next september said maj gen tran cong 
man editor of the army newspaper 
if there is no political solution now vietnam will withdraw 
all its troops in 1990 there will be nothing to settle and to 
debate then the americans will have no reason not to establish 
diplomatic relations 
half a million southerners many of whom worked for the us 
government have applied for exit visas to america to join 
relatives or in hopes of jobs and business opportunities 
tens of thousands have spent years trying to get out and their 
struggle has an ironic counterpoint members of the first emigrant 
wave many of them now american citizens return by the thousands 
for short visits with relatives and pour badly needed dollars into 
the economy 
gen nguyen vinh nghi 58 who was captured by north vietnamese 
troops shortly before the fall of south vietnam on april 30 1975 
hopes to take his wife and three children to the united states 
he was released from prison camp a year ago and says i have

a 75yearold widow in need of money said officials 
tricked her out of a masterpiece for a pittance a court agreed 
giving the first round to her in one of three swindles that have 
shaken the french museum world 
last month the court convicted the city of strasbourg and its 
museum of decorative arts of fraud in the purchase from 
mariemadeleine falbisaner of an unsigned painting attributed to 
simon vouet court painter of king louis xiii 
when the museum did not return the painting as ordered a 
magistrate charged chief curator jeandaniel ludmann 51 with 
breach of trust for failing to do so 
my family has lived for generations in strasbourg and i wanted 
the family heirloom to remain here mrs falbisaner said in a 
telephone interview this is what i get for being sentimental i 
was gypped 
ludmann the museum and strasbourg have appealed a decision is 
expected within two years and mrs falbisaner hopes to recover the 
painting now in storage at the museum 
knock wood i wont die before then she said 
also in december charges were brought against pierre rosenberg 
chief curator of paintings at the louvre for involvement in the 
purchase of a work by 17th century portraitist bartolome esteban 
murillo for half its estimated worth 
rosenberg a scholar with an international reputation was 
accused of either knowing or purposely ignoring the fact that the 
painting the gentleman of seville might have been stolen from 
its owner an elderly eccentric heiress who died under suspicious 
circumstances in 1986 
another elderly widow saw justice done in december when an 
unsigned painting by nicolas poussin was returned to her and she 
sold it for 14 million 
twenty years ago her husband sold it for the equivalent of 366 
to the louvre whose experts had noticed the mislabeled painting in 
a sale catalogue 
after the museum displayed it as a poussin the family sued the 
court ruled that the louvre did not have the right to use its vast 
resources and expertise to cheat ordinary citizens 
french museums have been an elite preserve some say above the 
law so newspapers recounted the unfolding dramas like installments 
in a seamy soap opera 
is there something rotten in the kingdom of museums art 
critic bruno foucart asked in beaux arts magazine recalling 
hamlets moral dilemma 
curator tripped up by canvas one headline sniffed an 
editorial by gerard dupuy in the newspaper liberation was called 
the scholar gone astray 
the latest episode is known as the vouet affair for the 17th 
century portraitist who experts say is the likely creator of mrs 
falbisaners unsigned allegory of force 
mrs falbisaners story began in 1986 when she decided to 
supplement her monthly pension of about 450 by selling allegory 
to the city of strasbourg for about 55000 
it had been in the family for more than 250 years and was 
believed to be the work of vouet who introduced the italian baroque 
school to france 
experts examined the painting before the sale however and to 
mrs falbisaners chagrin concluded it was a highquality example 
of the vouet school but not by the master himself 
the museum still was interested however and curator ludmann 
borrowed the work to examine its condition a standard procedure 
without telling mrs falbisaner he took the painting to the 
louvre for laboratory examinations including xrays 
tests indicated the work was by vouet or at the very least 
attributable to him that information was not passed on to mrs 
falbisaner 
ludmann sent an enthusiastic letter to city officials urging them 
to approve the sale the tests he wrote reveal the existence of 
several retouchings by the artist himself 
he said the price was more than reasonable and assuredly 
advantageous given vouets fame and his value on todays market 
both the louvre and strasbourg officials have denied formally 
authenticating the work as a vouet 
im convinced the essentials of the painting its composition 
idea and colors are vouet ludmann told the associated press 
but added that he cannot be certain because the work is unsigned 
big money is at stake in todays art market a vouet is 
estimated to be worth up to 500000 nearly 10 times what the 
museum agreed to pay mrs falbisaner 
many in the art world say privately they are delighted to see 
museums get a comeuppance but have closed ranks publicly 
dismissing the scandals as the price of becoming fashionable 
ten years ago no one outside the museum world would have 
noticed one said privately today a curator is a superstar who 
appears on television and dines with the mayor 
ann cremin a respected art critic said the museums because 
of their limited acquisitions budgets have to be on the lookout for 
bargains 
these kinds of affairs have probably happened countless times 
in the past the difference is the money involved the ordinary 
person today hires a good lawyer to get the property back and the 
story makes the papers

tracy chapman seems of another time a time when 
dylan odetta seeger and guthrie celebrated freedom and the spirit 
of man and defied brutality and repression with their songs and 
anthems 
chapman whose selftitled debut album has been nominated for six 
grammys is of this age and her songs take a hard cold look at 
poverty racism inequality and human relations she is 
uncompromising tough and compassionate 
i think people look at the world in many different ways and 
choose to see what they like she said in an interview last year 
with the washington post i think lots of people ignore some of 
the harder issues the more unpleasant things i dont think i harp 
on them 
her lp opens with talkin bout a revolution a song that 
tells of standing in the welfare lines 
crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation 
wasting time in the unemployment lines 
sitting around waiting for a promotion 
poor people gonna rise up 
and get their share 
poor people gonna rise up 
and take whats theirs 
until tracy chapman hit record stores last april the 
24yearold poetsingersongwriterfolksinger was one of the boston 
areas best kept secrets as an anthrolopolgy major at tufts 
university in medford mass she performed in coffee houses and 
clubs and was a local hit 
the lp with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae 
enchanted millions more it has sold over 4 million copies and has 
been nominated for album of the year and best contemporary folk 
recording the single fast car has been nominated for best 
song and record of the year and chapman herself is up for best new 
artist and best female pop vocalist 
fast car was a no 1 hit and tells of a high school dropout 
who works to supports her alcoholic father and who wants to escape 
it all with her unemployed boyfriend 
you got a fast car 
and i got a plan to get us out of here 
i been working at the convenience store 
managed to save just a little bit of money 
we wont have to drive too far 
just cross the border and into the city 
you and i can both get jobs 
and finally see what it means to be living 
chapmans rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings is an 
instrument by itself and highly effective on behind the wall a 
song about a battered woman she sings a capella of the harsh 
realties of the domestic fight last night i heard the screaming 
then a silence that chilled my soul and slams the police for 
doing nothing 
she grew up in cleveland and has been singing since she was a 
child she was in a connecticut boarding school when 
singersongwriters had been put out to pasture by synthesizer 
philistines chapman didnt turn on her radio but many of her 
classmates listened to folk music and played guitar 
in college one of her classmates was brian koppelman whose 
father charles is a leader in the music publishing business this 
gave her the wedge she needed to gain entry to the recording world 
chapman whose musical roots can be traced to joan armatrading 
carol king and joni mitchell was part of a new wave of 
singersongwriters in the late 1980s especially women such as toni 
childs marti jones melissa etheridge and michelle shocked

public school officials concerned that students 
may be living on the streets opened homeless shelters in two 
houston schools thursday so needy pupils can get beds showers and a 
meal 
a 12yearold girl who had been sleeping under an abandoned house 
was the first of eight people to enter the shelters officials said 
we didnt discuss anything with the child when she came in 
said school board president melody ellis right now shes playing 
checkers with one of the administrators we just tried to give her 
encouragement and let her play 
the shelters will remain open nightly until at least jan 20 
when the superintendent the houston independent school district will 
recommend to the school board that the program be continued or 
modified 
within an hour of opening six children arrived at the shelters 
and ms ellis said four other young boys who showed up at one of the 
campuses left before entering apparently because of television 
cameras nearby 
it is drizzling outside and it is extremely cold and i would 
really like for these children to come in ms ellis said when 
asking reporters to leave the area temperatures were in the low 40s 
thursday night 
by late evening eight youths and one parent were in the two 
shelters including a homeless woman with five children all 
enrolled in houston schools and a 14yearold dropout 
houston is estimated to have 20000 to 25000 people who live on 
the streets or in shelters but its uncertain how many of those are 
children 
the school shelters are not intended for children whose families 
are staying in city shelters but rather for those pupils who seem 
to live alone on the streets 
weve had teachers discovering students sleeping in areas 
around schools storing clothes under houses in the neighborhood and 
some who are asking for help school district spokesman larry yawn 
said 
its not certain why those pupils are on the streets however 
judy hay of harris county childrens protective services said use 
of the term homeless for the school program may be a misnomer 
i know theres children out there she said but i 
certainly didnt think they were in school these children have a 
home somewhere but they either are abused or choose not to be at 
home 
ms hay said programs already exist for truly homeless 
children whose parents for example may be living out of their 
cars 
other social service programs also exist for children who need a 
coolingoff time away from their parents she said 
there are vacancies in shelters right now ms hay said 
its going to be interesting to find out what these principals 
have been seeing 
under the schoolhouse shelters program approved this week and 
announced wednesday volunteers from the school system and other 
social agencies will staff the shelters which officials hope may 
lead to more permanent assistance for homeless youths seeking help 
in a familiar place 
one school is set up to handle children from kindergarten through 
eighth grade the other is intended for high school students 
the red cross has donated 75 beds and blankets existing showers 
and dressing rooms in gymnasiums of the schools will be used 
officials said 
the cost to the school district while not yet determined should 
be minimal officials said the district is providing food soup 
and sandwiches and security guards 
the program will serve only students enrolled in the houston 
independent school district among the nations 10largest districts 
with about 190000 students 
security officers will guard against drugs and weapons and yawn 
said handheld metal detectors will be used at the school entrance 
students entering the shelters operated from 530 pm until 7 
am will have to prove they are enrolled before entering

surviving crew members of the world war ii 
submarine finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion with 
george bush the young navy pilot they dubbed ellie the elephant 
after rescuing him from the pacific ocean more than 44 years ago 
don kohler 64 of rogers ark the torpedoman who helped pull a 
grateful bush to safety from his orange life raft onto the finbacks 
deck remembers offering a smile and a hearty welcome aboard 
but recalls little else about the incident 
at that time he was just another downed pilot said kohler 
a retired chicago businessman nobody back then knew hed become 
president of the united states 
rescued after his plane was shot down by japanese fire bush 
eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoing 
duties watched betty grable movies in the wardroom and donned 
earphones to listen in awe as the submarines torpedoes sank two 
enemy ships 
former finback officers remember the 20yearold bush as a 
gregarious jokester who earned the nickname ellie for his comic 
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant they said in recent 
telephone interviews 
i remember he was very lively obviously intelligent and very 
personable said retired rear adm lawrence heyworth of virginia 
beach va who was the finbacks torpedo and gunnery officer when 
bush was hauled aboard on sept 2 1944 
said heyworth all three pilots we rescued were bright 
brighteyed young men but george seemed the most outgoing and had 
the most ebullient personality he was the most entertaining and he 
made us laugh a lot 
we called him ellie because of his outstanding imitation of an 
elephant trumpeting ellie the elephant it wasnt because we all 
sat around thinking we were republicans we must have seen one in a 
tarzan movie we just thought elephants were funny we kept asking 
george to do it over and over again 
he had a tremendous sense of humor recalled we bill 
edwards of bay st louis miss an insurance agent and retired navy 
commander as a bearded ensign aboard the finback edwards filmed 
bushs rescue with an 8mm kodak movie camera 
edwards said that at last count nearly 30 surviving officers and 
enlisted crewmen of the finback were planning to attend bushs 
swearingin at noontime jan 20 at the capitol 
they and a few of bushs former flying buddies plan to sit 
together in prime bleacher seats on pennsylvania avenue for the 
inaugural parade after bush takes the presidential oath of office 
inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunion 
for bush and his old submarine buddies at blair house the 
presidential guest quarters across the street from the white house 
possibly next wednesday 
heyworth and edwards have stayed in touch with bush over the 
years but most of the finback veterans havent seen or spoken to 
bush since he left the submarine at midway island after a monthlong 
combat patrol 
bush won the distinguished flying cross for completing his 
bombing run against a japanese radio communications center in the 
bonin islands about 600 miles south of japan after his grumman 
avenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed in 
flames bush bailed out over the water but his two crew members were 
lost 
according to his autobiography bushs only injuries were a gash 
on the forehead and a painful sting from a portuguese manofwar he 
was picked up by the finback less than two hours after his parachute 
hit the ocean 
im proud of what i was able to do to help mr bush on board 
our boat said kohler 
but dan moody 71 a finback veteran and retired radiation 
laboratory technician living in albany calif gave little thought 
to bush at the time 
we brought him aboard dried him out and gave him hot coffee 
he said and then forgot him 
i was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman moody said 
whod pay any attention to a 20yearold kid

retired adm james d watkins is scrambling 
back to his battle station three years after ending a sparkling 
41year navy career but this time the threat is a homegrown crisis 
instead of a foreign power 
he was nominated thursday by presidentelect bush to head the 
energy department which has been rocked by a partial shutdown of 
the nuclear plants that produce the nations atomic warheads and by 
the prospect of devoting tens of billions of dollars to rebuilding 
and cleaning up the aging nuclear complex 
watkins 61 has no background in the commercial energy field 
but he has been associated with the navys nuclear operations since 
early in his career which was capped by a fouryear stint as chief 
of naval operations the top navy officer 
in 1958 watkins studied nuclear engineering at oak ridge tenn 
national laboratory one of the links in the nationwide nuclear 
bombmaking network he later taught at navy nuclear training 
centers and worked in the naval reactors division of the atomic 
energy commission a forerunner of the energy department 
at a news conference following the announcement of his nomination 
as energy secretary watkins said grappling with the nuclear weapons 
plants problem would be his first order of business before his 
senate confirmation hearings start 
watkins selection came just hours after president reagan 
formally endorsed an energy department report recommending that 81 
billion be spent over the next two decades to modernize the nuclear 
bomb factories it acknowledged that budget constraints would make 
it difficult to carry out the plan 
one of the most immediate threats posed by the nuclear weapons 
plant problem is the possibility that the united states could run 
low on tritium a shortlived radioactive gas that energy department 
reactors produce for atomic warheads 
last year the last of the tritiumproducing reactors was shut 
down for safety reasons leaving the country at least temporarily 
without fresh supplies of the gas 
the pentagon has said the reactors must be restarted soon in 
order to avoid jeopardizing the nations nuclear arsenal but 
officials have not said just when the problem would become critical 
no date has been set for restarting the tritiumproducing reactors 
although reagans report said it was unlikely before late 1989 
even once the key reactors are made safe and put back into 
operation the new energy secretary will face great uncertainty over 
whether and when to build a new generation of tritiumproducing 
plants the existing ones are more than 30 years old reagans 
report called them obsolete and in need of replacement 
a related and perhaps more longlasting problem is finding the 
technology and the money to clean up the widespread 
environmental damage caused by four decades of bombmaking 
energy industry officials welcomed the selection of watkins 
although his name was not among the many that had churned through 
washington rumor mills in recent weeks 
adm watkins has demonstrated his ability as a leader and 
administrator said charles j dibona president of the american 
petroleum institute representing major oil companies 
other officials urged watkins to tackle the military reactors 
problem immediately 
it is especially important that this national security issue be 
handled skillfully so it does not become an abiding distraction 
to other energy issues said george h lawrence president of the 
american gas association a trade group 
although the nuclear problem is likely to give watkins his most 
immediate headaches the new energy secretary will face challenges 
on other fronts among them are 
an emerging battle in congress over whether to raise the federal 
gasoline tax as a way of curbing gasoline consumption and cutting 
the federal budget deficit debate over a possible tax on oil 
imports also is likely to heighten this year 
a growing wave of oil imports that has increased concern about 
us dependence on opec some economists and members of congress 
have said the government should act now to insulate the nation 
better against a supply disruption particularly in the volatile 
middle east that could force up oil prices 
calls by the natural gas industry for ending all controls on gas 
prices consumer groups are opposed 
deciding whether to open up more federal lands in alaska and 
elsewhere for oil and gas exploration conservations are strongly 
opposed the oil companies say such additional exploration is vital 
to halting a recent slide in domestic oil production

an unreleased department of energy report 
concludes that a linear accelerator could produce one of the key 
ingredients in nuclear weapons more cheaply quickly and safely than 
new production reactors could 
such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste than 
a nuclear reactor and should be more readily acceptable to the 
public according to a draft summary of the report obtained by the 
associated press on thursday 
the us supply of tritium a radioactive gas used to produce 
nuclear warheads is threatened by the crumbling condition of the 
energy departments existing weapons plants and reactors 
the report prepared by scientists at the brookhaven and los 
alamos national laboratories and at westinghousehanford co in 
washington state concluded that an accelerator could produce enough 
tritium to meet all us weapons needs 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminium the resulting collision 
produces tritium 
according to the report using such an accelerator to make 
tritium would not produce any longlived nuclear wastes and 
costs associated with safety and environmental concerns should be 
minimal 
in addition it said an accelerator does not have the 
licensing requirements associated with nuclear reactors and should 
be more readily acceptable to the public 
last july the department recommended building two new production 
reactors one at the savannah river complex near aiken sc and 
the other at the idaho falls national laboratory in idaho 
at present the nations only facilities for producing tritium 
are three reactors at savannah river but all three are shut down 
either for maintenance or because of safety problems 
department officials have said that at least one of the reactors 
should be back on line this year but the startup date continues to 
slip as more problems are found 
the departments energy research advisory board looked 
briefly at using an accelerator to produce tritium but ended up 
recommending construction of two new reactors said chris sankey a 
doe spokeswoman 
the board concluded that these technologies were not mature 
enough to provide new production capacity in the next 10 to 12 
years she said 
but the doe report said that the nations tritium needs could be 
met by using an accelerator that could be in operation as early as 
1996 
by comparison the proposed new reactors are expected to take a 
minimum of 10 years to complete 
the required accelerator technology has largely been 
demonstrated at the component level although some additional 
development work is desirable to effect cost reductions improved 
performance and ease of operation the report said 
the accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to 
operate roughly the entire output of a nuclear power plant one 
potential site for it would be in the pacific northwest which has 
the cheapest electric rates in the nation 
the report said preliminary discussions with the bonneville 
power administration indicated that the federal power marketing 
agency based in portland ore would have enough electricity 
available to power an accelerator 
an accelerator could cost more to build but because the cost of 
operating it would be about half that of a reactor total life 
cycle costs including construction would be about 25 percent 
less said pierre grand a scientist at brookhaven 
the two planned new reactors would cost an estimated 68 billion 
grand acknowledged that those are ballpark figures and we need 
to do a lot more work to come up with firm estimates 
but he said he was convinced that construction of an accelerator 
would alleviate all the safety licensing and waste problems 
associated with a reactor 
grand said that while radioactive waste would be produced you 
wont have the transuranic wastes that are the culprits in terms of 
longterm storage

congressmen teachers and saudi princes will 
no longer be invited by nasa to be passengers on the space shuttle 
under a new policy that emphasizes completing the recovery from the 
challenger accident in which two nonastronauts were killed 
the space agency announced a new category of space flight 
participants and said at the same time that flight opportunities 
for them are not available at this time 
before the challenger exploded on liftoff jan 28 1986 nasa had 
given minimum training to a senator a member of the house of 
representatives a saudi arabian prince and christa mcauliffe the 
first teacher in space mrs mcauliffe was killed along with 
industrial engineer gregory jarvis and five astronauts 
the challenger accident marked a major change in the us 
outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than nasa 
astronauts the national aeronautics and space administration said 
in the policy statement thursday 
nasa and interested external parties domestic and 
international must reexamine previous understandings 
expectations and commitments regarding flight opportunities 
at the time of the challenger explosion the process of choosing 
a reporter to fly on the shuttle was in its final stages committees 
had winnowed down thousands of applications to 40 
when the shuttle does begin flying nonessential passengers 
again nasa said a teacher will be the first 
the agency said that for now flight opportunities generally will 
be limited to professional astronauts and payload specialists 
essential for mission requirements while it works to improve the 
reliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog 
the new space flight participant category embraces those whose 
presence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation of 
payloads or for other essential mission mission activities but is 
determined by the administrator of nasa to contribute to other 
approved nasa objectives or to be in the national interest 
sen jake garn rutah flew on the shuttle in april 1985 and 
rep bill nelson dfla was aboard in january 1986 at the 
invitation of nasas administrator both hold positions important to 
the space program on congressional committees and the official 
explanation was that the flights were important to their oversight 
responsibilities 
in 1985 shuttle passengers included sultan alsaud of saudi 
arabia and rodolfo neri vela a mexican they were aboard nasa 
said to observe the launches of the arabsat and morelosb 
communications satellites for their countries 
nasa said that while it remains committed to a longterm goal of 
providing such flight opportunities it is devoting its energies to 
proving that the shuttle is safe and reliable 
accordingly flight opportunities for space flight participants 
are not available at this time nasa said when nasa determines 
that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight 
participant first priority will be given to a teacher in space in 
fulfillment of space education plans 
all shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five 
nasa astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for 
payload or other mission requirements the agency said such added 
crew members have to be chosen at least 12 months before the flight 
and first consideration will be given to nasas own people

with only a week to go the reagan 
administration is managing to eke out a few foreign policy successes 
before turning leadership in world affairs over to presidentelect 
bush and his deputies 
the withdrawal of 450 cuban soldiers from angola this week marks 
the beginning of the end of a 14year presence in the southwest 
africa country the pullout is part of a deal arranged by the united 
states that will bring independence to namibia now under south 
african control 
chester a crocker the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs worked eight difficult years for a settlement continuing 
efforts that began early in the carter administration 
the cuban exodus does not end the war in angola the marxist 
government armed by the soviet union is still fighting the rebel 
union for the total independence of angola or unita which has been 
supported by south africa and the united states 
but the war is likely to be less intense and namibia will get 
the independence south africa was unwilling to grant despite 
worldwide condemnation 
in afghanistan the soviets have again started to withdraw their 
troops despite threats to stall until a political settlement is 
worked out with usarmed rebels 
transports carried some units out by air this week while others 
streamed northward from the soviet garrison in the capital city of 
kabul by feb 15 the last of the 50000 soviet troops are supposed 
to be gone 
here too the departure of a foreign army does not mean peace is 
settling in but the fighting may slacken 
rebels armed by the united states and pakistan have government 
forces on the run without soviet backing however president 
najibullah and his army could collapse without much of a struggle 
soviet troops have been in the country since december 1979 their 
ouster was a main foreign policy goal of the carter and then the 
reagan administration 
success came partly as a result of massive soviet losses and the 
kind of anguish at home that americans suffered during the vietnam 
war but the advent of mikhail s gorbachev in april 1985 and the 
smoother relationship he worked out with president reagan had a lot 
to do with it 
superpower cooperation also helped bring about the african 
settlement and the ongoing vietnamese troop withdrawal from 
cambodia although it did not crack the arabisraeli conflict or 
have an impact on the wars in nicaragua and el salvador 
in the meantime the outgoing administration is defying tradition 
by not just fading away 
secretary of state george shultz has purchased his tickets for 
flying home to california right after the inaugural next friday but 
a us air force jet is waiting for him to board at andrews air 
force base this weekend 
the idea is to fly to vienna and celebrate the end of a 27month 
human rights conference hold a 32nd and final meeting with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and make preparations for 
eastwest arms control talks 
those negotiations will seek the reduction of troops all across 
the european landscape the idea is to ease tensions between the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
to get those talks going the soviets met us demands for the 
release of more than 600 political prisoners the reunification of 
more than 100 families and steppedup emigration of jews ethnic 
germans and armenians 
the shultz trip is on hold though pending resolution of a 
dispute between greece and turkey over how much turkish territory 
across from cyprus will be included in the reduction talks

a spokesman for the farm credit council an arm 
of the financially beleaguered farm credit system says it makes 
sense to send nearly 200 of its representatives to hawaii later this 
month for a midwinter convention 
protests have been raised by a grassroots unit in north dakota 
the fargo farm credit services which tried unsuccessfully to get 
the councils st paul minn district to reduce its number of 
delegates to the meeting 
the fargo board objected to sending a 14member district 
delegation plus some staff people to the jan 24 meeting scheduled 
at the sheratonwaikiki hotel after the oneday council meeting 
most of the delegates will attend the annual convention of the 
national council of farmer cooperatives on jan 2526 
joe terrell of the farm credit councils national office in 
washington said the council is an affiliate of the ncfc which will 
send about 800 delegates to honolulu compared with the councils 
175 
the council handles lobbying activities for the cooperative farm 
credit system which includes nationwide networks of federal land 
banks production credit associations bank for cooperatives and the 
federal intermediate credit bank 
overall the system has a loan portfolio of more than 50 
billion as a result of a continuing financial crisis and huge 
losses congress late in 1987 drew up a bailout plan that could pour 
as much as 4 billion into the ailing system 
terrell said thursday in a telephone interview that the honolulu 
convention site was selected in 1983 by the ncfc and that the 
council had studied the situation for almost a year before deciding 
to go to honolulu or hold its own annual meeting somewhere else and 
apart from the ncfc 
although there was some agonizing over the potential public 
relations harm of going to hawaii terrell said that a cost analysis 
showed it was good business to join ncfc in honolulu 
terrell said other sites were studied including washington 
dc and cities in the midwest and on the west coast 
air travel to honolulu will be a little bit higher for a larger 
number of people than to mainland cities he said but those 
additional costs will be offset by other things such as holding a 
joint reception and sharing other functions with the ncfc 
so we decided to do it knowing that there could be some 
criticism about it terrell said 
rep byron l dorgan dnd called the decision to send farm 
credit system officials to hawaii a foolish mistake in the wake 
of the 4 billion bailout passed by congress 
we didnt bail them out to send them to hawaii dorgan said 
we bailed them out to help family farmers 
dorgan in response to an associated press query said the farm 
credit system has done a pretty good job under some rough 
circumstances but this is the kind of foolishness that shows a lack 
of sensitivity to how things look to the folks out there in the 
country who are paying bills 
he added there are plenty of empty hotels in the farm belt 
that would love to host a meeting of the farm credit folks there 
might be less sun and also less heat for the farm credit council

fluecured tobacco farmers and buyers each will 
be assessed 112 cents per pound for the 1989 crop the agriculture 
department said 
the total of 224 cents covers a nonet cost assessment of 2 
cents per pound and 024 cents to help cover the federal budget 
deficit the 1989 total assessment will be down slightly from last 
years total of 226 cents per pound 
department officials said thursday they consulted with the 
fluecured tobacco cooperative stabilization corp the 
producerowned association that handles the support program before 
determining the 1989 assessment 
the budget deficit assessment will be imposed according to the 
omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 which calls for a 
reduction in the level of price support by 14 percent or 
alternatively an assessment on producers to achieve and equal 
reduction in spending 
officials said the 1989 price support for fluecured tobacco will 
remain at 1468 per pound as announced on dec 15 for this years 
crop

take two boys born today one is white the 
other is not the chances are five times greater that the nonwhite 
boy eventually will become a murder victim the fbi says 
nonwhite males born now face a 1 in 38 chance of ending up the 
victim of a killer while the risk for white males born today is 1 
in 204 according to a statistical study released thursday 
the odds faced by the entire population born today are 1 out of 
177 the study found 
sharon propheter a statistician with the uniform crime reporting 
program cautioned that the predictions are based on 1987 figures 
and do not account for possible changes in the murder rate 
we cant look into the future and say there are going to be so 
many murders in 1999 said propheter who prepared the report with 
statistician harvey rosenthal this is based on what happened in 
1987 
the murder rate in 1987 was 83 per 100000 population that 
year there were an estimated 20100 murders nationwide of which 
9510 victims were nonwhite 7436 of them nonwhite males the 
murder rate in canada for that year was 25 per 100000 
between 1967 and 1987 the us murder rate leaped 34 percent 
the fbi reported the highest rate in the past 10 years was 102 per 
100000 population in 1980 and the lowest was 79 per 100000 in 
1984 and 1985 
the fbi study was based on the uniform crime reporting statistics 
added to a computer model it did not break down the nonwhite 
category for blacks hispanics asianamericans and other 
minorities propheter said 
if there were no murders the average lifespan for all americans 
would increase by almost 3 months and the average lifespan for 
nonwhite males would increase by more than 11 months the study 
found 
a person born now can expect to live about 75 years according to 
health statistics 
the study which calculated the probabilities of being murdered 
for newborns those age 20 and those age 40 predicted that while 
newborn nonwhite males have a 1 in 38 chance of becoming a murder 
victim the chance for nonwhite females is 1 in 138 for both sexes 
combined the chance is 1 in 60 
for newborn white males the risk is 1 in 204 while for white 
females its 1 in 437 for a combined chance of 1 in 277 
for newborns of all races the chance of being murdered is 1 in 
122 for males 1 in 324 for females and 1 in 177 for both sexes 
the least likely to be murdered among the ages calculated by 
the fbi are white women who are now 40 they have only a 1 in 931 
chance of being murdered of all the groups now 40 the highest 
probability of being murdered remains nonwhite males with a 1 in 
97 chance the overall odds for that age group is 1 out of 453 
as for men who already have reached age 20 nonwhites have a 1 
in 41 chance of being murdered while whites have a 1 in 224 chance 
for an overall chance of 1 in 136 
for females who are now 20 nonwhites have a 1 in 157 likelihood 
of being murdered and whites have a 1 in 504 chance for a total 
probability of one in 376

looming shortages of skilled labor can be eased 
by relying more on older workers provided they receive training and 
their oldage benefits are protected according to a group of labor 
department studies 
educational reform in public schools should eventually maximize 
the labor force of the future but cannot immediately remedy the 
skills shortage of todays population labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin said thursday in releasing the department studies i 
think clearly that older workers should be tapped across the board 
one of the reports the departments first extensive analysis of 
potential labor shortages said major shortages could occur because 
the economy is projected to grow at 2 percent to 3 percent annually 
while the rate of work force growth will be just 1 percent 
the median age of workers is projected to rise from the current 
36 to 39 by the end of the century with the number of people aged 
45 and over increasing from the 1986 total of 742 million to 963 
million 
the government said that most employers while aggressively 
pursuing members of the shrinking pool of younger workers have 
ignored the special needs of older workers including flexible 
scheduling job sharing health care and phased retirements 
in some cases it actually costs older workers to continue working 
past the age when they are eligible to retire the studies said 
that is because social security and private pension provisions often 
penalize beneficiaries who continue or resume working 
the social security penalties slowly are being phased out but 
the report said that a faster timetable should be considered and 
that employers should revamp their private plans offering employees 
incentives to work to a later age 
another key to keeping older workers on the payroll researchers 
said is retraining employees to reflect the changing labor market 
far more attention needs to be given to the design of jobs and 
working conditions that are deliberately tailored to the distinctive 
capabilities limitations needs and preferences of older workers 
now employed and others who under the right circumstances might 
choose to become reemployed the department said the barriers 
are formidable but not insurmountable 
the reports said the definition of older workers can vary 
involving employees as young as 47 in some cases but most problems 
are faced by workers in their 60s workforce participation drops 
significantly at age 62 and again at 65 because these are 
eligibility dates for social security and many pensions

president reagan led a hushed 
crowd at a military review in a moment of silence for the 595 
members of the armed services who died in the line of duty during 
his administration 
they volunteered they chose to serve they gave their lives 
they are our heroes the president said at thursdays ceremony in 
the gleaming new hangar that will be home to the new air force one 
being built to replace the aging presidential aircraft 
reagan led the tribute at a pentagonsponsored ceremony honoring 
him for his service as commander in chief secretary of defense 
frank c carlucci presented the department of defense medal for 
distinguished public service and medals from the armed services to 
the president 
during his remarks reagan complimented all of those in uniform 
the gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace properly 
goes not to me but rather to all of you he said 
over the last eight years the luster has been restored to the 
reputation of our fighting forces after a time during which it was 
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as 
yours reagan told the assembly 
those days will never come again he said to thunderous 
applause 
the marine band followed its traditional playing of the marine 
hymn and other armed service anthems with a rendition of the 
sentimental auld lang syne 
the unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include 
flyovers of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the coast guard 
it was forced inside by a chilly rain the flyovers were called off

president reagan says some civil rights leaders 
are doing so well by keeping alive the feeling that theyre 
victims of prejudice that he sometimes wonders whether they 
really want what they say they want 
reagan made the statement in an interview to be broadcast sunday 
on the cbs television program 60 minutes portions of the 
interview were broadcast thursday on the cbs evening news 
the president defended himself against criticism of his civil 
rights record saying he was a lifelong foe of discrimination and 
one of the great things that i have suffered in this job is this 
feeling and this editorializing comment that somehow im on the 
other side 
of the black leaders who have criticized him he said 
sometimes i wonder if they really want what they say they want 
because some of those leaders are doing very well leading 
organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that theyre 
victims of prejudice 
he declined to name names 
mike wallace of 60 minutes conducted separate interviews with 
reagan in the oval office and with first lady nancy reagan in the 
presidential residence he also interviewed them together in the 
residence 
asked whether she had ever worried during the irancontra crisis 
about the possibility of impeachment mrs reagan said no well 
no i it never entered my mind until somebody said it on 
television and then that word is a frightening word 
its like its like having somebody say cancer to you you 
know you you you freeze 
mrs reagan did not say who it was she heard discuss the 
possibility of impeachment no impeachment moves were made against 
the president who repeated during the interview his denial that he 
swapped arms to iran in an effort to secure release of american 
hostages 
mrs reagan also said in the interview she believes john 
poindexter who lost his job as the presidents national security 
adviser because of the irancontra affair should have told 
ronnie about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to 
contra rebels in nicaragua the president has said he did not know 
of the diversion 
asked if she disagreed with her husband about his description of 
poindexter aide oliver north as a national hero the first lady 
replied sometimes we disagree

national education association the teacher union asked bennett what 
he would do if he had a magic wand to wave over american schools 
no drugs none zero out gone disappear replied the 
bluntspoken educator give me a wand all the drugs gone 
during his 3 years in the reagan cabinet the conservative and 
combative bennett often spoke out about the drug plague and 
chafed at what he felt was an inadequate effort by the reagan team 
to combat the problem 
now as presidentelect bushs choice to be the nations first 
drug czar it will fall on the shoulders of the burly former college 
football lineman to find a way to win that war 
bennett 45 was a headlinegrabbing education secretary who 
railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards and 
spoke his mind freely on topics in and out of his field from 
defense of western civilization courses to aids to a trip to managua 
to thumb his nose at the sandinista government 
his spirited defense of education budget cuts including a 1987 
attempt to cut in half a 200 million drug education program made 
him unpopular with school groups and some lawmakers 
it was bennett who made the call to embattled supreme court 
nominee douglas h ginsburg in november 1987 suggesting ginsburg 
withdraw because of his admitted use of marijuana while a law 
professor 
bennett himself grew up in the raucous 1960s flirted with the 
idea of joining the radical students for a democratic society at 
williams college and had a blind date as a graduate student in texas 
with hardrocking janis joplin who later died of a drug overdose a 
onetime rock band guitarist he is an unabashed fan of early rock 
n roll of the buddy holly and ritchie valens variety 
in an interview with the associated press after the ginsburg 
affair bennett said he and joplin just drank a couple of beers 
he turned aside a question about whether he had ever used marijuana 
saying i will not join this procession of confessors if i have 
any confessions to make i will make them to a priest i will 
stipulate for the record however i was young 
but bennett had said flatly in prior interviews that he never 
tried illicit drugs 
bush was asked at thursdays announcement if he knew his new drug 
czar was addicted to nicotine bush referred the question to 
bennett but added he knows his mandate 
bennett a longtime twopackaday smoker told reporters you 
will not have a director of national drug control policy who 
smokes asked when he was quitting bennett whose post requires 
senate confirmation said by the time im national director 
he left reagans cabinet in september to write open a small 
policy shop called the madison center and deliver lectures at 
reported fees of up to 15000perapperance 
he found fault with the reagan war on drugs best known for nancy 
reagans just say no crusade 
an allout war on drugs with more resources for police more 
prosecutors more convictions more jail sentences would be 
popular with the american people and it would be the right thing 
to do bennett said in an interview with the heritage foundations 
policy review magazine 
i wish we had done more in the area of drugs we have done a 
lot more than some people will give us credit for but our policies 
on drugs could have been more coherent more direct we could have 
taken not only the moral lead which i think president reagan did 
but more of the legislative lead he said 
according to an account in the new republic last may 23 bennett 
repeatedly urged the pentagon and thenattorney general edwin meese 
to unleash the us military against foreign drug traffickers the 
military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the persian 
gulf did to irans navy bennett reportedly advised in one memo 
bennett is a brooklynborn son of a bank officer and a medical 
secretary who was raised in the virginia suburbs of washington after 
his parents divorced he majored in philosophy at williams after 
abandoning plans to pursue a career in advertising 
after obtaining his phd in philosophy from the university of 
texas at austin and his law degree at harvard bennett taught at 
several campuses and eventually ran the national humanities center 
in research triangle park nc he was chairman of neh from 
19811985 
as the third education secretary he made headlines from the 
start when he defended steep student aid cuts by suggesting some 
students would simply have to undergo divestiture of certain 
sorts stereo divestiture automobile divestiture 
threeweeksatthebeach divestiture 
he infuriated college administrators with his broadsides against 
rising costs and once challenged them to start the new academic 
year by sending each of americas 12 million college students a 
letter warning that drug use would not be tolerated 
but even some of his enemies admired the flood of attention he 
brought to education in a wall street journal poll of notables last 
spring bennett emerged as the choice for best reagan appointee

if elections came down to who was the butt of 
more jokes on latenight television george bush and michael dukakis 
would be sharing the white house and dan quayle would be president 
for life 
a study of monologues by johnny carson and david letterman found 
that the score during the general campaign was virtually a tie 51 
jokes about republican bush to 50 about his democratic opponent 
michael dukakis 
the study by robert lichter and daniel amundson of the private 
nonpartisan center for media and public affairs found that the 
biggest target was quayle the vice presidentelect he drew 52 
barbs more than 10 times democrat lloyd bentsens total of five 
the presidentelect did better as the political season 
progressed during the primary campaigns bush was on the receiving 
end of more jokes than all his democratic opponents combined 
george bushs improved media image this fall even reached into 
the realm of latenight comedy but dan quayle got stuck with gary 
harts role as the allpurpose political joke said lichter and 
amundson 
some of their findings 
when bush mistakenly referred to sept 7 as pearl harbor day 
carson played up the gaffe for three days one example a reporter 
pointed out to bush that the japanese attacked on dec 7 instead of 
sept 7 bush said thats what made it a sneak attack he said if 
they showed up on pearl harbor day it wouldnt have been a 
surprise 
carson on a typical bush photo opportunity he was humming my 
country tis of thee while mother teresa spoonfed him apple pie 
carson on bushs appeal to hispanics george is a good man but 
hes not the most ethnic guy around somebody asked him what he 
thought of cinco de mayo and george said oh ill just have 
regular coffee and he had a bad opening he opened with ich bin 
ein gringo

a cargo ferry slipped out of the 
falkland islands for uruguay and chile in an attempt to reopen 
shipping links with the south american mainland that were ruptured 
nearly seven years ago 
argentina which invaded the islands it calls the malvinas in 
1982 and was driven out 74 days later by the british strongly 
opposes the shipping links uruguay has said it will not cooperate 
unless neighboring argentina agrees while chile says its attitude 
depends on uruguays 
the 777ton indiana i left stanley harbor without fanfare 
thursday carrying 12 passengers believed to be mostly island 
businessmen hoping to establish mainland trading links 
the vessel is expected to reach the uruguayan capital of 
montevideo on sunday then head to the southern chilean town of 
punta arenas at the tip of south america before returning to the 
remote falklands 
the frenchbuilt ship was recently refitted in hull england it 
is a rollon rolloff ferry meaning vehicles can drive aboard 
it is not a regular service which is significant because we 
dont know where demand will come from said graham botterill 
manager of the ship 
we are an international commercial venture and as such can go 
anywhere in the world we like he told reporters in stanley 
botterill said the ship may only sail to montevideo three times a 
season while the ships booking agent tom swales said it is 
not a scheduled service and is different in that respect to say 
running a ferry link between england and france 
the owners hope to attract business executives interested in 
saving on freight costs the present shipping link is with distant 
britain 8000 miles away 
the identity of the indiana is owners is not clear but they are 
known to be a consortium including british japanese french 
taiwanese south korean and spanish fishing companies each of which 
has invested about 260000 
the ship has a british crew is registered in nassau and flies 
the bahamian flag 
argentina claims sovereignty to the south atlantic archipelago 
britain rules it as a colony and says sovereignty depends on the 
wishes of the islanders who overwhelmingly want to stay british 
attempts to launch angloargentine negotiations on the islands 
future are stalled over argentinas demand to put the sovereignty 
issue on the agenda and britains insistence that sovereignty is

a west german affiliate of a company here is 
being investigated as a source of at least one piece of equipment 
used in a suspected libyan chemical weapons plant officials said 
thursday night 
west german officials are investigating material used in the 
libyan factory that may have come from frankfurt zink a european 
affiliate of john zink inc said john zink president bernard benson 
the united states says the plant at rabta about 35 miles 
southwest of the libyan capital of tripoli is a chemical weapons 
factory libya has denied the accusation saying the plant is 
designed to produce pharmaceuticals 
nbc news reported thursday night that us intelligence officials 
determined as early as the summer of 1987 that libya had obtained 
the chemical components of poison gas 
information obtained by the united states included the names of 
companies in west germany and other countries which sold supplies 
equipment and expertise to the libyans the network said 
nbc showed film footage of a zink company sign in frankfurt the 
new york times also has reported that frankfurt zink was among a 
number of companies from which libya obtained materials for the 
plant 
benson said zink officials in the united state were informed by 
west german authorities that the frankfurt affiliate was being 
investigated he said it is believed but had not been confirmed 
that a flare manufactured by the company was used in the libyan 
plant 
its a fairly small part of the plant benson said a 
typical device used in chemical plants to burn off waste gas 
the west german government which had denied that any west german 
firms were involved with the libyan plant announced thursday that 
it had found traces of west german complicity in building the 
factory 
benson said company records indicate that the flare valued at 
about 100000 was to be shipped to a pharmaceutical company in 
hong kong 
whether that actually went to hong kong or went to libya i 
just cant verify he said we have no proof that it did end up 
there libya its early in the discovery process for us 
john zink is a worldwide distributor and manufacturer of 
combustion equipment and environmental control devices and about 
half of its equipment is shipped outside the united states benson

a koreanamerican businessman was arrested 
thursday in an alleged international conspiracy to buy nervegas 
bombs for export from the united states possibly to iran officials 
said 
juwhan yun 48 of short hills was accused in a federal 
complaint of conspiring to violate the arms export control act by 
seeking to ship the gas sarin which attacks the central nervous 
system causing convulsions and death 
it was a wideranging transatlantic conspiracy said first 
assistant us attorney michael chertoff 
the arrest came the same day the west german government reversed 
itself and said it suspected that west german companies helped build 
a libyan plant that the united states believes is for manufacturing 
chemical weapons 
the turnaround followed the arrest wednesday night of a belgian 
shipper tied to the case and confirmation by libya that west german 
firms aided the project libya says the plant is for producing 
medicine 
in the new jersey case chertoff added that at one point in the 
dealings with yun the purported destination was iran but that this 
had not been verified 
yun negotiated with an undercover customs agent posing as an arms 
dealer to buy 500 quarterton bombs that use sarin said richard 
mercier special agent in charge of the us customs services 
office in newark 
mercier described the gas as a very rapid odorless colorless 
poison which can enter the body by inhalation absorption or 
injection 
yun was arrested after his wife dropped him off at customs 
offices in newark where yun believed he was to meet the undercover 
arms dealer mercier said 
if convicted yun faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 
fine he was ordered held without bail by us magistrate ronald

they held an election and no voters 
came 
the two people who requested the referendum held wednesday never 
arrived as planned 
charles and patricia schunk live on property within a 200acre 
parcel annexed in december to the neighboring city of eau claire an 
annexation can be vetoed by residents of the property and thats 
what the schunks did by not voting 
polls at hallie town hall opened at 9 am and stayed open for 11 
hours on the referendum question of whether the land ought to remain 
attached to eau claire 
the schunks are the only residents of the tract town attorney 
david raihle declared the election outcome a 00 tie under state 
law the tie nullified the annexation raihle said 
in an ordinary election hallie is a suburb of 4500 eligible 
voters the 200acre parcel includes vacant lots a few businesses 
and the hallie golf course 
the nullification of the annexation through the nonvote saves 
the town from taking eau claire to court raihle said because some 
nonresident property owners would have insisted on suing 
the referendum cost the town about 125 said town clerk shirley 
sippel

blacks arent getting proper medical care because 
they lack insurance have poor health coverage or have been 
disappointed by doctors studies published today indicate 
the studies also show that blacks are included in fewer tests of 
new drugs and in at least one state tend to get less aggressive 
treatment for heart disease 
they were published in todays journal of the american medical 
association a theme issue coinciding with the birthday sunday of 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
according to a nationwide survey of 10130 us residents one in 
11 blacks said they didnt see a doctor for economic reasons in 
1986 compared with one in 20 whites 
blacks were less likely to have health insurance and those who 
did were less likely to be covered by private insurance and more 
likely to live in a state with limited medicaid benefits said 
researchers led by robert j blandon of the harvard university 
school of public health in boston 
their report said 372 percent of blacks overall had not seen a 
doctor in a year compared with 317 percent of whites 
the disparity was greater for people in poorer health with 322 
percent of blacks going a year without a doctors care compared 
with 175 percent of whites the researchers said 
there continues to be a lack of parity in access to health 
care and a consequent excess of unmet medical needs for blacks 
compared with whites the authors said 
blacks were more likely than whites to live in oneadult 
households perhaps making it harder for them to get to a doctor 
the researchers said 
blacks were more likely than whites to report that during their 
last visit their physician did not inquire sufficiently about pain 
did not tell them how long it would take for prescribed medicine to 
work did not explain the seriousness of the illness or injury and 
did not discuss test or examination findings the study said 
this is true despite that blacks on average are in poorer 
health than whites and continue to have a death rate 1 times 
higher than whites of the same age as well as double the white 
infant mortality rate the researchers said 
medicine in some ways is no different than getting your car 
repaired or deciding whether to spend the night in a particular 
hotel howard e freeman chairman of sociology at the university 
of california at los angeles and a coauthor of the study said 
thursday youre not inclined to do it if past experiences have 
been negative our data suggest theres a greater proportion of 
negative experiences for blacks and the poor in general than there 
are for the more affluent among us 
a related study in the journal found few blacks included in 
trials of new drugs 
a review of 50 medical studies published from 1984 through 1986 
showed that blacks were included in fewer than twothirds of the 
tests said researcher craig k svensson of wayne state university 
in detroit 
svensson said researchers particularly those from companies that 
are seeking government approval for new drugs should include large 
numbers of blacks in clinical trials to determine if the medications 
have different effects based on race 
a third study in the journal examined the treatment of 
heartdisease patients in massachusetts and found that whites had 
more angiography procedures and heart bypass operations 
in angiography doctors take xrays of the heart after injecting 
dye into it allowing them to determine the extent of blood vessel 
blockage 
the researchers drs mark b wenneker and arnold m epstein of 
the harvard school of public health were unable to say if their 
findings were typical nationally but added their study suggests 
that substantial racial inequalities exist in the use of procedures 
for patients hospitalized with coronary heart disease

a substance dentists have long used to strengthen 
teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb 
spinal osteoporosis a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5 
million americans researchers say 
university of texas southwestern medical school researchers on 
thursday announced results from a sevenyear trial of the new 
treatment 
doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of 
trabecular bone found primarily in the spine it most commonly 
affects elderly women and results in shortened stature curvature of 
the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and 
digestive discomfort 
the treatment employs a slowrelease form of sodium fluoride a 
compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which when given 
with calcium citrate can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by 
adding bone mass said dr charles pak mineral metabolism chief at 
southwestern medical center 
pak said fluoride has been available as an osteoporosis treatment 
for decades but caused serious side effects including corrosion of 
the stomach lining painful swelling of the joints and stress 
fractures 
these complications have precluded the longrange acceptance of 
use of fluoride in the united states said pak our treatments 
have been designed to overcome these problems 
in the new treatment fluoride is encapsulated in a waxy pill 
that allows it to bypass the stomach before much of the compound is 
released that helps alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and 
allows the fluoride to be absorbed slowly into the blood at an 
effective but not toxic rate pak said 
each year an estimated 500000 people suffer osteoporosis spine 
fractures and a third of women over age 65 will have spinal 
fractures during their lives the southwestern researchers said 
treatments such as estrogen and calcium supplements which are 
directed at preventing bone loss are useful in averting the 
development of osteoporosis when they are applied early such as 
during the early postmenopausal period said pak but they have 
limited value in patients with established osteoporosis who have 
already sustained a substantial bone loss our treatment is directed 
toward the latter group 
pak said the treatment which has been conducted on experimental 
basis at 10 hospitals around the country does not reverse spinal 
curvature or other damage but does increase bone mass and forestall 
further breakage 
he said it cannot be used by people who have sustained hip 
fractures because of differences in the makeup of hip bones 
pak said he plans to apply to the federal food and drug 
administration in april for approval of the treatment an fda review 
usually takes nine months to 2 years he said 
the new drugs promise to increase the availability and usability 
of osteoporosis treatments said dr lawrence raisz director of 
endocrinology and metabolism at the university of connecticut 
everybody is anxious to have a treatment approved by the fda 
raisz said 
the new drugs were developed by pak and a team of researchers 
with the help of the mission pharmacal co of san antonio 
since 1982 the group has tested the treatment on 251 patients in 
dallas fort worth temple and tyler texas charleston sc 
cleveland and indianapolis 
less than 5 percent of patients at southwestern experienced 
gastrointestinal problems when treated with fluoride for an average 
of 35 years and about 6 percent complained of joint pain 
pak said findings were similar at the other hospitals patients 
spinal bone mass gained 3 percent to 6 percent each year 
the studies were sponsored by southwestern the general clinical 
research center there funded by the national institutes of health 
and the national institute for arthritis musculoskeletal and skin 
diseases

mexican and us officials are investigating 
the origin of a cache of uzi submachine guns and ammunition 
uncovered in the home of an oil union boss charged with the murder 
of a federal agent 
the oil boss joaquin hernandez galicia said the former mayor of 
reynosa across the border from mcallen texas arranged the arms 
shipment the exmayor is believed to have fled with his family to 
the united states according to a highlyplaced source in the 
attorney generals office 
authorities said 200 submachine guns smuggled in from the united 
states were found in the home of hernandez galicia when he was 
arrested tuesday after a shootout with police in ciudad madero 
about 220 miles northeast of mexico city 
soldiers blew down the door of his home with a bazooka and a 
federal agent was shot to death in the ensuing gunbattle 
hernandez galicia among two bodyguards and 48 other jailed 
associates was charged thursday with homicide weapons possession 
importing prohibited weapons and resisting arrest he faces 40 years 
in prison if convicted 
his associates are to be charged with fraud weapons possession 
and tax evasion judicial authorities say 
hernandez galicia 66 told investigators that former reynosa 
mayor jose cruz contreras secretly delivered the uzis and about 
30000 cartridges on dec 10 according to a statement from the 
attorney generals office 
the source in the attorney generals office said mexican 
authorities and fbi and drug enforcement administration officials 
met thursday to try to determine where the arms originated 
in a mexico city prison thursday hernandez galicia said they 
told me my family was kidnapped and if i didnt give a statement 
that pleased the federal attorney general i wouldnt see them 
again 
he told reporters his detention was a dirty prefabricated 
infamy 
several thousand oil workers and supporters demonstrated for his 
release thursday night in mexico citys main plaza 
according to the statement hernandez galicia told investigators 
cruz contreras was accompanied during the arms transaction by juan 
abrego the police chief of hidalgo texas the statement did not 
elaborate 
the texas towns mayor edward vela said thursday that the 
allegations were under investigation 
attempts to reach abrego by telephone were unsuccessful but 
abrego was quoted thursday by the official excelsior news agency as 
saying he had nothing to do with any arms shipment to hernandez 
galicia 
on various occasions i went to his house in ciudad madero 
accompanied by contreras but i never brought him arms abrego was 
quoted as saying 
vela said he talked with his police chief and that abrego would 
continue as head of the 13member police force 
if and when anything is proven we will take the appropriate 
action vela said adding that he was a friend of the former 
reynosa mayor i find it hard to believe cruz contreras is 
involved hes a businessman and does a lot of work with the poor 
and disadvantaged 
hidalgo with about 3000 residents is across the rio grande 
from reynosa reynosa with one of mexicos nine refineries is a 
stronghold of oil workers allied with hernandez galicia 
a bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local 
chiefs to evacuate the unions national headquarters before they 
could vote to choose a new secretarygeneral 
the new leader of the 200000member union sen ricardo camero 
cardiel pledged to use all legal means to win the freedom of 
hernandez and other arrested leaders the daily newspaper la 
jornada said 
camero cardiel replaced salvador barragan camacho barragan 
camacho who has a history of heart trouble is under arrest in a 
hospital 
judicial police showed reporters jewelry valued at more than 13 
million they said was found inside the trunk of barragan camachos 
car 
the oil workers union like most of the labor movement is 
closely tied to the government but hernandez galicia has a 
longstanding feud with president carlos salinas de gortari

dribble diplomacy is alive and well as the israelis 
topped the soviet army team in a basketball contest that had more 
significance off court 
while china had its spell of pingpong diplomacy in the 1970s 
when it decided to warm up to the west the jewish state and the 
soviet union now seem to be improving relations 
at the army sports complex on moscows west side maccabi of tel 
aviv held on to beat the soviet army 9792 to the joyful shouts of 
hundreds of soviet jews who had the rare opportunity to wave an 
israeli flag and proclaim their ancient heritage 
in israel it was estimated that more than 2 million of the 42 
million people followed the game in the first live broadcast from 
moscow maccabi held a 7151 lead with 12 minutes to play but the 
soviet team stormed back to within 9389 on the play of guard 
vladimir gorin and forward sergei tarakanov 
rushhour traffic in major israeli cities was cut to a trickle as 
people sped home early to watch the game israelis gathered in 
pizzerias and cafes to watch jerusalems central mahane yehuda 
market closed three hours early 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir not known as a sports 
buff viewed the game on a small portable tv set in his office 
after ken barlow one of four native american players on the 
israeli team wrapped up the game for maccabi with a short jump shot 
as the clock wound down fans rushed into the streets in israel 
shouting we won we won bus and taxi drivers honked their horns 
inside the stadium soviet jews hugged and kissed each other 
this is joy this is happiness crowed merab 
detrokalashuvili a 38yearold jew from the soviet georgian 
republic the jewish nation is one nation 
on the court the pace had been hectic but with nary an incident 
maccabi captain doron jamshi and coach zvi sherf said nor was any 
disturbance reported in the stands or outside 
relations are very good a pleased jamshi said its like a 
little war we won the war and go home happy 
the teams appearance in moscow for a european championship cup 
game was the first by an israeli team in 15 years 
the soviet team will go to israel for a rematch in march 
it was the first soviet appearance by an israeli basketball team 
since israeli participants in the university games were jeered as 
they walked into lenin stadium in august 1973 
the kremlin severed diplomatic relations with israel following 
the 1967 mideast war and it has been only in recent years under 
president mikhail s gorbachev that sovietisraeli relations have 
shown signs of improving 
the visit of soviet musicians a leading poet and ordinary soviet 
tourists to israel have helped cultural visits are particularly 
popular not leastly because israel has 250000 immigrants from the 
soviet union 
foreign minister moshe arens of israel said the drawing closer of 
the two nations is motivated by soviet desire to play a role in any 
mideast peace settlement and the need to convince israel such a role 
can be constructive 
but for basketballcrazy israel and for soviet jews chanting 
maccabi maccabi in the stadium and waving blueandwhite 
banners bearing the star of david the game was a joy just in itself 
especially that final score 9792 
the usborn players on the israeli team were willie sims who 
has played for maccabi three years he first came to israel to play 
briefly in 1977 then returned in 1981 he played at louisiana state 
university 
barlow has played for maccabi for two years after a collegiate 
career at notre dame 
kevin magee played at ucirvine and came to israel in 1984 to 
play for maccabi 
lavon mercer has been with maccabi one year and before that he 
played seven years with hapoel tel aviv he played at georgia state 
university

last week a peruvian judge issued a restraining order 
indefinitely suspending a threeyear sovietperuvian accord which 
permits 20 soviet trawlers to annually catch 400000 tons of mainly 
mackerel and pacific hake inside perus 200mile limit 
fishermen argued that the contract provided unjust profits to the 
soviets 
the government responded by soliciting another court order 
barring 50 peruvian fishing boats from leaving their home port of 
paita 600 miles north of lima until the contract dispute is 
resolved 
the lima daily el comercio said nearly all of paitas fishing 
boats which supply more than half of the fish consumed 
domestically began a sympathy strike tuesday 
fishing is one of perus most important industries and more than 
4 million tons of fish are caught yearly peru exports nearly 300 
million worth of fishmeal annually the ministry of fishing said

a 12yearold girl who had been sleeping under an 
abandoned house was the first to seek shelter at a public school in 
a new program that offers homeless students a refuge from the chilly 
streets 
right now shes playing checkers with one of the 
administrators said school board president melody ellis we 
just tried to give her encouragement and let her play 
public school officials opened shelters at two schools thursday 
night to provide needy students with beds showers and hot meals 
the 12year old who was not identified was the only one of 
eight children who stayed at the shelters on the first night who met 
the guidelines for the schoolhouse shelters program officials said 
a mother brought five children to a shelter and two teenagers who 
sought refuge gave names of schools outside houston 
if only one child shows up the programs working because 
thats one child thats not on the streets says area schools 
superintendent kaye stripling 
im not disappointed ms ellis said its going to take 
some time for the children to build up a trust factor with us and 
you can imagine how frightened these poor little children are with 
all this attention 
four other boys who came to a shelter decided to leave because 
they feared the attention they might draw said officials who tried 
unsuccessfully to discourage reporters from staking out the shelter 
officials in the houston school district texas largest with 
about 190000 students set up the shelters after increasing reports 
of students living on the streets houston has an estimated 20000 
to 25000 homeless people but its uncertain how many are children 
the program is based on the premise that students who feared 
seeking help elsewhere might turn to a more familiar environment 
school 
under the programs guidelines only students enrolled in houston 
schools are eligible to stay in the shelters which are not meant 
for families or children who should be served by other social 
programs 
one of the two schools is set up to handle children from 
kindergarten through the eighth grade the other is intended for 
high school students 
the red cross donated 75 cots and blankets and area residents 
volunteered to drive the streets in search of children needing 
shelter the cost to houston schools which provided food space and 
security officers was described as minimal 
the program will remain in effect at the two schools until at 
least jan 20 when the superintendent will recommend to the school 
board that it be continued or modified 
despite general support from social agencies some officials have 
doubts about how severe the problem is 
programs already exist for truly homeless children said judy 
hay of harris county childrens protective services 
but supporters of schoolhouse shelters disagreed saying a cold 
front that swept through houston thursday evening may help prove the 
necessity of the program balmy afternoon temperatures dipped to a 
windy 40 degrees by late evening 
these children do not have homes ms ellis said we have 
incidences reported where children have left school and gone home to 
find that there is nobody there anymore

a political scandal involving leading government 
officials has prompted one irate citizen to protest by chopping off 
part of a finger and mailing it to the prime minister police said 
today 
a member of a rightist organization admitted severing the top of 
his little finger on the right hand and sending it to prime minister 
noboru takeshita along with a message protesting political 
corruption a police official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
47yearold protester was a member of an extreme rightist group but 
he refused to identify him because the act was obviously aimed at 
seeking publicity 
the protester included a return address on the package the 
official said 
a package containing the finger was delivered to takeshitas 
official residence on tuesday with a letter describing japans 
leaders as dirty politicians involved in a stockprofiteering 
scandal the official said 
scores of politicians and business leaders were offered the 
opportunity to buy unlisted stocks of recruit cosmos co a real 
estate subsidiary and then reaped hefty profits after public 
trading began 
the scandal has led to the resignation of two cabinet ministers 
and 16 others from the top echelons of the bureaucracy business and 
news media a relative and aide to takeshita also have been 
implicated but the prime minister maintains he was not personally 
involved 
the rightist was also quoted as saying in his protest message 
i urge you to reflect gravely on the situation at the beginning 
of a new era 
emperor hirohito died at age 87 on saturday and his eldest son 
akihito immediately succeeded to the throne 
police said there were no plans to file charges against the 
protester a resident of the saitama region near tokyo and a member 
of a rightwing group known as kokuyukai or concern for the 
country group 
japans rightist groups often drive around cities in 
militarystyle jeeps and trucks blaring recorded marching songs and 
anticommunist slogans 
many extreme rightists advocate revision of the pacifist 
constitution to remilitarize japan and restore the emperor to his 
preworld war ii status as a living god

army officials knew or should have known 
about health and safety hazards threatening civilian workers at the 
us military academy that prompted inspectors to cite 156 
violations a federal official says 
of the violations found by the us occupational safety and 
health administration 107 were classified as serious meaning 
they held a substantial probability that death or serious injury 
can result john tomich oshas new york regional director said 
thursday 
tomich said he was uncertain whether any serious injuries had 
resulted from the violations which included bare electrical wires 
a chlorine gas hazard and unsafe machines 
the military also clearly knew about 30 additional problems but 
failed to make a reasonable effort to rectify them tomich said 
in some cases academy officials had hoped to remove the hazards 
but may have been hampered by budgetary restraints tomich said 
a lot of the violations have to do with basic safety said 
tomich whose albany office headed the investigation for whatever 
purpose the conditions were allowed to exist we were surprised 
at the number of violations and the severity of them 
west point officials said the report which was sent to the 
academy this week still had to be reviewed by the schools 
superintendent lt gen dave palmer and they declined comment 
oshas august 1988 probe was the first time the federal safety 
enforcement agency had investigated west point the osha team was 
dispatched after the academys occupational accident rate rose above 
the national average for the first time in 1988 tomich said the 
national average was 279 accidents per 100 workers a year tomich 
said it was 385 at west point 
besides 3800 civilian employees 4400 cadets and 1600 military 
personnel are at west point said academy spokeswoman andrea 
hamburger 
osha is only authorized to investigate civilian worksites tomich 
said fewer than half of those were inspected at the academy and the 
sites chosen were considered high hazard areas 
the thing that we were surprised at was the sheer numbers that 
we had here tomich said we had 80 or 90 pages of citations 
which is not your normal case and thats not even going into the 
entire facility wall to wall 
among the violations found by osha 
at the cadet gym the academy failed to properly separate tanks 
of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid near the pool the 
combination of the two chemicals would create dangerous chlorine 
gas tomich said adding the potential for them to mix was 
there 
inadequate ventilation at the indoor rifle and pistol range 
created a potentially dangerous exposure to lead particles from 
bullets 
many machines failed to have adequate safeguards against a 
worker getting caught in the apparatus tomich said there was risk 
of amputation 
numerous cases where electrical wiring was either exposed or 
unsuitable tomich said employees risked coming in contact with live 
wires and being electrocuted 
elevated working platforms failed to have guardrails 
many exits were padlocked violating fire safety codes 
despite failing to address these problems tomich said he 
detected no blatant disregard for civilian safety 
in many cases he said army officials basically just 
transferred that information onto a notice of unsafe condition and 
posted it in the area but never corrected it

the head of a government probe on the 
deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned and 
indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to 
the inquiry 
prime minister bob hawke said james muirhead federal court judge 
since 1977 resigned late thursday to become administrator of the 
northern territory 
aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and 
expressed concern that the inquiry set up in 1987 to investigate 44 
aboriginal deaths in police custody since 1980 could be downgraded 
since the inquiry began the number of aboriginal deaths in 
police custody has grown to 104 and muirhead had said the increased 
number would extend his work expected to be completed last month 
two years minimum 
aboriginal activists have charged police brutality as the cause 
an interim report issued last month recommended aboriginal 
recruits replace white police officers suspected of racism and that 
drunkenness be abolished as a crime for aborigines 
most aborigines have died in police cells by hanging after being 
picked up on charges of being drunk and disorderly 
hawke said muirhead who also was the judge in the lindy 
chamberlain trial would continue in his job until april the 
chamberlain trial was the basis for the recent us movie starring 
meryl streep entitled a cry in the dark 
the black action group and the committee to defend black rights 
which represents many of the families of aborigines who have died in 
custody urged the federal government ensure that justice is not 
denied the countrys indigenous population following muirheads 
resignation 
aborigines australias original inhabitants number about 
160000 or 1 percent of the 16 million population government 
figures statistics show aborigines are socially and economically 
deprived 
aboriginal activists declared last years bicentennial marking 
european settlement a year of mourning 
muirhead 63 said aborigines should not fear the probe will wind 
down 
i think the commission is well established he said 
no replacement was immediately named

the us government has evidence implicating west 
german companies in the construction of a libyan chemical factory 
and indicating that the plant began test production of poison gas 
according to news reports 
intelligence sources said a toxic spill occurred during an 
attempt to make poison gas in august and led to frantic phone calls 
to west german companies for cleanup help nbc news reported 
thursday 
imhausenchemie a chemical company whose officials have denied 
any connection with the disputed plant was one of those the libyans 
called for help the tv networks news said 
officials in confirming the nbc report to the new york times 
said the evidence included extensive intercepts of telephone 
conversations between the libyans and their suppliers 
the united states has charged that the plant at rabta about 35 
miles southwest of the libyan capital of tripoli is a chemical 
weapons factory libya has denied the accusation saying the plant 
is designed to produce drugs 
nbc said us intelligence officials determined as early as 
summer 1987 that libya had obtained the chemical components of 
poison gas 
the united states was able to compile detailed evidence of the 
libyan operation through electronic eavesdropping satellite 
surveillance and the use of spies in libya and europe nbc reported 
the information obtained included the names of companies in west 
germany and other countries which sold supplies equipment and 
expertise to the libyans 
earlier this month the washington post also reported that a 
chemical spill occurred at the plant in august 
the west german government had denied any german firms were 
involved with the libyan plant but chancellor helmut kohl announced 
thursday that authorities had seized documents that may show west 
german companies helped build the plant

amnesty international charged that 
burmese military authorities arrested at least three burmese 
students shortly after thailand forced them to return home 
a 21yearold student taken into military custody in a separate 
case died two days after his release apparently from harsh 
treatment in detention the londonbased human rights organization 
said 
the statement dated thursday was received by telex in bangkok 
today a day after another amnesty statement accused thai military 
authorities of forcibly repatriating 22 students who fled burma 
after a bloody military coup in september thai officials said they 
returned voluntarily 
in tokyo japan today announced it would suspend a 74 million 
grant to burma because it is under military rule japans foreign 
ministry said it has not recognized gen saw maung who seized power 
after a bloody september coup as burmas legitimate leader 
the latest amnesty international statement said that according to 
the burmese state radio two students repatriated saturday sao myo 
win tun and kyi moe were arrested shortly after their return and 
taken into military custody for questioning 
amnesty previously said the two students had taken leading roles 
in the august and september demonstrations for democracy in shan 
state 
the statement said other reports indicated authorities arrested a 
third student saturday tu ain tin who had become popular among 
demonstrators for performing prodemocracy songs 
the statement said amnesty also was concerned that another 
prodemocracy demonstrator zaw win tin of the burmese capital of 
rangoon reportedly died dec 30 less than 48 hours after he was 
released from military custody 
he had been arrested several weeks earlier and had apparently 
been held incommunicado without charge or trial since then 
amnesty said he is said to have died from the effect of the 
severe ill treatment he sustained while in prison 
amnesty has reported many burmese arrested for involvement in the 
prodemocracy campaign have been held without charge or trial and 
that some have been tortured or otherwise harshly treated 
students led last years nationwide demonstrations for democracy 
in burma until saw maung took power sept 18 his troops cleared the 
streets by killing hundreds of unarmed demonstrators 
thousands of students fled to thai border areas controlled by 
antigovernment guerrillas seeking refuge and in some cases 
military training thai officials have said about 7000 remain at 
the border 
thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum but then 
army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh broke an international 
campaign to isolate burmas government and reached an agreement with 
saw maung to send the students home 
saw maungs government promised no action against the students 
and denied accusations of arrests and harsh treatment 
under the program the students are brought to tak in northern 
thailand and then flown to rangoon aboard burmese military aircraft 
seventysix students returned thursday bringing to 260 the 
number who have returned under the program thai officials said

killing of its no 3ranking law enforcement officer 
justice minister michael tate announced the reward after

man of this seniority no witness is safe he told a news 
conference all australians have found this killing shocking and 
would want no resources spared in the hunt for the murderer 
winchester 55 was buried today will full police honors in

the us dollar rose in european trading this 
morning as the market continued to react positively to comments in 
washington by west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg 
dealers said 
the stronger dollar depressed gold prices slightly 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar surged in asian dealings 
and continued to rise in europe in response to stoltenberg saying he 
would like to see the dollar remain at around 180 west german marks 
dealers in frankfurt and milan said the markets rally was being 
curbed by fears of central bank intervention 
a trader with the milan branch of a major us commercial bank 
expressed surprise at the strength of the dollars rally so far this 
year spurred mainly by high us interest rates 
lets not forget that the dollar has risen without the benefit 
of a longexpected hike in the us discount rate she said the 
discount rate is the interest rate charged by the federal reserve on 
loans to commercial banks 
but another trader in milan said the primary motive behind the 
dollars rally is speculation 
the us still has a big trade deficit and says it wants a 
lower dollar the west germans have a huge trade surplus and want a 
stronger mark but the dollar surges and the mark falls he said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 053 yen to a closing 12665 yen later in london

an accused killer whose 100000 bail was revoked 
last year after he allegedly threatened a witness was allowed to 
leave jail based on forged court papers that showed a new bail of 
10000 officials said 
george suarez 35 whose 1983 conviction in the murder of an 
elderly pharmacist and a customer at a brooklyn drugstore was 
overturned on a technicality left rikers island jail dec 17 but 
officials only found out thursday when he failed to appear in court 
for his retrial said ruby ryles a correction department 
spokeswoman 
she said a woman whose name was not released had paid the 
10000 bail in cash 
suarez lawyer harold weiswasser said he learned of the escape 
when he walked into brooklyn state supreme court thursday and 
justice ronald aiello asked him where his client was 
i thought the judge was kidding me he said 
authorities then discovered that legal papers had been doctored 
to show that suarezs status had been changed from no bail to 
10000 bail said ryles 
i was shocked and the clerk was quite upset because it was his 
signature that had been forged said weiswasser 
suarez and two codefendants were convicted of seconddegree 
murder in the dec 12 1982 shooting deaths of milton scher 73 and 
34yearold rose degennaro 
suarez and the other two were sentenced to prison with suarez 
getting 50 years to life he was released on 100000 bail however 
after his conviction was overturned on a technicality in december 
1987 ryles said 
suarez was sent back to jail and his bail was revoked last 
september after a witness in the case reported being threatened 
according to a spokesman for the brooklyn district attorneys office 
police have warned the female witness that suarez has escaped 
correction officials also were trying to determine how suarezs 
papers had been changed and to find the woman who bailed him out

of foreign ministers the nonaligned movement cannot lose sight of 
its goal of ending colonialism 
it was the first such highlevel meeting of the nonaligned 
movement since the palestine national council declared an 
independent palestinian state in november 
about 90 countries most from the nonaligned movement have 
recognized palestine and kadoumi thanked them for their support he

calling for a permanent headquarters for the organization 
iacovou in his opening address said the conference was designed 
to make suggestions as to how the movement will become more 
effective and more dynamic

september delegates complained the organization was bloated 
churning out endless documents that nobody read and adopting 
resolutions nobody followed 
the conference on updating the movement emerged from those 
complaints 
foreign minister narasimha rao of india said the movement is at 
a crossroads one road leads to irrelevance the other to the role 
it has played in contributing new ideas to international problems

a decade after predicting measles was on the verge 
of eradication federal health officials have proposed two new steps 
to try to wipe out the disease 
the recommendations issued thursday by the centers for disease 
control could mean an extra measles shot for thousands of infants 
and older children 
according to the cdc the major outbreaks of measles in the 
united states in recent years have occurred among infants under the 
15month vaccination age and among schoolage children who have been 
vaccinated but got measles anyway as many as 10 percent of all 
vaccinations fail to provide the intended protection 
to try to stop the outbreaks the cdcs immunization practices 
advisory committee has recommended 
infants younger than 15 months in areas where recurrent measles 
is a problem should get two measles shots instead of one a shot 
of measles vaccine alone at 9 months and a second dose at 15 months 
in the commonly used measlesmumpsrubella vaccine 
in schools experiencing outbreaks and in nearby schools where 
the disease might spread all students whose measles shots came 
before 1980 should be revaccinated along with their siblings 
that 1980 cutoff was chosen because vaccinations before then may 
not have been as effective either because the vaccine subsequently 
was improved or because the vaccinations came earlier in life 
according to us policy at the time the cdc said 
in the late 1970s cdc measles specialists believed the once 
common childhood disease could be eradicated by fall 1982 but that 
goal was not met from 1983 to 1988 between 1497 and 6282 measles 
cases have been reported in the united states each year 
dr sonja hutchins a cdc measles specialist could not predict 
how many children would be affected by the new recommendations 
adding were in the process of analyzing that now 
the cdcs recommendations are not binding on local health and 
education officials but are widely recognized as health policy in 
the united states 
local health officials will be responsible for monitoring measles 
in their communities and spreading the word about the new 
recommendations ms hutchins said 
the cdcs immunization committee is recommending the twodose 
routine for infants in any county that has had five preschool 
measles cases in each of the previous five years and is urging 
revaccination of certain students at any high school or college 
where an outbreak is taking place or might spread from a nearby 
school 
about one in 10 counties reported at least one measles case in 
1987 more than 800 cases occurred in california alone another 469 
in new york city 452 in texas and 318 in new mexico 
the nations measleseradication strategy which stresses 
vaccination of infants surveillance for measles and aggressive 
outbreak control is unchanged ms hutchins said 
these three elements are still important she said these 
two major recommendations are modifications to the current 
strategy 
the two modifications come with alternatives the cdc said 
in affected areas where a twodose infant schedule isnt 
possible vaccination should come at 12 months not 15 the agency 
said and if a school fighting a measles outbreak cant revaccinate 
all students whose shots came before 1980 it should at least target 
students vaccinated before the age of 15 months

democratic legislator thomas a loftus found 
it troubling enough to be called tommy by the reagan white 
house now republicans rate him a sustaining member of their 
national committee 
loftus speaker of the state assembly is preparing to run in 
1990 against republican gov tommy g thompson 
for several years loftus said thursday the reagan white house 
sent letters addressed to rep tommy loftus 
tommy is the name my mother used to sew in my underwear he 
said 
he said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the gop its 
computerized address system was amiss as an alternative he 
suggested republicans address the correspondence to thomas or tom 
to boot he is among recipients of a form letter signed by 
republican party strategist lee atwater telling him you have a 
noteworthy record of support for republican principles 
loftus said the only part of the letter that really appealed to 
him was its declaration that he has a special grasp of the issues 
and a keen understanding of the challenges we will face as america 
moves into the 1990s 
the atwater letter contained a plastic card that identifies 
loftus as a sustaining member of the republican national 
committee to which he was invited to contribute money

the worlds most populous country is growing 
faster than the food supply threatening chinas economic 
development unless authorities enforce strict birth control 
policies official reports said today 
if we dont strictly control the baby boom more difficulties 
will be passed on to succeeding generations peng peiyun head of 
the state family planning commission told about 6000 people 
gathered thursday night at the great hall of the people 
she was quoted by the china daily newspaper 
the population increase will gobble up all the economic gains 
each year unless it is put under strict control the xinhua news 
agency quoted beijing mayor chen xitong as saying 
china will have 11 billion people by april ms peng told the 
meeting 
she did not announce the birth rate for 1988 but disclosed that 
1987s rate was 23 percent higher than the 2 percent previously 
announced for the year 
the recent barrage of official lectures on family planning may 
indicate that last years rate was higher still the official goal 
is 15 percent growth or lower 
to achieve that goal since the early 1980s the government has 
limited most families to only one child but in the past few years 
more and more families have ignored the limit and the state also 
has seemed to relax the policy 
last year it said rural couples whose first child was a girl 
would be allowed to have a second to try for a son to work on the 
land 
however the combination of soaring population and stagnant grain 
harvests has heightened anxiety among officials 
chen said the rapid growth rate means per capita grain supplies 
will remain about even even if overall grain production is increased 
25 percent to 11 trillion pounds by the year 2000 
however a decline in per capital grain supplies seems likely 
because agriculture officials recently said it will be virtually 
impossible to reach that goal by 2000 
population projections for 2000 are going higher and higher the 
target is 12 billion but family planning authorities said last 
year it more likely would reach 127 or 128 billion 
the economic daily predicted tuesday that it would hit 132 
billion if it continues growing at its current pace 
enforcement of the general onechild policy varies widely from 
one area to another cities are the most strict with most workers 
facing fines and possible dismissal if they have a second child 
but in some rural areas farmers have become prosperous enough to 
be able to afford the fines

transportation 
asked where the rest of the new faces are bush aides have 
suggested theyll be at subcabinet levels of government 
bush himself has insisted that his cabinet does have its share of 
new faces or at least old faces in new jobs 
i set a goal for a broadbased cabinet experienced people 
experienced people bush said in an interview earlier this week 
with usa today i think weve got it theyre giving me a hit a 
little on new faces these are new faces when i said new 
faces i didnt mean i was going to reach out and find everybody

a group of eight west german jet fighters today and collided with 
two of them killing the two british crewmen and injuring a german 
pilot officials said 
several houses were slightly damaged on the edge of the northern 
village of wiesmoor by debris from the tornado but there were no 
civilian casualties local police said 
the tornado crashed into a field just outside wiesmoor while one 
german plane came down a few miles away the defense spokesman said 
the other plane involved in the crash managed to land safely he 
said 
the pilot of the german jet that crashed was injured he said 
the accident came amid growing complaints among the west german 
public about the dangers to civilians from nato training flights 
over this densely populated country more than 100 people were 
killed in militaryrelated plane crashes last year in west germany 
a spokesman at the west german defense ministry in bonn said the 
british plane flew into a group of eight german alfajet fighters 
preparing to land at wittmund air base near wiesmoor 50 miles 
northwest of the port city of bremen 
the defense ministry spokesman who asked not to be identified by 
name said the tornado plane collided with two of the alfajets 
earlier reports indicated the british plane crashed with only one 
german fighter 
a spokesman at the british forces headquarters in rheindahlen 
confirmed the tornado had crashed after the collision killing the 
twoman british crew 
we can confirm that a royal air force tornado jet from no 14 
squadron at the royal air force base brueggen crashed near the

miles south of the crash site 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
tornado was on a routine training mission when it crashed 
a wiesmoor police spokesman said the injured german pilot had 
been taken to a nearby hospital it was not immediately clear 
whether the pilot sustained his injuries while ejecting from the

died after three italian air force stunt jets collided during an air 
show at the us air force base in ramstein that was attended by 
thousands of people 
the last major nato plane crash occurred on dec 8 when a us 
air force a10 thunderbolt slammed into a residential neighborhood 
in the city of remscheid killing the pilot and five people on the

a conference of eastern and western 
nations today informally accepted a landmark accord on human rights 
and security diplomats said the pact calls for freedom of travel 
and religion in the east bloc 
however a greekturkish dispute still blocked a final agreement 
among the 35 nations that is to include a mandate for new european 
talks on conventional weapons said the diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity if the deadlock is broken a final pact 
could be signed on saturday they said 
the disagreement between greece and turkey over a turkish port in 
the eastern mediterranean has prevented negotiators from the 16 nato 
and seven warsaw pact nations from approving the new eastwest talks 
on reducing conventional troops and weapons across europe 
twelve nonaligned nations are also attending the conference 
agreement on the human rights and security accord came after more 
than two years of tough eastwest bargaining at the helsinki review 
conference which opened in november 1986 
a copy of the accord obtained by the associated press showed 
landmark agreements on the freedom of east bloc citizens to travel 
practice religion and monitor their countries compliance with human 
rights 
western diplomats called the vienna document a milestone its key 
test however will be whether the soviet union and its allies 
actually stick to the new commitments 
the pact refined and defined the humanitarian undertakings in 
far greater detail than ever possible before said canadian envoy 
william bauer 
he and other western diplomats said reforms in the soviet union 
played a major role in securing the agreement 
the diplomats also said the human rights provisions contained in 
the vienna document are more specific than any others since the 
helsinki process began with the signing of the helsinki final act in 
1975 
the document also provides a mechanism by which any two of the 
signatories can raise human rights issues western diplomats 
described that agreement as a major achievement 
the conference is scheduled to wind up next week with a threeday 
closing ceremony attended by foreign ministers from all the 
signatories of the 1975 helsinki final act the soviet union the 
united states canada and all european nations except albania 
but that ceremony was put in jeopardy today because of the 
failure to break the deadlock between greece and turkey if the 
impasse is broken a final document could be accepted in a public 
meeting on saturday diplomats said 
turkey agreed with the soviet union that the eastern 
mediterranean port of mersin which is close to syrian border 
should be excluded from the new eastwest arms talks 
but greece insists the port must be considered it says mersin is 
a key port for shipping supplies to northern cyprus which is 
controlled by turkey the rest of the island is controlled by greece 
greek ambassador evangelos frangoulis denied at a news conference 
today that athens raised its objections at the last minute he said 
athens would be happy to put aside the issue until the eastwest 
arms talks open probably in march diplomats say however that 
turkey will not accept this compromise 
in an attempt to break the deadlock the 35nation conference 
worked into the night thursday 
a draft document presented on behalf of the nonaligned nations 
early today was informally accepted by caucuses of nato the warsaw 
pact and the 12 nations of the european economic community 
diplomats said 
the only outstanding human rights issue remained canadas 
acceptance of a controversial human rights conference in moscow in 
1991 
bauer the canadian envoy said this morning he expected firm 
assurances from the soviets during the day that they would permit a 
leningrad couple waiting for 10 years for exit visas to emigrate 
he indicated that canada would then agree to the moscow 
conference

using electrodes connected to a monkeys brain 
scientists at johns hopkins university say they have produced a 
computer image of the brain as it thinks 
we have visualized a thought process a mental 
transformation said dr apostolos georgopoulos a neuroscientist 
and leader of the research team weve used a technique that lets 
a mental process be seen as a physical one 
the teams study published today in science magazine found that 
nerve cells of the motor cortex the part of the brain that controls 
movement can be tracked during the thinking that precedes 
purposeful movement 
the findings might someday help scientists develop artificial 
limbs that respond electronically to the brains instructions 
georgopoulos said 
experiments on a trained rhesus monkey named lambda demonstrated 
that mental calculations showed up on the computer screen 
thousandths of a second before the animal performed a task 
georgopoulos has worked since 1980 to decipher the electrical 
brain activity that determines how an animal responds to stimulus 
such as a shining light 
we know that the brain analyzes the situation and has to 
produce a movement that will be appropriate for the situation with 
the appropriate direction in space georgopoulos said so we ask 
the animal to make that movement and we record the activity of the 
brain and see how the cells interrelate 
using a clocklike device with a circle of light bulbs 
scientists taught lambda to move a metal handle to a right angle to 
whichever light was turned on 
georgopoulos said lambda coaxed with rewards of banana juice 
learned to respond correctly more than 80 percent of the time 
electrodes implanted into the monkeys cortex picked up the 
electrical activity of the cortical cells that control arm movement 
the impulses were relayed to a computer and interpreted into images 
of vectors or directional forces 
the computer graphics showed that milliseconds after the light 
flashed on the electrical activity in those cells displayed a 
tendency to think in the direction of the light the vectors 
then rotated in that direction 
this i believe is the first time one can infer something 
about the psychological processes of the brain georgopoulos said 
you can look at the brain and see theres a rotation

us fighter jets buzzed a libyan commercial airliner 
flying from tripoli to istanbul libyas official jana news agency 
said today 
the report citing a statement by the secretariat of libyas 
general popular committee for communications and maritime transport 
said the incident occurred tuesday after the libyan airlines boeing 
707 had left tripoli communications air space and entered athens 
communications air space 
in washington a pentagon spokesman cmmdr mel sundin said 
we have checked with the appropriate authorities and we have no 
knowledge of any such incident there are a lot of planes over there 
and a lot of military planes if something did happen it may well 
not have involved our planes 
he said us officials would probably investigate the libyan 
claim further 
the week before us jets shot down two libyan military planes 
over the mediterranean us authorities said the attack was in 
selfdefense but libya claimed the american aircraft launched a 
premeditated attack 
the libyan news agency monitored in london said the captain of 
the libyan airliner observed a us fighter plane flying fast from 
right to left and then go behind the airliner 
shortly thereafter the statement said two us fighters 
appeared one from the right and the second from the left each 
about 10 miles from the airliner and at about the same altitude 
they flew alongside the airliner for about 14 minutes the statement 
said 
it added that the captain informed athens air control 
according to jana libya also sent a protest to the arab civil 
aviation and the international civil aviation organizations 
condemning the behavior of the us fighters which it said 
endangered the safety of the airliner 
it said any repetition will be considered a threat against 
international air navigation over the mediterranean

prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted today 
as saying he may unveil a peace plan during a visit to washington 
but will swim against the tide in opposing a role for the plo 
the englishlanguage daily jerusalem post quoted shamir as saying 
in an interview that the us decision to start a dialogue with the 
plo gave new impetus to the 13monthlong palestinian uprising or 
intefadeh in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
i must say that their recent step with the plo caused grave 
damage to peace grave damage to us i think they prolonged the 
intefadeh he was quoted as saying adding that he believed the 
palestinians had been on the verge of giving up 
he said he was developing specific peace proposals that included 
his view of a final settlement for the west bank and gaza strip but 
refused to disclose his ideas saying publicity would invite arab 
rejection 
im thinking in complete frameworks but i do not think that it 
is worthwhile today to make any plan public because this will kill 
it off they will say no and thats it he was quoted as 
saying 
shamir said he would make his ideas clear when he visits 
washington aides said he is expected to travel to washington in 
late february or march to meet with presidentelect george bush 
it could be that i will propose certain ideas or even more 
than that when i go to washington shamir was quoted as saying 
in a sign of flexibility on procedural questions the hardline 
prime minister said he would welcome help in arranging the talks 
from un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar but he was 
adamant in opposing un involvement in negotiations because he 
believed the un is hostile to israel 
i will never trust any decision made by the un or by any un 
institution because we know in advance that any un body no 
matter what its composition is against us he was quoted as 
saying 
shamir was sharply critical of european countries for insisting 
that israel speak with the plo which he considers to be a terrorist 
organization bent on destroying israel despite recent plo

the naacp has sued the new york times charging 
that its real estate ads promote discrimination by picturing whites 
almost exclusively 
the times said in statement that its advertising conforms with 
antidiscrimination laws and that the complaint appeared to be 
without merit 
the plaintiffs who also included a housing rights group said 
photographs and drawings that accompany real estate ads in the times 
depict whites almost exclusively as potential residents thus 
indicating a preference based on race 
decades ago homeowners could hang up signs or run ads that 
said whites only the fair housing laws were designed to change 
all that benjamin hooks director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people said in a statement thursday 
but now developers run ads that say with pictures what they can 
no longer say with words 
the plaintiffs said they recently negotiated an agreement with 
the washington post and some of its advertisers to have black models 
included in real estate ads it said the times declined to enter 
into such an agreement 
the civil rights suit filed in us district court was joined 
by the new york open housing center and four individuals

the chairman of the house ethics committee 
wants to know why the son of an illinois congressman was on the 
congressional payroll while at the same time running for office in 
chicago 
thomas john savage son of rep gus savage dill was on the 
payroll of del walter fauntroy the district of columbias 
nonvoting representative to congress at the same time he was 
running for the illinois legislature from chicago 
rep julian dixon dcalif who chairs the house ethics 
committee has written fauntroy demanding an explanation of the 
younger savages employment a congressional source said thursday 
a federal investigation into the case began last month after the 
associated press reported savage was on fauntroys payroll although 
he had submitted a sworn affidavit to illinois elections officials 
stating he had met state requirements by living continuously for two 
years in the legislative district he sought to represent that 
period covered the time he was on fauntroys payroll 
house rules meanwhile require that a congressional employee 
report regularly to work 
fauntroy first said the younger savage had worked on a district 
of columbia statehood bill but savage later conceded he rarely 
worked in fauntroys office and did little more than stuff envelopes 
when he was there 
thomas savage earned 21398 while on fauntroys payroll from 
september 1987 through june 1988 
dixons letter asked fauntroy to explain how he had come to hire 
savage what duties savage performed and whether savage had 
regularly reported to work the congressional source reported 
a justice department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the fbi also is looking into any connection between fauntroys 
employment of the younger savage and rep savages employment of 
lezli baskerville a former fauntroy aide 
a month before fauntroy hired savage ms baskerville had been 
ousted from a job savage had given her on the house public works and 
transportation committee committee officials said she had not shown 
up for work 
after leaving the public works panel ms baskerville returned to 
fauntroys payroll where she was directed to do legislative work on 
behalf of the national black leadership roundtable a private group 
of black businessmen that fauntroy chairs according to a memo 
provided by fauntroy to his staff 
fauntroy in a statement released thursday said on the advice 
of counsel for the united states house of representatives while i 
have nothing to hide i have nothing to say 
it should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed 
by any law enforcement authorities nor has anyone on my staff even 
talked to any law enforcement authorities 
the fbi officials investigating the matter do not have subpoena 
powers according to sources familiar with the probe 
in addition congressional sources and others familiar with the 
investigation said johnny barnes fauntroys staff director refused 
to meet with fbi agents who attempted to question him barnes 
refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter 
i dont know nothing about no investigation gus savage told 
reporters at chicagos midway airport i havent done anything to 
get investigated 
accusing the assembled media of just wanting to make a story 
savage testily pointed to one reporter and said did you stop 
being a transvestite 
contacted by telephone in chicago on thursday thomas savage said 
he was unaware of the investigation he refused to comment further 
congress is out of session and a telephone call to dixons 
office seeking comment on thursdays developments was not returned 
the fbi conducts a preliminary investigation after an initial 
determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed 
examination ordinarily a report resulting from a preliminary 
investigation is sent to the us attorneys office for review a 
decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury 
in the fauntroy case the preliminary investigation will 
determine whether attorney general dick thornburgh will seek the 
appointment of a special prosecutor the procedure required when 
members of congress are involved

a 15yearold palestinian died today of head 
wounds suffered in a clash with troops and assailants believed to 
be jewish militants smashed a monument to arab soldiers in east 
jerusalem 
mayor teddy kollek called the vandals in the capitals arab 
sector idiots and expressed concern that their action might lead 
to retaliation by arab militants and further fuel tensions in the 
city 
in the occupied gaza strip merchants began a sevenday 
commercial strike after proplo leaders of the palestinian uprising 
called for the move in slogans painted on walls 
the strike is to protest the israeli collection of taxes from 
palestinians nonpayment of taxes is a major tactic of the revolt 
against israel rule 
the israeli newspaper maariv said today the plo has foiled 
israeli efforts to block its funding of the uprising by using 
israeliarab businessmen international organizations and 
ultraorthodox jews to transfer money 
mohammed yaub salhoub 15 died early today at mukassed hospital 
in east jerusalem a day after being shot in the head by troops 
during clashes in the nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied gaza 
strip hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the death but said it was checking the 
circumstances 
the death brought to 352 the number of palestinians killed in the 
13month uprising fifteen israelis have also died in the unrest 
the monument to soldiers of the arab legion outside the 
rockefeller museum was partially smashed said police spokesman alex 
lapidot he said police had no suspects 
an anonymous caller told israel army radio the monument was 
damaged by lovers of the land of israel and the jewish people 
the caller said the attack was carried out to protest the 
dismantling by troops two days ago of a monument erected by jewish 
settlers in honor of an israeli taxi driver slain in the west bank 
settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to jews killed 
in the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban 
the people who did this are stupid they are idiots said 
kollek he said the city would offer to repair the monument 
police imposed a curfew in east jerusalems silwan neighborhood 
after they arrested 14 people including nine said to be firebomb 
throwers 
it was only the third time a curfew was clamped on a jerusalem 
neighborhood during the uprising curfews are a frequent measure of 
control and punishment in the occupied lands 
in a newspaper interview published today prime minister yitzhak 
shamir accused the united states of prolonging the uprising by 
opening a dialogue with the palestine liberation organization last 
month 
it gave a great push and great encouragement to people who 
perhaps had reached a point where they were considering desisting 
from this way the uprising he was quoted as saying in the 
jerusalem post 
the united states ended a 13year ban on contacts with the plo 
after its chief yasser arafat last month renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist 
the maariv newspaper and palestinian journalists said the closing 
of arab banks and limits put on money palestinians can bring into 
israel have not halted plo funding of the uprising 
maariv said a fringe group of ultraorthodox jews who believe 
the state of israel cannot exist until the coming of the messiah 
transfer money to palestinian activists but demand a 25 percent fee 
for religious seminaries 
it said arab public figures from northern israel and israeliarab 
businessmen belonging to the islamic opposition movement have pumped 
millions of dollars into the uprising by laundering money through 
legitimate businesses 
also today palestinian notables considered moderates confirmed 
they met earlier this week in jerusalem with leaders of the american 
israel public affairs committee aipac a proisrael lobby in 
washington that has spearheaded the fight to block the plos 
diplomatic gains 
the meeting took place at the jerusalem residence of us consul 
philip wilcox and also included plo supporters said one of the 
participants west bank lawyer jonathan kuttab 
kuttab said such meetings are useful because only staunch 
supporters of israel such as aipac could eventually persuade 
israeli leaders to drop their resistance to talks with the plo 
the only people who can change israels views are friends like 
aipac he said criticism from any other source could reinforce 
israels paranoia and fears

a car bomb exploded today in a suburban 
district of south beirut controlled by the proiranian militia 
hezbollah killing at least six people and injuring 14 police said 
the blast came on the sixth day of fierce fighting between 
hezbollah or party of god and the rival amal militia for control 
of south lebanon police said two civilians were killed as the 
militias battled with mortars and machine guns and another three 
were wounded 
the afternoon blast in beiruts bir elabed neighborhood came a 
half hour after thousands of hezbollah supporters demonstrated 
against the syrianbacked amal a police spokesman said 
he said the demonstrators who included hundreds of women clad in 
black chadors from head to toe had disappeared from the streets 
when the car bomb went off 
the protesters chanted death to america the great satan and 
death to amal chief nabih berri as they marched through the 
streets following noon prayers 
if it happened during the demonstration it would have been a 
much greater disaster with plenty more casualties said the 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
he said the bombladen car was a dark blue mercedesbenz rigged 
with 220 pounds of tnt 
the explosion touched off several fires in bir elabeds roweiss 
neighborhood and many shops and cars parked nearby were gutted 
police said 
reporters saw at least 10 cars that had been reduced to piles of 
twisted metal twentysix others also were damaged on both sides of 
the street where the explosion occured 
police said the wounded included a driver for a western news 
agency and a photographer from a local beirut newspaper both are 
lebanese 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the car 
bombing the first in lebanon this year by police count there were 
20 car bomb explosions in lebanon last year that killed 116 people 
and wounded 488 
another police spokesman said the amal gunners slammed 120mm 
rounds at the rate of 10 per minute into the village of jbaa held 
by hezbollah fighters jbaa is 30 miles southeast of beirut 
the new casualties in the south raised the toll to 114 killed and 
230 wounded since the clashes broke out sunday on the western edge 
of israels selfproclaimed security zone 
the police spokesman said thuds from exploding shells and 
staccato bursts of machine gun fire echoed across the valleys of 
iklim tiffa 
the spokesman said hezbollahs firepower was much weaker than 
that of amals hezbollahis responded by shelling amal 
positions 
it appears that amal has started a war of attrition to force 
the isolated hezbollahis to consume their stocks of ammunition 
before trying to storm their positions again the spokesman added 
most of jbaas 6000 residents fled the village after hezbollah 
gunmen captured it sunday along with nearby hamlets 
in a counterattack monday amal recaptured four villages west of 
jbaa 10 miles southeast of the port of sidon but have failed to 
dislodge hezbollah fighters from the mountain stronghold jbaa is 
the key to a 9squaremile enclave controlled by around 500 
hezbollah fighters 
on thursday hezbollahis repulsed a 1000strong amal force the 
police spokesman said 
amal or hope has cut off supply lines to the hezbollah enclave 
by blocking its northern western and southern approaches hostile 
israelibacked militiamen of the south lebanon army man positions to 
the east 
hezbollahs shiite zealots aim at creating an islamic republic in 
lebanon along the lines of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis state in 
iran 
the more secular amal favors a government that would give 
lebanons moslems and christians equal shares in running the nation

libya today flew the body of a us pilot killed in 
the 1986 raid on tripoli to rome where a vatican representative 
turned over the flagdraped coffin to italian officials 
the body was to be handed over later to us officials 
the libyan military plane a white sovietbuilt ilyushin with a 
tiny green libyan flag near one window arrived at romes ciampino 
airport at 345 pm 
the libyan news agency jana said thursday that libya was 
returning the body but did not identify the pilot however jana 
reported on dec 24 that libyan leader moammar gadhafi was offering 
to return the body of capt paul lorence 31 of san francisco 
libyas gesture comes during increasing international debate over 
a suspected poison gas factory in libya and only nine days after 
us warplanes shot down two libyan jets over the mediterranean sea 
jana also has complained that a libyan airlines plane en route 
from tripoli to istanbul on tuesday was buzzed over the 
mediterranean by us fighter planes the pentagon said it had no 
knowledge of such an incident 
at the airport a delegation including two vatican officials and 
several italian diplomats and air force officers met the plane no 
us officials were present 
the white coffin draped with an american flag and topped with 
wreaths of red and orange flowers was carried off the rear section 
of the plane by the italian air force officers in blue uniforms and 
libyans in green fatigues 
the casket was set on the ground briefly before the air force 
officers tranferred it to a blue police mortuary van the body was 
to be taken to a morgue for identification 
one of the vatican officials monsignor francesco mointerisi 
said italian officials would later turn over the body to the 
americans 
the vatican said it was acting as an intermediary for 
humanitarian reasons vatican sources said the libyans first 
approached the vatican around dec 15 
jana said thursday that in the framework of the humanitarian 
initiatives to which the great fatah september revolution libyan 
government devotes a fundamental interest the body of the american 
pilot will be handed tomorrow 13th january to the representative 
of the vatican representing his holiness the pope 
lorence and fernando ribasdominicci 33 of utuado puerto rico 
were in an f111 that disappeared during the april 15 1986 raids 
on tripoli and benghazi witnesses reported seeing an f111 crash 
into the mediterranean soon after the plane being hit during the 
raid 
the other 17 us air force bombers returned safely to their 
bases after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities 
three months after the 1986 us attack libyan television showed 
pictures of a body it said was lorences libyan authorities have 
made no mention of ribasdominicci 
president reagan said the attack was in retaliation for what he 
called libyas support for international terrorism 
libyan authorities said the raids killed about 40 people 
gadhafi was quoted as saying in the dec 24 dispatch that he was 
returning the body especially since this occasion coincides with 
the end of the rule of the reagan administration 
the move follows the jan 4 downing by us jets of two libyan 
planes over the mediterranean us authorities said the attack was 
in selfdefense but libya claimed the american craft launched a 
premeditated attack 
the libyan gesture also comes after washington threatened 
possible military action against a nearly completed plant in rabta 
40 miles from tripoli that it says is intended for chemical weapons 
production

a koreanamerican businessman arrested in an 
alleged conspiracy to purchase nervegas bombs had contacts in 
britain south korea and possibly iran but officials say its still 
unclear who wanted the weapons 
juwhan yun 48 was arrested thursday and was being held without 
bail at the metropolitan correctional center in new york city 
pending a bond hearing tuesday 
a federal complaint accused yun of conspiring to violate the arms 
export control act by seeking to ship bombs containing sarin a gas 
that causes convulsions and death by attacking the central nervous 
system 
yun negotiated with an undercover us customs service agent 
posing as an arms dealer to purchase 500 quarterton bombs and other 
weapons said richard mercier chief agent at the federal agencys 
newark office 
he described the gas as a very rapid odorless colorless 
poison which can enter the body by inhalation absorption or 
injection 
no weapons were ever delivered officials said 
i cant say that there was any indication there was ever any 
plan to use it or in fact there was actually an end purchaser who 
had plans to deploy it in any fashion said michael p chertoff 
first assistant us attorney 
at one point in the dealings the purported destination for the 
bombs was iran but that has not been verified chertoff said 
yun also contacted the undercover agent about the possible 
purchase of tow antiarmor weapons and stinger antiaircraft 
missiles apparently for delivery to iran the complaint said 
a briton charles caplan also was charged in the case which 
chertoff called a wideranging transatlantic conspiracy 
concern over the potential spread of chemical weapons has 
intensified recently at a united nations conference in paris on 
wednesday more than 140 nations reaffirmed the 1925 geneva protocol 
banning the use of chemical arms 
yuns arrest came the same day the west german government 
reversed itself and said it suspected german companies helped build 
a libyan plant the united states believes is a chemical weapons 
factory libya says the plant will produce medicine 
yun was arrested when his wife dropped him off at customs offices 
in newark where he believed he was to meet the undercover agent 
mercier said 
if convicted yun faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
he told us magistrate ronald hedges that his short hills home 
was worth 650000 and that he also owns a 400000 new york city 
condominium he said he has three children and has been in the 
united states for 17 years 
the arrest followed a sevenmonth investigation that also 
involved the us department of defense the army and navy and 
french and british customs officials 
according to the complaint the undercover agent contacted yun 
after customs received a tip from a confidential informant that 
komex international corp of summit was seeking to buy ammunition 
for export to south korea yun was identified as president of komex 
an importexport company that had engaged in legitimate arms 
dealings 
on nov 27 the complaint said yun telephoned caplan who 
operates domino associates of london caplan asked yun if he could 
obtain 200 to 500 sarin bombs and three days later yun asked the 
customs agent if he could obtain the ordnance the complaint said 
throughout the negotiations yun was communicating with ky joo 
president of kwang jin trading co in seoul the complaint said 
french officials entered the investigation when yun discussed the 
deal via facsimile with joo who was staying in a french hotel 
in subsequent fascimile messages last month yun and caplan 
discussed the purchase of a minimum of 500 sarin bombs for 12000 
each 
yun met with caplan and two other people in a london hotel 
earlier this month authorities said the two others were described 
in the federal complaint as coconspirators but were not identified 
caplan could be extradited chertoff said 
caplan recently completed a ninemonth prison sentence in britain 
for conspiring to export 50 gun silencers to libya in 1985 through a 
company called domino avionics 
he was described in court as a former employee of cbstv in the 
united states and a former military consultant his attorney said he 
was a smalltime businessman and had a very small part of the arms 
business 
a british customs spokesman who requested anonymity said of the 
nerve gas case we were approached by the us authorities in 
connection with this case and we conducted our own inquiries 
the spokesman added that british authorities have been unable 
to produce any evidence that an offense has been committed in the 
united kingdom 
a man who answered the telephone at komexs offices declined 
comment and hung up 
messages were left on a telephone answering machine at domino 
associates holdings ltd defence suppliers offices in london they 
were not immediately returned

a prosecutor today said he has 
opened a criminal investigation into the imhausenchemie company 
which the united states claims helped build a chemical weapons plant 
in libya 
werner botz chief prosecutor in offenburg said he opened the 
probe after reading a report on the dispute in this weeks stern 
magazine 
stern a nationwide news magazine known for its investigative 
reporting said imhausenchemie was involved in the libyan plant 
along with ibi engineering of frankfurt and the hamburgbased pen 
tsao medical material company 
imhausenchemie has denied any connection to the plant in rabta 
60 miles outside tripoli news reports and us government sources 
have said imhausenchemie provided much of the technical equipment 
for the facility which us officials said was built to manufacture 
poison gas 
libya said the plant will produce pharmaceuticals 
hans frey a spokesman for the prosecutors office in karlsruhe 
near offenburg said the possible charge being investigated is a 
violation of the export control law he said he had no other 
information about the probe 
imhausenchemie ibi and pen tsao have been named by us 
officials in their accusations that west german companies aided 
libya in building the plant 
federal officials have audited imhausenchemie and said they 
could find no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the lahrbased 
company 
federal officials also cleared pen tsao of suspicions of 
wrongdoing but said investigators were examining records seized from 
ibi which is no longer in business 
tv and magazine reports have shown bank documents and other 
records said to establish libyan financial links with 
imhausenchemie and ibi 
chancellor helmut kohl said thursday authorities uncovered new 
documents implicating west german companies in deliveries of 
equipment for the plant 
his spokesman friedhelm ost today conceded that bonn officials 
first learned of indications in october that west german 
companies were involved with the plant 
ost was asked about reports alleging bonn officials have known 
for as long as two years that imhausenchemie and other west german 
companies may have been involved in the project 
he said intelligence sources mentioned the possibility of west 
german involvement in october but contended they had no evidence 
then or now that can be used for legal action against any west 
german companies 
todays announcement followed the arrest of a belgian shipping 
agent linked to the case and confirmation thursday by libyas un 
ambassador that west german companies assisted in the project 
the ambassador ali treiki told cbs that west germany did help 
us not only in this plant in other plants also 
federal officials said this week that belgian authorities had 
arrested and charged jozef gedopt directorgeneral of cross link nv 
of antwerp with forging shipping documents for goods delivered to 
libya 
the zdf television network said gedopts company allegedly used a 
cyprusregistered freighter to deliver west german equipment to 
libya in february 1986 after forging destination papers 
nbc news reported thursday that libyan officials contacted west 
german companies for cleanup help after a dangerous chemical spill 
in august at the facility 
both nbc and the new york times quoted unidentified officials as 
saying the evidence included extensive interceptions of telephone 
conversations between the libyans and their suppliers

think necessary end to the legal career of one who has in times less 
beclouded by poor and corrupt judgment served his country in high 
office

in income for 1983 and 1984 and operating an illegal bank in which 
investors lost 44 million

arrest fined 500000 and ordered to enter an alcohol treatment 
program he was later suspended from practicing law pending final 
decision of the appeals court

investigators have determined that the engines of a 
boeing 737 that crashed sunday north of london were correctly wired 
a newspaper said the report if true would rule out a possible 
cause of the disaster 
meanwhile the planes engines were crated for shipment today to 
france where the manufacturer will search for clues to the cause of 
the crash 
the british midland airways jet flying from london to belfast 
crashed into a roadside embankment while attempting an emergency 
landing at an airport 100 miles north of london the disaster killed 
44 people and injured 82 
investigators are now trying to solve a major mystery in the 
crash why the planes right engine shut down when the left engine 
was on fire 
us and british authorities earlier this week ordered checks on 
the wiring of similar aircraft engines that move prompted 
speculation that a faulty alarm system may have misled the british 
midland airways crew into shutting down the wrong engine causing 
the crash 
the pilot had reported his right engine on fire but evidence of 
a fire was found afterward only in the left engine 
the times of london said investigators were as certain as can 
be that the engines were correctly wired after checks on similar 
engines ended thursday 
investigators are still no nearer to discovering the cause of the 
engine problems and do not know if the cockpit misinterpreted 
instruments in the control panel the paper said 
the cfm56 engines jointly made by usbased general electric 
and snecma of france will be stripped down at snecmas plant south 
of paris the british transport department said

the military today denied a 
claim that it was aiding angolan rebels in violation of a peace 
treaty and said angola should negotiate with the guerrillas to bring 
peace to the region 
maj valeriano martinho an angolan member of a commission 
monitoring the ceasefire between south africa and angola told 
journalists visiting the area thursday that monitoring posts had not 
been established in southeastern angola 
he also said he believed south africa was continuing to supply 
the rebel group the national union for the total independence of 
angola through gaps in the border between angola and the south 
africanruled territory of namibia 
the rebels control the territory and their leader jonas savimbi 
said several months ago that he would attack any troops trying to 
enter the area 
under a treaty signed dec 22 south africa has agreed to 
withdraw from namibia and allow it to become an independent nation 
and cuba has agreed to pull its troops out of angola south africa 
and angola also agreed to establish monitoring posts along the 
border 
the negotiations did not include the angolan rebels who have 
received aid from south africa and the united states in their 
13year war with the marxist angolan government which has been 
supported by cuban troops 
south africa responded to martinho with a statement that said the 
military had done everything and more that is required of it in 
terms of all the agreements signed between south africa angola and 
cuba 
the statement said south africa was prepared to establish the 
monitoring posts on its side of the border but is aware of the 
fact that the angolan armed forces are experiencing difficulties 
with the guerrillas 
the best possible solution to the problem would be for angolo 
to negotiate with the rebels the statement said 
savimbi says his guerrillas are fighting for a government of 
national unity to be followed by free elections the angolan 
government has refused to negotiate with him

the official news agency tass today expressed 
serious doubts over a story it ran about six men allegedly pulled 
from the rubble in leninakan 35 days after the armenian earthquake 
regrettably we are unable so far to confirm with full 
certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our armenian 
colleagues about the leninakan miracle nor can we categorically 
deny them tass said 
todays urgent dispatch was headlined one always wants 
miracles 
tass reported thursday that the six men had been rescued a day 
earlier from the basement of a wrecked ninestory apartment building 
after being trapped for five weeks after the dec 7 earthquake 
the chief source of information for the tass account was aikaz 
akopyan a 50yearold electrician akopyan was quoted as saying he 
and the other men survived because the basement was used to store 
canned vegetables smoked ham stewed fruit and pickles 
soviet television broadcast an interview thursday night with 
akopyan from his hospital bed and the communist party daily pravda 
and other soviet newspapers printed his account of the ordeal and 
rescue the story was widely reported in the united states 
but tass said disturbing questions surfaced when armenian 
reporters began to check into akopyans story 
why for instance a day after the miraculous salvation was it 
possible to locate only aikaz akopyan in a yerevan hospital tass 
asked in the dispatch 24 hours after publication of the first 
report where is the survivors sister who failed to appear at 
the hospital on friday though she promised to do so 
artem shakhbazyan a journalist with the stateowned armenian 
news agency armenpress said in a telephone interview that agency 
reporters searched hospitals in yerevan and the earthquake zone for 
the other five survivors today failed to located them 
military authorities brought into leninakan for the relief effort 
also knew nothing of the rescue related by akopyan he said 
there are doubts about all of this shakhbazyan said 
however he said akopyan was known to be a leninakan resident 
and that four neighbors who visited him at yerevans hospital no 3 
verified that his home had been destroyed by the quake and his wife 
and children killed 
he maintains that what he said happened just as he said it 
that he was trapped for 35 days with five other people the 
armenpress reporter said he said akopyan was given a psychiatric 
examination today and found to be sane 
akopyan was suffering from pneumonia and was in a weakened 
condition shakhbazyan said 
tass said that when akopyans account was sent to its moscow 
headquarters by armenpress it was immediately circulated around 
the world on the tass wire picked up by radio and television with 
more details added by correspondents of several soviet newspapers 
everyone wanted to believe in the leninakan miracle it said 
tass recalled a previous report that 17 earthquake victims had 
survived for weeks in a wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted 
snow that report was denied by rescue officials 
a host of other news items from armenia truthful and invented 
sell on the world news market tass said it is understandable 
one wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being 
saved on the 35th day after the quake

backers of a planned memorial honoring blacks 
who served in the revolutionary war banked their first major 
corporate contribution friday and said they hoped to build it in 
washington by 1991 
design and construction of the black revolutionary war patriots 
memorial is expected to cost about 4 million said bill noack a 
spokesman for general motors which contributed 25000 to the 
project 
gm also plans to sponsor a dinner in washington on may 23 aimed 
at raising another 250000 noack said 
the memorial is intended to honor the 5000 black soldiers and 
sailors who fought in the revolutionary war as well as black slaves 
who ran away or petitioned for freedom during the era according to 
maurice a barboza president of the black revolutionary war 
patriots foundation 
gm group vice president marina whitman who presented the 25000 
check to barboza at a news conference said we are here today to 
correct the historical record if you will the 5000 or so black

support are not prominent in the pages of history yet they 
made a meaningful contribution to our freedom as a nation

air traffic controllers reached tentative 
agreement with the federal aviation administration on their first 
union contract since president reagan fired 11400 controllers in 
1981 
its a clear victory for both the faa and the union said 
union president r steve bell who predicted easy approval of the 
agreement by the national air traffic controllers associations 
7000 members they make up just over half of the nationwide 
controller workforce 
it represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and 
management at faa in sharp contrast to past problems said faa 
spokesman john g leyden 
the tentative contract was signed late thursday after a third 
round of talks in baltimore md the negotiatons began in washington 
in november 
the union won the right to represent the 13000 controllers in 
june 1987 the former union the professional air traffic 
controllers organization was forced into bankruptcy and decertified 
after reagans mass firings of most of its members during the strike 
the contract does not cover salaries which are set by congress 
or any matter that would significantly increase cost of the 
operation 
it covers some working conditions guaranteeing employees breaks 
and changes in working positions after every two hours the 
controllers monitor and control air traffic at about 400 
installations around the country 
the contract also sets up several committees on safety 
technology and other matters a development that union negotiator 
elizabeth thomas of tamiami fla said would give the union more 
involvement in faa decisionmaking 
among provisions are participation of the union in accident 
investigations that involve a controllers actions immunity for 
controllers who report deficiencies in the system local and 
national committees on keeping a safe workplace and evaluation of 
possibly setting up a program to deal with job stress 
controllers earn between 19000 and 55000 a year depending on 
experience and the number of operations conducted at their assigned 
facilities

george bush may be the big elephant in the 
inaugural parade next week but his buddies on a world war ii 
submarine remember him as ellie the elephant the funloving 
young navy pilot they rescued from the pacific ocean 44 years ago 
surviving crew members of the uss finback are looking forward to 
a nostalgic reunion with bush here next wednesday two days before 
they watch him take the presidential oath of office on the west 
front steps of the capitol 
inaugural planners have passed the word to several finback 
veterans that bush is setting aside time to meet with them at blair 
house across the street from the white house to swap war stories 
and renew old acquaintances 
prime bleacher seats have been reserved for the inaugural parade 
friday down pennsylvania avenue for nearly 30 survivors of the 
finback crew plus several of bushs old fellow pilots who are 
expected to attend the inauguration 
bush was nicknamed ellie by the finbacks officers for his 
wardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant 
it wasnt because we all sat around thinking we were 
republicans said retired rear adm lawrence heyworth 67 of 
virginia beach va who was the finbacks torpedo and gunnery 
officer 
we must have seen one in a tarzan movie we just thought 
elepants were funny we kept asking george to do it over and over 
again 
bush was plucked from the pacific on sept 2 1944 shortly after 
he bailed out of his flaming grumman avenger torpedo bomber over the 
bonin islands 600 miles south of japan 
bush won the distinguished flying cross for heroism during the 
bombing raid against an enemy radio communications center the 
citation noted that bush then only 20 completed his dive and hit 
his target even after his plane was hit and engulfed in smoke his 
two crew members were lost 
at that time he was just another downed pilot said don 
kohler 64 of rogers ark the torpedoman who helped pull bush out 
of his bobbing orange life raft to the safety of the finbacks deck 
nobody back then knew hed become president of the united states 
during the month he spent on the finback before saying goodbye at 
midway island bush eagerly took his turn at night lookout watches 
and other seagoing duties watched betty grable movies in the 
wardroom and donned earphones to listen in awe as the submarines 
torpedoes sank two enemy ships 
retired navy cmdr we bill edwards who filmed bushs 
rescue with a kodak movie camera from the finbacks conning tower 
remembers bushs surprise that his first meal on the submarine that 
night was filet mignon and fresh strawberry shortcake with whipped 
cream 
he said hed been eating nothing but spam and beans on the 
carriers edward 67 said in a telephone interview from his 
retirement home at bay st louis miss 
bush was one of three navy pilots rescued by the finback during 
us carrier raids against the bonin islands in early september 
i remember he was very lively obviously intelligent and very 
personable said heyworth all three pilots we rescued were 
bright brighteyed young men but george seemed the most outgoing 
and had the most ebullient personality he was the most 
entertaining and he made us laugh a lot

court reversed the ruling and returned the case to us district 
court in ann arbor

the state commission on judicial conduct 
today took up a complaint against a dallas judge who said he gave a 
killer a lenient sentence because the victims were queers 
the closeddoor inquiry could result in dismissal of the 
complaint against judge jack hampton or in sanctions ranging from a 
private warning to the appointment of a special master to hold a 
hearing on his removal from the bench 
commission chairman judge william e junell said that the 
11member panel of judges and private citizens would begin by 
hearing a staff investigative report on the matter 
last month hampton said he gave 18yearold richard lee 
bednarski 30 years in prison instead of the maximum of life in part 
because the two victims were homosexuals he said the victims were 
cruising for teenagers 
gay rights and civil liberties organizations filed a complaint 
with the commission asking for hamptons removal he later 
apologized for a poor choice of words 
junell said hampton might be asked to talk to the commission

communist party leaders are ready to make 
solidarity legal again if the trade union will help back their 
political and economic reforms a government source said friday 
the source a party member informed about preparations for a key 
meeting of the party central committee on monday and tuesday 
characterized the decision as a gamble and revolutionary for 
poland 
if it is accepted by the opposition it will mark the end of an 
era of political impasse in poland and represent an admission that 
authorities efforts through most of the 1980s to destroy the east 
blocs only independent union movement have failed 
solidarity leader lech walesa was not available for comment 
friday evening 
union national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said he had not been 
expecting such a dramatic action from the central committee meeting 
but if it happened it would be very good and could open the 
road to talks between the opposition and the government 
members of the ruling politburo led by gen wojciech jaruzelski 
visited factories friday to inform party units about the plenum the 
staterun pap news service reported 
the source who demanded anonymity said solidarity could be 
legalized in a few months if it agrees to certain conditions which 
he said might be expected to include a promise to obey a 1982 union 
law that spells out arbitration procedures in collective bargaining 
disputes and bans wildcat strikes 
solidarity banned seven years ago has said it would accept 
legalization within the framework of that law 
solidarity would also be expected to begin talks immediately with 
the authorities the source said it would be asked to agree with 
authorities on the form and aims of a new election law that could 
result in a substantial presence of the opposition in parliament 
but leave the party in a coalition majority with the allied 
peasant and democratic parties the source said 
the arrangement would mean the communists would have diminished 
power in the parliament because they now have an absolute majority 
and do not need the coalition parties to rule the source said 
parliamentary elections are scheduled this year and jaruzelski 
has stressed that more opposition voices should be heard in 
parliament however the party wants to allocate seats to various 
constituencies rather than have westernstyle competition among 
opposing parties as the opposition prefers 
other topics for discussion would be on the formation of a second 
chamber of parliament and on a permanent council of national 
reconciliation a committee that would represent a broad political 
spectrum of views and seek consensus on major issues 
compromise with the opposition is possible in part because of the 
changing international situation including the reforms being 
carried out by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and the easing of 
ussoviet tensions the source said 
authorities expect the west to support polish reforms and 
encourage the opposition in a positive sense but not to back 
adventures revolt and civil war he said arguing that only 
peaceful change not confrontation will bring results 
poland also expects the decision to recognize solidarity to lead 
western governments to look more favorably on the countrys requests 
for credits in such forums as the paris club the international 
monetary fund and the world bank the source said 
the country already has hints that western governments will look 
on the action favorably he said 
we hope that this decision will facilitate financial relations 
with the west and western participation in the polish reform said 
the source 
we count on the opposition being loyal so we can have this 
year a legal opposition in poland the source said 
he said the compromise as he described it was possible but not 
100 percent sure there are people against agreement 
there are party members who oppose the compromise especially 
within the official trade union movement opzz but jaruzelski and 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski favor the agreement and have 
sufficient backing to produce a declaration at the party meeting 
the source said 
the source estimated that no more than onethird of central 
committee members will be opposed or hesitate before approving the 
decision 
the source said walesa must decide if he prefers legalization 
and some divisions in his ranks or unity and continuation of the 
situation 
according to our knowledge walesa and those around him are for 
the agreement he said 
solidarity was suspended and then banned after a dec 13 1981 
military crackdown when authorities said the union had been taken 
over by radicals intent on toppling polands communist system 
the union had a 16month legal existence after august 1980 and 
continued to be active after the imposition of martial law first as 
an underground organization and more openly since a 1986 political 
amnesty

contradictory bookkeeping procedures and 
a desire to boost commissions within the treasurers office 
contributed to losses of 279 million in the states investment 
fund gov arch moore said 
moore who leaves office monday announced the findings of a 
private audit of the fund thursday it was the republicans first 
public comment on the investment fund loss since it became public 
after the nov 8 election in which moore was defeated by democrat 
gaston caperton 
state officials havent said yet which state agencies and local 
governments will absorn the losses so the effect of the missing 
money is not clear said house finance chairman george farley a 
democrat 
even without taking into account the missing 279 million the 
state has been experiencing financial problems so severe that income 
tax refunds were delayed up to five months in 1988 
house of delegates speaker chuck chambers a democrat said after 
the governors announcement that it appeared the board of 
investments wasnt paying attention when the investment fund was 
losing money 
moore chairs the board whose other members are treasurer a 
james manchin and auditor glen gainer the board has nominal control 
of the investment fund 
moore said at a news conference that manchins office was making 
inflated and unrealistic interest payments to local governments 
even when the losses were piling up so the treasury could attract 
commissions 
the consolidated funds losses totaled 279 million through nov 
30 said moore the audit by touche ross amp co ascertained that 
the treasurers office kept two sets of books said moore they 
kept one set of books to determine what they paid out in interest 
another set was kept as related to their transactions and they 
never reconciled the two methods 
for example the central investment pool in the consolidated 
investment fund paid out rates of 9 percent 83 percent and 78 
percent respectively in april may and june 1987 when the losses 
were severest and the fund had no earnings the audit showed 
you will find that the treasurers office was paying out 
tremendously large sums of money that they were not earning moore 
said 
manchin however was unhappy with the reference to two sets of 
books 
i would like to believe that it was one accounting system which 
took care of profits and the losses there was another accounting 
system which took care of the distributions the distributions never 
have shown where the losses were the treasurer said 
under the guidelines of the fund created in 1978 the treasurer 
could go to an outside agency to handle investments or he could 
charge a commission on what investments he could gather from local 
governnments 
the commissions were not monitored by the legislature they 
were a fund out of which the treasurers office could do essentially 
what he wanted to do said moore 
the fund generated from commissions was used to pay for 
daytoday expenses in the treasurers office 
moore said the investment office borrowed billions of dollars 
worth of funds from brokerage houses to help buy the huge amounts of 
securities transactions that were being handled by the investment 
office the 17 billion fund saw sales of 805 billion in 1987 
the audit showed that 272 billion was borrowed in 1986 and 
1987 including 108 billion in april 1987 the month in which the 
largest loss was recorded an addition 43 billion was borrowed in 
1988 
moore said much of the borrowing occurred without the knowledge 
of the board of investments

a disagreement surfaced friday within the state 
department about whether the african national congress is a 
terrorist organization or a legitimate freedomfighter 
the state departments internal argument arose following 
inclusion of the anc in a book terrorist group profiles issued 
this week by the defense department 
officially spokesmen for both departments said they agreed the 
anc should be in the book 
that was an information document said state department 
spokesman charles redman its not meant to be a policy 
publication he added 
but within the state department counterterrorism officials 
disagreed with professional diplomats concerned with maintaining 
ties to south africas black majority 
the section on the anc one of some 50 groups in the compilation 
says that the ancs indiscriminate attacks on civilians in recent 
years could endanger americans caught in the cross fire 
a pentagon spokesman said the group was included in the book 
because authorities wanted to warn americans of the danger from the 
anc and other organizations around the world the spokesman lt 
cmdr jim kudla said the book had been fully coordinated with 
the state department 
the office of counterterrorism at the state department concurred 
that the inclusion of the anc had been approved saying that while 
the group is a political guerrilla organization it also has used 
terrorist tactics 
redman also said that theres no question that certain anc 
acts would be considered terrorist acts 
but he also read a statement prepared by the departments africa 
affairs bureau which said the united states government has not 
determined that the anc is a terrorist organization 
the statement added that we regard the anc as a politically 
diverse organization with substantial political support in south 
africa 
some of the ancs political objectives such as ending 
apartheid and establishing a nonracial government in south africa 
are goals we share the statement said 
we strongly differ with the anc on some of the methods they 
have used to pursue these objectives including the use of 
violence the statement added 
a bureau official asked by a reporter if the statement was at 
odds with the position of the counterterrorism office said i 
cant go any further the official declined to be identified by 
name 
a counterterrorism office official who also declined to be 
identified by name indicated that there was a difference between 
the positions 
despite periodically condemning the ancs car bombings and other 
attacks secretary of state george shultz met in januray 1987 with 
anc leader oliver tambo and state department officials maintain 
contacts with the group 
the anc also has support among liberals in congress but 
conservatives condemn the group as a communist organization armed by 
the soviet union 
the pentagon book says the anc is armed with soviet weapons and 
gets most of its training in marxistoriented angola 
the south african government in 1960 banned the thenpeaceful 
anc and one year later the group began a sabotage campaign in 
recent years the ancs attacks have expanded to include random 
bombings in busy public places such as fastfood restaurants and bus 
depots 
there have been 180 bombings in south africa over the past 31 
months killing 35 people and injuring at least 665

presidentelect bush said today he would 
take a hard new look at us immigration policies but he blamed 
the influx of refugees from central america on what he called 
tyranny in leftistrun nicaragua 
bush at a brief news conference at the airport in nearby 
marathon en route to a weekend of fishing in the florida keys 
defended offshore oil drilling and said it can be done without 
harming the environment he also said he would strive throughout his 
presidency to rid the world of chemical and biological weapons 
referring to the furor over what the united states contends is a 
chemical weapons plant under construction in libya bush said i 
think there is much more understanding now about that rabta plant 
and i think thats a good thing 
but i think the way to approach it now is to build on what 
happened there in terms of worldwide understanding to start with a 
determination to stop proliferation of chemical weapons he said 
earlier bush told reporters traveling wioth him from washington 
that he never doubted west german chancellor helmut kohls 
commitment to eliminating chemical weapons the bonn government said 
thursday it now has indications that a german company may have links 
to the suspect plant 
bush who is being joined on the fishing trip by buddies 
including treasury secretary nicholas brady and sen alan simpson 
rwyo was asked first what he planned to do about the influx of 
refugees overburdening the miami area 
bush replied that the influx of refugees into florida and his 
home state of texas is causing an overburdening of facilities like 
schools and hospitals this is a sorry commentary on whats 
happening in central america and nicaragua and weve been seeing 
this for a long long time 
when i become president were going to take a hard new look at 
the immigration policies he said but there is no easy answer 
to it 
the final answer is democracy and freedom in nicaragua the 
vice president added when people are fleeing tyranny the united 
states has to be generous but no one community can suffer an 
overload without some support 
asked what he would do about the refugees already here bush 
replied crisply the law takes care of that 
queried as to whether he favors a ban on oil leasing in the 
florida keys bush a former texas oilman said what does that 
have to do with fishing 
he went on look ive pledged two things one is recognizing 
that this country cannot depend on foreign oil for our national 
security but needs prudent development of our offshore resources 
two i am pledged to see that that is done with total 
compatability to our marine life and to other environmental 
considerations 
the presidentelect said he knows it can be done compatibly 
because i have experience in this first hand in the gulf of mexico 
when a local reporter asked if he would have a winter white house 
at islamorada bush replied there will be no winter or summer 
white houses anyplace i have a home now in kennebunkport maine 
and thats the one house that i have and i hope to get to there 
sometime 
on air force two earlier bush said the fact that his new cabinet 
is heavily weighted with familiar washington figures was just what 
he wanted 
bush had promised to bring new faces to washington but he 
said i never pledged that i would have a totally inexperienced 
cabinet theres a lot of new faces in the cabinet it depends how 
you define new new from the old reagan administration cabinet 
not new from having no experience in washington 
i want an experienced cabinet thats exactly what weve got 
said bush who choose only three people without washington 
backgrounds to fill his 17 cabinet and cabinetlevel jobs 
the presidentelect who once hoped to appoint the whole cabinet 
before christmas finally finished the task thursday by naming 
former naval chief james d watkins as energy secretary and tapping 
former education secretary william j bennett to lead antidrug 
efforts 
seven current or former reagan cabinet officers and two retiring 
republican lawmakers will hold top jobs under bush 
he also enlisted edward derwinski an undersecretary of state and 
former congressman to head the new department of veterans affairs 
and kept william webster on as cia director 
labor secretarydesignate elizabeth dole and carla hills bushs 
choice as us trade representative will be the only women in the 
cabinet it will have two hispanics lauro cavazos at education and 
manuel lujan at interior and one black louis sullivan at health 
and human services 
bush assembled his cabinet at blair house for an informal meeting 
followed by a dinner with their spouses he told reporters 
beforehand 
im going to tell them to think big im going to tell them to 
challenge the system im going to tell them to adhere to the 
highest ethical standards 
he also said more in earnest than in jest im going to tell 
them i dont like kissandtell books he added that he wants them 
to be on the record as much as possible 
id rather see their name on the record than insidiously leaked 
to somebody bush said 
i dont mind differences being aired i want them to be frank 
i want them to fight hard for their position and then after i make 
the call id like to have the feeling that theyd be able to 
support the president bush said 
ill tell them to work with congress were going to have some 
fights with congress but were not going to approach it as though 
were dealing with the enemy the presidentelect said 
watkins 61 the chief of naval operations until 1986 under 
reagan is a nuclear warfare expert who headed the presidential 
commissin on aids that called last year for new legislation to 
protect the civil rights of victims of the deadly disease 
the retired admiral said he is determined to make sure that 
safety is never subverted and the environment is adequately 
protected while nuclear energy is developed 
bennett 45 a longtime twopackaday smoker said he would kick 
the habit before he is sworn in as director of national drug control 
policy 
bush who will be sworn in friday said he is not entirely 
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration which could reach 25 
million however he said it is being paid for largely with private 
funds and the country deserves every four years something as 
unifying with the pageantry and the drama of an inauguration 
the excursion to florida is bushs third fishing or hunting trip 
since his election two months ago he went fishing in gulf stream 
fla in november and went hunting and fishing in texas and alabama

retail sales grew in 1988 at their strongest 
pace in four years the government reported friday but the year 
went out with a whimper of weak holiday sales at department stores 
and car dealerships 
sales totaled 161 trillion for the year up 67 percent from 
1987 and the largest annual increase since a 98 percent gain in 
1984 the commerce department said 
but despite rosy expectations for strong yearend sales by 
retailers and car dealers december sales were up just 02 percent 
from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted 138 billion 
decembers gain was the slowest since a 03 drop in september 
that was followed by a revised 17 percent increase in october and a 
09 percent rise in november the figures are not adjusted to 
exclude the effects of rising prices 
economist david wyss of data resources inc in lexington mass 
said that while the overall sales figure for 1988 turned out to be 
a lot better than we feared it was going to be after the stock 
market crash in october 1987 decembers numbers were unexpectedly 
low 
it suggests that were entering 1989 with a lot less momentum 
than we thought we had wyss said i wouldnt call it a worry 
yet but it does suggest that the economy is going to be slowing 
down in 1989 
jay levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua ny said the 
report shows consumers have moved toward caution after a period 
of more buoyant spending 
the bond market rallied in early action friday as traders read 
the sales figures as a sign of a slowing economy that would place 
less upward pressure on interest rates 
however some economists were skeptical about the implications of 
the report saying decembers weak numbers later might be revised 
upward and that they might not reflect strong sales late in the 
month particularly of automobiles 
all i know is that auto companies were well satisfied with what 
they saw and the general merchandisers were well satisfied said 
robert dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington said that while 
retail sales werent as strong as expected for december spending 
still showed modest growth that should continue into the new year 
while overall retail sales for the year were posting their best 
showing since 1984 the department store category rose by just 45 
percent the smallest annual gain since a 34 percent rise in the 
recession year of 1982 
this sluggish performance was offset by a 95 percent rise in 
auto sales for the year up sharply from a 18 percent increase in 
1987 however auto sales actually fell in december dropping 03 
percent from the previous month and posting the first decline since 
a 14 percent drop in september 
excluding autos retail sales were up 03 percent in december 
following a 06 percent rise in november 
retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health 
because it represents about onethird of the gross national product 
the holiday season is particularly important because it can account 
for half of a general retailers annual profits 
sales by general merchandisers reached 1576 billion in 
december up 03 percent from a month earlier other categories 
posting gains during december included furniture stores service 
stations and bars and restaurants 
sales decreased at food clothing and drug stores

a leaky roof on the church built over the grotto 
where jesus is believed to have been born has revived an ancient 
dispute among three christian communities over control of the church 
when the greek orthodox church recently tried to repair the roof 
on the church of the nativity roman catholics and the armenians 
complained now the israeli government has taken responsibility for 
repairs an israeli spokesman said friday 
the workers who were on the roof had to be ordered off said 
shmuel hamburger religious affairs officer for the military 
government of the occupied west bank where the church in bethlehem 
is located 
hamburger said the argument dates to before 1852 when the 
thenturkish government of palestine stepped in to settle disputes 
among the three churches 
an agreement known as the status quo was established to 
assign such responsibilities as cleaning the church but roof 
repairs have always been disputed 
the procedure in which the roof is repaired from the time of 
the turks was done by the government hamburger said 
construction on the church of the nativity began in the 4th 
century the greek orthodox church gained title in 1672 but the 
roman catholics obtained partial ownership in 1852 the armenians 
control a southern section of the church 
the grotto where tradition says jesus was born is under the greek 
orthodox part of the church 
the three churches jealously guard their rights as outlined in 
the status quo and roof work done in 1983 also caused a dispute 
the rev claudio baratto director of the roman catholic 
christian information center said his church and the armenians 
consider the roof common property and believe any repairs should be 
approved by all three churches 
baratto said the roof has been leaking for years and referred to 
it as part an ancient question over which the churches continue 
to argue 
some parts pretend to have rights that the other parts 
contest he said 
we hope in the future to reach a sensible solution baratto 
added but for now he said the israeli government will have to 
take responsibility for the repairs 
hamburger said they should be made after the rainy winter weather 
subsides 
a spokesman for the greek orthodox church could not be reached 
for comment bishop timothy secretary to the greek orthodox 
patriarch told the jerusalem post that the church was not trying to 
repair the roof but only to clean out rain gutters 
he added however that the church has the right to make roof 
repairs if it wishes 
if we wanted to do something we would do it i dont think 
they had the right to complain the newspaper quoted him as saying

the rate of increase in wholesale prices nearly 
doubled in 1988 to 4 percent the worst pace since americans began 
recovering from doubledigit inflation at the beginning of the 
decade the government said friday 
although inflation is still a far cry from 1979 and 1980 when 
wholesale prices posted backtoback increases of 13 percent and 12 
percent many economists said they are worried about the trend 
the rise in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of the retail level was the worst 
since 1981 when it shot up 71 percent 
the index rose 22 percent in 1987 a year before that it 
recorded a rare decline of 23 percent 
i dont like the sound of a doubling of inflation but we have 
to put 4 percent in perspective said robert brusca an economist 
with nikko securities co international inc 
its not that bad but its not that good either if we were at 
4 percent and moving down i wouldnt worry about it but were 
heading up what concerns me is the potential for further 
acceleration he said 
meanwhile in a separate report the commerce department said 
retail sales in december rose a lackluster 02 percent following 
strong increases in october and november 
economists said that figure if it is not reestimated in 
subsequent months could be an indication that the momentum of 
economic growth slowed a bit as 1988 ended that would ease 
inflationary pressure and make it less necessary for the federal 
reserve board to boost interest rates in response the bond market 
rallied in early trading 
for the year retail spending rose 67 percent in 1988 to 161 
trillion the best performance in four years 
the reagan administration this week in its final economic report 
to congress listed the taming of inflation as one of its greatest 
accomplishments 
the administration is predicting a steady drop in the rate 
through 1994 richard w rahn chief economist of the us chamber 
of commerce and an adviser to presidentelect bush said the 
annualized wholesale inflation rate when looked at by quarter 
eased last year from 49 percent in the second quarter to 46 
percent in the third to 33 percent in the fourth 
inflation watchers should not be concerned he said 
but most other private analysts expect tight labor markets and a 
squeeze on factory capacity to produce at least a modest price 
speedup with inflation rates above 5 percent by the end of 1989 
the unemployment rate in december matched a 14year low while 
factories were straining in november at the highest operating levels 
in nine years 
inflation in 1988 worsened and then paused i think this 
buildup in pressure will cause it to worsen again said robert 
dederick a former reagan administration economist now with northern 
trust co in chicago 
much of the impetus for wholesale price increase last year was 
provided by a droughtinduced 57 percent increase in food prices 
the steepest since 1980 they had showed no change in 1987 
meanwhile energy prices which had soared 112 percent in 1987 
fell 34 percent in 1988 however with the production agreement 
reached by the opec nations in november analysts expect higher oil 
prices this year 
all other finished goods in 1988 rose 43 percent 
in december food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 01 
percent and energy costs edged up only 02 percent everything else 
jumped 06 percent the biggest increase since september 
this is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery 
shoppers prices were unchanged in november after a 01 percent 
decline in october however that period of stability was preceded 
by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through 
the summer 
the department reported december declines in these catagories 
turkey 171 percent fresh and dried vegetable prices 85 percent 
fresh fruit 27 percent fish 13 percent and pork 03 percent 
there were gains of 3 percent for beef 25 percent for chicken 
and 1 percent for dairy products 
fuel oil in december soared 85 percent and natural gas rose 33 
percent gasoline prices however fell 35 percent holding back 
overall energy gains 
for other items a sharp 57 percent increase in tobacco prices 
and significant gains of 09 percent in automobile costs and 07 
percent in womens clothing led the index 
the overall december increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1100 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 110 last month 30 cents 
more than in november 
decembers consumer price index which measures prices at the 
retail level and unlike the wholesale index includes services and 
imports is scheduled for release on jan 19

a joint hong kongchina panel approved a measure 
friday to bar the enclave from electing its own chief executive for 
at least 15 years after chinese rule begins in 1997 a committee 
member said 
however the committees political blueprint would also provide 
for increasing proportions of elected seats in the local legislature 
martin lee a prodemocracy lawyer from hong kong who sits on the 
committee said the plan which must be approved by china 
represents a big step backward as far as democracy was concerned 
the proposal is included in a proposed constitution by which 
communist china will govern capitalist hong kong after the british 
withdraw from the colony on chinas coast 
the document is designed to enshrine the one countrytwo 
system plan promised by beijing to allow this territory of 57 
million people to exercise a high degree of autonomy and remain 
capitalist for at least 50 years after the change in sovereignty 
the 58member committee with hong kong and chinese 
representatives met in the nearby southern chinese city of canton on 
friday and approved most of the second draft to be submitted to the 
chinese national peoples congress a third and final draft is 
expected to be approved by china next year 
in an interview from canton lee said the group backed a plan 
under which the first three postcolonial chief executives serving 
fiveyear terms would be chosen by an electoral college 
a governor appointed by london heads the colonial government the 
chief executive will be postcolonial hong kongs top local official 
under the committees proposal a referendum could be held to 
determine whether the fourth chief executive will be popularly 
elected however the vote will take place only if half the members 
of the local legislature the sitting chief executive and a 
committee of the chinese congress approve according to lee 
effectively we may never have a directly elected chief 
executive said lee 
the committee also proposed that the first four post1997 local 
legislatures each lasting four years be composed of directly 
elected members and interest group representatives lee said 
popularly elected members will constitute 27 percent of the first 
legislature 38 percent of the second and 50 percent of the third 
and fourth 
if a referendum is held the public could decide whether all 
members are popularly elected lee said

fees for grazing livestock on public land 
administered by the forest service will be boosted by up to 25 
percent effective march 1 the agriculture department said today 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said monthly fees 
for grazing stock on nationa forests in 15 western states will be 
raised to 186 per head up 32 cents from last year fees for 
national grasslands in nine states will be raised 46 cents to 229 
per head 
the interior depatrtment said it planned similar increases in 
grazing fees on lands controlled by the bureau of land management 
grazing fee rates are going up because the prices farmers and 
ranchers received for beef cattle increased by 9 percent and 
private grazing land lease rates increased in most of the staes 
involved robertson said 
on the other hand cost increases for livestock production were 
modest in comparison he said these are factors included in a 
formula to determine annual grazing fees 
for grazing fee purposes the term head month is used which 
was described by the agency as a months occupancy and use of 
range by one weaned or adult cow bull steer heifer horse burro 
or mule or five sheep or goats 
the new fees apply to national forests in arizona california 
colorado idaho montana nebraska nevada new mexico north 
dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota utah washington and wyoming 
higher fees will apply to national grasslands in colorado 
kansas nebraska new mexico north dakota oklahoma south dakota

authorities arrested seven human rights 
activists and they face prosecution on charges of telling lies 
about the state the government said friday 
the activists reported arrested in plovdiv are connected with 
the independent society for the protection of human rights in 
bulgaria according to a western diplomat and newspapers in sofia 
bta the official news agency carried an interior ministry 
statement on the arrests of the seven it identified four of them as 
ilia stoyanov minev grigor simov bozhilov dimiter tomov yordanov 
and blagoy vassilev topouzliev 
an exile source speaking on condition of anonymity said minev 
was president of the human rights group and had spent 27 years in 
jail 
the otechestven front newspaper linked menev to eduard genov a 
leading bulgarian dissident who spent 10 years in internal exile he 
and another activist ivan yankov were expelled and arrived in 
vienna on oct 20 
in an interview then genov told the associated press that 
bulgarian officials appeared poised to stifle dissent out of fear it 
might snowball into a growing opposition 
the bta announcement said most of those arrested had been 
previously convicted of various crimes and investigators would 
undertake the necessary actions for clarifying the facts and 
circumstances for charging these people with criminal offenses 
it added in complicity and internationally they have 
disseminated untruthful allegations with the aim to create mistrust 
of authorities and their work 
the allegation apparently referred to interviews given by some of 
those arrested to western reporters or radio stations

former olympic diver bruce kimball may be 
allowed to change his guilty plea in a drunkendriving manslaughter 
case to safeguard insurance money for victims and their families 
his attorney said 
the guilty plea kimball entered wednesday could amount to a 
breach of contract and allow his insurance company to cancel a 13 
million liability insurance policy said frank quesada a lawyer for 
the 1984 silver medalist 
so kimball may seek to change his plea to no contest before 
sentencing jan 30 quesada said 
the company could cut kimball loose he said it has 
nothing to do with the way bruce feels a change in pleas 
would be all for the victims 
hillsborough circuit judge harry lee coe iii said he would accept 
a nocontest plea if its proven his policy would be canceled 
kimball pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of 
testimony about the aug 1 crash which killed two teenagers and 
injured four others he said he wanted to spare the families the 
grief of hearing descriptions about how his car plowed into the 
youths on a deadend road in suburban brandon 
kimball 25 is being held in hillsborough county jail awaiting 
sentencing on two counts of drunkendriving manslaughter and three 
counts of causing great bodily injury while driving under the 
influence of alcohol he faces between seven and 22 years in prison 
under state sentencing guidelines 
there are four civil lawsuits pending against kimball stemming 
from the accident a month before the 1988 olympic diving trials in 
which he participated but failed to make the team 
if the victims lawsuits are successful money from kimballs 
liability insurance policy could pay for damages 
gary sawyer kimballs attorney in the civil cases said he 
didnt know if the insurance company aaa of michigan would cancel 
kimballs policy

attorneys claimed he was a suicide risk has been adapting to life

an electronics company and six men the 
first group indicted in the pentagon purchasing investigation 
pleaded innocent friday to charges they paid or took money for 
inside information about a multimilliondollar defense contract 
us district court judge richard williams set a trial date of 
march 27 for teledyne electronics of newbury park calif a 
division of teledyne industries for three teledyne employees 
george h kaub eugene r sullivan and dale schnittjer for two 
private consultants william parkin and fred lackner and for a navy 
purchashing official stuart berlin 
the defendants were released on 10000 personal recognizance 
bonds 
the charges which range from conspiracy to bribery are 
contained in a 27count indictment returned by a federal grand jury 
last week 
they are the first resulting from the federal governments 
twoyearold investigation into allegations that private consultants 
paid bribes to defense employees for information about contracts let 
by the pentagons 150billionayear purchasing office 
at the arraignment each defendant pleaded notguilty to all 
counts against him all face charges of conspiracy and bribery and 
some face other charges 
teledynes attorney thomas patten asked williams to postpone 
the trial because we have a daunting task in front of us 
later patten said he felt his client should be afforded more 
time to develop its defense because the government spent over two 
years to work on its end 
another attorney george oconnell who represents sullivan a 
teledyne electronics executive told williams that he has met with 
lengthy delays and stonewalling in trying to interview key 
pentagon employees about the case 
but joseph aronica an assistant us attorney said prosecutors 
have no intention of impeding access to witnesses williams 
suggested the two sides try to work out their differences before 
resorting to legal maneuvers 
gerard treanor an attorney for parkin said we anticipate 
after the trial he will be acquitted 
berlin the navy man was asked whether he thought he would be 
exonerated sure do he responded 
the indictment alleges that teledyne electronics and its 
employees paid parkin of alexandria va to obtain details about a 
navy radar contract worth more than 100 million parkin then paid 
lackner a consultant based in woodland hills calif who in turn 
gave bribes to berlin the indictment says 
prosecutors said berlins information played a role in landing 
the contract for teledyne electronics 
berlin parkin and lackner face maximum penalties of 185 years in 
prison and fines of 55 million each if convicted on all counts 
teledyne electronics faces a fine of 65 million if convicted the 
other men face lesser sentences if found guilty 
prosecutors have said they plan to develop the case with the help 
of testimony from michael savaides a former employee of teledyne 
electronics who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery 
he is cooperating with prosecutors 
after the indictment was made public the defense department 
suspended berlin without pay and barred teledyne electronics from 
doing business with any agency of the government 
the pentagon also suspended the hazeltine corp and two of its 
former exeutives who have entered guilty pleas in the massive 
pentagon investigation

a man who spent six months in jail 
facing rape charges was released friday cleared by a dna print test 
that showed he could not have been the attacker 
were so happy said sammie scheffs mother mary miller 
its been so bad i knew he didnt do it now we can get on 
with our lives 
state supreme court justice james cowhey signed an order 
dismissing the charges against scheff 26 of greenburgh after the 
dna tests cleared him 
in an unusual move the district attorneys office made the 
dismissal motion backing a motion scheffs attorney had planned to 
make 
its about time said scheff who left court and headed back 
to his job as a carpenters assistant 
the dismissal came a day after a hearing during which experts 
declared that the dna tests proved 100 percent that scheff could 
not have raped the 21yearold woman outside a convenience store in 
greenburgh on feb 8 1988 
scheff was arrested feb 25 and imprisoned until aug 26 when 
his bail was reduced from 50000 to 500 based largely on the test 
results 
prosecutor george bolen said his office would accept the dna test 
results as scientific evidence but his office asked for the hearing 
to determine if the tests were done properly 
the victim had identified scheff in a photo array and in a 
lineup bolen said 
dna print testing is a new highly technical procedure based on 
the fact that each persons dna or genetic material is unique 
except in the case of identical twins 
the dna print identification test offers comparisons of genetic 
codes by extracting the dna from a crime scene specimen such as 
semen blood or tissue and chemically dividing the dna into 
fragments 
the fragments form a pattern which serves as an identity profile 
the pattern can be compared with the identity pattern from the 
suspects blood specimen

the judge in the irancontra case today 
dismissed the two criminal charges that accused fired national 
security council aide oliver north of illegally diverting more than 
14 million in us iran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
us district judge gerhard gesell said he had no choice but to 
grant the motion by independent counsel lawrence walsh to dismiss 
the conspiracy and theft counts against north the reagan 
administration had refused to allow use of some classified documents 
bearing on the charges in the trial 
it is apparent that the attorney general and the independent 
counsel are unable to proceed are unwilling to proceed in 
connection with the conspiracy and theft charges said gesell 
the court is powerless to direct the case to proceed on the 
two main counts 
the judge dropped the charges under a section of the classified 
information procedures act in which the attorney general may certify 
that a trial may result in the disclosure of classified information 
attorney general dick thornburgh made that certification in a 
declaration filed thursday with gesell at the judges request 
walsh last week gave up his pursuit of the conspiracy and theft 
of government property charges against north after the 
administration refused to declassify portions of documents that 
gesell said were needed in order for north to get a fair trial 
meanwhile today the justice department filed a motion to quash 
subpoenas that north had served to compel the testimony of president 
reagan and presidentelect bush when he stands trial beginning jan 
31 
the department said the two subpoenas raise profound 
constitutional concerns not only regarding executive privilege with 
respect to particular information but also regarding the authority 
of the courts to compel appearances by a former or sitting 
president 
norths unprecedented attempt to compel a chief executives 
testimony threatens the place of the president in the 
constitutional structure as head of a coequal branch of the 
government the department said in a brief signed by assistant 
attorney general john r bolton 
the court papers disclosed that reagan offered last sept 28 to 
respond in writing to reasonable written questions about the 
case bush has also offered to provide such written responses to 
relevant questions 
the offer was apparently rejected by norths lawyers and the 
justice department argued that the defense must show that they need 
the testimony of bush and reagan for their case 
at a hearing today gesell touched on one of the areas of 
classified material that was among the most sensitive with the 
administration he pointed to the portion of his order dec 12 that 
said that in many cases the government must provide the full text of 
intelligence reports in open court in any trial of north 
the court has no factual basis to question the classification 
of documents that the administration says it cannot allow to be 
disclosed at norths trial gesell said 
meanwhile walsh embarked on an effort to protect the remaining 
12 criminal charges against north from the problems of classified 
information that plagued the conspiracy and theft counts 
walsh said in a court filing thursday that norths possible 
offenses to the other 12 counts are narrowly circumscribed and 
that the classified information problems affecting the 
conspiracy and theft charges should no longer be at issue 
walshs view clashes with the one expressed a week ago by defense 
attorney brendan sullivan who said classified information 
pervades the remaining charges as well 
at the conclusion of todays court hearing gesell announced that 
lawyers from both sides were to meet immediately in his chambers to 
discuss matters pertaining to classified information 
four of the remaining charges relate norths alleged obstruction 
of inquiries in september and october 1985 by misrepresenting his 
activities to congress 
walsh said the government also will prove north denied in the 
1986 presidential inquiry by attorney general edwin meese iii that 
the nsc was involved in the diversion of an arms sale money and that 
north told meese the israelis controlled the diversion 
walsh said in the court filing thursday that the governments 
case no longer depends on proving that the proceeds of the iranian 
arms sales constituted government property or that by diverting 
those proceeds to the contras north embezzled them 
he said classified information problems affecting counts one 
and two the conspiracy and theft charges should no longer be an 
issue 
still walsh said north may attempt to bring classified 
information into the case by saying that he covered up his 
activities because superiors directed him to or because everything 
he did was authorized and perfectly legal under neither 
approach should north be permitted to import classified 
information said walsh 
however gesell said monday that while motive does not determine 
guilt or innocence under the law north has a right to show the 
activities he sought to cover up were not illegal north might then 
seek to bring in some of the same classified information that led 
walsh to abandon the conspiracy and theft charges 
walsh said the government would prove north solicited funds for 
the contras from private donors helped contra leader adolfo calero 
obtain weapons played a role in the contras opening a southern 
front and provided military advice and intelligence 
since that alleged assistance predates us arms sales to iran 
proof of the legality or illegality of diverting money to the 
contras from those arms sales is irrelevant said walsh 
walsh said what is not at issue in connection with the counts 
concerning the attorney generals inquiry is whether north was 
authorized to divert funds or believed he was authorized 
the independent counsel also said north should not be permitted 
to introduce evidence that earlier in 1986 the attorney general or 
the president allegedly had some fragmentary knowledge of norths 
conduct 
walshs filing also disclosed new information on the allegation 
north made personal use of travelers checks supplied by calero 
walsh said that on four occasions involving six checks north spent 
them on official travel for which he sought and received 
government reimbursement 
according to testimony at congressional hearings in 1987 north 
had spent some of the travelers checks at local merchants those 
checks are mentioned in the indictment 
according to walsh north on three occasions involving half a 
dozen travelers checks spent the money on private travel for himself 
or his family

sen jesse helms rnc said friday the 
soviet union is preventing us inspectors from xraying containers 
leaving a soviet missile assembly plant and is therefore violating 
the treaty banning mediumrange nucleararmed missiles 
but the state department said it expects full soviet cooperation 
when the xray equipment is ready to be installed and is satisfied 
that existing procedures will enable the detection of any banned 
mediumrange ss20 missile attempting to leave the factory 
the united states is satisfied with the implementation of the 
treaty to date said department spokesman charles redmond 
helms in a letter to president reagan called inspection rights 
at votkinsk the heart and keystone of the treatys verification 
system and said that under the treatys terms the us inspection 
team should have been able to xray all items leaving the factory by 
last dec 1 six months after the treaty went into effect 
the package of procedures that the soviets obligated themselves 
to allow have not been agreed in part because the soviets have made 
unacceptable demands for other procedures and provisions helms 
said 
because of this failure to agree to the us xray rights the 
us xray equipment is still not installed at votkinsk he said 
helms asked reagan what he intends to do to prevent the soviets 
from continuing to exploit their potential to cheat at votkinsk 
and added 
due to soviet intransigence the us has been totally unable 
to monitor effectively or verify whether the soviets have continued 
to manufacture or deploy perhaps dozens of banned ss20 missiles 
from the votkinsk factory for the last eight months that the treaty 
has been in force 
but at the state department redmond said that any problem was a 
minor one 
the soviet union agrees fully with the right of the united 
states to install that kind of equipment redmond said adding 
that the soviets will have the same xraying privileges at the us 
facility at magna utah 
we are now in the final stage of working out of the details of 
implementing this right redmon said the united states is in 
the final stage of testing the appropriate equipment for this 
particular verification method 
when we are fully ready to install our equipment we expect the 
soviet union will cooperate with us fully he said 
a 30person us team continuously monitors the votkinsk facility 
and has inspected every vehicle leaving it large enough to contain 
an ss20 redmon said 
additionally he said the inspection team is opening randomly 
selected ss25 canisters 
this particular monitoring activity is but one element of a 
comprehensive set of verification procedures redmond said

people who tested positive for drugs in 
preemployment screening but were hired anyway had sharply higher 
absentee rates and were much more likely to be fired than other 
workers the postal service reported friday 
once on the job people who had positive drug tests had a 43 
percent higher absentee rate and were 40 percent more likely to be 
fired than workers who tested clean of drugs the agency said 
were doing actual work force performance factors attendance 
and involuntary turnover are the first ones in which we see a 
strong relationship at this point in the study said assistant 
postmaster general joel s trosch in a telephone interview 
frankly i anticipate some of the relationships we see getting 
stronger and i will not be surprised if we see other relationships 
such as accident rates he said 
even these first interim results provide significant support 
for a business decision to say no to applicants who test positive 
for drugs added trosch who handles employee relations 
the drug tests were not used in deciding whether to hire the 
employees involved although the postal service is planning to 
institute preemployment drug screening for all new workers over the 
next 30 days trosch said 
the national labor relations board meanwhile is considering 
whether such testing should be subject to bargaining between the 
postal service and its unions 
the test results reported friday came from a program involving 
4375 workers hired at 21 sites around the country over nine months 
the report covered the first six months of work for those people it 
is planned to continue for a full two years 
in the test designed by the postal service with national 
institute on drug abuse consultation job applicants were screened 
for drugs before being hired 
however local managers were not informed of the results of the 
tests they made hiring decisions based on written exams and 
interviews as with any postal worker officials said 
in the study 5465 applicants were screened for drugs of them 
4375 were eventually hired by the postal service and 4220 were 
evaluated in this study because they had completed their sixmonth 
probationary period 
a subsequent analysis found that 515 applicants had tested 
positive of which 354 had been hired by the agency 
marijuana was the most common drug found being detected in 232 
cases of those hired 88 had tested positive for cocaine and 34 for 
other drugs according to the report 
of all those hired 361 have since been fired by the postal 
service for one reason or another the report said 
that group included 42 people who had tested positive for drugs 
and 319 who had tested negative 
the study found those using drugs made up 84 percent of the 
evaluated group of people hired the firing rate for drug users was 
40 percent higher than for nonusers 
in addition the agency totaled up the sick leave leave without 
pay and time spent absent without leave for both groups 
while it did not report detailed numbers in this category the 
agency said that those who had tested positive for drugs were absent 
from work at a rate 43 percent greater than those who tested 
negative 
our study is the first in which we are comparing 
performance of individuals who test positive and who test negative 
in an actual work setting trosch said 
in reporting the preliminary figures the postal service added 
that turnover and absenteeism are only two of many areas that are 
potentially affected by whether workers use drugs 
other productivity savings may result from reductions in 
accidents injuries benefit claims etc the report said 
statistics on those topics are expected to be included as the 
test continues 
the 21 postal centers involved in the test are trenton nj 
hartford conn new haven conn atlanta tampa fla orlando 
fla dallas fort worth detroit two hiring centers in chicago 
denver st louis milwaukee san diego calif oakland calif 
santa ana calif long beach calif los angeles and two hiring 
centers in seattle

union leaders on friday predicted easy approval 
of the first labor contract for air traffic controllers since 
president reagan fired 11400 of them during a strike eight years 
ago 
the new threeyear contract with the federal aviation 
admnistration will help ensure air safety said r steve bell 
president of the yearold national air traffic controllers 
association 
it gives controllers guaranteed breaks limited immunity in 
reporting system errors and participation in accident investigations 
and some faa decisionmaking 
the tentative agreement signed late thursday in baltimore does 
not cover salaries which are set by congress and range between 
19000 and 55000 annually 
but bell said new faaunion professional councils would be 
set up he added that such labormanagement cooperation could lead 
to increased compensation better working hours and more health 
benefits 
both sides described the talks as evidence of vastly improved 
relations between the faa and its 13000 controllers since the 1981 
illegal strike that led to the bankruptcy and decertification of 
their old union more than half the controllers who monitor and 
control air traffic at 400 sites around the country have joined the 
new bargaining unit 
its a clear victory for both the faa and the union said 
bell predicting that the agreement would be approved in a vote by 
union members within the next few weeks 
it represents a new spirit of cooperation between labor and 
management at faa in sharp contrast to past problems said faa 
spokesman john g leyden he said talks with the new union went 
smoothly while the old union used to begin by asking for such 
things as olympicsized swimming pools at each faa site and other 
costly benefits the government agency had no authority to provide 
the new contract goes a long way toward helping airline 
safety bell said in a telephone interview what it contains is 
a safety system contract between the faa and controllers and with 
the american flying public 
the contract would for the first time guarantee controllers a 
break away from any controller duties after two hours monitoring air 
traffic bell said controllers often are worked for two hours 
straight and then switched to another duty without a break 
the return of limited controller immunity eliminated before the 
1981 strike would allow workers to report errors and system 
deficiencies without fear of retribution as long as they did not 
involve negligence 
the system if errors were made and reported tended to be 
punitive in nature rather than preventative said bell he said 
management gave up none of its rights to discipline employees 
the contract would also include controllers on boards that review 
system errors and in groups that oversee technical development of 
the system and evaluate facilities 
the faa was heretofore a little bit testy with allowing 
controllers to get into the procedure aspect of the job bell said 
the faa also agreed to quickly release controllers from duties 
for participation in accident investigation by the national 
transportation safety board controllers have not been included on 
official investigative teams since the old contract bell said

presidentelect bushs choice of an energy 
secretary with nuclear expertise but no experience in other energy 
fields drew little praise and some concern friday from industry and 
environmental groups 
in announcing his selection of adm james d watkins to head the 
energy department bush said thursday that watkins would oversee the 
daunting task of repairing the departments crippled nuclear weapons 
complex safety and other problems recently forced the closing of 
the countrys only facilities producing tritium a vital ingredient 
for nuclear warheads 
watkins was trained in nuclear reactor engineering early in his 
41year navy career worked in the naval nuclear office of the 
nowdefunct atomic energy commission and later commanded a 
nuclearpower submarine 
but he has no professional experience in the conventional energy 
areas such as oil and natural gas that are more commonly 
associated with the energy department 
youre touching me on my achilles heel watkins said in 
response to a news conference question thursday about his views on 
how to shore up domestic oil prices 
this admitted weakness and bushs clear interest in focusing on 
problems in the nuclear weapons complex has caused some concern 
about how the new administration will address other energy issues 
such as the growing us dependence on foreign oil 
our initial reaction is definitely one of disappointment 
said tom haywood executive vice president of the north texas oil amp 
gas association a producers trade group we had hoped for someone 
who could come in knowing the domestic oil business he said 
adding that he expected watkins to be a quick study 
bryan jacobowski an energy analyst at the wall street firm of 
paine webber inc said oil industry executives had figured bush 
would pick somebody who was a bit more of an advocate for their 
interests on capitol hill 
in part the selection of a military official to head energy 
policy reflects a declining emphasis within the energy department on 
civilian energy issues in the current fiscal year the department is 
spending 58 percent of its 15 billion budget on defense programs 
in 1982 the defense share was 28 percent 
george h lawrence president of the american gas association 
representing natural gas producers hailed watkins proven 
managerial skills and said his nuclear background will help in 
solving the nuclear defense problems 
but he said it is especially important that this national 
security issue be handled skillfully so it does not become an 
abiding distraction to other energy issues 
the natural gas industrys main concern about leadership in the 
energy department is that it help win congressional approval to end 
the remaining price controls on gas 
bush has pushed aside suggestions that oil executives need worry 
about his choice 
theyve got a president of the united states that came out of 
the oil and gas industry that knows it and knows it well he said 
thursday 
some analysts said the watkins choice appeared to reflect a 
relaxed attitude by bush about the possibility of a new oil crisis 
developing in the 1990s 
it suggests the bush administration doesnt see a major 
problem in fossil fuels in the near future said john lichtblau 
executive director of the petroleum industry research foundation 
which is supported by oil industry funds he added that he disagrees 
with this view and is concerned that if the opec cartel falls into 
disarray again oil prices could fall low enough to harm us 
security 
environmental groups also expressed mild concern about watkins 
stephen schwartz of the greenpeace environmental organization 
said he hoped the choice of watkins does not reflect a decision to 
place military production needs ahead of safety and the 
environment 
dan w reicher an attorney for the environmental group natural 
resources defense council said his group was worried that nuclear 
defense needs would get too much attention in an energy department 
headed by a career military man 
we are concerned that the appointment of adm watkins signals 
that cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound national 
energy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclear 
weapons production reicher said

architect frank lloyd wrights former home 
at taliesin needs a fiveyear 16 million restoration and should be 
opened as a tourist attraction according to members of a state 
commission studying the site 
commission members say they plan to recommend creation of a 
nonprofit corporation to undertake the restoration and oversee 
operation of the landmark some state money would be involved but 
most would be raised from corporations foundations and private 
donors commission members said 
taliesin built in 1911 on 600 acres amid the rolling hills of 
southwestern wisconsin and declared a national landmark in 1976 now 
is a school for architects 
commission members said they were optimistic the plan would win 
the blessings of the taliesin fellowship gov tommy thompson and 
other state officials and that restoration would start soon 
the commission expects 200000 to 250000 people to visit 
taliesin annually the site also would be available for national and 
international conferences 
there are some unknowns since theres quite a lot of logistics 
involved in handling that many people said nicholas muller head 
of the state historical society and a member of the study 
commission but the commission is not looking at the state as a 
great pot of money 
there is some disagreement among commission members about how to 
perform the restoration said marshall erdman a builder architect 
and former wright student who heads the state commission 
we want to do it right he said if we do it incorrectly 
theres no use doing it on the other hand we have to deal with 
practicalities and fortunately unlike most restoration work we 
still have people who were there on the site so we can save a lot 
of effort and research 
air conditioning a new heating systems and better glass bonding 
would make taliesin comfortable year round erdman said 
a lot of the things were doing is the way it should have been 
done had mr wright had the resources and technology we have 
today erdman said

the government agency that administers medicare 
proposed a new rule friday to deny payment under the program to 
hospitals and physicians that deliver substandard hospital inpatient 
care 
the new rule would enhance the governments ability to ensure 
that medicare beneficiaries receive highquality care said 
william l roper administrator of the health care financing 
administration 
in proposing the rule the agency complies with instructions from 
congress 
the agency said the rule was not expected to have a substantial 
impact on a significant number of small entities or small rural 
hospitals 
under the rule peer review organizations composed of physicians 
in each state and under contract to the health and human services 
department to review healthcare services funded under medicare 
would be authorized to deny medicare payments when substandard care 
harms a patient or places the patient at high risk 
the rule prohibits physicians and hospitals from charging 
patients for services for which payment was denied because of 
poorquality care 
when the review groups find that care is substandard but does not 
result in harm to the patient or present imminent danger medicare 
will pay for the claim but the review group will conduct a followup 
review and work with the provider to correct the problem 
currently when review groups find poor care being delivered 
they are limited to remedial action which includes discussing the 
case with the hospital or physician intensifying future reviews and 
recommending sanctions

a car bomb exploded in south beirut on 
friday minutes after thousands of proiranian shiite moslems marched 
by in a demonstration against their syrianbacked rivals seven 
people were killed and 15 wounded police said 
the blast occurred on the sixth day of fierce fighting between 
the mainstream amal militia and the fundamentalist hezbollah for 
control of south lebanons apple province and the countrys 1 
million shiites 
the mercedesbenz blew up on roweiss street a residential area 
in the bir elabed district it touched off several fires and 
blasted a crater in the street six feet deep and more than seven 
feet across 
the force of the explosion catapulted a flaming car onto a power 
pole 
a tongue of flame pierced the sky when the deafening blast 
occurred i was hurled a few yards off and then landed on my belly 
with glass raining on me said issam jaber interviewed in front 
of his tool shop 
at least 10 cars were destroyed more than 16 buildings suffered 
considerable damage in a onemile radius around the blast at least 
nine shops were destroyed 
broken power cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards 
and uprooted pine trees 
police said the dead were civilians who lingered after thousands 
of hezbollah protesters passed by minutes before some demonstrators 
carried placards and chanted slogans such as death to america the 
great satan and death to nabih berri 
berri heads amal which is backed by syria 
if it happened during the demonstration it would have been a 
much greater disaster with plenty of more casualties said a 
police spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
hezbollah gunmen shot in the air to clear a path for ambulances 
at one point they stopped a team of civil defense workers beat five 
of them blindfolded them and then dumped them into the trunk of a 
car and sped away 
they are suspects said one hezbollah gunman who refused to 
give his name 
syrian troops in charge of security in beiruts moslem sector 
watched but did not intervene 
a hezbollah statement said none of the party leaders or partisans 
who took part in the demonstration was injured 
no one claimed responsibility for the blast 
hezbollah militiamen claimed berri was behind it but an amal 
statement disclaimed involvement calling the blast an intolerable 
act of terrorism aimed at fanning the flames of dissension within 
the shiite community 
hezbollahs parade was called to protest what the party termed 
the murderous military adventure by berri to evict hezbollah 
from south lebanons apple province 
militiamen of the two factions battled friday with mortars and 
machine guns in and around the apple province village of jbaa but 
none made territorial gains 
police said two civilians were killed and another three wounded 
jbaa is the key to a 9squaremile enclave controlled by about 
500 hezbollah fighters it extends south to the hamlets of ein 
bouswar and louwaizeh and east to wooded mount safi 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani called for an end 
to the fighting rafsanjani speaking in tehran said hezbollah and 
amal are both committing murder and the islamic republic is 
disgusted

tritium a gas that strengthens nuclear bombs is 
a byproduct of canadas nuclear power plants but the united states 
shouldnt look to the north for a way to ease a shortage caused by 
problems in us weapons plants 
it would not be amenable said atomic energy control board 
spokesman hugh spence in peacetime certainly it would not be 
amenable certainly we would not countenance sales directly to the 
weapons system 
antinuclear activists allege that any exports to the united 
states would be virtually impossible to track in their civilian or 
military uses 
even if our tritium isnt used directly in military weapons 
systems which we suspect it will be it will free up their scarce 
supplies irene koch of the nuclear awareness project said in a 
telephone interview 
the savannah river plant in aiken sc the only us source of 
the radioactive isotope of hydrogen is closed because of safety 
problems the us department of energy has recommended building two 
new production reactors at a cost of 86 billion meanwhile the 
defense department needs to replenish the tritium which decays at a 
rate of 55 percent a year in its warheads 
the us nuclear industry is based on lightwater reactors which 
use water as a coolant and other materials as moderators slowing 
the neutrons enough so they cause fission canadas 18 reactors use 
heavy water in which hydrogen is replaced by the isotope deuterium 
as coolant and moderator 
one byproduct of the reaction is tritium which also has some 
commercial and industrial applications including in emergency 
lighting devices 
right now the plan is to remove the tritium and then store it 
on site young said in a telephone interview we still havent 
made that decision to sell any of it let alone export any of it to 
the us 
the question of exports came up in the debate over the plant 47 
miles east of toronto mainly from the critics who oppose this 
he said 
its very much an issue for us it has been for a couple of 
years said koch whose group is pressuring the ontario provincial 
government to refuse permission for any tritium exports 
the federal government also would have to license exports of 
radioactive materials and spence said canada has one of the worlds 
most stringest systems of safeguards against nuclear exports for any 
military purposes 
it requires countries with recognized nuclear capacities the 
united states britain and france to agree that no canadian 
materials will be used for weapons in general other countries must 
have fullscope safeguards to obtain canadian materials and 
must allow international inspection of all nuclear facilities india 
was cut off in 1974 
it also is recognized that exports for peaceful uses free a 
supply for weapons systems although that has not come up in any 
debate spence said i know the americans know our safeguard 
concerns and in many ways share them 
washington has not approached the canadian government for 
tritium he said it really hasnt come up

most older americans support a new national 
health insurance program that pays the catastrophic costs of major 
illness according to a poll released friday by the american 
association of retired persons 
the new health insurance law which took effect jan 1 will 
cover extended hospitalizations and help pay high prescriptiondrug 
bills it will be financed by premiums paid by all medicare 
enrollees a sore point among some retirees 
the poll of 1750 people age 45 and older found 71 percent 
supported the program while 15 percent opposed it among the 657 who 
were age 65 and older 65 percent supported the program and 21 
percent opposed it 
aarp said the finding that concerns them most is that more than 
half of those questioned said they were not familiar with the 
program 
there a great need to get the facts out said john rother 
aarps director of legislation research and public policy even 
those familiar with it are in fact misinformed about aspects of 
the program he added 
the 28millionmember aarp supports the catastrophic illness 
program and has started a campaign to educate senior citizens about 
its benefits 
some retirees are upset they will have to pay for coverage 
whether they want it or not and say they could do better buying 
private insurance 
the major financing provision of the program has been the target 
of most complaints it requires everyone eligible for medicare who 
pays more than 150 in federal income taxes to pay an extra premium 
based on the amount of tax they own 
the maximum surtax on any person is 800 this year or 1600 for 
a couple if both spouses are eligible such a couple would have 
income of at least 70000 
overall 58 percent of those polled said they viewed the 
supplemental premium based on tax liability as positive 
however a majority of those surveyed said they did not like 
having only those over 65 pay for it overall 52 percent viewed 
this as a negative aspect of the program compared with 42 percent 
who said was it was positive 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he was gratified by the poll 
results and anticipates no change in the tax 
it offers security and peace of mind to older americans and the 
vast majority of them understand and appreciate that he said in a 
statement 
the poll was conducted by telephone dec 218 results have a 
margin of error of plus or minus 25 percentage points for the 
entire group of 1750 and 4 points for the subgroup of those age 65 
and older

friday during a religious procession honoring two sikhs executed for 
the assassination of prime minister indira gandi authorities and 
witnesses said 
civil administrator nr gupta said at least four people 
including a sikh trapped in a burning truck were killed about 200 
people were injured and more than 200 shops were looted and set 
ablaze he said 
the government of jammukashmir state imposed a curfew on the 
northern city and ordered police to shoot violators 
police opened fire several times and used tear gas to try to stop 
the fighting but it continued until 1000 army troops arrived more 
than five hours later gupta said 
witnesses said the fighting started shortly after about 2000 
sikhs left a temple on a procession in honor of kehar singh and 
satwant singh who were hanged last week and now are revered as 
martyrs of the sikh faith 
many carried pictures as the eightmile procession moved through 
a hindu neighborhood and a group of militant hindus asked the sikhs 
to remove the pictures the witnesses said one sikh pulled a dagger 
and lunged at the hindus who retaliated they said 
jammu 40 miles north of sikhdominated punjab state has a 
population of about 500000 of these about 80000 are sikhs about 
300000 are hindus and the rest are moslems 
kehar singh and satwant singh were executed for the assassination 
of mrs gandhi who was killed oct 31 1984 in apparent 
retaliation for an army raid she had ordered on the sikhs holy 
golden temple 
sikh militants were using the temple as a base for their fight 
for an independent homeland in punjab state 
the assassination caused antisikh riots in many northern cities 
including jammu more than 2700 people died most of them sikhs 
sikhs comprise 2 percent of indias 800 million people but are a 
majority in punjab sikh militants claim discrimination by hindus 
who comprise 80 percent of the countrys population

competition to go to the hottest inaugural week 
party the texas black tie and boots ball has led to a political 
scrap over sen phil gramms decision to give some of the 50 
tickets to those contributing 1000 to his reelection campaign 
so intense is the fight for tickets that people have put ads in 
newspapers one man was offered a free trip to europe if he 
relinquished his tickets and others have reportedly scalped theirs 
for 500 each 
described as an event where you can let your hair down grab a 
beer and kick your boots off this ball is a big draw this year 
because presidentelect bush an adopted texan is expected to show 
up with 5500 other guests 
organizers initially planned for 4500 people but rented more 
space at the washington hilton to accommodate demand 
unlike many events over the glittery inaugural week the ball is 
not sanctioned by the official inaugural committee 
instead the bipartisan texas state society made up of texans or 
wouldbe texans is hosting the jan 21 party as it has for the past 
two inaugurations democratic rep charles stenholm is the societys 
chairman 
at the center of the controversy is gramm a firstterm 
republican who is using the inauguration to raise money for his 1990 
reelection campaign 
for a 1000 contribution gramm offered his supporters 
membership in the gramm senate advisory board during inaugural 
week board members are invited to a lunch with a cabinet officer 
and attend a reception with vips they were also given tickets to 
the ball until supplies ran out according to fundraiser brad 
oleary 
the inaugural package is expected to bring in between 100000 
and 150000 for the senator oleary said 
oleary said he bought 300 tickets right after they went on sale 
dec 14 at the request of the society he and others who purchased 
big blocks of tickets later returned 10 percent of them 
chino chapa stenholms spokesman said gramms campaign was by 
far the largest purchaser of tickets tickets were automatically 
sent to the societys 3000 members while others were made 
available by the society 
some of the criticism has come from democrats upset that gramm 
has used to bipartisan ball as a way to make money the black tie 
and boots thing is indicative of the way phil gramm operates said 
ed martin executive director of the texas democratic party its 
always phil gramm first he said 
republicans have been more tempered but dan flynn a spokesman 
for rep bill archer rtexas holder of bushs old congressional 
seat said it would have been totally unethical to resell 
tickets at a higher price 
archers office which has been inundated with requests bought 
about 20 tickets and then sold them at the same price to 
constituents he said 
a lot of folks from texas cant understand why they cant get 
in said ed gillespie an aide to rep dick armey rtexas 
larry neal gramms spokesman said the office had heard a lot of 
complaints about the ball but most of them came from democrats he 
said it was not particularly surprising to find complaints 
coming from the party that lost the election gramm was traveling in 
texas friday and was not available for comment 
gramms aides defended the senators fundraising they said the 
1000 contribution bought more than the 50 ticket and about 
twothirds of the black tie and boots ball tickets were given to 
people who contributed money to the campaign earlier 
oleary said the society should have done a better job in 
dividing up the tickets for what he said promised to be a cattle 
show 
they wouldnt have had this problem except that people from new 
york maine connecticut and all over want to come they should have 
limited it to people with a texas drivers license 
next time we will recommend imposing limits on the tickets you 
can buy chapa said 
despite the balls popularity some like armey are avoiding it 
he cant stand wearing a black tie gillespie said adding he 
doesnt drink he does his smoozing on the house floor

farmers planted 545 million acres of winter 
wheat last fall for harvest in 1989 a 12 percent increase from 1988 
and the most in four years the agriculture department said friday 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
year it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat 
output 
production was reduced last year by drought and brisk export 
demand has helped reduce stockpiles with greater demand prices 
have risen substantially the past year 
also farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their 
wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price 
supports compared with 275 percent previously 
all states increased acreage from 1988 except arizona the 
dakotas mississippi montana nevada new jersey and wyoming the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its report new 
mexico and tennesee are unchanged 
in kansas the largest producer wheat plantings jumped 22 
percent to 124 million acres 
nationally the 545 million acres of winter wheat planted for 
1989 is the largest acreage since 578 million acres were planted 
for the 1985 harvest according to usda records 
seeding of this years crop kicked off in august in several 
states the report said progress moved along by varying 
degrees reaching about 97 percent as of dec 1 by middecember 
seeding was finished except for parts of the southeast arizona and 
california 
in a supplyanddemand analysis officials said the us total 
wheat stockpile on june 1 the beginning of the 198990 wheat 
marketing year could be whittled to around 534 million bushels 
less than half the 126 billion bushels in the june 1 1988 
inventory it was more than 182 billion bushels on june 1 1987 
export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost 
wheat sales to the soviet union china and other foreign buyers 
total shipments in 198889 are expected to be around 15 billion 
bushels more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover 
us domestic food requirements 
meanwhile wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted 
range in the current marketing year of 360 to 375 per bushel on 
the average compared with 257 in 198788 and 242 in 198687 
a comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by 
last years drought corn prices for example were forecast at an 
average of 230 to 270 per bushel in the 198889 marketing year 
that runs through august compared with 194 last season and 150 
in 198687 
another report showed the dec 1 inventory of corn at 707 
billion bushels down 28 percent from a year earlier the wheat 
inventory at 171 billion bushels was down 32 percent from dec 1 
1987 
soybean stocks as of dec 1 were reported at 137 billion 
bushels down 22 percent from a year earlier 
a review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor 
adjustments in usdas previously announced harvest figures with the 
exception of corn last years corn harvest was reported at 492 
billion bushels up from 467 billion bushels estimated last 
november 
even so the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987 
production with the droughtreduced yield averaging 846 bushels 
per acre compared with the record level of 1194 bushels per acre 
in 1987 
the 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 181 billion 
bushels down 14 percent from 1987 and soybeans last year totaled 
154 billion bushels 20 percent below 1987 production cotton 
output at 154 million bales was up 5 percent from 1987 and was 
the most in seven years

the west german finance minister said friday 
his government had some new information to link firms in his 
country with the construction of a plant in libya that the united 
states says was designed to develop chemical weapons 
but the west german official said criminal prosecution would 
proceed only if there was complete evidence gerhard stoltenberg 
pledged after a onehour meeting with deputy secretary of state john 
c whitehead that whatever it takes to get information it will be 
followed 
meanwhile west german and us experts held a second day of 
meetings on the intelligence the reagan administration has used to 
support its claim that libya was trying to develop chemical weapons 
at the plant some 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
we are trying to provide as much information as possible 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said he said the 
talks at an undisclosed location would be useful and productive 
but provided no other details 
separate british and dutch investigations also point to an 
attempt by col moammar gadhafis country to develop chemical 
weapons secretary of state george p shultz said last week the 
libyans had not reached the point of production 
stoltenberg in a curbside news conference outside the 
department renewed allegations that west german firms had been 
targeted for criticism by us media 
what we did not like in some american press comments he 
said was to single out germany because it is obvious that it 
could have been a problem of quite a few other countries 
the finance minister said the united states and west germany 
should join in promoting international cooperation to prevent 
technology transfers to countries which could produce chemical 
weapons to endanger world security 
officials of the west german government last week registered 
skepticism that the united states had evidence to link west german 
firms to the plant which gadhafi said was producing pharmaceuticals 
however chancellor helmut kohl said thursday in bonn that 
authorities had seized new documents that may show firms helped the 
north african country build a chemical plant 
on friday hans frey a spokesman for the prosecutors office in 
karlsrube told the associated press there would be an investigation 
into the imhausenchemie company 
frey said the possible charge being investigated was a 
violation of the export control law he did not elaborate 
imhausenchemie has denied any connection to the libyan plant 
stoltenberg said the evidence came from west german sources 
there was no proof a week ago he said and now there is some 
new information in the last days which could lead to criminal 
prosecution 
but he said its not a final decision we must have complete 
evidence to prosecute whatever it takes to get information it 
will be followed 
referring to the dispute with the united states the west german 
official said we have really made progress in understanding

the official tass news agency on friday raised 
serious doubts about a story it ran on the miraculous survival of 
six men trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building for 35 days 
after the armenian earthquake 
in an urgent dispatch headlined one always wants miracles 
tass said it hadnt found a single eyewitness to confirm a leninakan 
residents tale that he and five others survived for five weeks on 
canned goods in a dark cramped food cellar 
everyone wanted to believe in the leninakan miracle the news 
agency said 
regrettably we are unable so far to confirm with full 
certainty the authenticity of the reports made by our armenian 
colleagues nor can we categorically deny them it said 
tass whose initials stand for the telegraph agency of the 
soviet union is run by the state and is used to distribute news 
and offical proclamations of the government 
in the years before president mikhail s gorbachev instituted his 
policy of greater openness or glasnost the soviet press was 
highly restricted in what it reported natural disasters and 
accidents rarely found their way into the national press its 
reporting on the devastating earthquake in armenia as well as other 
recent disasters has been unusually candid 
tass first ran the story thursday a day after the reported 
rescue in its dispatch friday it said it could not find the other 
five survivors the rescuers or any witnesses to the incident that 
made headlines around the world 
officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the 
dec 7 quake which killed 25000 people they began bulldozing the 
ruins to prevent decaying bodies from spreading disease 
but aikaz akopyan a 50yearold electrician admitted to a 
yerevan hospital thursday with pneumonia offered tass a detailed 
report of his fiveweek entombment 
psychiatrists examined akopyan and found him normal and 
reporters found acquaintances who confirmed akopyans identity and 
former residence in the ruined apartment building tass said 
akopyan remembers the five young men perfectly well tass 
said friday they said he suggested the other five survivors mut 
have traveled to relatives in another village 
but neighbors in the area of the ruined building told two 
correspondents from the soviet newspaper izvestia that they knew 
nothing of a rescue wednesday 
leninakan city council chairman e kirakosian walked down the 
street with the izvestia reporters thursday and told them the last 
survivors in the city were found dec 26 the newspaper said in its 
friday afternoon editions 
earlier attempts to find the rescuers were hampered by the fact 
that there is still only one telephone line to leninakan according 
to armenpress the armenian news agency that is affiliated with tass 
akopyan was quoted by tass as saying the six survived because 
they were buried in a cellar used to store canned vegetables smoked 
ham stewed fruit and pickles he said he sang and told stories in 
the pitchdark room to keep the others from going crazy 
soviet media leaped on the story the evening news program 
vremya interviewed akopyan in his hospital bed thursday night 
and friday mornings komsomolskaya pravda published a large photo of 
akopyan on its back page headlined and still there are 
survivors 
the communisty party daily pravda ran the tass report on page 
three under a small headline more than one month underground 
and moskovskaya pravda offered the same article with the title 
freed from captivity in the rocks 
but fridays izvestia was skeptical 35 days under the 
rubble read the headline 
tass said armenpress first heard of akopyans tale from yuri 
tunyan head of health and social security for the armenian council 
of ministers 
the first thought which crossed the mind was it is 
impossible tass said but tass correspondent kirill dibrova 
interviewed akopyan in the hospital and believed him 
ashot adomyan deputy chief physician at hospital no 3 also 
believes the story the news agency said 
tass quoted the doctor as saying it is natural for a man trapped 
in a basement for more than a month to develop pneumonia 
in addition akopyan arrived at the hospital blindfolded 
professional rescuers would have bandaged the eyes of a person 
trapped in the dark for five weeks before taking him into daylight 
tass said 
but it said rescue authorities in leninakan could not confirm 
akopyans story leaving disturbing questions 
why for instance a day after the miraculous salvation was it 
possible to locate only aikaz akopyan in a yerevan hospital the 
news agency asked where is the survivors sister who failed to 
appear at the hospital on friday though she promised to do so 
in an intriguing twist tass quoted an acquaintance of akopyan 
named siranush nersesyan who said she heard in the housing 
administration in leninakan on jan 9 two days before akopyan says 
he was rescued that people probably were still alive in the 
basement of that building 
in its story friday tass recalled a report earlier this month on 
french tv that 17 earthquake victims had survived for weeks in a 
wrecked bakery by eating grain and melted snow that report was 
subsequently denied by rescue officials 
a host of other news items from armenia truthful and invented 
sell on the world news market tass said it is understandable 
one wants so much to believe in the miracle of six people being 
saved on the 35th day after the quake

two british journalists said friday they got jobs 
as airplane cleaners at heathrow airport using fake applications and 
were able to wander on and off jets where they could easily have 
planted bombs 
one of them a london weekend television researcher said he left 
a package on a japan airlines flight without being challenged 
the other daily express reporter graham dudman said he was 
hired by skyliner services after a 10minute interview and found 
alarming holes in heathrow security three weeks after a bomb was 
planted on pan am flight 103 
the two journalists were not working together when they got their 
airport jobs the british airports authority which operates 
heathrow refused comment 
dudman said he decided to apply at the airport after a bomb blew 
up flight 103 on dec 21 killing all 259 people on board and 11 
people on the ground in the scottish town of lockerbie 
the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt and switched to 
a bigger plane at heathrow 
dudman said he was hired by skyliner services a private cleaning 
contractor after an interview jan 4 he said his application 
which contained many lies was never checked dudman said he 
received a pass that allowed him access to all areas of the airport 
and he started work jan 9 
as a parttime aircraft cleaner it enabled me to board 12 
jetliners on any one of which i could have planted a bomb under a 
seat or in a locker he said 
i gained unchallenged access to luggage containers and the 
cabin and flight decks of transatlantic airlines where at times i 
was alone and unsupervised he said 
dudman said he carried bulky packages and a camera past security 
posts and was never stopped or questioned even when he took 
photographs on the airfield several photographs appeared in the 
paper including one that showed the reporter posing near some pan 
am luggage 
each member of the cleaming staff i spoke to about security 
said they had never seen any and expressed amazement there had been 
no clampdown after pan am dudman said 
london weekend television said researcher stewart morris was 
hired by fernley aeroclean using a fake name it said he planted a 
parcel on japan air lines flight 402 
morris said he wasnt searched when boarding planes or supervised 
while working and could have planted the parcel anywhere except 
possibly twa which ran a metal detector over the cabin after the 
cleaners had finished 
paul ross a reporter for london weekend television said after 
he received a call from morris he bought a ticket on flight 402 
retrieved the package from under a window seat during the flight and 
took it into the cockpit without challenge 
it could have contained a bomb a gun or a knife he said 
i could easily have blown up or hijacked the plane 
london weekend television said the incident was filmed and would 
be shown sunday subject to approval by the independent broadcasting 
authority 
after dudmans disclosure heathrows managing director alan 
proctor announced that heathrow had withdrawn security passes for 
staff at skyliner 
transport secretary paul channon ordered the british airports 
authority to tighten security to ensure no one had unsupervised 
access to aircraft or checked baggage in restricted areas unless 
they had held an airport pass for at least six months 
skyliner called the governments action a very harsh decision 
because procedures for security are the same with us as they are for 
all the other companies at heathrow

a man being sued by the state for refusing 
to rent to an unmarried couple is challenging the state human rights 
act which he says violates his religious beliefs forbidding sex 
before marriage 
the bible clearly states this is wrong layle french 32 
said thursday from his farm outside marshall in southwestern 
minnesota i live with the bible as my guide 
french said the human rights act which protects minnesotans from 
various forms of discrimination violates his first amendment right 
to freedom of religion and is unconstitutional 
the dispute began last february when susan parsons of marshall 
sought to rent a house owned by french parsons and french entered 
into an agreement in which parsons told french she intended to live 
with her fiance and that his two children would stay with thempart 
of every month according to a human rights department complaint 
two days later french told parsons he had changed his mind and 
would not rent to her french said he told her why dont you get 
married and ill let you rent it 
he and his attorney james r anderson filed a written response 
friday with the state attorney generals office to the lawsuit filed 
dec 7 by the state department of human rights 
an administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case april 
11 
anderson said the laws lack of a provision for a jury trial 
makes it unconstitutional 
human rights commissioner stephen cooper said juries do not hear 
human rights cases because juries are supposed to reflect the 
societys majority and human rights laws are designed to protect 
the minority 
he said french was trying to control the lives of his tenants 
landlords often have exaggerated ideas of what their rights 
are cooper said theyre trying to invent a constitutional 
right to say i have the right to tell you what to think 
french said he believes by living together the couple would 
violate a littleknown state statute that outlaws sexual intercourse 
between unmarried adults 
we contend its a very schizophrenic state that on the one hand 
outlaws fornication and on the other compels cohabitation said 
anderson its against his religious convictions to rent on that 
basis 
he conceded that the misdemeanor sex statute was rarely enforced 
although still on the books 
cooper said french had no evidence parsons and her fiance would 
violate the law forbidding sex before marriage 
phone calls to parsons home for comment friday went unanswered

a flight data recorder missing from a 1987 
longrange nuclear missile test would provide valuable information 
to any us adversary that might have recovered the device an 
energy department official said friday 
although the recorder contained no classified information it 
is valuable said chris sankey a department spokeswoman she 
declined to describe the specific value of the recorder to the 
soviet union or any other country 
the pentagon acknowledged earlier this week it was investigating 
the loss of the recorder and said there was a possibility it may 
have been found by the soviets 
defense officials also said the recording device which would 
contain such information as the acceleration and velocity of the 
missile during flight was not classified but a pentagon source 
indicated the data would be valuable to a us adversary since the 
missile was being tested under realistic conditions 
wouldnt you like to get your hands on that asked the source 
sankey said a search for the device was continuing jointly by the 
departments of defense and energy but there was no clear evidence it 
had fallen into soviet hands 
the energy department is responsible for building and testing the 
pentagons nuclear warheads during test flights the missiles carry 
a dummy warhead and not an actual nuclear weapon although the rest 
of the missile contents are real 
ms sankey said only the flight date recorder and some minor 
debris were lost during the us recovery of the minuteman 2 
missile that was launched july 7 1987 from california toward 
kwajalein atoll in the western pacific ocean 
she said this was the first time that a missiles flight data 
recorder had been lost in a test flight 
it doesnt pose a loss of any technology for the united states 
but obviously there are a lot of things unclassified that we dont 
want nonallied countries to have ms sankey said

four medical malpractice suits 
against a doctor who replaced patients spinal discs with bone taken 
from cadavers have been settled for 53 million said lawyers for 
the plaintiffs 
aaron schneider an orthopedic surgeon used a garden hose to 
wash the bone pegs cut from pelvic bones of cadavers at the pinellas 
county morgue after getting permission from next of kin lawyers 
said he then stored the bone pegs in his kitchen freezer they said 
three other malpractice suits against schneider are pending 
the latest settlement of 975000 was reached tuesday 90 minutes 
into the testimony from the first witness during the trial of a suit 
brought by dolores nelson 47 of st petersburg 
her lawyers said she suffered crippling pain and a severe loss of 
mobility because of the procedure 
nobody that i know uses this procedure testified dr ronald 
b greene an orthopedic surgeon from the university of 
pennsylvanias medical school 
schneiders insurer florida patients compensation fund agreed 
to settle while greene was testifying 
in earlier court proceedings schneider denied he committed 
malpractice but he declined to comment after the settlement 
the procedure is not experimental but is considered difficult and 
requires extensive training said miami lawyer larry stewart who 
represented mrs nelson 
schneider performed the operation 107 times on 58 people and his 
own records showed a success rate of 24 percent said another lawyer 
for mrs nelson larry bianchi 
schneider told mrs nelson who injured her back in a 1981 fall 
that replacing a disc with a bone peg had a 90 percent chance of 
alleviating her pain according to court papers 
mrs nelsons pain however worsened after the operation at 
humanasun bay community hospital in st petersburg and she 
sustained nerve injury the suit said 
she underwent two more operations one using more bone pegs from 
a cadaver and the other using bone chisled from mrs nelsons hip 
in the end she had 14 different bone pegs hammered in and nine 
chisled out the suit said 
the hospital also was named in the suit but was dropped from the 
case monday after agreeing to a small settlement that was not 
disclosed 
prior settlements reached in the last six months have ranged from 
247500 to 2062000 three more cases are set for trial later 
this year 
the florida department of professional regulation has no public 
record of any investigation or discipline involving schneider a 
spokesman said

the department of energy held back for several 
months a report that concluded there was a cheaper quicker and 
safer way to produce tritium for nuclear weapons than building a new 
production reactor sources familiar with the report said friday 
a copy of a draft summary of the report obtained by the 
associated press said a linear accelerator could produce enough 
tritium to meet all us weapons needs 
the report which still has not been released was prepared by 
scientists at the departments brookhaven and los alamos national 
laboratories and the westinghousehanford co a department 
contractor based at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington 
state 
the draft summary was dated august 1988 a month after the 
department had recommended construction of two new production 
reactors and at a time when there was deepening concern about the 
safety and reliability of the entire weapons complex particularly 
the tritiumproducing reactors at savannah river in south carolina 
the sources who asked not to be identified said friday that 
department officials were worried that release of the report would 
provide further ammunition for critics of the departments decision 
to build new reactors 
they also said officials feared the report could cause problems 
at a time when the department was struggling to get its defense 
production programs back on track 
the sources said the department wanted the report held until 
after the election and the new administration took office 
i think the words were put it on ice said one source at 
the hanford reservation familiar with the report they wanted to 
hide it under a rug 
another source who worked on the report said that as word of 
the study started to seep out to the scientific community there 
were subtle suggestions to scientists at los alamos and hanford that 
they not discuss it 
the source also said the report had yet to receive a fair hearing 
from the energy department and that those who have seen it at the 
department have been skeptical about its conclusions 
chris sankey a department spokeswoman denied that the 
department had been holding the report 
weve not directed any such effort to put such a report on 
hold she said to my knowledge the department has not formally 
reviewed and therefore is not prepared to discuss this particular 
proposal 
i would point out that pursuance of other technologies to meet 
longterm national security requirements is consistent with the 
objectives of our national laboratories and contractors 
ms sankey had said earlier that the departments energy research 
advisory board looked briefly at the idea of using an accelerator to 
produce tritium but concluded that the technology was not mature 
enough to provide new production capacity 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speed until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads 
the draft report said that an accelerator would produce far less 
radioactive waste would not operate at the high pressures and 
extreme temperatures and should be more acceptable to the public 
than a nuclear reactor

candidacy for a second term as the leader of the nations 
seventhlargest city a day after a mayoral commission released its 
plan to stem racial tensions

place to do business 
dallas is the best place anywhere for businesses to succeed

suburbs 
at the top of my list of priorities are fighting crime and 
drugs and economic development which i believe are inextricably 
tied together

the most violent in the citys history five dallas police officers 
were killed and the city recorded a record number of homicides 
she said progress has been made toward easing racial tensions and 
praised the work of dallas together a 76member commission she 
appointed to study race relations in the wake of the police

appointment of a charter review committee to study the number and 
composition of city council districts dallas city council is now 
comprised of the mayor two atlarge members and eight district 
members 
expensive campaigns keep many people from running for city 
office dallas together said mrs strauss spent about 12 million 
on her mayoral race in 1987 but she said she would not spend that 
much for the may 6 election 
she is the only announced candidate for the post 
mrs strauss served two terms as an atlarge city council member 
and defeated fred meyer in a runoff for mayor in 1987 the 
incumbent starke taylor did not run

the government on friday 
applauded a pentagon report calling this countrys leading 
antiapartheid group a terrorist organization 
but the government also said it was confused by a report released 
by another us agency with a contradictory view 
the defense department report released wednesday listed the 
outlawed african national congress among 52 terrorist organizations 
worldwide 
as far as the south african government is concerned the 
pentagon report correctly analyzes terrorism said foreign 
minister pik botha 
however the us information service in pretoria released a 
statement from the state department in washington that contradicted 
the pentagon report 
the us government has not determined that the anc is a 
terrorist organization said the statement prepared by the state 
departments africa affairs bureau 
the state department supported the ancs aims of ending apartheid 
and establishing a democracy but it disagreed with the ancs use of 
violence the statement said 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
botha described the state department statement as somewhat 
confusing he added nevertheless the state department 
acknowledges that the ancs violent methods are unacceptable and 
this is the decisive issue 
the pentagon said its booklet which included a foreword by 
presidentelect george bush was prepared as a reference work not 
as a policy statement 
the booklet has prompted headlines in south african newspapers 
and angry condemnations of the united states by some antiapartheid 
activists and organizations 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu the 1984 nobel peace prize 
laureate who says he supports the african national congress goals 
but opposes violence said he was shocked and dismayed by the 
defense department report 
in washington a pentagon spokesman said the group was included 
in the book because authorities wanted to warn americans of the 
danger from the anc and other organizations around the world the 
spokesman lt cmdr jim kudla said the book had been fully 
coordinated with the state department 
but within the state department counterterrorism officials 
disagreed with professional diplomats who wrote the statement 
contradicting the the pentagon report and who are concerned with 
maintaining ties to south africas black majority 
the south african government banned the african national congress 
in 1960 and the group began a sabotage campaign one year later 
there have been 180 bombings in south africa during the 31month 
state of emergency killing 35 people and injuring at least 665 of 
all races 
the government says it will not negotiate with the group unless 
it renounces violence the congress says it had no alternative but 
to take up arms after it was banned as a peaceful organization

eight leaders of montenegros 
government resigned friday two days after the central republics 
communist party leaders were forced out by growing unrest over the 
regions faltering economy 
it was the first time the entire government and party leaderships 
of one of yugoslavias six constituent republics had stepped down 
the montenegrin parliament on friday accepted the resignations of 
the sixman state presidency but voted to keep it in a caretaker 
capacity until new elections were held 
it also accepted resignations of the republics representative in 
the collective nineman federal presidency and of its speaker 
velisav vuksanovic 
the state news agency tanjug reported later that the parliament 
also decided to call early elections in montenegro a final decision 
on that matter will be made jan 26 tanjug said 
on wednesday the partys central committee formally accepted the 
resignation of its ruling politburo and named a interim leadership 
to prepare for an extraordinary party congress 
yugoslavias federal government six republic governments and two 
autonomous provinces each are run by a party presidium a state 
presidency and a government the presidencies headed by chairmen 
mostly have formal functions subordinate to the party 
montenegros government in charge of implementing economic 
policies already resigned after mass protests last october 
the ouster of the entire montenegrin ruling elite came after more 
than 120000 people demonstrated earlier this week in titograd the 
regions capital demanding the leadership step down because of the 
disastrous state of the regions economy 
the current mass dissatisfaction among the workers students 
and young people is due to a large extent to the difficulties faced 
by the country as a whole said bozidar tadic vicepresident of 
the montenegrin parliament in his keynote speech which was 
broadcast live on national television 
montenegros representative on the federal presidency veselin 
djuranovic said his decision to step down was motivated by a 
sense of responsibility for the economic situation and in the 
expectation that it will help alleviate the crisis

diplomats from the tiny african nation of 
rwanda collected more parking tickets per car than any other un 
mission in the city where the world body makes its home 
data released friday by new yorks parking violations bureau show 
the five cars of the east african nations mission received 307 
summonses in the first six months of 1988 the bureau said each car 
collected an average of 102 tickets a month 
sudan bahrain the ivory coast and seychelles rounded out the 
list of the top five parking scofflaws according to bureau figures 
each of sudans five cars was ticketed an average of 847 times 
per month bahrains three vehicles each got 783 tickets a month 
the ivory coasts 13 vehicles each got 696 tickets and seychelles 
with one car collected six 
figures for the last half of 1988 are not yet available 
consular and un diplomats hold diplomatic immunity and thus 
cannot be compelled to pay parking tickets few ever do and the 
parking violations bureau does not try to collect the millions in 
unpaid fines 
new york parking tickets cost 10 to 40 depending on the 
offense 
the soviet union with 110 vehicles did not even make the list 
of the top 20 offenders the us mission does not issue diplomatic 
plates to its employees and did not appear on the list 
the parking violations bureau turns its list over to the new york 
city commission for the united nations and consular corps which 
serves as liaison between the city and the foreign diplomatic 
community 
officials in that commission headed by gillian martin sorensen 
talk to the worst offenders and have achieved some success in 
reducing the number of offenses 
the total number of parking tickets went down from 153784 in 
1978 to fewer than 65000 in 1985 even though assigned diplomatic 
parking spaces in midtown manhattan were cut by 40 percent 
according to mrs sorensens office

ask ray mcanally what he thinks of the people he 
portrays so memorably and the irish actor is lost for words his 
job he says is to honor his characters not to judge them 
the character is me i see the world that he sees says the 
62yearold actor who can be seen on masterpiece theater on pbs on 
sunday playing fictional prime minister harry perkins a socialist 
who is unseated by his own uppercrust secret service 
written by alan plater and directed by mick jackson it will air 
in two parts sunday from 9 to 10 pm est and monday 9 to 11 pm 
est 
its mcanallys second recent pbs series following his starring 
role as neerdowell rick pym in john le carres a perfect spy 
set in 1990s britain coup shares the paranoiac 
conspiratorial tone of such recent british films and tv series as 
defense of the realm and edge of darkness 
it is rooted in a longstanding reallife conspiracy theory 
that rightwingers in the british secret service plotted to oust 
harold wilson and his labor party government in the 70s 
adapted from a novel by chris mullin a labor lawmaker coup 
is a satire in which a labor prime minister outrages his opponents 
by telling the truth to the press and honoring his election pledges 
perkins downfall comes from keeping a promise to remove us 
military bases and turning to moscow for aid rather than allowing 
britain to remain an aircraft carrier for the united states 
as the rightwing press howls for his blood the secret service 
sets out to discredit him by concocting a phony bank account in his 
name and digging up an ancient love affair 
the series invites debate but mcanally keeps his distance an 
irish resident who has never voted in a british election he tries 
to get under perkins skin without evaluating him 
my job is not to make decisions about politics but to create 
the human being mcanally said in a phone interview if i were 
playing british prime minister maggie thatcher id vote for 
maggie thatcher 
when i play harry im in his shoes he feels that the world 
needs changing that the values society holds need to be changed 
mcanallys strength is his uncanny ability to become his 
character whether as the polished papal ambassador in the 
mission or as the roughhewn ulster work boss in cal 
the perkins role required a distinctly south yorkshire accent 
which he honed to perfection by spending five months in the pubs and 
steel foundries of sheffield 
of scripts he says i draw no massive cosmic global 
conclusions but simply take every line in detail 
mcanally has rarely been out of work since making his 
professional debut in his native county donegal at age 16 he has 
worked closely over five decades with dublins abbey theater in more 
than 150 plays classic and modern as both an actor and a director 
movie work has ranged from shake hands with the devil with 
james cagney to the fourth protocol with michael caine he most 
recently appeared on londons west end stage last season playing 
george bernard shaw alongside sir john gielgud in the best of 
friends 
roland joffes movie the mission made him a star a status he 
accepts with ambivalence im still thank god quite anonymous 
married with four children mcanally says he was first drawn to 
acting at age 6 and sees it as a vocation not a career 
this is where i belong he said a lot of people go into 
the business because they think its going to give them something 
that i think can be disastrous because they may not get what 
theyre looking for 
mcanally will be seen later this year as the lawyer jaggers in a 
new tv adaptation of great expectations

from libya and that washington had canceled a missilefiring 
exercise in the central mediterranean north of libya

the california board of education on 
friday unanimously adopted a new policy statement intended to 
strengthen the teaching of evolution in the states 7125 public 
schools 
fundamentalist church leaders criticized the new policy which 
was adopted as a guideline for classroom teachers and for textbook 
publishers and said they will urge local school boards throughout 
the state to interpret the policy to allow teachers or students to 
question evolution 
a key provision of the policy statement specifies that only 
theories based on factual evidence should be taught in science 
classes while theories based on religious belief are appropriate 
to the historysocial science and englishlanguage arts curricula 
associate state superindentent francie alexander described 
adoption of the new policy statement as a very significant step 
toward eliminating the hesitancy of some local schools to teach 
evolution in science classes when faced with opposition from church 
leaders 
it makes it explicit what is science and what is religion that 
means evolution is going to be taught as the main theory of origins 
we have not had anything of this clarity before she told 
reporters after the boards vote 
but the rev louis sheldon of anaheim president of the 
traditional values group which he said includes 6000 california 
churches said the principal weakness of the new policy is that it 
is not clear how students or teachers may question evolution theory 
is there still a door of opportunity through which a critical 
view of evolution can be raised we do not see it precisely in the 
language were kind of in a no mans land he told reporters 
after the vote 
sheldon said his group isnt advocating the teaching of the bible 
creation theory in science classes but only wants to keep the 
door open to allow discussion of other theories of the the origin 
of life 
the issue is will evolution be taught as fact or as theory 
sheldon said adding that there is some positive material in the 
statement we just want to carry it further 
neither side testified directly before the full board which 
adopted the policy statement after a brief description and no 
debate but nearly half of the boards members had participated in 
part or all of two lengthy hearings drafting the statement earlier 
this month 
the debate over the policy statement focused almost exclusively 
on evolution but that word didnt even appear in the first two 
drafts of the document and was added in the final draft adopted by 
the board only as an example of scientific theories in a footnote 
however alexander said she was sure that to textbook publishers 
and local teachers its very very clear that the statement 
sets policy for teaching evolution

airport authorities said former ugandan 
dictator idi amin left dakar on friday apparently bound for 
kinshasa the zairean capital from which he was just deported 
the authorities said on condition of anonymity that amin flew out 
on the same falcon 50 plane that brought him to the senegalese 
capital on thursday it belongs to the zairean state mining company 
gecamines 
amin accompanied by one of his sons was detained in kinshasa on 
jan 3 as he tried to enter zaire on a false passport one of a 
batch reported stolen 
zairean officials said they established that amin intended to 
return to uganda through zaire the two countries share a common 
border 
officials in kinshasa made it clear amins presence was unwelcome 
and an embarrassment they assured neighboring countries of 
continuing cooperation and good will 
calling himself dada big daddy the 300pound amin seized 
power in a 1971 coup and ruled until 1979 drawing world accusations 
of human rights atrocities and corruption ugandas president now is 
yoweri museveni 
amin was supposed to take a flight from dakar to saudi arabia 
where he has been living in exile for years but the plane left for 
jidda the saudi capital without him the authorities said 
they said the pilot would not accept him as a passenger because 
he did not have a saudi visa they said when the falcon 50 left they 
presumed it was returning to kinshasa 
elaborate security precautions at the airport prevented reporters 
from talking to amin 
saudi diplomats said authorities in jidda were not pleased at the 
manner he left the country and are not happy about accepting him

alongside the icy runway at kabuls 
airport about 500 soviet soldiers laden with equipment lined up 
friday in front of giant transport planes waiting to take them back 
to the soviet union 
downtown afghans huddled in blankets against the biting cold 
forming long lines for bread or gasoline bread the staple diet of 
the poor has become a precious and increasingly expensive commodity 
afghan guerrillas assisted by a bitter winter appear to be 
making an increasingly effective attempt to blockade the city of 3 
million and some diplomats say the soviet strategy is to get out as 
quickly as possible with as little publicity as possible 
indeed fridays troop departure was the latest in what western 
diplomats say is a rapidly accelerating pullout that belies hints 
from moscow it may not meet next months withdrawal deadline 
they the soviet troops are leaving and they want to cover up 
the kabul end of it said one western diplomat it could be that 
with the acute shortages they dont want to show the unpleasant 
reality of kabul 
but the soviet news agency tass said friday an extremely 
difficult situation developed in kabul in providing the population 
with foodstuffs long breadlines appeared in the city 
it reported that the government imposed an antihoarding decree 
under which people who deliberately hide surplus foodstuffs and do 
not hand them over in time are brought to court 
tass said convoys of food fuel and other necessities were being 
rushed into kabul but groups of extremists attack convoys 
virtually every day and are a constant threat to kabuls supplies 
afghan government forces killed or wounded 100 insurgents in 
battles in nangarhar and kandahar provinces and near kabul seized 
54 missiles intended for use against the capital city the news 
agency said another 170 resistance fighters were killed or wounded 
in fighting among rival factions tass said 
under a unmandated agreement the red army which entered 
afghanistan in december 1979 is to be out of the country by feb 
15 soldiers began leaving may 15 and about half the estimated 
100000 were gone by aug 15 
but the moslem guerrillas fighting the soviet and afghan troops 
this week broke off negotiations with yuli vorontsov the soviet 
deputy foreign minister and the ambassador to kabul vorontsov 
hinted that if the insurgency continued the soviet troops might 
delay their departure 
western diplomats say the current rate of withdrawal indicates 
the bulk of the soviet troops are likely to be gone ahead of 
schedule 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze traveled to kabul 
on friday the nature of his visit was not disclosed by tass 
fridays group of troops was lined up beside two blue and white 
ilyushin76 transport planes more than a dozen smaller antonov 
aircraft were nearby diplomats estimate that seven to eight il76 
aircraft arrive and leave daily 
this week the soviets shut down their 700bed military hospital 
in kabul pulled out all the medical staff and handed the facility 
over to the afghan administration soviet civilian advisers as well 
as government ministers are also going there are no firm numbers on 
how many of the estimated 2500 advisers remain 
diplomats say that in the past week the number of advisers at 
the ministry of health has been cut from 16 to two and at the 
afghansoviet transport company from 20 to five 
the price of nan the flat bread that along with sugar and tea is 
all most afghans can reguarly afford has more than doubled to about 
15 afghanis at the commonly used black market rate a us dollar 
is worth 200 afghanis 
sugar ran out at most stores about a month ago 
on sunday a regular working day in this moslem country the 
bread shortage was so acute that 80 percent of bread stores were 
closed witnesses said a group of afghan soldiers broke into and 
robbed one store that still had supplies 
large parts of the city are without power for up to six hours 
daily in what appears to be part of an effort to conserve power 
the university closed in november a month early and wont reopen 
until march a month late 
thos who can afford it are exacerbating the shortages by stocking 
up 
people join cars at gas stations filling up twogallon cans to 
lug home 
one western diplomat estimated that up to 7000 of the remaining 
50000 soviet soldiers may have left since the new year the us 
state department said jan 11 that the soviet union had renewed its 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
army gen vitaly m shabanov a deputy soviet defense minister 
told a moscow news conference friday it is our intention to abide 
by the geneva agreements this is our duty and indeed this is the 
firm opinion and strong intention of our leaders so there can be no 
doubts in this regard

the treasury department is working on a savings 
and loan reform plan that would transfer control of the insurance 
fund for sampl deposits from its current regulatory parent to the 
agency that insures commercial banks a government official said 
friday 
however the department hasnt decided for certain on the 
recommendation to presidentelect bush which would give the federal 
deposit insurance corp jurisdiction over the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
it would be an administrative merger not a merger of the money 
in the funds which are each separately financed through premiums 
paid by the industry they insure the official said 
commercial bankers are lobbying hard to make sure money from 
their fund doesnt go to solve a competing industrys problems the 
fdic is solvent with more than 15 billion in reserves the fslic 
although it still has several billion dollars in cash to work with 
has been technically insolvent since 1986 
an administrative merger of the funds would promote similar 
regulatory standards for both banks and sampls bankers believe that 
regulation of sampls is now more lax 
the fdic already regulates institutions called savings banks 
which are similar to savings and loan associations even so many in 
the sampl industry believe merging the funds would eventually mean the 
end of a separate system of providing home mortgage loans 
currently the federal home loan bank board runs the fslic which 
as the deposit insuror has prime responsibility for making sure sampls 
engage in safe lending practices however the bank board is also 
charged with promoting home ownership by establishing sampls a role 
critics say can inherently conflict with the fslics 
the wall street journal in fridays editions cited sources who 
said the department is close to deciding in favor of the fslicfdic 
merger but is still considering whether to recommend abolishing the 
bank board altogether 
sampl regulators reacted strongly against both proposals which 
could be forwarded to presidentelect bush as soon as he takes 
office on jan 20 
i think its a crummy idea said bank board member lawrence 
white it does not get us any kind of pot of gold thats going to 
solve the problem i dont think you get any better regulation 
what it does do is create administrative disruption and disarray at 
exactly the wrong time 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic has in several speeches 
expressed his agencys preference for going it alone however 
he has said he would if asked tackle the job of regulating sampls in 
addition to banks 
in a study released earlier this month the fdic recommended that 
fslic be made independent of the bank board but remain separate 
from the fslic 
treasury is also examining ways to find a source of money to 
devote to faster rescues and closings of insolvent sampls proposals 
range from a mechanism to borrow the money offbudget so that it 
does not inflate the budget deficit to spending the money outright 
but declaring it exempt from grammrudman deficit limits 
a senior member of both the house budget committee and the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee rep bill gradison 
rohio suggested friday a rationale for exempting sampl rescue 
spending from grammrudman 
gradison released a congressional research service report that 
argued that the economic impact of sampl failures has already been 
felt because the losses already exist as a liability of the 
government regardless of when the payoff actually occurs 
the bailout should be reflected in the budget but because the 
economic impact has already been absorbed the resulting outlays 
should be exempt from the grammrudman targets he said 
reagans outgoing budget director joseph r wright jr told 
reporters friday he favored putting the sampl rescue onbudget 
rather than hiding the spending through some budgetary device 
bush meanwhile moved this week to establish an independent 
source of expertise on sampls in the white house by naming roger b 
porter a harvard university business professor as chief domestic 
policy adviser and richard breeden a washington attorney as an 
assistant for issues analysis

bernhard goetz who shot four young black men on 
the subway and was convicted only of illegal gun possession was 
sentenced friday to one year in jail and fined 5000 after a judge 
noted he had shown no remorse 
i do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of 
society than it is about me goetz told the court before the 
sentence was pronounced society needs to be protected from 
criminals 
goetzs lack of remorse gave me concern he might recidivate in 
possessing a firearm said state supreme court justice stephen 
crane in manhattan supreme court is new york states triallevel 
court 
the nowfamous defendant who faced one to seven years decided 
to go ahead with his sentencing even though he has asked the us 
supreme court to review his case because he wants to get the jail 
time over with said his attorney mark baker 
hes resigned to the fact that hes going to jail baker 
said hes paid his bills for the next few months and gotten his 
affairs in order hes tense and apprehensive 
under a oneyear prison sentence goetz gets credit for nine days 
he already served immediately after his arrest and becomes eligible 
for parole in 51 days 
goetz left immediately for rikers island city jail smiling 
meekly at court officers as he was led away the correction 
department agreed to a defense request that goetz be kept in 
protective custody there baker said 
there is no rhyme reason or reality to bernhard goetz going to 
jail goetzs other attorney barry slotnick said after the 
sentencing he had urged that his clients sentence be limited to 
the nine days he had already served 
he has lived in a fishbowl due to publicity and he should not 
go to jail slotnick told the judge 
assistant district attorney gregory waples calling goetz a 
potential danger to himself and new york society sought a 
oneyear sentence with supervised parole so that goetz would be 
forced to undergo psychiatric treatment 
goetz shot the teenagers in december 1984 he fled to new 
hampshire then surrendered saying he had shot the men because he 
felt he was about to be robbed the case became a sensation of the 
talkshow airwaves and editorial pages prompting debates on racism 
selfdefense and vigilantism 
to many blacks in particular goetz was a coldhearted criminal 
a symbol of raciallymotivated violence to many whites 
particularly gun owners he was the subway vigilante an 
ordinary citizen protecting his rights 
goetz was acquitted in june 1987 of attempted murder assault and 
other charges and convicted only of possessing the gun used at the 
time 
on oct 19 1987 crane sentenced goetz to six months in jail a 
5000 fine 200 hours community service five years probation and 
psychiatric counseling 
but last year a midlevel appeals court overturned the sentence 
saying the judge should have followed the state gun control law 
which mandated a oneyear sentence the case was returned to crane 
for resentencing 
baker said he and slotnick asked the us supreme court on jan 6 
to review the case because they are challenging the conviction 
itself 
but because goetz wants to get the jail time over with the 
attorneys did not request that the sentencing be held off until the 
supreme court rules within six to eight weeks baker said 
we all decided to proceed and not delay it any further baker 
said if he gets the straight time of a year in jail we wont 
appeal that either 
if the high court decides to review the case however the 
attorneys would ask that goetzs sentence be interrupted baker said 
three of the four teenagers goetz shot recovered the fourth was 
braindamaged and partially paralyzed goetz claimed he shot them in 
selfdefense because he was about to be robbed the youths claimed 
they were panhandling 
goetzs sentence is an outrage and gives license to bigots and 
lunatics all over the city of new york to go out and blast people 
who they hate and fear said ron kuby a lawyer representing one 
of the teenagers darrell cabey in a multimilliondollar suit 
against goetz 
he said he had spoken with cabeys mother who expressed 
disappointment with the verdict she was hoping a stiff sentence 
would prevent other people from going out and doing to black youth 
what bernhard goetz did to darrell cabey unfortunately thats not 
going to happen 
mayor edward i koch said he thought the sentence was 
appropriate saying of those who carry illegal handguns every one 
of them should serve a year in jail no exceptions 
despite all the headlines and public debate that the goetz case 
spawned it is difficult to say if the case changed the lives of 
anyone not directly involved in the shooting or its prosecution 
in the place it logically would have had the greatest impact 
the subways police say they can see little effect 
i dont really see any pattern at all that exists based on that 
particular case said sgt bob valentino a spokesman for the 
transit police 
subway crime figures have bounced up and down in the years since 
the shooting while subway ridership has been up an estimated 3 
million people use the subway every weekday 
the perception of subway crime of being frightened is more 
than the reality said valentino were trying to address that 
and inform the public

a departing justice department official used a 
private public relations firm friday to announce a press conference 
that was not officially cleared with the attorney general 
the public relations company that issued the release for 
assistant attorney general roger j marzulla had recently prepared 
an announcement that the outgoing head of the land and natural 
resources division was joining a local law firm to start an 
environmentallaw practice 
without telling the justice departments public affairs staff 
hartzmeek international inc told news organizations the land 
division planned to file a court action against the district of 
columbias sewage treatment plant 
department spokesman loye miller said use of a private public 
relations firm to announce an official justice department action was 
unprecedented and ran counter to established procedures 
the firm got involved in official justice department business 
just four days after the agency announced deep cuts in its public 
affairs staff that would take effect in 30 days 
later friday marzulla appeared before television cameras in his 
office to discuss the court action even though department officials 
said he had not received clearance to hold a press conference 
at the outset marzulla said he was conducting a briefing not a 
press conference but he read a prepared statement and took 
questions during a session filmed by two local tv camera crews 
the hartzmeek press release was distributed before the justice 
department issued its formal release announcing the government was 
seeking a 31 million contemptofcourt judgment against the dc 
government for failing to upgrade the sewage plant 
miller said he was unaware of the private companys news release 
miller said he had been unable to get clearance from the attorney 
generals staff for marzulla to hold a press conference 
miller said marzulla had sought clearance from attorney general 
dick thornburghs office to hold a press conference the spokesman 
said he was prepared to advise marzulla not to hold a press 
conference when he was told the assistant attorney general had 
withdrawn his request for clearance 
marzulla said he asked hartzmeek to issue the release to give 
local news organizations notice that the departments action was 
being taken 
more publicity is needed marzulla said because the departments 
antipollution efforts have been eclipsed by the wrong notion that 
there has not been enough enforcement 
he denied seeking to promote his new career as an environmental 
lawyer by using the public relations firm to summon local reporters 
to the briefing 
it does not strike me as inappropriate marzulla said

nato the warsaw pact and 12 other 
european nations on friday informally accepted a landmark human 
rights and security accord designed to enhance freedom in the soviet 
bloc and boost eastwest contacts 
but a lingering dispute between greece and turkey continued to 
block final agreement on a mandate for new eastwest arms talks 
the accord includes provisions that would increase religious 
freedom speed emigration procedures and the issuance of visas for 
important family reasons allow independent monitoring encourage 
tourism allow freer spread of information and give all prisoners 
humane treatment 
another provision would stop the abuse of psychiatry against 
political prisoners soviet authorities have been accused of using 
mental hospitals to punish dissidents 
western diplomats hailed the document as a major advance on human 
rights but noted the key test was whether the soviet bloc would 
stick to it 
the 1975 helsinki final act signed by the soviet union the 
united states canada and all european nations bar albania 
contained commitments to free travel information and other human 
rights that the east bloc often violated 
the vienna document refined and defined the humanitarian 
undertakings in far greater detail than ever possible before 
noted canadian ambassador william bauer who played a prominent part 
in western efforts to achieve good human rights agreements 
reforms in the soviet union played a major role in securing the 
agreement bauer and other western diplomats said 
diplomats trying to resolve the dispute between greece and 
turkey nato allies reported no firm progress friday and scheduled 
their next session of natowarsaw pact talks for saturday 
the us ambassador to the talks stephen ledogar said secretary 
of state george shultz will not come to vienna next week to wind up 
the 35nation helsinki review conference and formally approve the 
final document unless the dispute is solved 
shultz could decide at any moment that the us could wait no 
longer ledogar told reporters time is running out 
greece and turkey are arguing over whether to include a strategic 
triangle of turkish territory close to the syrian border and the 
disputed port of mersin in new eastwest talks on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
ledogar said greece and turkey will have to share the bame if 
their dispute unravels the arms talks and helsinki conference 
agreements 
polish ambassador wlodzimierz konarski speaking on behalf of the 
warsaw pact said late friday we have done all we can to reach 
agreement in vienna 
the problem remaining is not eastwest he said you 
cant blame the east for it 
konarski said the session set for saturday was the final 
deadline for advising foreign ministers whether or not to come to 
vienna next week 
the ministers are scheduled to end the meeting in a threeday 
session next week the meeting opened in vienna in november 1986 
the mandate for the new arms talks is supposed to be included in 
the final document of the conference 
nato and the warsaw pact gave provisional agreement to the final 
document minus the mandate for arms talks on friday after the 12 
neutral and nonaligned nations at the conference worked late into 
the night to resolve outstanding differences 
even as the east bloc informally accepted the accords reports 
came from bulgaria of the arrest of at least seven independent human 
rights activists in that nation 
communist authorities in czechoslovakia also have banned a rally 
planned sunday by independent groups in prague who want to 
commemorate a student who burned himself to death in january 1969 to 
protest the 1968 sovietled invasion 
if finally approved the vienna accord contains provisions to 
allow religious education the spread of religious literature 
and charity action by churches 
resolve outstanding emigration applications within six months 
and grant visas for family reunification within one to three months 
facilitate tourism allowing western visitors to stay in east 
bloc homes 
provide much more information needed by western businessmen 
trading in the east 
allow independent groups to monitor their governments human 
rights behavior and the state of the environment 
in addition the agreement provides for the first time a formal 
mechanism allowing any helsinki signatory to take up human rights 
matters with any other signatory 
annual conferences on human rights are planned before the next 
helsinki review conference scheduled in helsinki in 1992

a day after announcing a 735 million tax package 
gov michael s dukakis launched a campaign friday to build 
political support for the plan which has drawn little enthusiasm in 
the legislature 
the governors first stop on what aides said would be an 
aggressive highly visible statewide lobbying effort was bunker hill 
community college the kind of government investment dukakis says 
his tax plan is designed to protect 
for our children and our grandchildrens sakes 180000 of who 
attend our public colleges and universities we must go forward 
dukakis said calling education the key to good jobs thats why i 
need your support for the revenue package i unveiled last night 
his plan which seeks to raise 131 million in the next six 
months and 604 million in the following year targets drinkers 
smokers drivers investors corporations and utilities 
the governor said he was committed to building support for new 
taxes rather than pare government spending much further 
dukakis told the house and senate ways and means committees 
friday that he is withholding 250 million in spending authorized in 
the 116 billion budget because the state does not have the money 
to pay for the spending 
dukakis told legislators that his revenue advisory board met 
thursday and made no change in its forecast of state tax 
collections at its last meeting in december the board trimmed 308 
million from its projection for the current fiscal year which ends 
on june 30 
in addition to meeting with hundreds of students and university 
officials at the bunker hill campus the governor also spent much of 
the day giving interviews to massachusetts television stations to 
promote the program 
the biggest element in the package was a proposed doubling in the 
personal income tax rate on profits from capital gains on 
investments dukakis proposed keeping the current exemption for 
sales of homes and would exempt profits from new investments in 
massachusetts 
dukakis also proposed raising the gasoline tax from 11 cents to 
17 cents a gallon adding 4 cents per pack to the cigarette excise 
a 50 percent increase in the state tax on beer wine and alcohol 
and applying the sales tax to purchases by utilities and to 
interstate telephone calls and data transmissions 
in addition dukakis called for diverting 14 million from the 
unemployment insurance trust fund to a job training program and 
changing the schedule of filing corporate estimated taxes to bring 
in an extra 46 million this year 
dukakis will present the tax proposal in a legislative package to 
skeptical legislators next week just past the midpoint in the 
budget year he said the plan would have to take effect by april 1 
to help balance the budget this year 
in december dukakis acknowledged a shortfall of at least 600 
million in the current state budget of 116 billion

the justice department will try to enter a 
civil suit brought against the general electric co over admissions 
that it failed to test components in engines sold to the navy 
officials announced friday 
a former plant manager for general electric anthony divincenzo 
sued ge last september under a law which lets private citizens seek 
damages on behalf of the government for alleged fraudulent activity 
the assistant attorney general for civil proceedings john r 
bolton said in a statement the justice department was petitioning 
us district judge carl rubin to join the suit but it was not 
known when rubin would decide the issue 
fbi and pentagon investigators have been reviewing ge admissions 
that test records may have been falsified at a seattle factory that 
made parts for military and commercial aircraft according to court 
documents and federal officials 
the investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the 
f404 engine that powers the navys fa18 fighter according to 
the justice department announcement 
the ge factory in question also makes an engine part used by the 
type of boeing aircraft that crashed sunday in britain killing 44 
people 
however federal and company officials said the part could not 
have caused the boeing accident the federal investigation began 
last year and has no connection with the accident in england 
ge spokesman richard kennedy said wednesday the factory made a 
timer valve for the cfm56 engine used by the boeing 737400 as well 
as a check and drain valve for the f404 engine aboard the navys 
fa18 fighter 
another ge employee attorney robert c anderson said in a 
letter dated last june 2 that test records may have been falsified 
for valves used on the fa18 in 198487 
according to newly revealed court papers in cincinnati the fbi 
has become involved in the investigation of the fa18 engines 
navy spokeswoman lt nettie johnson was unable to say immediately 
whether the fa18 had experienced problems from faulty 
check and drain valves 
anderson the ge attorney said in his letter to the pentagon 
that in late may 1988 it was discovered that prior to july 1987 
a particular flow leak check which is required by geae general 
electric aircraft engine specifications was not performed on the 
f404 check and drain valves 
it is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983 
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken anderson 
said in the letter 
the test was reinstituted in july 1987 when the problem was 
detected by lower level personnel in the plant the letter said 
during the period involved it is also believed that operators may 
have falsified internal test records which are maintained to reflect 
actual test readings 
andersons letter does not indicate the total number of engines 
or their value but said the deliveries covered the periods of 
aprilmay 1984 aprilmay 1985 aprilmay 1986 and aprilmay 1987 
defense department officials said they had received andersons 
letter as part of what they called a voluntary disclosure 
program for companies that believe they have not met the terms of 
their contracts the inspector generals office in the pentagon in 
conjunction with the fbi is investigating the admissions in the 
letter said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at the request of the justice department all documents in the 
divincenzo suit remained under seal until last friday when judge 
rubin denied a federal motion to allow the justice department until 
feb 1 to decide whether to join the case as a plaintiff

a prosecutor on friday ordered a 
criminal inquiry into a west german firm washington says helped 
build a poison gas factory in libya compounding the embarrassment 
of the bonn government 
the inquiry into the export activities of imhausenchemie a 
black forest chemical firm was announced eight days after the 
government said the firm appeared to have no link with the suspected 
chemical weapons plant 
werner botz chief prosecutor for the offenburg region told the 
associated press he opened the new investigation after reading an 
extensive report on the issue in this weeks stern magazine 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
us government is pleased the west germans took a look at the 
evidence supplied by us officials and investigated the matter 
in another embarrassment friday chancellor helmut kohls 
spokesman conceded at a news conference that intelligence sources 
told the government in october that west german companies may have 
helped build the plant south of tripoli the libyan capital 
government spokesman friedhelm ost had said earlier that bonn 
knew nothing of alleged west german complicity in the project until 
us secretary of state george shultz brought it up during kohls 
visit to washington in november 
at the same news conference friday finance ministry spokesman 
karlheinz von den driesch said investigators had to date found no 
evidence against west german firms that would stand up in court 
after meeting in washington friday with deputy secretary of state 
john c whitehead finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said bonn 
had some new information to link west german firms with building 
the libyan plant 
he said however that criminal prosecution would proceed only if 
there was complete evidence and pledged that whatever it 
takes to get information it will be followed 
west german and us experts met for a second day in washington 
to examine us evidence on the plants purpose and alleged west 
german involvement 
stern cited what it said were official documents and witnesses in 
its article which accused three firms imhausenchemie the now 
defunct ibi engineering of frankfurt and pen tsao medical supply 
of hamburg of being deeply involved in the libya project 
us officials contend the plant in rabta 60 miles south of 
tripoli is intended to produce chemical weapons libya says it is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
stern alleged that imhausenchemie provided everything that is 
needed to build a chemical plant to ibi which in turn shipped 
the materials to libya under forged bills of lading 
the article also mentioned involvement by the cross link nv firm 
of antwerp belgium the director of that company jozef gedopt was 
arrested in brussels wednesday night and charged with forging 
shipping documents on goods delivered to libya 
a woman who answered the telephone at imhausenchemie friday said 
the firm would have no comment on the developments she refused to 
give her name or put calls through to the management 
libyas un ambassador ali treiki has said the west germans 
did help us not only in this plant in other plants also 
a finance ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
told the ap the offenburg prosecutor had informed bonn of his 
decision to reopen the inquiry into into imhausenchemie but the 
official said the decision was not the result of evidence provided 
by governmentordered audits 
we have said repeatedly that we have found no grounds for 
prosecution the official said the prosecutors in our country 
are free to order investigations independent of the government 
west german law requires firms exporting hazardous materials 
arms or their components to obtain licenses from the economics 
ministry however officials have said the legalities regarding 
transfer of technology or consultation vary from case to case 
the bonn daily newspaper die welt reported in its saturday 
editions that west german intelligence chief hansgeorg wieck told 
kohls office in late september it had uncovered indications of west 
german involvement in the project 
die welt which gave no source for the report in editions 
delivered late friday said imhausenchemies name was not mentioned 
to kohl until oct 18 
were the intelligence warnings ignored die welt headlined

a man prosecutors call the al capone of italy 
claimed friday at a deportation hearing that he was framed for 
crimes in his homeland and faces certain death from mobsters or 
corrupt police if he is deported 
carmine esposito 32 told immigration judge craig zerbe that the 
nuova camorra organizzata a criminal clan similar to the mafia that 
operates in and around naples wanted him to join them but that he 
rebuffed their overtures 
esposito testified that he once was asked to saw off a shotgun 
for a customer of the auto body shop owned by his father in acerra 
italy 
when he refused the customer who allegedly controlled the 
local police force had him harassed by police and eventually 
framed esposito said 
thats why i escaped from my country because this happens 
every day said esposito if he is forced to return to italy he 
added they kill me 
italian authorities charge that he ordered or committed 12 
killings in his homeland from april 1982 through june 1983 esposito 
has not been convicted of those crimes 
an attempt to have him extradited last year failed because the 
charges on which the extradition warrant was based were dropped 
esposito wearing handcuffs testified for an hour friday in a 
small federal hearing room guarded by a sentry with a shotgun 
zerbe said he would issue a written opinion in the case next week 
the judge ruled earlier friday that esposito cannot be deported 
on the basis of weapons convictions in italy because the 
convictions occurred after he was living in the united states 
esposito who moved here in april 1984 still could be deported 
because he entered the country on a fraudulent passport said craig 
oswald a government attorney 
italian courts convicted esposito of associating with criminals 
and of forging license plates for cars engaged in criminal activity 
in addition to the weapons violations 
the murder charges have not gone to trial and warrants that were 
issued for them have expired though the charges still stand oswald 
said 
esposito was arrested almost two years ago and has been 
incarcerated ever since in solitary confinement at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center 
a federal prosecutor at time of the arrest called esposito the 
al capone of italy esposito denied the accusation

replied this is just ridiculous 
the president replied by repeating his criticism of the proposed

you help america find a way out of the trap of the welfare state

john hull an american linked to an 
illegal armssupply network aiding the nicaraguan rebels was being 
held friday under charges of drug trafficking and violating costa 
rican national security his lawyer said 
attorney ciro casas zamora said hull was formally charged in the 
4th federal district court and was being held in the san sebastian 
jail where he will remain until a monday bail hearing 
a source in the office of judicial investigations said on 
condition of anonymity that hull was arrested thursday for 
investigation into charges of drug and weapons trafficking and 
spying for the usbacked contras fighting the nicaraguan 
government 
the office of judicial investigations acted after residents near 
his farm on the nicaraguan border denounced activities by hull that 
were seen as possibly endangering relations between costa rica and 
nicaraguas sandinista government the source said 
hulls lawyer called his clients arrest politically 
motivated and said he plans to appeal 
this is a simple case of political persecution in which the 
government of president oscar arias is trying to defend the 
political interests of the sandinista government and the costa rican 
marxists casas zamora said 
a us embassy official said on condition of anonymity that an 
american consular official was seeking permission to visit hull 
the official dismissed suggestions that the arrest was 
politically motivated contending that the office of judicial 
investigations has an honorable reputation 
all the embassy can do the official said is ensure hull has 
access to a lawyer and that he is treated the same as a costa rican 
citizen 
hull a former indiana resident who is about 69 years old has 
lived in costa rica for 20 years and has said he is a costa rican 
citizen he has acknowledged he supported the contras and has said 
that in the past he let them use his property in los chiles 81 
miles northwest of san jose 
f andy messing who heads the conservative national defense 
foundation in washington said he and rep david dreier rcalif 
met with hull during a factfinding trip to central america last 
month 
he said hull assured them he stopped assisting the contras when 
the irancontra case broke in the case reagan administration 
officials sent arms to iran for money to be sent to the contras 
hull said in 1986 interviews that authorities twice raided his 
home looking for evidence of rumored gun running and drug smuggling 
the searches turned up nothing he said 
hulls wife mariella of patoka ind confirmed that her 
husband was being held the evansville ind courier reported 
friday 
mrs hull would not reveal details about the case but said she 
was informed by telephone that her husband was arrested the 
newspaper said 
witnesses testifying before congress on illegal arms shipments to 
the antisandinista rebels have said hulls ranch was a way station 
for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers 
hull was not among 13 men indicted in september in miami on 
charges of running an illegal arms network for the contras reports 
said hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case 
i would be extremely upset if that were true jack blum 
counsel on the case for the senate foreign relations committee said 
after the indictments witnesses say hull was all over the place 
in this case 
convicted cocaine pilot gary betzner has testified that hull once 
met his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange contra arms 
for colombian cocaine 
hull has denied any connection to drug trafficking 
hull also was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last 
year by two journalists tony avirgan filed the suit with his wife 
martha honey after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the 
defendants 
a us district judge in miami ruled in favor of the defendants 
he ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove that a wideranging 
conspiracy was behind the news conference bombing in nicaragua that 
injured avirgan eight people were killed but the apparent target 
contra leader eden pastora only was wounded

registration and proof that the animal had been spayed or neutered

those who are registered die or are moved out 
if a pup was born after the registration period that pup would 
have to be taken out of the city or disposed of said dr stephen 
joseph the citys health commissioner

leftist guerrillas battling the 
usbacked government vowed on friday to increase attacks in this 
capital city and advised civilians to stay clear of possible 
military targets 
the rebels broadcasting on the clandestine radio farabundo 
marti told street vendors and passersby to avoid the capitals 
military bases and the us embassy the guerrillas consider 
washington the sponsor of what they call the counterinsurgency 
campaign against them 
a 9yearold civil war has killed an estimated 65000 people 
most of them civilians 
urban commandos of the marxistled farabundo marti national 
liberation front increased actions last year bringing what had been 
a primarily rural war to the capital in november and december they 
attacked three major armed forces installations in san salvador 
causing about 40 casualties among military personnel 
two civilians were killed and about 40 wounded in the attacks 
which employed vehicles equipped with explosive charges 
the government considers such attacks terrorist acts but the 
rebels say the vehicles serve as mobile artillery launching 
platforms for rudimentary mortars they say the explosion in the car 
is a charge that catapults the bomb toward the military target 
the explosion of the launching charge destroys the vehicle and 
creates a shock wave that shatters surrounding windows and in some 
cases has killed and wounded passersby 
also friday authorities of the national university said they 
have received death threats and blamed a new death squad that 
announced its formation last month 
bombs exploded thursday night at the homes of the dean and 
assistant dean of the universitys humanities college the bombs

climb he said adding that he is seeking 50000 
garrett said he has only worn the diamondandruby ring three or 
four times and only displays it upon request he claimed hes kept 
in a safe for the past few years 
its just a ring he said when i got it it was good to 
have but theres more to life than a gold band and a diamondyou

someone wholl keep it not bust it up

an unreleased department of energy report 
concludes that a linear accelerator could produce one of the key 
ingredients in nuclear weapons more cheaply quickly and safely than 
new production reactors could 
such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste than 
a nuclear reactor and should be more readily acceptable to the 
public according to a draft summary of the report obtained by the 
associated press on thursday 
the us supply of tritium a radioactive gas used to produce 
nuclear warheads is threatened by the crumbling condition of the 
energy departments existing weapons plants and reactors 
the report prepared by scientists at the brookhaven and los 
alamos national laboratories and at westinghousehanford co in 
washington state concluded that an accelerator could produce enough 
tritium to meet all us weapons needs

on a snowy sunday morning this month two 
youths were buying drugs within a few steps of the embassy of spain 
there was nothing furtive about the deal just money handed over and 
two small packets given in return anybody driving by could have 
seen it 
across the street next to the polish embassy a young woman 
signaled a passing car the car stopped the woman leaned into the 
open window and handed over some money she withdrew a gloved hand 
holding a small package anybody could have watched 
that block just a mile up 16th street from the white house is 
one of the estimated 90 openair drug markets flourishing in the 
capital which last year achieved the distinction of having the 
nations highest murder rate 
washington is a city of contrasts and they never have been more 
stark the news coming out of the capital these days of farewells 
and the fresh expectations which arise with the inauguration of a 
new president competes against news of murder drugs and a mayor 
under a cloud 
things have gotten bad enough for the other washington to begin 
to poke into the consciousness of official prosperous gleaming 
washington 
barely a block from the white house some of the citys homeless 
huddle on heating grates activist mitch snyder estimates there are 
15000 people who live in washington with no homes other than the 
streets and he says several have frozen to death the best 
publicized case was that of jesse carpenter a world war ii veteran 
who died of exposure across the street from the white house in 
lafayette park 
across the street from the domed congress a beggar jangles coins 
in a tin cup and asks passing legislative aides for money 
its the american dream and the american nightmare all rolled 
into one said bj harris a drug education counselor with the 
nonprofit sasha bruce youthworks a youth counseling service named 
in honor of the late daughter of a prominent american diplomat 
statistics provided by the census bureau highlight the disparity 
the district of columbia has the nations second highest per 
capita income after the state of connecticut 20303 annually 
which is 323 percent higher than the national average 
the city has the nations fourth highest per capita education 
level with 28 percent of the population having completed 16 years 
or more of schooling 
yet washingtons infant mortality rate is the highest in the 
country 208 per 1000 births compared to the national average of 
106 according to the childrens defense fund the city has the 
countrys highest tuberculosis case rate 254 per 100000 
according to the centers for disease control 
this city has monoliths of marble attesting to a great 
civilization and yet some of its neighborhoods are like the 
undeveloped third world harris said 
most of the 27 million tourists who come through washington every 
year never see the seamier sides in washington most neighborhoods 
are clearly delineated between the 170000 white minority and the 
458000 blacks and hispanics 
there are many middleclass black neighorhoods and integrated 
neighborhoods with tidy lawns and substantial houses which could 
fit anywhere in america some of the predominantly white areas such 
as green and grassy spring valley or cleveland park with shaded 
streets of elegant victorian homes are as comfortable as any in 
america 
one can stroll down massachusetts avenue past the official 
residence of the vice president past the statute of winston 
churchill past the ornate islamic center where moslems gather to 
worship past dozens of elegant embassies without a moments 
thought of danger 
in fact one can live a lifetime in northwest washington removed 
from the violence and crime that characterize neighborhoods just a 
few miles away 
the lines of race and class are very distinct here said 
harris 
the neighborhood we live in is completely white and its a 
world apart from the crimeridden streets in other parts of the 
city said lauren silva pinto a television producer who lives with 
her husband on a shaded block in northwest washington i feel 
extremely safe here we walk around at night with no problems have 
barbecues visit neighbors 
washington became a mecca for blacks fleeing the segregationist 
south in the first half of this century washington was segregated 
itself until after world war ii but jobs were available for blacks 
who ultimately became the majority group in the capital 
most of the people who work in washington whether for the 
federal government or other employers live in suburbs across the 
potomac river in virginia or across the district line in maryland 
among them are black professionals whose income has risen and who 
chose to migrate away from the citys rundown housing and mediocre 
schools 
this meant that many of the role models for black youths are no 
longer there said jim fyfe chairman of the department of 
justice law and society at american university 
the citys youth who are largely responsible for the sharp 
escalation in the crime rate are victims of alienation and 
hopelessness said fyfe 
those feelings compounded by a 35 percent unemployment rate 
among the citys youth have resulted in a sharp escalation of drug 
consumption and trafficking over the past year some of those picked 
up in police sweeps are as young as 12 
they see the mansions the fancy diplomats cars and they know 
they can never have those things said greg anderson himself a 
former addict and pusher who now works as a researcher for an 
unusual local television program called city under siege 
the nightly 30minute program produced with police help focuses 
on attempts to stem the drug epidemic 
drugs are responsible for washington surpassing detroits murder 
rate in 1988 with a record 371 homicides 4942 per 100000 
compared with 48 in the former murder capital 
police say drugrelated murders account for 60 percent of the 
killings compared to 1986 when they accounted for only onethird 
police officers say many of the killings are the result of turf 
wars for the lucrative crack trade prices of crack the highly 
addictive cocainebased substance which looks like a rock and is 
smoked in a pipe are much higher in washington than elsewhere 
said lt michael raizilowish a small bag of crack which goes for 
50 in new york can sell for up to 100 here he said young dealers 
can easily make 100 or 200 a day 
police are outgunned and outnumbered a highly touted attack on 
drug infested neighborhoods called operation clean sweep led to 
46000 arrests over the past two years but has done little more than 
clog the citys overcrowded jails and court systems the police 
chief said it was a failure it didnt curtail the drug trade for 
more than a moment 
the drug epidemic has undermined the tremendous popularity of 
dc mayor marion barry who has been the subject of two 
investigations into his social ties with suspected drug dealers 
city officials say the drug plague can no longer be tolerated 
we must all make a personal commitment because we all have a 
stake in this war against drugs wrote assistant police chief 
isaac fulwood in an impassioned washington post article 
and he added what happened to our city last year should make 
us all ashamed

she won an academy award for playing the ruthless 
television executive in network and gave unforgettable 
performances as bonnie parker in bonnie and clyde and evelyn 
mulwray in chinatown 
faye dunaways exhaustive preparation and demand for perfection 
have won her admiration but have also caused tension on the set 
jack nicholson her costar in chinatown nicknamed her the 
dreaded dunaway 
but for her latest movie burning secret dunaway drops the 
tempo she plays sonya tuchman the wife of an american diplomat 
stationed in vienna in 1919 the film has a quiet somber feel and 
dunaway plays her part with the same sense of understatement 
you just have to keep it balanced inside the actress said 
its a part of acting your business is the inner character and 
the rest will take care of itself 
this particular character was gently restrained she was very 
much in the period of 1919 very much as it should be she wasnt 
like diane in network 
burning secret also stars klaus maria brandauer mephisto 
and out of africa as the enigmatic baron who romances sonya 
and features 12yearold david eberts in his film debut as sonyas 
sensitive son 
what klaus does is what the best actors do dunaway said 
hes a link he always goes against the grain hes also a very 
great gentleman 
dunaway who has played opposite such seasoned thespians as 
warren beatty and william holden relished the opportunity to work 
with an untrained actor such as eberts 
children have a wonderful thing they dont have to battle 
against artifice dunaway said david is completely genuine 
which is what all of us grownups want to achieve he wasnt like a 
child actor david didnt have that artifice he had a wonderful 
kind of innocence and reality about him 
acting dunaway noted is really a way of staying childlike a 
chance to remain open and adventurous 
i do know that acting is play when you actually are doing it 
its play lets do this now and then this its all very 
spontaneous she said thats very enjoyable because the rest of 
life is far more complicated 
dorothy faye dunaway was born in 1941 in bascom fla she 
attended florida state university and the university of florida 
before transferring to boston universitys school of fine and 
applied arts 
in 1962 her senior year at boston university dunaway was chosen 
to play a lead role in arthur millers the crucible and was 
subsequently recommended for admission to an actors training 
program at the new lincoln center repertory theater 
her time at the lincoln center program led to roles on broadway 
in a man for all seasons and after the fall dunaways 
performance as the unhappy wife in the american place theater 
production of hogans goat caught the attention of talent agent 
joyce selznick and in 1967 led to her film debut in the 
happening 
neither that film nor hurry sundown made much of an impact 
but later that year dunaway earned her first academy award 
nomination when she starred with beatty and gene hackman in bonnie 
and clyde an enormous critical and commercial success 
i think ive been lucky for many of the roles ive played 
dunaway recalled but bonnie was definitely the biggest break for 
me it was the closest to me i felt kind of homefree 
she went on to earn another oscar nomination in 1974 for 
chinatown and was named best actress in 1976 for network 
still fame has had its drawbacks as well she has divorced twice 
from rock star peter wolf and photographer terry oneill and her 
overwrought performance as joan crawford in the 1981 cult classic 
mommie dearest left moviegoers wondering whether the real 
faye dunaway came armed with wire hangers 
i think it was a mistake to do she admitted the 
intentions are there we wanted to make the portrait of a tortured 
woman its an interesting challenge but i dont think it can be 
done people think that youre like that the persona thats created 
by the roles you play are identified with you you have to be 
careful 
dunaways career made few gains after mommie dearest until 
1987 when she won raves as the broken down alcoholic wanda in 
barfly 
i was absolutely searching for a part that would make people 
forget mommie dearest barfly was a gift from mickie rourke 
her costar a gift from god i was deglamorized demystified 
the vulnerability in barfly is close to me but not the 
drinking 
dunaways admirers have included crawford john huston who 
played her father in chinatown and debra winger who sighted 
her performance in mommie dearest as a major influence on her 
own career 
dunaway expressed great respect for patricia neal but stressed 
that her acting style is very much her own 
you can only be yourself you cant emulate other actresses

in israels longest running play the rabbi 
steals the show 
rabbi benjamin levene takes on the roles of an ultraorthodox jew 
whos never heard of television a macho bus driver a bohemian 
painter and a character israelis think of as a typical american 
tourist hes crazy about israel but would never want to live here 
levene developed the oneman show as part of the educational 
program for gesher hebrew for bridge a movement that is trying to 
bring together religious and secular israelis at a time when 
tensions between the two have brought the melting pot society near 
the boiling point 
if we dont understand each other the rest of the world will 
just gobble us up levene recently told 40 secular tel aviv high 
school students at a seminar on jewish identity in jerusalem 
in recent years secular jews who make up about 70 percent of 
israels 42 million population have clashed in the streets courts 
and legislature with observant orthodox jews over sabbath 
observances and other issues 
levene a modern orthodox jew who grew up in jersey city nj 
and moved to israel in 1969 tries to ease tensions by making people 
laugh at and appreciate his parade of stereotypes 
in the past decade he has taken the show to schools collective 
farms and army bases doing as many as four to five shows a week he 
also performs in the united states and soon will take the show to 
los angeles and montreal 
he began a recent performance as an ultraorthodox rabbi dressed 
in black and flicking cigarette ashes in his vest pocket when he 
thinks no one is looking in an exaggerated show of modesty he 
covers his eyes when he hears women are in the room 
the 41yearold levene takes aim at the holierthanthou 
tendencies of some ultraorthodox 
a jewish state theres a state with a lot of jews in it but 
its not a jewish state says his character everyone here acts 
just like gentiles 
as far as hes concerned prayer is much more effective than any 
army could be in defending the jewish people and things would be 
better if people rested on the sabbath as the bible commands 
after a short break in his act levene returns as moti a macho 
bus driver who wears his army dog tags outside his shirt which is 
unbuttoned to his waist moti answers most questions in the brusque 
clipped style he learned in uniform affirmative ditto 
his idea of a religious experience is watching a video of the 
film benhur hes served in every israeli war since 1948 even 
if he was just a cook and he doesnt care what his children do when 
they grow up so long as they dont leave israel 
levenes portrayal attacks motis materialism but appreciates his 
patriotism 
while levene is backstage changing for another character his 
straight man shimon siani takes over and asks the students for 
their impressions the secular teenagers many wearing jeans punk 
haircuts and oversized earrings have mixed feelings 
i like the fact that his family is so important for him and 
that charity is a way of life and mutual help orna gerzner said 
of the ultraorthodox character i guess in the secular community 
weve lost that a bit 
the teenagers comments indicate they are much more conservative 
than the levene character jeanpaul simone a parisborn artist who 
lives in israel with his nonjewish wife and son noel 
simone refused to bear arms in the israeli military he is a 
humanist who believes in justice world peace and the dignity of man 
most of the students pounced one of the teenagers in the 
audience who said he would marry a nonjew 
of course the boy added defensively only if she agreed 
to come live here in israel with me 
one of the funniest characters is the cigarchomping american 
jewish fundraiser everybody knows harry he has a sun visor on his 
forehead a camera around his neck and a bag full of cheap 
souvenirs and hes on his 228th visit to israel 
i know everyone and everyone knows me he says adding 
israel is real lets hear it for la 
harry repeatedly mentions that he gave 45 million to israel 
last year 
although harry is far from modest and prefers his comfortable 
american lifestyle to israels hardships he is a fervent supporter 
of the state and is involved in his hometown jewish community 
several high school students said the show made them rethink some 
of their own stereotyping 
i dont believe in religion at all and i generally dislike 
the ultraorthodox said rika sharir but i think this showed me 
the more sympathetic side of some religious people

malaria the killer disease once 
believed to have been largely eradicated in latin america is making 
a comeback in venezuela 
experts attribute the resurgence to declining standards of living 
due to scarce resources and a booming population 
they estimate that malaria cases in venezuela reached some 40000 
in 1988 up from 11127 in 1984 the last year of accurate records 
kept by the world health organization for the country 
recent venezuelan press accounts have warned of an imminent 
epidemic of malaria sweeping the remote southeast orinoco river 
basin inhabited mainly by indians and gold miners in that area 
alone at least 50 people have died of the disease in recent months 
officials say 
until 1945 malaria was the leading killer in venezuela 
it is transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito of the genus 
anopheles prevalent in tropical regions the mosquito bites only 
between sunset and dawn 
the disease is caused by parasites injected during the mosquitos 
bite the most serious form of malaria causes fever chills 
headache and sometimes shock kidney and liver failure and coma 
there is no known vaccine against malaria although researchers 
are still searching for one 
francisco montbrun venezuelas health minister has made several 
tours to the malariaridden areas and says the nation is facing a 
severe crisis 
he blames the comeback mainly on an influx of gold miners to 
areas in southeastern venezuela that previously were scarcely 
inhabited 
before there was nobody there so we had the disease 
controlled he said now with all the people moving in from who 
knows where theyre getting malaria and there are no controls 
the gold miners leave holes in the ground that are breeding 
places for the mosquito they live in shacks without walls it is 
very hard to carry out control programs 
dr arnaldo gabaldon who is credited with largely eradicating 
the disease in venezuela by 1961 maintained that the resurgence of 
the disease resulted because the government halted ddt spraying 
programs in malariaprone areas in the last decade and failed to 
train personnel in control programs 
theyve gotten lazy the bureacrats would rather sit in their 
airconditioned offices than go out in the field and see what is 
going on under the sun said gabaldon who was given the 
outstanding alumnus award in november by the johns hopkins 
school of hygiene and public health in baltimore for his lifetime 
fight against malaria 
the venezuelan government strapped for funds due to falling oil 
prices and payments of the foreign debt has cut back on public 
services 
the health ministry will run a deficit for 1988 of 55 million 
said health minister montbrun meaning that money for ddt spraying 
and for paying workers in the field has been short 
although banned in the united states and other areas of the 
world ddt still is used in tropical regions to fight malaria 
doctors in the field also blame declining government services for 
the malaria comeback of recent years 
a world health organization report says ddt spraying campaigns 
across latin america have declined drastically falling from 135 
million houses sprayed in 1975 to 55 million in 1982 
it blames recession economic policies of contraction and an 
asymmetrical and nonequitative renegotiation of regional debt as 
causes of a decline in malariacontrol programs 
other causes listed in the report are massive migrations into 
the amazon basin and resistance of vectors anopheles 
mosquitoes to ddt 
malaria cases in neighboring brazil have risen from 51800 in 
1970 to 378257 in 1984 according to the world health organization 
tourism officials maintain travelers to such popular places as 
venezuelas angel falls would not be in danger 
its not necessary to fear malaria says jose haua of haua 
turismo perhaps there is a focus in the goldmining area but 
where we go there is no danger if you want we can give you a pill 
here in the office before the trip 
doctors say that taking certain quininebased and other 
medications during and after trips to malariaridden areas can 
lessen the severity of the disease if it is contracted but not 
prevent it 
other precautionary measures such as the use of repellents and 
mosquitonets at night are usually sufficient they say

jack nicholson who had directed her in goin south had 
suggested her for the role as the smalltown prude in the witches 
of eastwick a part that had been written with an older actress in 
mind her performance was praised but she said it set her career

i wanted to get out on bull durham i was too old susan 
sarandon gets it and shes three years older than i am she

children jessica 7 and jesse 3 veronica said 
the doting aunt pulled out pictures of the kids she said her 
sister works on occasion if its convenient and doesnt take her 
away from her family 
maybe she got saturated when she was a kid i dont know 
cartwright said she was on series for 12 years no im the only 
nut in the family i like to subject myself to torture 
when she played ethel kennedy in robert kennedy and his 
times a cbs miniseries she had to quickly enlist her niece

ronald reagan is a mythical centaur hes 
also rocky a human television set and a warrior in what is billed 
as the first art exhibit to feature a sitting president 
these images of reagan by nearly 40 artists including andy 
warhol and red grooms appear in an exhibit titled reagan 
american icon at bucknell universitys center gallery 
the show featuring works done in the past eight years opened 
jan 14 and will run through march 23 reagan will yield the 
presidency to george bush on jan 20 
its unprecedented that a president has had contemporary 
artists do this many images of him said robert p metzger the 
gallerys director who added that the exhibit was the first of its 
kind for a president still in office 
the reagan interpretations range from flattering to critical but 
metzger was quick to point out the exhibit was put together based on 
the quality of the art not politics 
you dont go out of your way to offend someone with an art 
exhibit but on the other hand art is not docile we do want to 
arouse people we want to make them think he said 
the show includes 
two andy warhol screenprints of reagan in van heusen shirt 
advertisements published during the presidents acting days 
a mock wooden toy by red grooms showing reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev standing on a missile connected to four 
wagon wheels titled nuclear nuts 
a heroic depiction of reagan as a centaur half horse half 
man by the moscowborn artists komar and melamid 
a ceramic image by robert arneson of reagan as a television 
set the presidents smiling face coming out of the screen a wire 
hand as the antenna and a warning on the back do not expose this 
appliance to thought or reason 
a painting by israeliborn artist ori hofmekler titled ronnie 
ii showing reagan as the sylvester stallone movie character rocky 
balboa sporting boxing gloves and shorts and wearing a championship 
belt with the presidential seal on it 
a lifelike portrait of reagan by leon mcfadden with the 
presidents face covered by tiny nearly invisible logos of all of 
the fortune 500 companies 
the show contains two paintings of nancy reagan and one of the 
president and first lady together 
it also has books articles posters photographs buttons 
tshirts and postcards about the reagans culled from metzgers 
personal collection of 50000 books and 50 filing cabinets filled 
with memorabilia about celebrities ranging from marilyn monroe to 
the artist jackson pollock 
metzger said he conceived the idea for the show several years ago 
but did not think enough work with reagan as the subject would exist 
until at least 1991 
to find the work metzger quizzed museum directors talked to 
artists and went to galleries in new york city 
it was just detective work tracking down the material he 
said when i began the search i didnt know there was enough for a 
show i was sort of groping who would have guessed 
metzger who has a doctorate in art history from the university 
of california signed by reagan when he was californias governor 
said the show is historically significant because it is done by 
artists while reagan was still in office 
this will be a show that will be a watershed he said 
theres probably no other show at any other museum devoted to one 
person there just isnt the material 
even though almost all of the images of reagan depict him in his 
role as president it was reagans former life as an actor which 
attracted the artists metzger said 
i do think its this duality of his life its captured the 
imagination of a lot of contemporary artists he said

there is an enormous vested interest these days 
in offering ordinary americans financial advice and it is likely to 
burgeon rather than diminish because it is profitable 
it is made up of diverse practicioners including bankers 
brokers financial planners lending officers mutual funds sales 
people insurance agents direct mail sellers financial 
publications and others with something to peddle 
it is motivated by profit as much as it is by any instinct to 
deliver you from your financial bondage and the message is 
invariably the same 
you must do something immediately about your financial situation 
these are troubled times and the troubles will be yours if you 
dont act now today 
confronted with such a blizzard of advice some of which you 
might have observed is contradictory what must you do 
answer nothing based on the experience of the past your 
chances in doing nothing rather than something might leave you no 
worse off and probably much better off than if you had acted too 
quickly and rashly 
some reminders 
attempting to adjust to every shortterm financial twist can be 
extremely costly experience in the stock market shows that inout 
traders do no better and often far worse than those who stay put 
through good times and bad 
there is a huge difference between investing and trading 
investing is a longterm transaction with a longterm payoff 
trading is an attempt to make shortterm gains it is the livelihood 
of wall street it isnt yours 
you are not incompetent most americans are smart enough to make 
sound financial decisions in spite of what sometimes seems a 
concerted effort to make them feel inadequate to the task 
take it from peter lynch manager of the magellan fund which in 
11 years has gained close to 1900 percent in a soontobe 
published book lynch comments that the ordinary person can do 
better without professional advice 
investing on your own is going to mean ignoring the hot tips 
the recommendations from brokerage houses and the latest cant 
miss suggestions from your favorite newsletter in favor of your own 
research he says 
numerous studies and the experience of many small investors and 
investment clubs adds documentation to his thesis so convinced is 
he of this point of view that he calls professional investing an 
oxymoron contradictory 
the latest urgent advisory about what you should do is likely to 
be followed within a year by still another that experience shows 
will send you off in a different direction altogether 
there are few real experts who advertise their wares publicly 
many who claim expertise also claim credentials that fail to 
withstand examination any adviser can show winners what about the 
losers 
there are no sure things available to the general public 
neither are there secret tax shelters that havent been exposed to 
the public eye certainly no adviser has one that others dont know 
about 
none of this will ever stop financial advice from pouring forth 
of course because it is a product that sells well in a free 
marketplace and that means it is yours to ignore as well as buy

the sinking new years eve of an 
overcrowded tourist boat off rio de janeiro has sparked a nationwide 
outcry against what many brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich 
and powerful and a general disrespect for law 
in public demonstrations brazilians have made the tragedy in 
which 52 passengers and crew died a forum to rail against a 
widespread sense that in brazil people in the right places can get 
away with lawbreaking from running red lights to hiring 
professional killers 
some of the worst vices of the brazilian soul came to light the 
moment the boat sank facility to bribe irresponsibility and the 
failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble the newspaper jornal 
do brasil of rio de janeiro said in an editorial 
there has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the 
bateau mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual 
fireworks display off copacabana beach a widely accepted figure is 
150 
the flatbottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers 
survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in 
rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible 
there are accusations as yet unproved that port authority 
guards who inspected the bateau mouche just two hours before it went 
down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea 
the navy and the police are bickering over which group should 
investigate the sinking there is widespread fear that no one will 
be held responsible as happened so often before here in latin 
americas largest country in highway and maritime tragedies fires 
and collapses of buildings and freeways 
in 1981 for example two riverboat sinkings in amazon waters 
claimed about 500 lives both resulted from overcrowding yet no one 
was ever prosecuted 
the sinking of the bateau mouche is a portrait of our 
reality political commentator alexandre garcia said in a 
syndicated newspaper column we were already irresponsible now we 
are becoming inhuman 
there is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms 
of negligence said evaristo de moraes a lawyer for the owners of 
the bateau mouche we need to look at our mentality which 
believes that laws are always flexible 
de moraes added however that in the case of the boat disaster 
i am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever 
indeed one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters 
that panic among the passengers was the cause of the tragedy 
paulo soares a soninlaw of the bateau mouches 50yearold 
captain camilo da costa who drowned told the ap camilo didnt 
want to go out he called us to say the boat was overloaded and the 
sea was too rough but he had no choice he would lose his job if he 
didnt sail 
brazilians are proud of what they call jeitinho or a 
little way of cutting through red tape avoiding a traffic 
ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with 
selfdefinitions of national character there is a whole 
professional category known as despachantes whose job consists 
basically of paying off the right people 
a recent primetime tv soap opera vale tudo anything goes 
drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed conniving 
corruption and deceit among it principal characters 
but it isnt exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has 
generated a sense of impunity in brazil said deputy justice 
minister luis eichenberg 
this also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and 
material resources he said we often are physically and 
financially unable to enforce the law 
many brazilians are determined that the bateau mouche case not be 
forgotten theater and movie personalities outraged by the 
drowning of the wellknown actress yara amaral along with rio city 
councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand 
that police determine responsibility in the sinking 
brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in 
december of the internationally known ecologist francisco mendes 
who sought to defend the amazons ecology and its poor peasants 
against the interests of powerful landowners many employ private 
gunmen to eliminate enemies 
according to amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization about 1000 peasants ecologists and roman catholic 
priests who defend landless farmers have been killed in land 
disputes in brazil since 1980 only three cases have been 
prosecuted the organization says

profound changes are at work in the american 
midwest sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto steel and 
farming powerhouses for autos the midwest was the place detroit 
the hub chicago and st louis also boasted auto plants now 
japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural largely white 
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for bigcity 
blacks the first story in a fourpart ap extra series the 
changing heartland examines this trend 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with a college campus and fertile fields 
this patch of midamerica is a place where students learn and 
farmers earn side by side but corn country has a new face producing 
a new crop cars 
last fall this tranquil town and its twin city bloomington 
joined a growing number of smaller midwest locales with 
japaneseassociated plants that are shaking up the auto industry 
the increasing japanese presence in americas midsection plants 
in ohio michigan kentucky tennessee one planned for indiana and 
chryslermitsubishi here is creating work and growth in white 
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority 
big cities 
certainly its a restructuring of the auto industry said 
richard hill a michigan state university urban affairs and 
sociology professor the reorganization is definitely 
detrimental to blacks 
the trend has aroused concern in a business thats already lost 
thousands of bluecollar jobs raised questions about potential 
bias and worried blacks whove long regarded the auto industry as 
a steppingstone to a better life 
auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people 
from the lower class to the middle class said joe wilson former 
head of a united auto workers local at a closed detroit plant 
what are you going to do for the people left behind locked up in 
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural 
areas 
japanese automakers whove invested 5 billion in usbased 
facilities in the last decade point to their affirmative action 
programs and insist transportation education and the work ethic 
not race determine location but some academics also claim the 
japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools 
of us autoworkers preferring to train novices 
whatever the reason communities such as bloomingtonnormal 
thriving whitecollar towns that are worlds apart from 
gaspingforsurvival bluecollar cities like detroit are becoming 
motor capitals 
its just a different culture said bloomington mayor jesse 
smart this whole city is like a big neighborhood and with 
modern auto plants being clean its not smokestack anymore its 
compatible with agriculture 
in bloomingtonnormal insurance farming and academia are big 
urban blight crime and unemployment are not 
bloomingtonnormal 4 percent minority had a 41 percent 
unemployment rate in october detroit 65 percent minority had a 
101 percent jobless level 
studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial 
decline in the detroit area 52 percent of black men in heavy 
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984 
according to a study by michigan states hill 
nationwide about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy 
manufacturing jobs in the same period said the study based on 
equal employment opportunity commission reports 
future prospects are even bleaker 
a 1988 study concluded japanese behavior with regard to site 
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the 
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their 
traditional american employers 
the study by university of michigan professors robert cole and 
donald deskins said although they had no concrete evidence they 
believe avoidance of blacks is one factor for the japanese in 
determining plant sites 
i think its a factor deskins said i cant say this is 
their intent 
the study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian 
labor force they represent 172 percent of workers at the big three 
us automakers 
in contrast the study said mazda motor manufacturing usa 
corps plant in flat rock mich has a potential black labor pool 
of 29 percent and honda of america manufacturing inc in 
marysville ohio has one of 105 percent company officials say 
their black workforce is 151 percent and 51 percent respectively 
honda spokesman roger lambert disagreed with the calculations and 
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges 
honda however agreed last march to give 6 million to 377 
blacks and women after an eeoc investigation concluded they should 
have been hired sooner 
the eeoc claimed honda employed discriminatory practices with a 
30mile hiring radius that excluded columbus ohio which has the 
areas largest minority population honda which expanded its hiring 
area before the settlement admitted no wrongdoing 
many japaneseassociated auto plants are close to universities 
and near interstate 75 dubbed auto alley which stretches south 
from michigan 
toyota is in georgetown ky near the university of kentucky 
chryslermitsubishi is in normal home of illinois state university 
while subaruisuzu automotive inc is near lafayette ind across 
the river from purdue 
these towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land lower 
taxes open space and a welleducated work force 
bloomingtonnormal population 87718 was appealing because of 
its good highway and rail systems incentives strong work ethic and 
schools said g glenn gardner former chairman of diamondstar 
motors corp the firm formed by chrysler and mitsubishi 
we needed people with very good communication skills verbal 
written and reading he said some of the major larger cities 
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of 
students 
in tippecanoe county surrounding lafayette one in four people 
25 years and older has four years of college said mark davis 
president of greater lafayette progress inc a nonprofit 
development corporation 
what kind of public education system does detroit have he 
asked what kind of technological capability in terms of college 
graduates does detroit have 
theres no godgiven right big cities should be viewed as the 
automotive centers he said we small towns technologically 
sophisticated centers think we can compete too

they do engaging in fierce bidding wars offering free land and 
water road and sewer improvements employee training funds and tax 
abatements 
chryslermitsubishi received 887 million in state incentives 
alone including 630 acres of farm land 
nobody ever offered us a site in chicago detroit or 
st louis gardner said 
experts also say japanese automakers prefer areas where unions 
arent strong 
theyre afraid wages will be high said michael young 
director of the center for japanese legal studies at columbia 
university theyre afraid unions will create demands that will 
make the company unproductive 
mazda is atypical it is 25 miles from detroit and spokesman 
jim gill said the only wholly owned subsidiary of a japanese 
automaker with uaw affiliation 
if youre going to locate in michigan gill said you best 
be prepared to deal with the uaw 
mazda because of its location also has many former big three 
employees nearly a fourth of its workers 
but vladmir pucik international business professor at the 
university of michigan said the japanese prefer a relatively 
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the japanese way 
of doing things they want to go somewhere so nobody will say at 
ford we did it differently 
gardner conceded chryslermitsubishi sought fresh faces 
we didnt want to have another car plant that would have 20 
years of experience transferred to our plant he said we wanted 
some green people when it comes to building cars 
but he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection 
was utter nonsense and any charge we selected a town to stay 
away from a union is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong 
the plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force 
bloomington mayor smart says the japanese will be happy they 
built here 
when you get into any rural setting people are not afraid to 
put in long hours he said here theres a satisfaction in 
seeing the end result youre just bred that way

us market share 
japanese companies increased their share of the us market 
from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987 
an estimated 208 million japanese imports and 737513 
transplants cars built totally or partly by the japanese at 
us sites were sold in this country last year that accounted for 
266 percent of the 1052 million cars purchased in the united 
states 
imports include cars such as the dodge colt built by mitsubishi 
in japan transplants include products of joint usjapanese 
ventures such as the ford probe built by mazda 
the number of transplant autos built in the united states has 
risen steadily the wefa group an economic consulting organization 
estimates japanese transplants in north america will total 17 
million cars in 1990 compared with 600000 in 1986 
</TEXT>

imports 
japan exported 221 million cars to the united states in the 
1987 fiscal year which ended last march the japanese government 
said shipments in the aprilnovember period were 104 percent below 
those of a year earlier but it still estimates japan will have 
exported 22 million cars to this country when the current fiscal 
year ends in march 
in 1981 japan imposed a voluntary export restraint in response 
to us political pressure it first limited annual exports to the 
united states to 168 million units the cap was increased in steps 
to 23 million units in 1985 it has remained there since 
some japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because 
domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of 
japanese cars driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the 
last three years

japanese investment 
in the 1980s japanese automakers have invested 5 billion in 
us assembly plants for cars and light trucks 
seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with 
partial or total japanese ownership are operating or building plants 
in the united states since 1984 the number of japaneseaffiliated

job loss 
a 1988 gao report said japaneseaffiliated automakers could 
cause the loss of 45000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a 
high displacement rate transplant autos built in lieu of domestic 
cars a production level of 18 million vehicles by those companies 
and 50 percent of the cars parts and materials were made in the 
united states compared with 83 percent for traditional us 
automakers 
but the uaw said the government underestimated the potential job 
loss due to transplants the union said up to 74000 jobs could be 
lost 
the gao estimated a job loss of 360000 from 1985 to 1990 from 
all factors including transplants gains in productivity rising 
auto imports and increased use of foreign parts however the uaw 
estimate was 470000 noting japaneseaffiliated plants have built 
only a third of planned capacity 
from 1985 to 1987 169000 auto manufacturing jobs have 
disappeared that includes workers at the plants as well as those 
employed by industry suppliers

minorities 
in 1984 according to reports filed with the equal employment 
opportunity commission blacks comprised 172 percent of all workers 
employed by the big three automakers and 84 percent of whitecollar 
employees 
blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force 
general motors corp estimated its 1987 payroll for its black 
employees was 3 billion the march 1988 current population survey 
estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 129 million blacks 
was 1788 billion 
so although gms black workers represented just sixtenths 
percent of all black employees they received 17 percent of the

the region was already home to cray research inc and founder 
seymour cray the guru of supercomputers as well as the industrys 
second major us player eta systems inc a subsidiary of control 
data corp 
now joining them is chens supercomputer systems inc they are 
all within 100 miles of each other in northwestern wisconsin and 
southeastern minnesota 
they have followed a path laid down just after world war ii when 
several retired naval intelligence officers founded engineering 
research associates in st paul minn and built codecracking 
computers for the government era was later bought out by univac 
which years later spawned control data 
cray helped start control data then formed his own company in 
1972 
cray research headquartered in minneapolis has a major base 11 
miles from here in chippewa falls cray recently expanded to 
colorado but most of his workers are in the two midwestern states 
cray hired chen who left to start his own firm 16 months ago 
now these neighbor rivals are competing to create a machine faster 
than those that already do billions of calculations a second and 
help design cars forecast weather and aid in weapons research 
theyre both after the fastest gun in the west said peter 
patton a computer consultant in minnesota chens oiling up his 
holster 
having so much brainpower battling to build the worlds biggest 
and best supercomputer in so small a region lends new prominence to 
a part of america probably better known for breweries and bitter 
cold than breakthroughs 
this places minnesota and wisconsin on the international map 
said patton director of technology assessment at the super 
performance computing service of dataquest inc a 
marketingforecasting firm 
it adds prestige its sort of the difference between a 
chevrolet assembly plant in your area and a rolls royce plant 
he said they dont think of us as dairy and flour milling states 
any more 
some predict this industry will have a ripple effect attracting 
parts and supply businesses patton said hundreds of companies in 
the twin cities area such as honeywell and 3m are already involved 
in advanced technology 
some have grander visions the potential is here to develop 
these businesses and offshoots into a minisilicon valley said 
dick hansen president of the first wisconsin national bank of eau 
claire 
but there are big differences between silicon valley and chippewa 
valley 
in california the focus is on microprocessors materials for 
many everyday products 
supercomputers are more elite with only about 350 installed 
worldwide many in government and corporate offices and expensive 
costing 1025 million each patton said 
in terms of dollars this is a very small corner of the total 
computer market said tad pinkerton director of information 
technology at the university of wisconsinmadison even if you 
have 100 machines at 10 milion apiece thats not a lot of money 
some midwesterners also say they dont care to duplicate some 
things about the silicon valley particularly its explosive growth 
wisconsin has a very progressive social environment one which 
is going to move cautiously in things like building pinkerton 
said 
even chens company will grow slowly chen who formed a 
partnership with international business machines corp talks of 
taking four to five years to build his computer employment now 
about 100 isnt expected to reach 1000 until the late 1990s 
despite the wait eau claire population 58000 had few qualms 
about offering chen a 50 million package of grants and federally 
guaranteed loans even though it was 4 million more than the citys 
annual budget 
the city is lending 15 million of the 312 million loan 
package hansens bank is responsible for the rest the deal calls 
for a federal agency to guarantee 25 million in loans which 
havent been approved yet 
despite the risks schatz said this was the chance of a 
lifetime its the first time we seriously played with the big boys 
and went after a nationally known famous person 
eau claire and other cities began wooing chen when he left cray 
in september 1987 after the company canceled his supercomputer 
project saying his proposal was too risky and too costly 
he decided on eau claire in part to avoid moving the 40 cray 
workers hed attracted to his company chen has also opened a 
chinese restaurant in town 
his company has created an influx of new residents who schatz 
said are responsible for raising the average cost of a house to 
105000 up 20000 from 1987 
youre always looking for clean hightech industry schatz 
added they pay high wages it brings an intellect to your 
community with scientists and engineers its an environment people 
like to work in 
that wasnt always the image of this northwestern wisconsin town 
named for its clear waters in the 19th century eau claire was 
whitepine country home to logger barons with 20 sawmills on its 
river banks it was nicknamed sawdust city 
a century later in 1981 an almanac ranked eau claire no 1 in 
america for most taverns per person one for every 629 people 
schatz said being home to one of a handful of supercomputer 
companies in the world will give eau claire new visibility people 
around the nation he said will know who we are now

theyre superswift hightech superstars that can do anything 
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht 
supercomputers are used by the government the military 
universities and fortune 500 companies to help crack codes forecast 
weather design aircraft conduct geological exploration or simulate 
the effects of nuclear explosions 
the supercomputer is important economically and socially 
said peter patton a computer consultant in minnesota theyre 
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime designing 
appliances to developing new lifesaving techniques and 
surgery 
that range he said can help shape americas role in the world 
economy 
the whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the 
international market said patton director of technology 
assessment at the super performance computing service of dataquest 
inc a marketingforecasting firm the key to maintaining that 
competitive advantage is faster design reduced government 
certification time better testing 
the two major us supercomputer companies are cray research inc 
and eta systems inc a subsidiary of control data corp 
its competition three japanese computer giants fujitsu 
hitachi and nec 
there also are about three dozen smaller socalled 
minisupercomputer companies in the united states patton said 
some experts believe the japanese are threatening americas 
dominance of the industry we opened a very large lead and we no 
longer have that large lead patton said 
one of japans main advantages he said is it has the lions 
share of semiconductor computer chips market we gave up on the 
semiconductor industry 
but other experts say its too early to talk of the japanese 
overtaking the united states 
even though cray machines use a lot of japanese components i 
dont think its fair to say theyre ahead in any way shape or 
form said michael burwen president of palo alto management 
group a consulting firm 
there are a lot of people who say the japanese are a very big 
threat to supercomputers he said i dont think the evidence is 
in the japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they 
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business 
about 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide us 
customers include nasa the national cancer institute and los alamos 
national laboratory location of the first cray introduced in 1976 
supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second 
for example a bible concordance an alphabetical referencing by 
word that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid1700s and 
required 1000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a cray 
supercomputer in 20 seconds patton said 
although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is 
it generally is described as the fastest largest most expensive 
machine at any time one that can do problems others cant 
burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private 
industry 37 percent in government installations and 19 percent in 
universities 
nowadays supercomputers are changing industry because products 
can not only be designed and prototyped on screen but be tested 
and evaluated and have complete data performance before you 
touch tool to steel he said 
automakers for one can do a design in six months instead of 
18 months he said you can literally take years off the design 
cycle 
supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for 
autos 
and oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production 
in petroleum exploration 
if they get 1 percent more oil out of a reservoir it pays 
for itself 100 times over patton said what if its a 10 
million computer if you get 20 billion more oil out of a 
reservoir 
among crays customers are americas big three automakers 
volkswagen fiat and petroleum giants such as shell and chevron 
a cray supercomputer also was used to help design stars amp 
stripes the yacht dennis conner sailed in 1987 when he won the 
americas cup two competing syndicates also used cray technology 
said company spokesman john swenson 
scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry 
constantly trying to produce faster machines 
cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next 
and its expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine 
in 199294 he hopes to produce the cray4 1000 times more 
powerful 
and swenson said that wont be the end as he explained we 
still dont see the limit

the indiana shoreline of lake michigan is home to 
the nations steel giants and perhaps no rust belt city better 
typifies a steel town than gary the steel slump of the 80s hit 
hard in gary already struggling with crime decay and a declining 
tax base but steel is making a comeback and gary hopes it can too 
the third story of a fourpart series the changing heartland 
looks at the resurgence in gary and northwestern indiana 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this steel town has long been a fourletter 
word for all thats gone wrong in industrial america a shrinking 
workforce sooty skies a sorry future 
with the citys fate tied to steels fortunes when the industry 
hurts so does gary now that steel is surging this archetypal rust 
belt city says it is on the mend too 
unemployment is down companies are moving in real estate is 
being snatched up more importantly gary is looking beyond steel 
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed 
were on an upturn now said mayor thomas barnes the 
optimism we feel is not because weve resolved the problems that 
exist its because were right now on a track to resolving them 
theres growth as opposed to further decline people are taking 
another look at gary 
they will still find a depressed city shuttered stores gutted 
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store but 
there also is new prosperity due in part to a leaner profitable 
steel industry thats been boosted by increasing demand import 
limits the low dollar and new technology 
after losses of almost 12 billion in 198286 the industry 
nationwide earned 1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that 
for 1988 
that improvement has contributed to an upturn in gary and other 
parts of northwestern indiana site of the worlds greatest 
concentration of steelmaking capacity for example 
five steel companies in porter and lake counties the latter 
including gary have spent more than 25 billion on their 
facilities since 1982 said the indiana steel advisory commission 
indiana is americas no 1 steel producer 22 percent of the 
nations steel is made there the industry pumps almost 20 million 
daily into indianas economy 
unemployment in the garyhammond ind area fell from 157 
percent in 198283 to 95 percent in 1987 the 1987 numbers would 
have been lower but for a sixmonth walkout at uss gary works the 
citys biggest employer and flagship of usx corp 
novembers unemployment rate was 61 percent 1988 was the first 
year this decade without doubledigit employment in any month those 
figures however do not reflect huge population losses the areas 
labor force shrunk by 38100 from 1980 to november 1988 
new and expanding businesses in the gary area have filled 124 
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6500 
jobs since 1984 much of the growth is steelrelated 
gary is one of the best heavy industrial locations in 
america said john gates an investor and redeveloper youre 
close to all the major manufacturers in the united states most of 
these peoples customers are nearby youve got very inexpensive 
rents and real estate costs 
if someone needs steel youre going to be near the biggest and 
cheapest source of supply nationwide added gates who has helped 
24 companies some from west germany and austria expand or settle 
in the area 
the newandimproved status may even be reflected in a 1988 money 
magazine survey that ranked the garyhammond area 41st among 300 
us living spots two slots above considerably more picturesque 
honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier 
that might seem surprising considering garys reputation as 
aging crimeinfested and polluted city planner taghi arshami says 
thats more myth than reality though he concedes garys center 
section with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres is devastated 
the problem we have generally for downtown is lack of 
investment lack of confidence on the part of business and on the 
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down he said 
but he is optimistic about developing garys downtown into a 
public and service sector hub noting that 12000 people work there 
some of garys image problems stem from lean times of the last 
decade jobs and people disappeared unemployment soared garys 
population now about 137000 fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986 
even now experts say growth in northwestern indiana is occurring 
in rural areas 
the mills shrank too while becoming more efficient 
northwestern indiana now has 35300 steelworkers a 47 percent drop 
from 1979 uss gary works has 7500 workers compared with 
2100022000 in the late 1970s 
although mill investments spur related business some say gary is 
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel 
the danger of gary is not that they arent doing fairly well 
said frank cassell professor emeritus of industrial relations at 
northwestern university but theyre likely to delude themselves 
into thinking that what theyre doing is the most powerful 
influence 
instead he said bigger factors are external demand the 
dollar and the nations economy gary is doing good work for 
itself thats commendable he said but one doesnt want to 
think thats the whole picture 
some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of 
diversifying but others point to such changes as the growth of the 
health industry which provides 20400 jobs in the area 
gary is also touting recreation promotional brochures feature 
the indiana dunes and lake michigan photos of children bicycling 
along the beach a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local 
boy who made good michael jackson 
we have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the 
world barnes said we have far from taken full advantage of 
it 
gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious 150200 million 
1400slip marina adjacent to the uss site that could eventually 
include a hotel shopping center and amphitheater officials hope to 
build the first 250 slips this year 
gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the 
chicago area its present airport provides only charter and private 
corporate service 
an expanded airport would relieve congestion at ohare 
international and midway in chicago one report said it would 
attract 65 million passengers to gary annually and create 122000 
jobs with a payroll of 16 billion 
though these projects are critical barnes said the city also has 
a much healthier manner of looking at problems whether its 
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs 
theres already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasnt 
existed in 20 years said bill brown transportation planner for 
the northwestern indiana regional planning commission 
people he said feel a lot more confident about garys 
future

here are some facts about the steel industry provided by the 
american iron and steel institute they represent reports from 25 
companies representing 80 percent of the industry 
profitslosses the nations steel industry is expected to post 
a 1988 profit of about 2 billion in 1987 profits were 102 
billion following losses of almost 12 billion in 198286 
the rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in 
the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand 
shipments domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have 
risen from 767 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in 
1988 an 82 percent increase 
production raw steel production jumped from 892 million tons 
in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 a 12 percent increase 
employment average industry employment in 1988 was 170000 
slightly above the 1987 average of 163000 the lowest since the 
institute started keeping records in 1933 the industry posted a 
recordhigh employment of 650200 in 1953 
imports imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 205 
percent of the steel shipped to consumers compared with 209 
percent in 1987 imports reached a high of 264 percent in 1984 the 
year when the voluntary restraint agreements set a goal of reducing 
imports to 202 percent of the us market the agreement expires 
this year 
state production indiana leads the nation in steel production 
with about 22 percent of the steel made there ohio accounts for 18 
percent and pennsylvania 13 percent

when the farm crisis of the 80s swept 
midamerica it took a heavy toll on iowa folks lost their land 
main streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns 
today however despite 1988s withering drought iowas fortunes 
are reversing the final story in a fourpart series the changing 
heartland looks at the upturn in iowas economy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when dennis keitel returned from a 
life abroad two years ago he yearned to settle on the soil he once 
called home he was ready for iowa but iowa wasnt ready for him 
jobs were scarce so was optimism people were moving out 
merchants were following but over time misery has given way to 
mending 
iowa a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural 
america is on the rebound consider keitel an iowa native who 
returned to a state thousands fled found work where two years ago 
there was none and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied 
i think this place is a gold mine says keitel a 36yearold 
engineer who grew up on an eastern iowa farm 
the iowa economy is coming on strong boasts gov terry 
branstad we know we still have a long way to go but weve come a 
long ways 
unemployment is down revenues are up and theres a sense the 
worst is over some claim a busttoboom assessment is too rosy and 
premature but the declining dollar export opportunities price 
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a 
turnaround consider 
the value of iowa farmland rose 204 percent in 1988 prompting 
the des moines register headline iowa dirt turns to gold again 
the increase reported in an iowa state university study was the 
largest since the mid1970s from 1981 to 1986 land values had 
plummeted 63 percent 
iowas labor force reached an alltime high in october 15 
million people working or seeking jobs unemployment was 35 
percent the lowest since november 1979 in some areas jobs 
outnumber residents mount pleasant has about 5000 people of 
working age but almost 12000 jobs 
iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide tollfree number to lure 
back exiowans who left in search of work 
iowa is expected to have a 180 million budget surplus in the 
1989 and 1990 fiscal years a panel of financial experts said in 
december although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal 
mandates 
one in five iowa farmers has substantial money troubles down 
from one in three in 198485 said neil harl an iowa state 
economics professor 
deere amp co the states largest private employer with 14800 
workers posted record fourthquarter and yearend earnings 
after six years in which iowa lost almost 100000 people the 
census bureau reported last month state population increased by 
11000 from 1987 to 1988 
despite such numbers some say last summers drought will have a 
lingering impact they also worry the states upturn is bypassing 
rural areas where schools have closed young people have departed 
and main street merchants have closed up shop 
we havent turned the corner yet by any means said dave 
ostendorf of prairiefire a rural advocacy group many of the 
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent 
branstad says though that no state enjoys uniform prosperity 
what we want to do is help those areas that arent doing as well to 
help themselves 
the state uses lottery proceeds for instance for economic 
development some of the money going for loans aid to local 
communities or research projects 
already the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm 
equipment industries have helped hardhit bluecollar areas in 
waterloo unemployment fell from 88 percent last january to 43 
percent in november 
people feel weve bottomed out said jim lawrence president 
of the waterloo chamber of commerce 
deere which has a giant local operation has recalled workers a 
leather processing plant recently opened and a new ibp inc hog 
slaughtering plant is being built lawrence said 
in mason city about 1500 new jobs many of them service sector 
and healthrelated will be created in 1989 alone compared with 
about 2000 in the last five years combined said tom jolas an 
economic development consultant to the city 
iowas recovery is due in part to a declining dollar that makes 
grain and other products more competitive on the world market said 
state economist harvey siegelman 
there will be winnebagos going to europe beef to japan and 
deere tractors all over the world he said 
just as critical is iowas effort to reduce its reliance on 
agriculture 
the key to success is diversification branstad said some 
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already 
exists and finding new uses for products 
branstad said iowa has also targeted several industries for 
development telecommunications biotechnology pharmaceuticals and 
insurance des moines already is an insurance capital 
mount pleasant 28 miles from the mississippi river learned to 
diversify decades ago its paid off the towns business roster 
includes such corporate names as motorola cargill and goodyear a 
walmart distribution center opened in 1985 
mount pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker a bulk 
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than las 
vegas and a school bus manufacturer 
we set an example of how we can control our own future said 
glenda griffin the local chambers vice president we appreciate 
the help of the state and federal government but we will not sit 
back and depend on them 
mount pleasant never hit the depths some iowa communities sank to 
in the mid1980s though the county unemployment rate was 81 
percent in 198283 in november it was 25 percent 
in the last six months two motels four stores and a truck stop 
have opened officials say property values rose from 45 million to 
130 million in the last decade retail sales jumped 187 percent 
from march 1986 to march 1988 
mount pleasant has also held onto its young people offering jobs 
involving computers and lasers 
there isnt a small town in the state of iowa that has any more 
sophisticated industry than we have said mayor tom vilsack 
keitel returned from saudia arabia in 1986 ending up as an 
engineer in connecticut when he couldnt find work in iowa last 
fall he found a job in mount pleasant 
iowa still has a lot to offer even with all of its problems 
he said we havent lost our sense of values the quality of life 
still means more than the almighty dollar 
vilsack has another explanation 
we cant do a lot about whats plaguing the smalltown farmer 
weve given families the opportunity to be in control of their own 
lives iowas got to take its destiny in its own hands

kangaroos may soon end up on dinner 
plates in new south wales australias most populous state animal 
welfare groups are hopping mad 
they contend few australians will want to feast on their national 
symbol but that tourists might 
conservationists called the decision disastrous and 
potentially dangerous because kangaroos carry a host of diseases 
paul hogan the comic star of crocodile dundee is luring 
american tourists to sydney but all they are likely to see is a 
bloodbath said sue arnold of australians for animals the 
countrys largest wildlife conservation group 
kangaroos are shot by helicopter poisoned snared and used for 
pet food as well as an export industry now theyre being offered 
for domestic human consumption how can they survive she said in 
an interview 
hogan hailed by the tourist industry for his throw another 
shrimp on the barbie commercials that brought a record 2 million 
visitors to australias bicentennial celebrations in 1988 has a new 
series to be screened in the united states in february 
in the commercial as reported by the sydney morning herald 
hogan says that god had a sense of humor when he desposited in 
australia the famous giant hopping mouse the kangaroo 
tourism minister graham richardson said the commercials are 
expected to contribute to a 20 percent growth in tourism this year 
five million tourists are expected by the year 2000 said bill gray 
manager of the governmentfunded tourism australia 
officials said a decision jan 6 to harvest kangaroos for human 
consumption will not endanger wildlife 
the news south wales health minister peter collins said the 
program is for farming kangaroos not depleting wildlife stocks the 
decision reverses a longstanding ban in new south wales of which 
sydney is the tourist gateway 
kangaroo meat already is consumed in the states of south 
australia and western australia its is described extremely lean 
full of protein and somewhat gamy not unlike venison 
collins said his department would ensure that kangaroo meat is 
safe to eat but arnold and others questioned how the state 
government planned to farm the creatures and maintain a standard 
that makes them fit for consumption 
australias population is 165 million the governments national 
parks amp wildlife service estimates the kangaroo population at about 
15 million an annual culling quota is about 3 million with the 
meat used for pet food and skins turned into such goods as wallets 
and purses for export 
what other country in the world slaughters its national 
symbol said richard jones a member of the new south wales 
parliament who was elected in 1987 on a platform of animal welfare 
arnold said kangaroos carry a range of diseases such as 
salmonella tuberculosis toxoplasmosis and hydatid cysts a worm 
that can be fatal 
farmers regard the kangaroo as a pest the greenpeace and animal 
liberation organizations both supporters of australians for 
animals said the decision represents a victory for the farm lobby 
the canberra times a newspaper in australias capital said the 
kangaroo industry is in chaos 
it said there is compelling evidence of widespread illegal 
shooting and few controls on the transportation of skins and 
carcasses interstate 
only licensed professional shooters are supposed to hunt 
kangaroos but conservationists and others maintain the government 
regulation is loosely enforced 
at the end of the day the only conclusion to be drawn is that 
the government controls on the kangaroo industry are worthless 
the newspaper said in an editorial 
christine townsend spokeswoman for animal liberation called the 
decision a disaster 
it simply commercializes our wildlife she said

ronald reagan leaves the white house with 
shoulders squared as ever his wits and wit undiminished by the 
burdens which sent his recent predecessors into quicker retirement 
and aged some of them almost beyond his years 
the western sun beckons and reagan nearly 78 enters the winter 
of his public life without melancholy even as he claimed with 
shakespeares assistance that his departure evoked such sweet 
sorrow in his heart 
more sweet than sorrow for this political romeo he relinquishes 
his power with relish happily telling his conservative 
revolutionaries in his farewell address thursday that my friends 
we did it 
history will be the judge of that but one reagan success is 
indisputable he stayed the course and leaves the presidency with 
the same charm and equilibrium with which he entered it no man 
especially in the nuclear age has proved so immune to henry adams 
observation long ago that power is poison and that its effect upon 
presidents is inexorably tragic 
reagan is totally comfortable with the fact of leaving and more 
relaxed about it every day says spokesman marlin fitzwater 
hes very satisfied that he has done everything he could do 
reagan in a typically light moment said recently the first item 
on his california agenda with be a long nap come to think of 
it he added things wont be all that much different after 
all a year earlier he observed that its true that hard work 
never killed anybody but i figure why take the chance 
he was in fact an often inattentive president above the usual 
fray operating more by instinct than intellect ever maddening to 
his critics he made an art of sitting things out like the poker 
champion who knows when to walk away from the table when to return 
and bet the ranch 
eight years ago he promised a revolution of ideas for 
america it may take decades to resolve the debate over how much he 
really changed the national course and how much for that matter 
the national interest changed his own ideas but certainly in an 
era of glassjawed politicians he went the distance without 
disabling scar or scorn and set a modern standard for survival 
theres just a hint of gray now on that old irish head and he 
needs a hearing aid in both his ears but nobody has aged less in 
the presidency even in simpler times which is all the more 
remarkable considering he was the oldest man ever to enter it that 
he was nearly mortally shot that first year that he needed 
surgeries major and minor for cancer 
or that his administration suffered failures and embarrassments 
that surely would have undone other presidents a staggering 
national debt the loss of hundreds of americans in lebanon the 
bizarre sale of arms to iran and the diversion of the profits to 
rebels in central america the criminal convictions of close aides 
and a pervasive sleaze quotient through the years colossal 
slips of the tongue and manglings of fact and the worst stock 
market crash in six decades 
through all of that the irancontra affair opened the only crack 
in his famed teflon veneer triggering an overnight 20percent drop 
in his popularity rating but even as the armsforhostages deal 
knocked him back on his heels it was not as diagnosed by some 
democrats an achilles rupture as usual ronald reagan bounced back 
he had many triumphs and made good on much of his agenda mostly 
on domestic policy the first term and foreign policy the second he 
lowered taxes radically altered the manner in which they are 
levied improved the national defense and raised the national 
spirit he relentlessly pushed the country through two painful years 
of high unemployment and recession that led to an unprecedented six 
straight years of recovery and growth lowering inflation from 13 
percent in 1980 to about 4 percent today unemployment fell by half 
to just over 5 percent 
his foreign policy produced a surprising number of successes 
foremost among them in reagans words we have the past few 
years forged a satisfying new closeness with the soviet union 
some of that doubtlessly is more reagans irish luck than his 
doing richard nixon gerald ford and jimmy carter after all 
didnt have mikhail gorbachev to deal with 
but reagan still had his own hands to play despite european 
resistance he deployed pershing ii missiles aimed at the soviet 
union and ignoring domestic pleas for a nuclear freeze stuck 
with his zerooption plan for intermediate nuclear weapons for 
six years it paid off the inf treaty eventually signed the first 
ever to reduce nuclear arsenals was entirely on his terms 
he sent arms to the afghan rebels and the soviets are finally 
leaving afghanistan he sent the navy to the persian gulf and iran 
and iraq called off their long hideous war many believe his 
measured use of us firepower especially against moammar gadhafys 
libya contributed to a decline in international terrorism his 
administration also helped end or temper regional conflicts in 
africa and southeast asia 
the results werent so rewarding in central america and 
americans are still held hostage in lebanon but reagan portrayed 
by his opponents in 1980 as a triggerhappy cowboy leaves with a 
remarkable record for statesmanship 
his presidency produced many contradictions he campaigned on a 
promise to abolish two cabinet departments energy and education 
and wound up instead adding one veterans affairs he put 
conservatives in the nations courts but his revolution barely 
disturbed local electorates and congress remained in democratic 
hands 
he promised to balance the budget and to this day blames 
congress that it wasnt done but he never even proposed a budget 
that cae close instead the national debt soared from 900 billion 
to over 26 trillion while he was in office a painful tax against 
the nations and george bushs future 
for all his talk about a safety net for the nations poor and 
disadvantaged more families live below the poverty line now than 
when he took office similarly he offered more rhetoric than remedy 
for the nations drug crisis 
to the consternation of even some republican allies in congress 
he often governed more by anecdote than analysis stubbornly 
clinging to notions that had no foundation in fact he once 
asserted in an antiabortion speech that babies have been born 
after just three months of pregnancy and have lived the record 
shows to grow up and be normal but the white house could produce 
no such record and the american college of obstetrics and 
gynecology said there was no solid evidence that fetuses less than 
six months old can survive

reagan repeatedly told the story of the woman who bought an 
orange with her food stamps then spent the change on a bottle of 
vodka she couldnt be found either change from food stamps 
incidentally is limited to 99 cents 
to illustrate the evils of school busing for racial balance he 
had a tale about how the daughter of the very woman who brought the 
landmark 1954 school desegregation suit now had to be bused miles 
from her home to attend class but kim smith daughter of linda 
brown smith went to school two blocks from her home in topeka kan 
whats more topeka didnt have school busing for racial balance 
reagan had lots of those remember the killer trees 
sometimes he tripped over his own tongue as well as the facts 
president samuel doe of liberia became chairman moe and an open 
microphone caught him more than once in hip shots like all right 
my fellow americans i am pleased to tell you today that i have 
signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever we begin bombing 
in five minutes 
not everybody thought these things funny but reagan the great 
communicator usually got away unscathed and unfazed in part 
doubtlessly it was because he had such an infectious ability to 
disarm his critics by laughing at himself and nobody deprecated 
reagan like reagan 
before the discovery launch last year he was asked if hed like 
to go into space ive been there for several years he 
deadpanned 
that kind of humor and modesty went a long way to stir a nations 
perception of reagan as at once a normal man and a very special one 
america laughed with him trusted him admired his schoolboy 
optimism and it forgave his indiscretions as family mischief 
educator and management consultant eugene jennings wrote in 
anatomy of power that great leaders in bearing and behavior 
make a distinction between authority and power and reagan never 
appears as an authority figure 
two other keys to reagans success jennings said were his 
ability to communicate his sense of values and his willingness to 
limit priorities while lyndon johnson and jimmy carter inundated 
congress and the public he noted reagan called forth one issue at 
a time never scattering his shot 
dwight david eisenhower was the last president to serve two full 
terms but he left tired and with his successor john f kennedy 
having campaigned on a promise to get america moving again 
reagan came along at a time when it appeared the national mood 
would hold any president to a single term the presidency had been 
weakened by the overlapping traumas of vietnam and watergate and 
while gerald ford and carter restored the integrity of the office 
the country remained wearied as it confronted the frustrations of an 
energy crisis runaway inflation and the the hostagetaking of 
americans in iran 
carter in an illadvised speech that sounded his own political 
epitaph complained of a national malaise in which americans 
suffered a crisis of confidence by the time the voters turned 
him out after four years jimmy carter had aged 10 it seemed that 
way with johnson and nixon too 
ronald reagan will be 78 on feb 6 but he looks and acts 
remarkably like the man who arrived in washington eight years ago 
full of exuberance his waistline may have expanded an inch but not 
much more has swelled he arrived with a size 7 hat it still fits 
and thats a major reason why the nation remains so fond of him

as anyone knows who has been outdoors on a 
windy winter day moving air can seem to go right through layer 
after layer of clothing chilling a person to the bone 
and that wind chill is more than just a nasty sensation or a 
number provided by the local weathercaster it can be a serious 
hazard at this time of year 
those especially vulnerable to the dangers of cold are the very 
young and the very old medical experts point out but virtually 
anyone can become a victim of hypothermia or extreme cooling of the 
body 
the wind chill exists all the time of course consider the 
pleasant summer day when it suddenly seems cold after emerging from 
a swimming pool 
thats wind chill at work too but its not much of a hazard then 
come this time of year the wind can whisk away body heat faster 
than you can say jack frost leaving you shivering or worse 
the reason is the bodys own cooling mechanism depends on 
evaporation of moisture a process that is very effective in 
removing heat 
moving air carries away molecules of evaporated water and the air 
that the body has warmed more water then evaporates into the dry 
air which the body has to heat the result is that the process 
makes the body even cooler 
and that in reality is the problem 
the wind doesnt make it colder it carries away heat to make it 
cold faster 
if the air is at 20 degrees fahrenheit and the wind is 20 miles 
per hour the windchill is minus 10 degrees 
people unfortunately exposed to these conditions wont actually 
cool down to minus 10 at the worst they will stop cooling at 20 
degrees when they reach the air temperatrure 
but they will get there faster cooling at the same rate as if 
the temperature were minus 10 
so what this all means is listen to the latest weather reports 
before leaving the house and dress for the weather layers of 
clothing are more effective than one or two thick garments 
since more than half of the heat produced by the body can be lost 
through the head and neck a cap or hat is vital in winter the 
center for environmental physiology points out 
trapped air is the key to insulation and there are several ways 
to do this animals use fur birds opt for feathers 
people can manage the same effect with layers of warm clothing 
especially wool and down garments which trap air in layers 
cold puts extreme stress on the body which can prove deadly to 
people with heart of lung disease and to those whose bodies have 
poor heat regulation systems the very young and very old 
especially 
the ill elderly can suffer at temperatures as high as 60 degrees 
according to physicians who urge that friends and family keep track 
of the old and ill at this time of year 
signs of hypothermia include changes in a persons appearance or 
behavior uncontrollable shivering or total lack of shivering when 
it would be expected stiff muscles slow or irregular heartbeat 
slurred speech weak pulse confusion drowsiness and a drop in body 
temperature 
victims of hypothermia need rewarming and medical attention the 
department of health and human services stresses 
while waiting for emergency medical help hhs experts say 
prevent further heat loss by wrapping the victim in a warm blanket 
hot water bottles or a warm heating pad not hot can help if 
placed on the victims abdomen 
if the victim is alert small quantities of food and drink can 
help but never give alcoholic beverages 
warming can also be accomplished by lying close to the victim and 
using ones body heat to warm them but do not handle the victim too 
roughly rubbing for example can make things worse the hhs 
experts warn 
besides the elderly infants are in danger of hypothermia because 
their body heating systems may not yet be fully developed 
thus parents and other adults need to pay close attention to the 
warmth of tots make sure they wear a cap limit a babys time 
outdoors and keep them as dry as possible since moisture carries 
off heat quickly

twenty years ago this month a huge 
oil spill in santa barbara calif helped launch the environmental 
movement with wrenching images of blackened beaches and lifeless 
oilsoaked birds 
this past week along the rugged washington coast it appeared 
that despite 20 years of progress in environmental protection some 
things havent changed 
its horrible said clifford perry 44 a volunteer at a 
makeshift dirty bird hospital set up in this tourist towns 
convention center to treat thousands of birds mired in a dec 22 oil 
spill 
imagine going into a grocery store and suddenly seeing oil over 
all the food then going outside and finding oil on your car on 
your house everything perry said thursday scrubbing a terrified 
seabird in a pan of soapy water thats how it is for these 
animals 
it was this kind of scene that environmentalists hoped to prevent 
when they rallied together after the jan 28 1969 blowout of an 
offshore union oil co well in the santa barbara channel 
that accident spread an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil 
along 150 miles of the southern california coast globs of tar 
blackened rocky cliffs and sandy beaches greasy mist coated 
beachside mansions at least 3600 birds died even as volunteers 
worked around the clock to wash the oil from their feathers 
disgust and anger translated quickly into political action 
spearheaded by a santa barbara group called get oil out better 
known as goo 
environmental awareness soon became politically fashionable and 
the 1970s produced a raft of legislation tightening safety 
procedures required of oil producers and transporters the 
environmental protection agency was born and the coast guard was 
ordered to beef up inspections of oil tankers and barges 
oil interests and environmentalists agree that technological 
advances of the past two decades also have made the oil industry 
safer 
yet oil spills remain as much a fact of life as they were 20 
years ago some 10000 to 15000 spills into us waters are 
reported every year during transportation and storage of oil coast 
guard officials say offshore drilling contributes 1300 to 1500 
more spills a year 
the vast majority of spills are small sometimes no more than a 
gallon or two but major spills are still a regular occurrence 
1988 was a particularly bad year 
on jan 2 a storage tank collapsed upstream of pittsburgh pa 
spilling 1 million gallons of diesel fuel into the monongahela river 
and affecting water supplies in three states 
in april 365000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a refinery in 
martinez calif 
in july a tanker crashed into a mooring structure in corpus 
christi texas spilling 630000 gallons of crude oil 
in september a mississippi river tanker scraped bottom and 
spilled 1 million gallons of heavy oil 
finally on dec 22 a tugboat tore a gash in the barge it was 
towing in rough seas off grays harbor wash spilling up to 231000 
gallons of heavy oil storms and strong currents spread the oil 
along 300 miles of coastline the worst damage was along some of the 
northwests most pristine beaches in washingtons olympic national 
park and british columbias pacific rim national park 
about 6000 birds have died 3000 more were spotted floundering 
along beaches and were taken to rescue centers like the one at ocean 
shores the painstaking bird cleanup may not be finished until the 
end of this month and officials said theyll consider themselves 
lucky if half the cleaned birds survive 
like the 1969 santa barbara spill the washington accident 
promises to provide ammunition for foes of oil development 
washington gov booth gardner toured the ocean shores bird 
hospital and vowed to continue fighting oil exploration that the 
interior department is planning for federal waters off the states 
olympic peninsula 
environmentalists in washington oregon and california said the 
spill will bolster their efforts to keep offshore drilling at bay 
they also want the coast guard to tighten its inspections of oil 
transporters and they are lobbying for better methods of assessing 
the ecological damage of oil spills 
this spill has certainly brought home to people that we cant 
wait for things to happen we have to get involved now said david 
ortman northwest representative of friends of the earth 
but an industry spokesman said those who would prevent oil spills 
should not oppose offshore drilling less offshore development will 
mean greater reliance on tankerdelivered foreign oil which has a 
much higher record of spills said mike fergus spokesman for the 
western states petroleum association 
offshore oil drilling has an excellent safety record he said 
between 1980 and 1987 us offshore oil platforms spilled a total 
of 291 barrels of oil while producing about 453 million barrels of 
crude oil he said a standard barrel of crude oil contains 42 us 
gallons 
to say no more oil development offshore is not reasonable 
given the demand that this country has for oil fergus said 
and so the arguments rage on as they have for 20 years in santa 
barbara goo still exists so does the goo several barrels a day 
of crude still bubble up from the ocean floor near the well that 
blew out in 1969 this seepage is not counted in the spill figures 
quoted by fergus 
goo didnt get the oil industry out but the group claims it 
helped limit the growth of drilling and forced safety precautions 
that otherwise would not have been taken 
in 1969 10 oil platforms dotted the the santa barbara channel 
today there are 22 with applications pending for at least six more 
without citizen action we suspect there would be two to three 
times as many platforms as there are now said robert hopps 
president of goo 
the environmental movement has changed a lot in 20 years a lot 
of our membership has died off literally hopps said 
but now as then the sight of an oily bird strikes something 
deep with the american conscience last weekend 1000 people 
reported to the ocean shores bird hospital to ask if they were 
needed 
we all use oil said volunteer perry still clutching the 
oilsoaked bird i guess we have to pay the price for it

the treasury department has taken under 
advisement a customs service decision to classify imported sport 
utility vehicles like the suzuki samurai and most small vans as 
trucks subjecting them to duty rates 10 times higher than those for 
cars an agency spokesman said thursday night 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said the department 
decided thursday to review the ruling will assess the case and make 
a legal decision 
last week deputy customs commissioner michael lane said that in 
the past these vehicles sometimes had been classified as cars upon 
which a 25 percent duty is imposed and at other times as trucks 
subject to a 25 percent duty 
the deciding factor often was whether the vehicles were fitted 
with back seats and other amenities 
lane said auto industry officials have estimated the ruling could 
affect 100000 to 250000 or more vehicles many of which would be 
switched from the car to truck category and could net the government 
hundred of millions of dollars in higher tariffs

drexel burnham lambert inc trying to cleanse 
its dirtied image from the wall street insider trading scandal has 
offered top jobs to two exchairmen of the securities and exchange 
commission including the one who first authorized a probe that led 
to the financial giants current problems 
john s r shad who headed the sec from 1981 to 1987 and now is 
envoy to the netherlands confirmed thursday through a spokesman at 
the us embassy there that he had been approached by drexel about 
becoming chairman but he did not say whether he would accept 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm also asked another 
exsec chairman roderick m hills husband of us trade 
representativedesignate carla hills about the possibility of 
serving on its board of directors 
hills who ran the sec from 197577 and is now an independent 
trade consultant in washington also confirmed drexel had approached 
him but declined to comment further 
it was under shads auspices that the sec began a major 
investigation of drexel in late 1986 which resulted in a massive 
civil enforcement action in september and a record securitiesfraud 
plea deal between the firm and the justice department reached last 
month but still not finalized 
shad ordered the drexel probe after the firm was implicated in 
extensive wrongdoing by ivan f boesky the speculator and inside 
trader now serving a threeyear prison term 
the firms objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the 
problems and opportunities it faces and to continue to make an 
important contribution to the nations capital markets drexel 
said in a brief statement thursday disclosing the job offers to shad 
and hills 
the firm continues to enjoy the loyalty and support of the vast 
majority of its employees and investment banking institutional and 
retail clients after the settlement the firms 2 billion of 
capital will remain among the largest in the securities industry and 
will be more than adequate to finance its future growth the 
statement said 
the invitations extended by drexel were disclosed as the firm 
continued to negotiate with the government over final details of its 
securities fraud plea bargain settlement 
under that accord drexel must pay a record 650 million in fines 
and restitution plead guilty to six unspecified felonies settle 
related civil litigation with the sec and agree to cooperate in the 
governments expanding campaign against wall street corruption 
shad is credited with toughening the agencys enforcement efforts 
to reduce insider trading and other abuses on wall street and is a 
leading proponent of strengthening business ethics in general 
independently wealthy with an extensive background on wall 
street shad resigned the sec post in 1987 after a sixyear tenure 
to accept the ambassador position 
if shad were to accept a drexel job he would replace robert 
linton who has long been expected to retire 
it would mark an ironic twist not only in the legal ordeal of the 
investment firm but also for drexels chief executive officer 
frederick joseph who was once hired by shad 20 years ago when shad 
ran the nowdefunct investment firm ef hutton amp co 
word that shad and hills had been approached came a day after 
drexel said it and former sen howard baker had agreed to end talks 
about a possible role for him in the firms senior management 
baker a prominent republican lawyer former tennessee senator 
and onetime white house chief of staff under president reagan had 
been negotiating with drexel since november about assuming a senior 
position 
there was no explanation for why talks ended but people familiar 
with the talks said there was disagreement over how much management 
control would be exercised by baker who has no background in wall 
street investment banking

sixteen us electronics companies have agreed to 
study the feasibility of creating a corporate partnership that would 
develop the next generation of televisions a trade group says 
the partnership would be a potentially profitmaking organization 
that would work with the federal government on research leading to 
the manufacture of highdefinition tv sets the american electronics 
association said thursday 
the partnership might even do its own manufacturing of 
components such as picture tubes spokesman john hatch said 
the trade group argues that the united states cannot afford to be 
left behind by the japanese in the next generation of bright sharp 
televisions which will be packed with sophisticated electronics 
given the unlikelihood of an individual us company risking 
entering this evolving new market the action is a logical and 
practical next step for the industry pat hill hubbard the 
groups vice president for science and technology policy said in a 
statement 
some analysts have expressed skepticism about the potential for 
success of such a partnership and some of the companies that agreed 
to do the feasibility study said they were not necessarily committed 
to participating in a partnership 
john taylor a spokesman for zenith electronics corp the last 
major us television manufacturer said in terms of overall 
support we rate this as third or fourth in importance 
acknowledging the obstacles ms hubbard said in an interview 
theres not been a soul whos encouraged me personally or aea in 
general on doing this theres been nothing but naysayers 
asked if she was optimistic about the chances for a partnership 
she said optimistic is too elevated a word this is a logical 
next step 
companies funding development of a business plan for the proposed 
venture are hewlettpackard co varian associates cohu inc 
digital equipment corp itt corp prometrix corp pco inc 
zenith international business machines corp apple computer inc 
tektronix inc raychem corp motorola inc texas instruments

public service co of new hampshire 
forced into bankruptcy court by debts from the stalled seabrook 
nuclear power plant is pondering a bid from northeast utilities 
that values the struggling psnh at nearly 2 billion 
psnhs initial reaction thursday to the bid from new englands 
largest power company was positive 
we are glad to see that northeast utilities a serious 
qualified bidder has valued psnh company of new hampshire at a 
level it describes as in excess of 2 billion psnh president john 
duffett said in a statement 
duffett said the psnh board would consider the offer which must 
also be approved by federal and state regulators and psnhs 
creditors 
under the northeast utilities proposal psnhs 36 percent share 
of seabrook would be spun off into a separate company to be owned by 
psnhs unsecured creditors 
northeast utilities pledged to buy seabrook power through a 
subsidiary which would be a new hampshirebased utility owning 
psnhs assets other than seabrook northeast utilities officials 
said 
northeast utilities said it would pay 12 billion for the 
nonseabrook assets the company valued the pledge to buy seabrook 
power at 750 million making the total deal worth nearly 2 billion 
psnh has said about 10 companies have expressed interest in 
acquiring all or part of the utility including new england electric 
system a pairing of central maine power co and central vermont 
psnh co and new hampshire electric cooperative 
a new england electric spokeswoman said officials would not 
comment on the northeast utilities proposal before reviewing it in 
detail comment was not immediately obtained from any other possible 
bidders 
seabrook a 58 billion 1150megawatt plant finished in 1986 
remains idle for lack of a federal operating license psnh went into 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last 
year after state courts refused to allow the utility to pass on the 
costs of seabrook to ratepayers 
psnh is the biggest stakeholder in seabrook northeast utilities 
owns 4 percent of the plant 
psnh its creditors and the state are negotiating a financial 
restructuring of the utility but the talks have been punctuated by 
harsh rhetoric and charges of bad faith 
in his statement thursday duffet criticized state officials for 
failing to recognize a value anywhere near the range proposed by 
northeast utilities 
northeast utilities officials said their proposed buyout would 
provide psnh with an opportunity to speedily resolve virtually all 
outstanding issues in the reorganization 
northeast utilities president william ellis said the state and 
psnh are now far apart on reaching a settlement with the 
utility wanting more money to settle up with creditors and the state 
refusing to agree to the high rates being proposed by creditors 
we firmly believe we can be the catalyst to bring 
ratepayers and creditors together ellis said 
ellis urged psnh to incorporate the proposal into its own 
bankruptcy reorganization plan if psnh declines northeast 
utilities will press its case with psnhs creditors and new 
hampshire officials ellis said 
northeast utilities based in hartford conn serves more than 1 
million customers in connecticut and 185000 customers in 
massachusetts through subsidiaries the connecticut light and power 
co and western massachusetts electric co 
the companys electricity sales in the past year were more than 
2 billion compared with psnhs sales of under 600 million 
the northeast utilities offer provides more money than had been 
previously available for stockholders and creditors and protects 
psnhs ratepayers from huge increases 
under the proposal firstmortgage and general and refunding 
mortgage bondholders who have been receiving interest since psnh 
filed for bankruptcy would recover their full principal about 
440 million ellis said 
thirdmortgage bondholders would receive all of their principal 
just over 400 million but substantially less than the total 
interest that has accrued 
steven davis president of consolidated utilities and 
communications inc a substantial thirdmortgage bondholders group 
said thursday it was too early to comment on the proposal however 
he said his groups position has been that as secured creditors 
you deserve 100 percent of capital and accrued interest 
the unsecured creditors who would hold the seabrook assets would 
receive about 70 million in cash from northeast utilities and 75 
million in preferred stock from the northeast utilities subsidiary 
northeast utilities would also pay them 165 million to pay for 
seabrook until it wins an operating license

a federal official investigating more than 
220 million in losses from alleged fraud at savings and loans says 
much of the crisis in the nations thrifts can be traced to a new 
breed of owner 
often they were real estate developers who took over a small 
thrift a move that provided them with a ready source of cash to 
fund their projects james cirona president of the federal home 
loan bank of san francisco said in testimony to be given today to a 
congressional committee 
cirona was appearing for a second day before members of the house 
banking finance and urban affairs committee at a hearing into the 
troubled thrift industry which saw a postdepression record 217 
insolvent institutions last year 
on thursday cirona whose district includes california nevada 
and arizona delivered a halfinch thick statement that said since 
august of 1987 his investigators had referred 5384 cases of 
possible fraud or abuse to the us attorneys office 
many of the cases involve rather small amounts obtained 
fraudulently by borrowers or depositors he said 
however we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders 
which may often involve very large sums of money for this reason we 
have established a special system of priority referrals that 
involves insiders or amounts in excess of 100000 
we estimate that losses on these priority referrals as of 
sept 23 1988 amounted to over 220 million 
the new breed of savings and loan owner who entered the field 
following deregulation in 1982 could find an auditor that would 
allow a thrift to guarantee a profit by investing in acquisition 
developments and construction loans cirona said in todays 
prepared testimony 
others testifying on thursday included herbert sandler chairman 
and chief executive officer of world savings and loan association a 
successful oakland thrift that sandler said deals only in 
residential loans 
he said the savings and loan crisis was the greatest financial 
scandal in history in which in excess of 100 billion has been 
wasted and lost 
the problems could have been avoided if the fundamentals of the 
thrift industry dealing only in residential loans had been 
followed he said 
sandler called efforts at deregulation of the industry bungled 
and that regulators had been repeatedly warned 
i could tell you stories that would make your hair curl he 
said bringing laughter from the nearlypacked hearing room and from 
committee chairman henry gonzalez who ran his hand over his bald 
pate 
gonzalez dtexas earlier told his own horror stories of failed 
thrifts recalling a couple who lost 50000 saved for their 
childrens education 
it would tear your heart out to hear such stories said 
gonzalez 
gonzalez called for a full analysis of the crisis in the savings 
and loans institutions where government bailouts exceeded 38 
billion in 1988 alone 
the hearing was needed to clean up the mess that is already out 
there he said adding that more hearings would be held in other 
cities

allegheny international inc has asked a 
federal bankruptcy judge for permission to sell its keystone 
ostersunbeam division to black amp decker corp as part of a plan 
management will devise to reorganize the troubled consumer products 
company 
creditors however asked us bankruptcy judge joseph cosetti 
thursday for permission to file their own plan to reorganize 
allegheny international which has been operating under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy code for nearly a year 
at a hearing before cosetti unsecured creditors lashed out at 
management for the rejection wednesday of a merger agreement with 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
this debtor is inept it has no credibility said robert 
sable representing allegheny internationals unsecured creditors 
lawyers representing unsecured creditors literally stood in line 
to tell cosetti they had no faith in the allegheny international 
boards ability to find an acceptable reorganization plan 
allegheny international asked cosetti to allow the firm to sell 
ostersunbeam a maker of irons shavers and other small appliances 
to black amp decker for 260 million 
in conjunction with that proposal management said it has entered 
an agreement under which its recent adversary spear leeds amp 
kellog would help finance the management reorganization plan the 
new york firm had been battling the board as head of a shareholders 
committee 
the board rejected the donaldson lufkin amp jenrette deal because 
the securities firm struck a private bargain with a rival bidder 
the paul s levy banker group to carve up the company between them 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette planned to sell the lawn furniture 
and gas grill business to levy for 250 million and keep the rest of 
the company including the ostersunbeam division 
the board also objected to donaldson lufkin amp jenrette altering 
its takeover proposal by lowering its common equity contribution to 
the reorganized company by 30 million 
allegheny international said it would ask the bankruptcy court 
for sanctions against donaldson lufkin amp jenrette and the levy 
group 
the board announced a tentative merger agreement with donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette last november after the major creditor groups 
scuttled an earlier management reorganization plan and forced the 
board to offer the company for sale 
cosetti deferred ruling on any of the requests he had set 
thursday as a deadline for management to choose among the bidders 
reorganization plans 
managements sole right to submit a plan expires today 
it was not immediately clear what antitrust considerations might 
be raised by the merger of the sunbeamoster division and black amp 
decker 
allegheny international would use the proceeds of the 
ostersunbeam sale to reduce debt and emerge with a company with 
about 500 million in annual sales from its remaining businesses 
which include gas grills lawn furniture weather instruments 
electric blankets and scales 
black amp decker based in towson md manufactures and sells 
power tools accessories household appliances and lawn care 
equipment

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan says 
the technological advances that have spurred changes in the world 
economy this decade are starting to be felt in poorer nations 
some heavily indebted nations for example mexico argentina 
and brazil are beginning to show signs of economic vitality 
greenspan said late thursday in a speech at the federal reserve bank 
of atlanta 
we obviously still have very significant problems with the 
debtor nations and their economic structure 
but greenspan said the nations are going through profound changes 
that make him optimistic that economic improvement may be 
forthcoming 
greenspan said that technological advances which have 
downsized the goods produced by industrial nations and vastly 
improved communications have put pressure on governments to open up 
their societies and economies 
he said that perestroika the name for soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs economic reform program is a worldwide 
phenomenon and is evidence that centrally controlled economies as 
part of oppressive government leadership are becoming a thing of the 
past 
if we could resolve the debt problem which were beginning to 
get some handle on then i think were going to find a really major 
renewal of economic capabilities in a number of these countries 
which have been under such terribly difficult pressure in recent 
years he said

six traders have been suspended from conducting 
transactions at the chicago board of trade and fined thousands of 
dollars each for engaging in fraudulent practices 
cbot disciplinary authorities found all six had engaged in a 
scheme involving a trader who wore a wig and fake identification to 
conduct transactions cbot officials announced thursday 
the traders were linked through federal court testimony last 
summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader thompson b 
sanders who was sentenced in november to six years in prison 
the disciplinary action imposed dec 16 but announced this week 
followed revelations by prosecutors in the sanders probe 
the suspensions ranged from 15 days to 10 years and fines were 
between 5000 and 50000 each 
investigators found all six engaged in fraud and dishonorable 
and dishonest conduct and reckless and unbusinesslike dealings 
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade 
sanders 45 was found guilty of setting up the scheme in which 
daniel dewey another former trader donned a wig and used stolen 
trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area near 
the treasury bond trading pit 
the government claimed that because of the disguises sanders 
dewey and others in the scheme were able to claim 30000 in trading 
profits without detection dewey was sentenced to five years in 
prison 
the six suspended traders were identified as david schremser dan 
hayes patrick bratta scott bremner patrick sutor and robert 
kinkade schremser and hayes testified under grants of immunity from 
prosecutors at sanders trial the cbot said 
the cbot board of governors levied the stiffest penalty against 
bremner who was suspended for 10 years fined 50000 and barred

between the united states and the eec

the spokesman who asked not to be named said the us

the first barometer of 1989 has already 
flashed a positive signal for the stock market 
in the first five sessions of the year the dow jones average of 
30 industrials posted a net gain of 3089 points 
that marks the 24th time in the past 40 years that the market 
gained ground in the first trading week according to yale hirsch 
an old tappan nj investment advisor 
on only two of those occasions in 1966 and 1973 did the market 
fail to finish the year in the plus column 
hirsch describes the firstweek performance as an early 
warning system for his popular january barometer which is based 
on the premise that as january goes so goes the year in the 
market 
in his annual stock traders almanac hirsch says the direction 
stock prices take in january has foreshadowed the full years 
outcome correctly all but three times since 1950 
this time of year is a peak period for the various indicators 
people have adopted to try to solve the perpetual riddle of the 
market outlook 
when the super bowl is played in miami on jan 22 many wall 
streeters will be rooting at least tongueincheek for the san 
francisco 49ers to beat the cincinnati bengals 
thats because the 49ers trace their origins to the national 
football league before its merger with the former american football 
league 
in the 22 years that the super bowl has been played a victory by 
a team from the original nfl has always been followed by an up year 
for stock prices 
sober rightthinking wall streeters try not to take the super 
bowl indicator too seriously it simply isnt fitting for people 
with fiduciary responsibilities to be associating themselves with 
anything so patently frivolous 
still the super bowl indicator gets a lot of attention if only 
as an entertaining diversion from the rigors of a demanding business 
hirsch argues that there is considerably more logic to the 
january barometer 
several events have been squeezed into january which affect our 
economy and our stock markets and quite possibly those of many 
nations of the world he observes 
congress convenes the president presents his budget and his 
state of the union message and national goals and priorities 
are set 
switch these events to any other month and chances are the 
january barometer would become a memory he concludes 
that case fails to sway some skeptics however who question the 
utility if not the validity of the january barometer 
in 1987 for example the market rose 132 percent in january 
thanks to the crash that fall stocks finished the year with a gain 
of just 2 percent 
so while the barometers performance that year was technically a 
correct call prices actually were lower at yearend than they had 
been 11 months earlier 
if you had tried to act on the january barometer as soon as its 
signal was known in other words chances are you would have lost 
money 
even worse yet from the viewpoint of many professional money 
managers the january barometer failed to alert investors in 1982 to 
the impending start of a mighty bull market 
stocks fell 18 percent in january of that year with an upsurge 
that started in august they closed out the year with a net gain of 
148 percent

japans dominant phone company under pressure from 
the government said friday it would disclose market information 
that would help its new longdistance competitors plan their 
strategies 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp said it would reveal facts 
such as the number of calls made between administrative districts 
and the revenue from each district as well as the number of phone 
subscribers in each city 
the utility long owned by the government was privatized in 
1985 and its telecommunications monopoly ended at the same time 
but it held key traffic information as a corporate secret despite 
pressure from competitors and the ministry of posts and 
telecommunications 
the competition is getting quite severe for us in many 
different aspects but we decided to disclose some of information we 
have to accommodate the needs of new common cariers ntt president 
haruo yamaguchi said at a news conference 
ntt is the worlds largest company in terms of its stock market 
valuation 
the company has been disclosing the total number of subscribers 
nationwide and the total number of calls made annually but it 
withheld other details 
three companies teleway japan ddi and japan telecom have 
started longdistance telephone services since 1986 in the 320mile 
corridor between japans two biggest cities tokyo and osaka 
ntt is reportedly losing its longdistance share to the three new 
common carriers the tokyoosaka corridor covers more than 70 
percent of japans 120 million population and the new companies are 
offering longdistance rates about 20 percent lower than ntt

the government today predicted that unemployment 
would rise from 2 percent to 3 percent as a result of an austerity 
plan designed to cut the economys growth rate and reduce inflation 
the announcement the first of its kind came as the government 
is struggling to cool an overheated economy that has boosted prices 
to recordhigh levels people ran on banks last summer to take out 
their money and buy as much as possible before prices went higher 
still 
the austerity measures will leave many people jobless said 
yuan wu spokeman for the state council or cabinet the most 
seriously affected will be those in the construction industry 
because it is those projects that we want to stop 
he said the government hopes to cut inflation by 3 percent to 5 
percent next year he said anything lower would stifle economic 
developement 
yuan said china has an 185 percent rate of inflation but some 
chinese economists privately put it at about 40 percent 
in a news conference summing up last years economy yuan said 
chinas gross national product in 1988 grew by 112 percent over 
1987 to 368 billion 
industrial output led the surge jumping by 177 percent 
however agriculture increased a disappointing 3 percent 
yuan said china hopes to cut its gross national product to a 75 
percent rate of growth this year under the plan industrial 
production will fall to 8 percent growth and farm output will rise 4 
percent 
he said unemployment in china was 2 percent and expected to rise 
50 percent to 3 percent this year because of the governments 
austerity program 
estimates by independent economists put the jobless figure much 
higher 
the government imposed the austerity program in september to put 
the brakes on the price spiral that has eroded the standard of 
living for up to a fifth of city dwellers 
a reform program designed to allow prices to float on the market 
was cut back severely 
under the austerity program more than 10000 projects have also 
been stopped reducing investment by 9 billion yuan said 
he said the government would move to cushion unemployment by 
guaranteeing the jobless a certain standard of living he did not 
give details 
although most areas of the economy will be cut the state will 
put more money into agriculture yuan said 
china will increase its farm investment by 100 million yuan 
said 
he said the austerity program has already slowed the growth of 
prices in december prices went up 26 percent over the same month 
the previous year but yuan said the rate of increase was 08 
percent less than in november 
bank deposits another signal of economic activity are again on 
the increase he said 
one of the reasons for the increase however is that many banks 
have frozen the assets of individually and collectivelyowned 
businesses 
yuan also said a crackdown on corruption has returned 21 
billion in embezzled funds to the state 
more than 150 highranking officials from national companies have 
resigned and more than 30 big companies closed because of corruption 
inquiries he said

the landmark 1986 overhaul of the federal 
income tax which was widely advertised as having no effect on the 
budget deficit actually will worsen the red ink by almost 91 
billion over a fiveyear period the reagan administration now 
estimates 
the 1990 budget that president reagan sent to congress on monday 
projects the new tax law will add 244 billion to the deficit this 
fiscal year and 203 billion in the year that begins oct 1 it 
resulted in an 89 billion loss in 1988 
a congressional budget office specialist this week disputed the 
treasury calculations cbos figures which are expected in a few 
days will show a far smaller revenue loss over five years the 
official said cbos estimates are supported by the joint committee 
on taxation which advises congress on tax matters 
in 1992 and 1993 we believe the new law will increase 
collections by between 5 billion and 10 billion a year said the 
cbo official who would not be quoted by name 
looking even further into the future its going to be 
revenueneutral meaning it will produce the same revenue that the 
old law would have in those years the cbo source said 
the treasury department offered no official explanation of why 
its new estimates differ so widely from earlier calculations 
however one treasury aide suggested the problem is that the new 
estimates have no way of accounting for higher incomes that many 
economists think resulted from the lower tax rates under the new law 
this explanation is based on the concept that underlies reagans 
economic policies that cutting tax rates induces people to work 
hard earn more and save more those higher incomes in turn would 
produce more revenue for the government 
during the nearly two years it took congress to write the law 
leaders of the house senate and administration always agreed on one 
point no matter what went into the new tax package the total 
result should neither raise nor lower total government tax 
collections 
on several occasions lawmakers had to amend their work because 
revenue experts indicated it would have lost money 
shortly after the law was enacted congress and the treasury 
department estimated that in the five budget years from 1987 through 
1991 it would produce 300 million less in total revenue than the 
old law would have a figure low enough to be considered 
revenueneutral 
but a year ago reagans budget indicated that loss would be 
232 billion 
the new budget more than doubles the loss or the same five years 
to 485 billion it projects a 909 billion loss for the five 
years from 1988 through 1992 
when reagan signed the new law congress and the administration 
agreed the measure would increase tax collections by 115 billion 
in 1987 chiefly because owners of stocks and other investments 
would be induced to sell some assets in the closing days of 1986 to 
avoid a higher tax on capital gains that began in 1987 
in fact the treasury department says 1987 collections rose by 
215 billion 
congress and the treasury department often have found it is next 
to impossible to project how changes in tax laws will affect 
taxpayer behavior and thus revenue collections more than a year 
or two into the future 
the problem with the 1986 law is even greater because it 
included the most changes since the income tax was enacted in 1913 
in addition to cutting tax rates significantly for individuals 
and corporations the law reduced or repealed several deductions and 
credits and aimed to shift 120 billion of the tax burden from 
individuals to businesses over five years 
the cbo official said whatever shortage in revenue results from 
the new law will have been caused by overestimating taxes to be 
gained by reducing individual deductions rather than from the rate 
reduction

wholesale prices boosted by a 04 percent 
increase in december rose 4 percent for all of 1988 the fastest 
pace since the nation began emerging from doubledigit inflation 
near the beginning of the decade the government said today 
the gain in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of the retail level was nearly 
double last years 22 percent increase it was the biggest gain 
since 1981 when costs jumped 71 percent 
the index was propelled upward by a droughtinduced 57 percent 
increase in food prices they had showed no change in 1987 
meanwhile energy prices which had soared 112 percent in 1987 
fell 34 percent in 1988 however with the production agreement 
reached by the opec nations in november analysts expect oil prices 
to head higher this year 
all other finished goods in 1988 rose 43 percent 
in december food prices fell a slight seasonally adjusted 01 
percent energy costs edged up only 02 percent but everything else 
jumped 06 percent the biggest increase since september 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said inflation 
is running pretty much on the course its been on for several 
months 
this is the third consecutive month of good news for grocery 
shoppers prices were unchanged in november after a 01 percent 
decline in october however that period of stability was preceded 
by seven consecutive months of increases from early spring through 
the summer 
with the end of unseasonably moderate temperatures in many parts 
of the country in december fuel oil soared 85 percent and natural 
gas rose 33 percent gasoline prices however fell 35 percent 
holding back overall energy gains 
for other items a sharp 57 percent increase in tobacco prices 
and significant gains of 09 percent in automobile costs and 07 
percent in womens clothing led the index 
the fall in wholesale food costs was led by a 171 percent drop 
in turkey prices fresh and dried vegetable prices fell 85 percent 
fresh fruit 27 percent fish 13 percent and pork 03 percent 
there was a gain of 30 percent for beef 25 percent for chicken 
and 10 percent for dairy products 
the overall december increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1100 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 110 last month 30 cents 
more than in november 
the increase was close to or slightly higher than what most 
economists expected in advance of the report in november the index 
rose 03 percent it was unchanged in october 
president reagan in his economic report to congress this week 
listed the taming of inflation as one of his proudest economic 
achievements however 1988 marks the second consecutive year of 
accelerating inflation wholesale prices actually fell 23 percent 
in 1986 
the administration is predicting a steady dampening of price 
increases through 1994 but most private economists forsee another 
modest acceleration this year however none expects a return to the 
days of 1979 and 1980 when wholesale prices surged 13 percent and 
12 percent 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co 
anticipates no relief next year he said tight labor markets and a 
squeeze on factory capacity will continue the unemployment rate in 
december matched a 14year low while factories were straining in 
november at the highest operating rates in nine years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
im expecting some further acceleration in prices particularly 
because the economy is so strong jones said i think we can say 
at best we had a slight breathing spell in october and november 
where we caught our breath after food prices were pushed up by the 
drought 
inflation at the consumer level which also includes services and 
has in recent years run at a higher rate than wholesale price 
inflation was 44 percent for the first 11 months of 1988 the same 
as the annual rate in 1987 
but jones said its only a matter of time before pressures 
producing an acceleration in consumer prices rises he predicted an 
inflation rate of 5 percent to 6 percent this year 
you cant flout the laws of economics the remarkable thing is 
we didnt had more acceleration last year he said 
the labor department is due to release its december index for 
consumer prices on jan 19

delta air lines incs carefully nurtured image of 
a familystyle company where life is lovely and finances are fine is 
a smoke screen hiding serious flaws says a former company 
executives new book 
i have written this book to say that the emperor has no 
clothes to expunge the illusion that delta is ok sidney f 
davis says in explaining the reasoning behind delta air lines 
debunking the myth 
fact is delta is not ok fact is delta no longer deserves the 
reputation that it is financially impregnable and can endure and 
prosper in the worst of times 
fact is delta is in need of strong medicine if it is to survive 
over the long term writes davis a former vice president and 
assistant general counsel who quit in 1979 after 13 years at the 
airline and now serves as general counsel for an airplane leasing 
company in atlanta 
industry analysts however see little to concern them at the 
atlantabased carrier which generally enjoys a strong reputation on 
wall street and among the traveling public 
no i cant confess to be to worried about delta said robert 
decker an analyst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago an opinion 
echoed by gail scully at argus research in new york 
the book offers nothing constructive said delta spokesman 
bill berry who gave it his own title sour grapes by sid davis 
i can see nothing to the current criticisms berry said i 
find his book laughable it is so out of tune with what the industry 
is today and what delta is and his opinions just are laughable they 
just dont fit today 
davis said he left delta in 1979 to become general counsel of 
springs industries inc after nine years at the textile company he 
returned to atlanta to establish a consulting business which was 
bought by his current employer intercredit corp 
he says high salaries lack of marketing expertise a subpar 
computer reservations system and failure to deal with airline 
deregulation have made delta a company living on borrowed time 
were stable were financially healthy were growing berry 
said were not setting the world on fire but were doing it the 
delta way 
the company has always been ultraconservative 
davis offers a litany of problems at delta complaints that chief 
executive officer ron allen has no grasp of marketing and is the 
wrong man at the wrong time accusations that deltas budget 
process is nonexistent claims the airline has prospered by dumb 
luck and suggestions its hiringfromwithin process has perverted 
the company 
he says the company has a siege mentality about criticism 
and has no planning process 
among davis solutions are for the company to more aggressively 
hire nondelta employees totally restructure its marketing 
department get rid of its nolayoff policy and demonstrate 
financial stewardship 
davis doesnt expect his recommendations to be heard the very 
problems i name and the solutions i pose will by my naming and 
proposing be immediately ruled out of any serious consideration of 
how to resolve deltas predicament he writes 
the book which arrived in atlanta stores last week has been 
greeted with a demand unusual for a businessoriented book 
according to sales people at some local bookstores 
its moving more quickly than even we imagined said cindy 
gelb spokeswoman for peachtree publishers ltd which printed 
15000 of the books initially 
berry admits to keeping up with sales but he says there has been 
little response coming to the airline 
berry said justreleased figures show delta for the 15th 
consecutive year got the lowest number of consumer complaints of the 
major airlines our passengers like us if nobody else our 
passengers like us 
last week delta the nations third largest airline reported an 
113 percent increase in revenue passenger miles in 1988 and said 
the actual number of passengers rose 71 percent to almost 60 
million

the government greatly expanded its role in 
protecting workers from hazardous materials friday setting exposure 
limits for 164 substances for the first time and tightening limits 
for 212 more in changes officials said could save 700 lives a year 
this is a monumental job assistant labor secretary john a 
pendergrass said in announcing the standards which he said should 
significantly reduce the risk of illness to 21 million americans who 
work in general industry and may be exposed to toxic or hazardous 
materials 
about 45 million workers now face exposures above the new 
limits the labor department said in completing a twoyear project 
that represents the first largescale changes to exposure standards 
in nearly two decades employers have until september to comply 
we are literally taking a 20year technological leap said 
pendergrass head of the departments occupational safety and health 
administration this is the biggest action osha has taken in its 
history 
osha estimated that in addition to preventing about 700 deaths a 
year the tighter limits should prevent 55000 illnesses and 500000 
lost workdays each year attributed to workplace exposure to 
hazardous and toxic materials rough estimates provided by the 
agency indicated the new standards could cut exposurerelated deaths 
by onefifth illnesses and lost workdays by onefourth 
the reductions in maximum exposure limits cover some of the most 
commonly used industrial materials and byproducts including 
acetone carbon monoxide carbon disulfide chloroform hydrogen 
cyanide perchloroethylene and styrene 
substances regulated for the first time include wood dust and 
grain dust acrylic acid butane gasoline paraffin wax fumes 
tungsten and welding fumes 
some substances are known or suspected carcinogens others can 
have narcoticlike effects on humans still others are blamed for 
kidney liver heart and respiratory ailments while some are major 
skin and eye irritants 
the limits cover the maximum amount of a substance a worker can 
be exposed to at any given time and during an eighthour workday 
osha said it needed to conduct further review before setting 
lmits for exposure to asphalt fibrous glass dust and mineral wool 
those substances had been subject to new standards under the 
agencys draft regulations but conflicting data presented during 
public hearings prompted osha to delay final decisions 
the changes announced friday could cost employers on average 
6000 a year for each affected workplace though that would vary 
greatly the government said costs could range from 77400 a year 
for petroleum refineries to 360 annually for auto dealers the 
average perworker cost is 150 
the department considered limits for more than 400 industrial 
chemicals and substances in a single review departing from a policy 
of casebycase study that had produced new comprehensive standards 
for just 24 substances in 17 years 
after the review the government decided to let stand existing 
limits on 52 substances the new limits on the others take effect 
march 1 and employers must be in compliance by sept 1 
exposure limits will remain unchanged for 169 additional 
substances not covered by the twoyear review some of them are 
currently being reviewed on an individual basis 
the new standards apply only to general industry but will be 
extended following additional proceedings to construction and 
maritime industries as well 
new limits were first suggested two years ago a draft was 
released last summer followed by 13 public hearings and a public 
comment period during which more than 90 companies trade 
associations and labor unions testified and submitted documents for 
osha to consider 
the new federal guidelines will require 23 states and the 
territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands to check 
oshaapproved local standards they have adopted to make sure they 
meet the new regulations 
those states are 
alaska arizona california hawaii indiana iowa kentucky 
maryland michigan minnesota nevada new mexico north carolina 
oregon south carolina tennessee utah vermont virginia 
washington and wyoming affected to a lesser extent are connecticut 
and new york which have state exposure standards for local 
government employees

than 2 a barrel in december in the wake of the new opec quota 
agreement the government oil monopoly pemex said 
the price of light isthmus crude in the americas was 1393 a 
barrel in december an increase from 1162 in november petroleos 
mexicanos said late thursday

respectively 
prices for european buyers during the first half of the month

organization of petroleum exporting countries 
opecs 13 members agreed to lower their output by nearly 4 
million barrels a day to 185 million barrels in an effort to stem

congressional analysts on friday disputed the 
reagan administrations projection that the 1986 tax overhaul 
which was supposed to have no effect on the federal deficit will 
actually worsen the red ink by nearly 91 billion over five years 
nevertheless the congressional budget office did acknowledge its 
own forecasts show that rather than being revenue neutral the 
sweeping law will lose 234 billion during the same fiveyear 
period ending in 1992 
comparing other time periods shows a similar disagreement between 
the administrations tax experts in the treasury department and 
those of congress who work for the congressional budget office and 
the joint committee on taxation 
the argument means nothing as far as reducing the deficit is 
concerned since the revenue figures are already built into the 
presidents budget 
however the disagreement is likely to make government officials 
and the public think twice the next time they hear anyone attempt to 
estimate tax revenues far into the future 
meanwhile joseph wright jr reagans budget director said he 
did not expect the size of the revenue losses to be anywhere near 
the levels being estimated in the presidents formal budget 
this is a static analysis done by the treasury department that 
does not take into account any other influences on the economy it 
needs to be taken with a grain of salt wright said 
he said the analysis failed to take into account faster economic 
growth that the administration contends is likely to occur in 
response to the reduction in tax rates 
shortly after congress passed the 1986 law treasury and the 
joint committee on taxation estimated it would be essentially 
revenue neutral lose only 300 million from 1987 through 1991 
they forecast a sizable revenue increase in 1987 because taxpayers 
would act to avoid a scheduled rise in the tax on capital gains 
losses in 1988 and 1989 and then increases into the future 
at this time a year ago reagan proposed a budget that forecast a 
23billion drop in collections during the same five years the 
budget that came out this week more than doubles that projected 
decline to 485 billion for the period and increases it to 909 
billion for the 198892 period 
in contrast cbo says that because of the big 1987 boost the law 
will increase collections by 46 billion in the 19871991 period 
though it will result in an overall loss for the 198892 period 
the administrations latest forecast was included in the fiscal 
1990 budget that president reagan sent to congress on monday during 
that 12month period beginning oct 1 revenue will be 203 billion 
less than under the old law treasury says cbo forecast a drop of 
only 700 million 
cbo expects the new law to produce more revenue each year than 
the old law starting in 1991 while the treasury department estimates 
continued declines at least through 1993 
it was a different story in 1985 and 1986 when congress and the 
administration were putting the new law together 
democrats wanted to ensure the overhauled law did not worsen the 
treasury drain that they blmed principally on reagans 1981 
acrosstheboard tax cut republicans were fighting any revenue 
increase on grounds more taxes would simply lead to more spending 
the solution was to aim for a tax bill that was revenue neutral 
that left the government with essentially the same money that the 
old law would have provided 
but as the new figures seem to indicate there is simply no way 
to forecast how taxpayers will react to changes in the tax law three 
or more years in the future 
sen bob packwood rore then chairman of the senate finance 
committee and a prime author of the new law recognized the 
difficulty of such forecasts on the day the senate passed the final 
version of the bill packwood declared 
we have done everything we can to write it so that it will be 
revenue neutral but very frankly when you are talking about a 
bill that goes over five years and were going to be collecting 
roughly 47 trillion over that five years you could hope it is 
neutral nobody can be absolutely sure 
forecasting tax revenues was made ever more difficult because the 
1986 law included the most changes since the income tax was enacted 
in 1913 in addition to cutting tax rates significantly for 
individuals and corporations the law reduced or repealed several 
deductions and credits and aimed to shift 120 billion of the tax 
burden from individuals to businesses over five years

a friday the 13th virus struck personal 
computers in britain on friday in what experts said may have been a 
new manifestation of a computer virus that originated in israel 
hundreds of personal computer users found the virus was 
programmed to delete files on friday the 13th said alan solomon 
managing director of s and s enterprises a data recovery center in 
chesham 
it has been frisky and hundreds of people including a large 
firm with over 400 computers have telephoned with their problems 
he said 
several us computersecurity experts said they had not received 
any reports that the virus had cropped up inside the united states 
the virus bore many of the characteristics of one that had been 
programmed to go off on friday may 13 1988 the day before the 
40th anniversary of the establishment of the state of israel that 
virus was first noticed at hebrew university in jerusalem and later 
spread to europe 
security experts said it was logical that a virus that was set to 
go off on one friday the 13th would also go off on subsequent friday 
the 13ths unless it was completely eradicated this was the first 
friday the 13th since the one in may 1988 
it is just a pesky nuisance and is causing a lot of problems 
today said solomon who also is chairman of an ibm personal 
computer users group 
the virus apparently attacked microsoft corps msdos the 
software that runs the internal operations of the original line of 
international business machines corp personal computers and 
compatible models 
there were no estimates of how widespread the damage from the 
virus was the israeli newspaper maariv said that in one case the 
original israeli virus destroyed 15000 worth of software and two 
disks in which 7000 hours of work had been invested 
the israel virus for some reason possibly an error by its 
creator began eating up space and slowing down computers before may 
13 1988 solomon said the latest virus also ate up room in 
computers and slowed them down before friday 
a spokesman for ibm in portsmouth who did not want to be 
identified further confirmed the virus had wiped out files in 
personal computers made by ibm and compatible machines the virus 
apparently did not affect personal computers in offices of ibm 
itself however said colette abissi an ibm spokeswoman in 
purchase ny 
the identity of the hacker who devised the virus might never be 
known solomon said 
the important thing is not to panic and start trying to delete 
everything in a bid to remove the virus as that can do untold 
damage he said 
as long as master disks are free from the virus files can simply 
be copied from them and used again he said

national westminster bank plc said its usbased 
county natwest government securities inc would abandon its primary 
bond dealership after operating in the us treasuries market in new 
york for just over three months 
natwest said some of the 100 people employed by the dealership 
might be transferred within the company 
the decision to withdraw resulted from an assessment of the costs 
involved in the primary dealership natwest said 
continued expansion of the business would require the injection 
of substantial additional capital but analysis of the prospective 
longterm return on capital has persuaded us that further investment 
cannot be justified in the context of our overall strategy 
natwest said in a statement 
county natwest government securities was named one of 46 primary 
dealers in us government securities on sept 29 the last time new 
primary dealers were added to the list by the federal reserve bank 
of new york 
in december the fed recommended that natwest inject 50 million 
to 100 million into the dealership to meet capitalization 
requirements 
primary dealers are government bond dealers that do business 
directly with the federal reserve bank of new york they are 
required to make markets in all government issues and to participate 
at all treasury auctions

usmade car and truck sales rose 56 percent 
during early january this year compared with the same period last 
year despite a 198 percent decline in car sales at general motors 
corp automakers said friday 
the drop at gm may have been due to dealers moving some sales 
from early january to late december to inflate yearend numbers 
analysts speculated strong truck sales helped bolster sagging 
automobile sales industrywide 
the seven us automakers said they sold cars and light trucks on 
a daily rate of 25622 vehicles during the jan 110 period this 
year during the same period last year they sold cars and trucks at

as its car sales skidded 198 percent to a daily rate of 6801 in 
early january this year compared with a rate of 8481 during the

i think youre just seeing a payback from the end of 
december said analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new 
york a few of the dealers probably called a few of the jan 34 
sales dec 31 sales to boost yearend figures 
david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new york agreed 
saying their sales were unbelievably good in late december and 
unbelievably bad in early january if you add the two periods 
together and divide by two things are about normal 
there was a lot of yearend window dressing in late december 
healy added 
during the final 10day period of december gm reported a daily 
sales rate of 14657 cars a day more than twice the early january 
rate 
overall us automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of 
15283 during the first 10 days of the year a 31 percent decline 
from a daily rate of 15765 during the same time last year

january 13 percent and 114 percent respectively

rate of 8488 last year

early january climbing to a daily rate of 2347 in 1989 from 1598

a year before

the dollar surged to threemonth highs against 
major currencies friday as buyers shrugged off attempts by central 
banks to restrain its rise 
most of the dollars gains occurred after midday in new york 
when currency trading ceased in europe and the european central 
banks were no longer in the market selling dollars traders said 
there were reports of two rounds of intervention earlier in the 
day by the central banks of the united states west germany canada 
italy belgium switzerland france britain and austria 
after the dollar had already achieved its gains for the day the 
federal reserve by itself reportedly sold some dollars late in the 
us trading session 
traders were unintimidated by the central banks because it 
appeared the banks were merely trying to stall the dollars rise 
not drive the dollar down said stephen flanagan senior yen dealer 
at manufacturers hanover trust co 
the us government fears the dollars rise because it could hurt 
the competitiveness of american goods in world markets worsening 
the us trade deficit japan west germany and others fear higher 
inflation if their currencies become too weak 
the dollar closed in new york at its highest levels since october 
against the west german mark japanese yen swiss franc french 
franc and italian lira and at its highest level since november 
against the british pound 
in spite of the seemingly sharp rise in the dollar though 
currency rates remain far more stable than they were earlier in the 
decade said craig sloane a currency analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
the dollar shot up until february 1985 and then immediately 
collapsed losing half its value against the yen and the mark in 
little more than two years since then it has traded in a relatively 
narrow range 
the dollars rise friday came in spite of news that us retail 
sales increased by only 02 percent in december while market 
forecasts had been for an increase of 14 percent 
higher sales could have signaled a hike in interest rates which 
would have made the dollar more attractive to investors instead 
yields on treasury bonds fell sharply 
also the commerce department is scheduled to report on the 
november merchandise trade deficit on wednesday and traders are 
usually reluctant to buy dollars heavily in advance of the report in 
case a big deficit hurts the us currency 
in london one british pound cost 17770 late friday more than 
one cent cheaper for buyers than thursdays late 17880 in new 
york the pound weakened to 17660 from 17850 
the dollar rose in tokyo to close at 12665 yen up from 12612 
yen late friday in london the dollar traded at 12635 yen in new 
york the dollar rose to 12730 yen from 12638 yen late thursday

spot copper price settled at the days high of 1536 a pound 
the explosion of the flash furnace feeding chilean copper corps 
chuquicamata smelter was reported to have killed at least 16 people 
and could result in significant production losses putting further 
strain on extremely tight copper supplies analysts said 
the question of how much production loss will occur is not 
clear at all but any losses are very bullish because the market is 
so tight said bette raptopoulos a metalmarket analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
production problems have plagued the worldwide copper industry in 
the past year helping to drive the commodity exchanges spotmonth 
price to a record high of 16475 a pound on dec 8 
a loss of production from chuquicamata is not going to be a big 
supply problem in times to come but it will have an immediate 
shortterm impact on prices said analyst james steel of refco 
inc in new york 
gold and silver futures prices fell moderately on the commodity 
exchange reflecting gains in the dollars value against major 
foreign currencies analysts said 
gold settled 230 to 240 lower with february at 40350 a troy 
ounce silver was 28 cents lower across the board with march at 
5957 a troy ounce

on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange despite the decline 
analysts said the markets bullish supplyanddemand fundamentals 
remained in place 
coffee settled 138 cents to 301 cents lower with march at 
1397 a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade ahead of an agriculture department crop report that 
was released after the close of trading and is expected to boost 
wheat prices and pressure corn and soybean prices on monday 
in the report the usda estimated 1989 winterwheat seedings at 
5446 million acres 12 percent above the 1988 tally but well below 
analysts prereport estimates 
the usda said 1988 soybean production totaled 154 billion 
bushels 198 percent below the 1987 harvest but higher than most 
prereport estimates and higher than the agencys nov 9 projection 
of 151 billion bushels 
the government said 1988 corn production totaled 492 billion 
bushels 303 percent below the 1987 harvest but much higher than 
prereport estimates and the usdas nov 9 projection of 467 
billion bushels 
the usda pegged soybean stocks as of dec 1 at 137 billion 
bushels compared with 176 billion bushels a year earlier corn 
stocks at 707 billion bushels compared with 977 billion bushels a 
year earlier and wheat stocks at 171 billion bushels compared 
with 251 billion bushels a year earlier the soybean number was 
slightly below expectations while the wheat and corn figures were 
higher than expected 
the winterwheat seedings figure alone would have been very 
bullish for the wheat market said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
but he said buying enthusiasm in the wheat market on monday 
probably would be tempered by the bearish corn and and soybean 
production numbers and the bearish wheat and corn stocks figures 
the corn numbers were a shockingly bearish surprise 
lespinasse said and could translate into opening declines of more 
than 5 cents a bushel on monday 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with march at 441 
a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with march at 288 a 
bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents higher with march at 243 a

chevron corp and phillips petroleum co said this week they plan 
to increase their capital spending levels for refining and marketing 
operations in 1989 while spending more exploration dollars overseas 
the companies said their strategies to focus on downstream 
investment the businesses that refine and market chemicals 
gasoline and other products were based on projections for weak oil 
prices into the 1990s 
the downstream or exploration and production operations of most 
major oil companies have been hurt in recent years because of low 
oil prices despite a sharp rise in crude prices since november when 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to reduce 
its output many analysts and oil company executives have remained 
skeptical that the gains would last beyond june when the agreement 
expires 
several oil companies have said recently they would reduce 
domestic operations and concentrate on foreign exploration because 
it is cheaper and the potential for finding oil is greater in 1988 
us oil production fell by an estimated 1 million barrels a day 
chevron the fourthlargest oil company said friday it will 
spend 38 billion in 1989 400 million more than in 1988 
excluding its 25 billion acquisition of tenneco oil and gas assets 
in the gulf of mexico 
chevron said it would invest 350 million for chemical 
production up 50 percent from last year and 11 billion for 
refining marketing and pipeline operations 25 percent more than in 
1988 
the san franciscobased company said its production budget would 
remain virtually unchanged at 2 billion but with increased 
investments in africa indonesia and the north sea 
meanwhile phillips petroleum said it would boost its capital 
spending 8 percent to 975 million concentrating on refining 
operations and foreign exploration and production 
the largest increase in the budget comes in the companys 
petroleum refining marketing petrochemicals and plastics business 
up from 330 million in 1988 to 389 million in 1989 
the bartlesville oklabased company is expanding its 
manufacturing capacity in several plastics lines at its houston 
chemical complex 
of the 406 million budgeted for worldwide exploration and 
production projects 228 million is earmarked for overseas where 
the company said it sees strong potential for adding reserves in a 
low oil and gas price environment 
the foreign exploration and production budget of 228 million is 
an increase from 159 million in 1988 domestic exploration and 
production was budgeted at 178 million for the year down from 241 
million

soft drink giant pepsico inc has agreed to buy 
general cinema corps bottling business for 175 billion in cash 
the companies announced friday two weeks after an earlier deal fell 
through 
the previous deal which carried a price tag of 15 billion 
disintegrated after the federal trade commission asked for 
additional details to determine whether it might violate antitrust 
laws the delay prevented the sale from being completed in time for 
general cinema to obtain tax deferral benefits 
were delighted that we reached a new agreement like this 
said general cinema spokesman phil nardone he said the companies 
negotiated for the past two weeks and every time one of the 
parties walked away from the table the other party came back so it 
showed you that both parties really wanted this transaction to come 
to fruition 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pepsico fell 75 cents 
a share to 3875 a share while general cinema rose 37 cents a 
share to 2437 
pepsico spokesman jim griffith said despite the higher price tag 
the new deal wont actually cost pepsico 250 million more because 
of offsetting reductions in financing costs and taxes 
comparing the net aftertax cost of pepsico of the deal we 
signed today and the deal that we had hoped to do in 1988 the 
difference to pepsico is only about 60 million more griffith 
said the reason for that is that this deal allows us lower 
effective financing costs and higher net tax benefits 
youre talking about a 5 percent difference and the deal makes 
great sense for us both from a strategic standpoint and an operating 
standpoint griffith said 
analysts have said the deal would bring one of the nations 
biggest independent bottlers under pepsicos control allowing the 
purchase nybased company to consolidate bottling operations and 
reduce costs 
under the new deal general cinema will not be able to defer 400 
million in capital gains taxes over 20 years because that provision 
expired dec 31 but nardone said the advantage of having cash 
which can be invested until the taxes are due helps offset the loss 
nardone said the new cash deal is an improvement over the 
previous arrangement which was for a 20year pepsico note 
the companies said the revised deal is subject to signing a 
definitive agreement the companies also said they do not anticipate 
any unusual delays in giving the ftc the additional information it 
wants 
nardone said the deal means general cinema will be pulling out of 
the bottling business although it maintains an 18 percent interest 
in cadbury schweppes plc 
general cinema a film exhibition and softdrink bottling concern 
based in chestnut hill mass owns and operates 1359 movie screens 
at 318 locations the company also owns about 60 percent of the 
neiman marcus group 
general cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 when it 
acquired american beverage corp which held pepsicola franchises 
in miami and northern ohio it subsequently purchased other 
franchises and has regional bottling facilities in atlanta 
jacksonville fla winstonsalem nc twinsburg ohio and 
charleston w va 
the companys beverage unit had revenue of about 720 million for 
the fiscal year ending oct 31

sundstrand corp declined to comment friday 
on a report that the aerospace contractor may pay the defense 
department nearly 100 million to settle questionable billing 
practices 
quoting unidentified sources business week magazine said the 
pentagon is preparing an administrative settlement in which 
sundstrand would make payments both in cash and contractprice 
guarantees to resolve the billing problem 
weve made a standard practice not to comment on anything like 
that which first of all we havent seen and secondly its an 
allegation on their part sundstrand spokesman claude vernam said 
the settlement would compound the effect of an unprecedented 
1273 million in fines levied against sundstrand late last year 
after the company pleaded guilty to overcharging the pentagon on 
defense contracts 
in its jan 23 issue business week reported that the 
administrative claim alleges the company billed the government for 
millions of dollars in costs unrelated to its pentagon contracts 
sources also told the magazine that current or former sundstrand 
executives may be indicted by the us attorneys office in chicago 
whether or not there will be any indictments and when those 
indictments would be handed down we have no comment said bill 
clabault one of several assistant us attorneys working on the 
case 
the federal prosecutors office routinely declines comment on 
pending investigations 
sundstrand pleaded guilty oct 21 to four counts of defrauding 
the government by overbilling on aircraft parts it also pleaded 
guilty in washington state to one count of mischarging on government 
contracts at its seattlearea plant 
business week also reported that sunstrand which makes 
electrical systems used in military and commercial jets has agreed 
never to rehire 10 former executives five of whom were fired jan 5 
in a disciplinary action that involved 22 people 
also at the governments insistence sundstrand agreed to revise 
its overhead accounting system reducing the governments cost on 
most contracts by 20 percent to 40 percent the magazine said 
in addition it said the company has guaranteed price reductions 
on some pentagon contracts and has separated government and 
commercial production at its plants 
last month sundstrands chairman and chief executive evans w 
erikson announced he was retiring

the overall quality of both corporate and 
municipal bonds declined in 1988 a creditmonitoring firm said 
friday 
based on preliminary data a record 386 corporate bond ratings 
were lowered last year representing 171 billion of debt according 
to standard amp poors corp the previous record was the 364 
downgrades in 1986 
conversely 261 corporate bond ratings were raised last year 
representing 158 billion in debt sampp said the number of upgrades 
in 1988 far surpassed the old high of 188 in 1987 it said 
the number of ratings is greater than the number of companies 
issuing bonds because differing types of bonds issued by the same 
company receive separate ratings sampp said 
several leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations especially in 
the retail industry accounted for some of the lowered ratings sampp 
said 
notable upgrades included texaco inc mobil corp and ford motor 
co which together accounted for 42 billion of debt 
the company said a negative trend continued in the ratings of 
debt offerings of financial institutions 
in municipal bonds sampp said large declines in the quality of 
housing utility and hospital issues more than offset positive 
trends in general obligation and airport port and college revenue 
bonds 
the firm said it lowered the ratings on 266 issues representing 
about 23 billion of debt while it raised the ratings on 112 issues 
equaling about 17 billion of debt 
in 1987 269 municipal issues representing about 165 billion in 
debt were downgraded while 153 ratings on 25 billion in debt were 
raised 
the number of municipal bond issues increased in 1988 as the 
market recovered from the federal tax reform act sampp said a total 
of 2094 issues were rated last year of which 82 were taxable in 
1987 1817 issues were rated including 70 taxables

shearson lehman hutton inc wall streets 
largest firm said friday it would report a loss for the fourth 
quarter of 1988 due to bad investments in a troubled texas bank 
the company also said it would revise downward its profit for the 
rest of 1988 because of previously reported accounting problems at 
the boston co a subsidiary that caters to wealthy clients 
shearson did not estimate the amount of quarterly loss from 
devalued securities in mcorp of dallas but said it would release 
fourthquarter figures later this month one stock analyst put the 
loss at 15 million to 16 million 
with capital exceeding 45 billion 40000 employees and more 
than 700 offices worldwide shearson i the largest us investment 
firm about 61 percent of it is owned by american express co the 
financial services giant 
shearson said it will record a pretax charge of 70 million in 
the fourth quarter ended dec 30 to reflect a further reduction in 
the value of mcorp securities shearson initially lowered the value 
of the holdings in early 1988 
to correct an overstatement in boston co earnings shearson said 
it would restate profit for the first three quarters of 1988 that 
will lower shearsons earnings for that period by 30 million to 
about 110 million 
shearson spokesman michael oneill said the problem at the boston 
co stemmed from recording revenues that should have been deferred 
and deferring expenses that should have been recorded 
he said an unidentified employee disclosed the problem and there 
was no misuse of company or client assets 
last month shearson estimated the restatement would result in a 
15 million profit reduction it also said three top boston co 
officers were suspended with pay over the improper accounting 
thomas schick another shearson spokesman said a committee of 
outside auditors and shearson officers is expected to determine who 
was responsible within a few weeks 
shearson declined to name the three suspended officers they have 
been identified by boston newspapers as president james n von 
germeten executive vice president joseph f murphy and chief 
financial officer michael j walsh 
the reviews conclusion was that what was involved here was 
accounting decisions that would boost the reported earnings 
schick said in terms of what the motive was i cannot possibly 
speak to that we do not believe that any laws were broken 
shearson said it would have reported a fourthquarter profit 
without the devaluation of mcorp holdings 
alison deans who follows the securities industry for kidder 
peabody amp co inc estimated the profit would have been 30 million 
to 35 million or 30 to 35 cents a share because of the mcorp 
problem the loss should be 15 million to 16 million she said 
shearson said it owns mcorp money market cumulative prefered 
stock with a face value of 1175 million and mcorp subordinated 
debt securities with a principal amount of 29 million 
after the adjustments the preferred stock will be valued at 
294 million and the debt securities at 116 million shearson 
said 
mcorp which has requested financial assistance from the federal 
deposit insurance corp in october declared a moratorium on payment 
of preferred stock dividends and principal and interest on debt 
ms dean said shearson acquired the mcorp securities after it 
agreed to underwrite them or bring them to market in early 1988 
there was a lack of investor interest and shearson ending up buying 
them itself 
it was unclear whether any other brokerage firms own mcorp 
securities in any significant amount but ms dean said she did not 
foresee the fallout from the troubles in the banking and savings and 
loan industries becoming widespread in the securities industry 
in composite new york stock exchange trading shearsons shares 
closed at 1962 up 87 cents from thursday

the federal trade commission has 
allowed billionaire developer donald trump to buy more shares of 
caesars world inc stock a trump official said friday 
trump has already bought a block of caesars world stock in 
middecember he filed a notice under the hartscottrodino act for 
a determination whether continued purchases would violate antitrust 
laws 
susan heilbron an executive vice president of the trump 
organization said the ftc notified trump on monday that he could 
buy more stock 
we did not receive any requests for additional information and 
they raised no questions about the antitrust implications ms 
heilbron said 
in his request to the ftc trump indicated he has the 
goodfaith intention subject to price availability and necessary 
approvals to acquire 15 percent of the stock he also indicated 
he may decide to seek control of caesars through the acquisition 
of 50 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities 
trump owner of two casinohotels in atlantic city and one under 
construction has not indicated how much stock he purchased in the 
rival gaming company but provisions of the hartscottrodino act 
require people or companies to file with the trade commission when 
they amass 15 million worth of stock in another company 
the day after trump officials received the notice from the ftc 
caesars shareholders adopted a shareholder rights program designed 
to prevent unfriendly takeovers 
under the new plan if someone buys 20 percent of caesars stock 
or if someone with 10 percent appears only interested in forcing the 
company to buy back the stock at a premium or if a person is 
unqualified to hold a gaming license then all other caesars 
shareholders have the right to buy additional stock at half its 
market value 
trump has not commented on his involvement with caesars ms 
heilbron also said that even after the ftc ruling mr trump would 
not comment on his plans

the governments friday the 13th economic reports showing higher 
inflation and a mixed picture for retail sales didnt cast any 
badluck spells on the financial markets where the dollar rallied 
bond prices jumped and stocks reached the highest level since the 
wall street crash 15 months ago 
the labor department said the rate of increase in wholesale 
prices nearly doubled in 1988 to 4 percent the worst pace since the 
early 1980s although inflation remains far below the doubledigit 
era of last decade many economists expressed concern 
i dont like the sound of a doubling of inflation but we have 
to put 4 percent in perspective said robert brusca an economist 
with nikko securities co international inc in new york its not 
that bad but its not that good either 
in another report released friday the commerce department said 
retail sales in december rose a weak 02 percent following strong 
increases in october and november but for the year retail spending 
rose 67 percent in 1988 to 161 trillion the best performance in 
four years 
the wholesale prices report had little effect on the markets but 
some traders said the retail sales figure for december was weaker 
than expected and suggested that inflationary pressure was easing 
which helped stocks and bonds 
others credited the strength in the markets to a relentless rise 
in the dollars value despite coordinated dollarselling by major 
central banks to stem the us currencys advance a more expensive 
dollar makes investments denominated in the currency more attractive 
in the bond market the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 
nearly 10 per 1000 in face value while its yield declined from 
897 percent late thursday to 888 percent the lowest in more than 
two months 
lower yields in the bond market encouraged investors to buy 
stocks and helped the market reach another in a recent series of 
postcrash highs on wall street the dow jones industrial average 
rose 375 points to 222607 finishing the week with a net gain of 
3178 points

a group of 84 former empire airlines pilots 
now employed by piedmont aviation inc have filed a 25 million 
lawsuit against the winstonsalem ncbased airline its parent 
company and the pilots union 
the suit will be served on piedmont usair group inc and the air 
line pilots association next week said alan peterman a syracuse 
attorney who is representing the pilots 
the suit claims the union arbitrarily refused to represent the 
pilots seniority interests and other employment rights in the 
usairpiedmont merger and accuses all three organizations of 
breaching contractual obligations to ensure the pilots interests 
were represented fairly the attorney said 
the suit was filed thursday in us district court in syracuse 
in december 1987 the pilots filed a 52 million lawsuit against 
the union and its piedmont master executive council which is 
pending 
both lawsuits seek to increase the pilots seniority with 
piedmont to include time spent flying for empire empire based in 
utica ny merged with piedmont in 1986 
the pilots lawsuit contends they will lose pay advancement 
opportunities and transfer ability during the decade following the 
merger because of their low placement on the integrated seniority 
list 
peterman said he expects the airlines and union to ask for the 
pilots lawsuits to be consolidated he said the 1987 lawsuit 
probably would go to a nonjury trial by years end

possible insider trading deals

embarrass the socialist government 
the takeover involved stateowned pechiney sas acquisition late 
last year of new yorkbased triangle industries whose main asset is 
the packaging company american national can corp 
the stock market authority the commission des operations de 
bourse is investigating that deal after receiving an alert from its 
counterpart the us securities and exchange commission

shareholder groups controlling the bank societe generale in which a 
state deposit institution provided a third of the funds involved
