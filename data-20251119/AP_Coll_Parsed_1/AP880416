nuclear workers lost track this month 
of five shipments of radioactive garbage from west germany but 
later found them an official said friday 
the investigation has taught us a lesson said paul ek an 
engineer with the atomic energy board we have to tighten our 
control of the transports 
he said the five containers of nuclear waste arrived for 
disposal as planned at swedens studsvik plant but they were not 
properly registered and were reported missing april 1 
the atomic energy board traced the material through the west 
german environmental ministry and the transnuklear company that 
organized the transports according to ek 
he said a stronger control system including customs reports on 
all nuclear waste shipments will be implemented during the next 
budget year 
we will also demand that the nuclear plants and studsvik 
inform us of transports within the country beforehand to make it 
possible to estimate what security is needed he added 
the new reporting system will enable the board to monitor the 
waste transports stepbystep in the same way as shipments of 
atomic fuel ek said

members of the ducks breath mystery 
theater say they were trying to conjure up memories of old japanese 
horror movies when they struck on the title zarda cow from 
hell 
but the name for the movie involving a giant demonic bovine 
didnt get any laughs from ben zarda owner of the zarda dairy in 
shawnee kan 
the zarda people decided theyd rather we not use that name 
its unfortunate because wed grown attached to it said 
executive producer scott smith who went along with zardas wishes 
the company learned of zarda the dairy from director robert c 
hughes a native of kansas city kan 
the cow connection just blew us away smith said 
we took the name out of the blue he said we wanted it to 
sound like a japanese horror movie it was supposed to be a 
nonsensical name 
ducks breath mystery theater a band of offbeat comics who got 
their start at the university of iowa and came back to iowa city to 
make the movie has been working on the zarda concept for some time 
its something weve been kicking around for about 10 years 
said ducks breath manager steve baker of san francisco 
the story line has a film company from hollywood coming to 
iowa to make a sleazy horror film about a giant cow baker said 
the film company has such exaggerated characters so absurd that 
it turns out the good folks of iowa are more qualified to make the 
movie than hollywood types 
more than 600 people showed up in iowa city this week to 
audition for about 40 parts in the film smith said the movie 
should be in the can by august 
meanwhile the group is considering another name for the 
production 
something equally japanese horror movielike something like 
zorka smith said

administration denial of permission for 
government scientists to transplant brain tissue from aborted 
fetuses to patients with parkinsons disease has put a spotlight on 
what one expert calls terrifying ethical questions 
ethicist arthur caplan of the university of minnesota said he is 
concerned because the decision disclosed friday flowed more from 
political opposition to abortion than an effort to stimulate public 
debate 
an administration official acknowledged that the issue has been 
a hot topic within the government health bureaucracy but denied 
that the decision to set up an advisory panel to consider the 
issues was driven by politics 
the official who discussed the matter on condition of 
anonymity said the ban does not apply to all research on fetuses 
but rather is limited to the emerging technology of implanting 
fresh fetal tissue into humans 
there are terrifying ethical questions surrounding the use of 
fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes in human beings caplan 
head of his universitys center for biomedical ethics said friday 
in a telephone interview 
he said those include the source and whether you would 
legitimate abortion or induce someone to have an abortion who 
wouldnt otherwise questions of payment questions of control over 
the tissue whether it can be sold to commercial companies or 
whoever questions of safety 
caplan who noted that the ban on national institutes of health 
research in the field does not keep private researchers from 
performing such experiments said he knows of three instances in 
which women considered becoming pregnant to produce fetal tissue 
that could be used to help treat their own diseases or those of a 
relative 
i think those are totally immoral because of a basic principle 
that you dont create life solely for the purpose of destroying 
it he said 
the only documented use of the specific experimental procedure 
nih scientists were barred from undertaking occurred in january 
when surgeons in mexico city said they had injected tissue from a 
miscarried fetus into the brains of two parkinsons sufferers 
parkinsons disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is 
potentially fatal the fetal tissue is believed to work by 
stimulating production of dopamine a brain chemical lacking in 
people who suffer from parkinsons 
the decision to keep nih scientists from going forward with a 
transplant experiment came last week in a letter from dr robert e 
windom assistant secretary of health at the department of health 
and human services to nih director james b wyngaarden 
this proposal raises a number of questions primarily ethical 
and legal that have not been satisfactorily addressed either 
within the public health service or within society windom wrote 
the letter instructs wyngaarden to appoint an outside advisory 
committee to examine the ethical medical and legal implications of 
using tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses 
the prohibition does not ban continuing research on tissue from 
fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths but that type generally 
is not feasible to use in the kind of transplant research the nih 
proposal contemplated 
a few conferences have been held by ethicists and researchers on 
the new technology but no clear consensus has emerged 
a letter published in science magazine last year by participants 
in a seminar at case western reserve university is one of the 
clearest statements on the potential questions 
the letter recommended that there should be a clear separation 
between decisions related to the acquisition of tissue and 
decisions regarding the transplanting of tissue into a recipient 
judith areen a georgetown university law professor who was on 
the panel explained friday in an interview in other words you 
dont want the fact of transplantation to be the reason a woman has 
an abortion 
a second recommendation was that the donor not know the 
recipient

for treasury secretary james a baker iii the 
mr smooth of the reagan administration it was a rare public 
relations disaster 
he had a careful script which called for finance leaders of the 
seven major industrial countries to demonstrate closeknit harmony 
as a way of reassuring financial markets of their resolve to 
continue stabilizing the dollar 
the groups communique which included many of bakers pet 
proposals was approved and issued on schedule wednesday but after 
that the script went badly awry 
instead of rallying on the news financial markets chose to 
focus the next day on a disappointing report that the us trade 
deficit unexpectedly rose in february to 138 billion 
the bad news sent the dollar into a nosedive and the major 
industrial countries had to launch hurriedly a multimilliondollar 
rescue effort to try to brake the fall 
by friday after spending by some estimates more than 700 
million to buy dollars on currency exchanges the seven industrial 
powers were able to stabilize the dollar but at a level 2 percent 
below where it was before the countries began their meetings 
wednesday 
and the turmoil raised anew troubling questions about the 
fragility of world financial markets which baker had hoped to put 
to rest with a show of unity this week 
the meeting of the socalled group of seven the united states 
japan west germany britain france canada and italy was being 
held in conjunction with the semiannual meeting of the 151nation 
international monetary fund and its sister organization the world 
bank 
world bank president barber conable said friday it was critical 
that the two lending organizations face up to the need to reduce 
poor countries debt burden which is estimated to total 1245 
trillion at the end of this year 
nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer offered as 
one solution a plan to reduce the interest rates the debtor 
countries pay on their loans 
all of us know that there is no way in which the poorest 
countries can meet their interest payments he said the 
interest burden thus mounts exponentially and the poorest countries 
are thus caught in a vicious circle 
btg chidzero zimbabwes finance minister warned at a news 
conference that there could be political and social upheavals in 
third world countries unless the debt problem is solved 
they would not leave the industrial countries untouched 
chidzero said 
but in between discussions about debt the finance ministers 
found themselves having to deal in hastily called meetings with the 
plunging dollar 
administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that baker and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan huddled 
at imf headquarters thursday with japanese finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa and west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg to 
discuss the dollar selloff 
canadian finance minister michael wilson told reporters friday 
that he believed the markets had calmed in part because investors 
realized that the underlying fundamentals of the economy are sound 
with growth continuing at good rates despite last octobers stock 
market collapse 
i think the reaction thursday was one of surprise but we all 
realize that the trade figures are erratic and as people reflected 
on that things calmed down he said 
dutch finance minister h onno ruding who heads the imfs 
policymaking committee said the market turmoil did not cause the 
countries to make any major changes to their final communique 
which predicted continued growth at a steady moderate pace 
this year 
we are trying to improve the world economic system 
regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day ruding

representatives of organized labor the state 
of michigan and parts manufacturers continued their criticism of 
the us freetrade agreement with canada telling a senate panel 
it benefits big automakers but no one else 
the big three is very happy with the agreement and they 
should be said marc santucci trade representative for michigan 
where the large automakers have their headquarters it is a very 
good agreement for the companies it is not such a good agreement 
for the country 
as we become a global economy we have companies no longer 
speaking for the best interests of the country santucci told the 
senate finance committee 
but thomas hanna president of the motor vehicles manufacturers 
association which represents the major automakers called the 
treaty one that we believe advances us national interests 
while helping the industry 
the agreement which requires passage by both houses of congress 
without amendment would eliminate trade barriers between the two 
nations on a wide range of goods and services the automotive 
sector accounts for about onethird of trade between the united 
states and canada 
one provision of the agreement strongly criticized by the united 
auto workers parts makers and the michigan representative allows 
canada to retain until 1996 agreements giving preferential duty 
treatment to manufacturers from outside north america having 
canadian production 
sen donald riegle a michigan democrat and member of the 
finance committee said that provision would have effects lasting 
far beyond 1996 
it is widely acknowledged that particularly in the case of 
japanese manufacturers once a part supplier is chosen it is a 
relationship of long standing riegle said by providing 
canadian suppliers with this advantage for the next seven years 
us parts producers are cut out of future opportunities to supply 
these plants 
hanna said the manufacturers supported immediate elimination of 
duty remissions but he called the delay a compromise worth 
accepting and supporting 
a second provision the uaw and parts suppliers would like to see 
removed requires vehicles shipped dutyfree between the two nations 
to have 50 percent north american content 
the uaw believes the content figure in the agreement is not 
high enough to assure the use of locally produced engines 
transmission and other major components said steve beckman the 
international economist for the uaw 
it would allow the big three to shrink the north american 
content of their vehicles down to the new standard which is far 
below the present level he said 
the manufacturers believe a 50 percent rule of origin is 
sufficiently high to do the job it was designed to do and that 
is to ensure that the benefits of the agreement accrue to those 
companies and products which can reasonably and fairly be 
considered as canadian or american in origin hanna said

the worlds rice bowl is skimpier this year 
and the agriculture department says that could help american rice 
growers export more in the early months of the 198889 season 
world rice production from the 198788 harvests is forecast at 
304 million metric tons milled equivalent down 4 percent from 
last year the departments economic research service said friday 
weak monsoons left asian producers with limited exportable supplies 
meanwhile global rice consumption is expected to increase 3 
percent leaving world stockpiles at their lowest level relative to 
use since 1974 
recently world production shortfalls and declining stocks in 
major importing countries have led to large world imports the 
report said however world trade in 1988 is expected to decline 
18 percent because high prices and reduced supplies in major 
exporting countries have deterred imports 
the us rice supply also has tightened reflecting a 6 percent 
reduction in last years harvest 
but the departments planting survey in early march indicated 
american producers intend to boost 1988 rice plantings by 19 
percent to 28 million acres that could boost this years output 
to around 155 million hundredweight from 128 million in 1987 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and there are slightly more 
than 22 hundredweight in a ton 
us farmers will harvest rice crops at least four months 
ahead of their asian competitors the report said since the 
united states will be the major source of supply during those 
months some increased export opportunities may exist towards the 
end of 1988 
however analysts cautioned that some foreign importers if 
possible may choose to wait until the beginning of 1989 when 
prices are likely to decline during the asian harvest 
the report said some foreign importers also have been 
substituting wheat for higherpriced rice 
in addition shipments of us rice under food aid are 
expected to decrease this year because of high prices the report 
said

the agriculture departments conservation 
chief says more volunteers are needed to help carry out a massive 
program aimed at protecting the nations soil and water resources 
wilson scaling head of the soil conservation service says that 
in 1987 some 2200 volunteers provided more than 1 million worth 
of assistance to agency field offices 
this earth team he said friday put in more than 132000 
hours in helping with tree planting making inventories of 
wetlands conservation education telephoning landowners to inform 
them of the conservervation reserve program and providing clerical 
and other office work 
many of the volunteers have expertise in geology biology 
botany surveying mapping and soil and erodibility 
determinations scaling said 
under 1985 farm law farmers with highly erodible cropland must 
have a conservation plan approved by dec 31 1989 and have it 
implemented by dec 31 1994 or lose usda benefits such as price 
support loans payments and insurance 
scaling said the agency estimates that 800000 conservation 
plans still need to be developed nationwide 
anyone interested in volunteering for the earth team he said 
can call 1800the soil for the location of the local office 
volunteers receive coverage for injury claims are compensated for

congress is moving the nation on a path some 
lawmakers say will switch the us energy appetite from the 
political quagmire of the persian gulf to the more inviting 
mountains of west virginia and cornfields of iowa 
the path is alternative motor fuels substances like methanol 
and ethanol that advocates say can curb growing us dependence on 
imported petroleum and cut the trade deficit 
conversion of the us car and light truck fleet to methanol 
means that the energy crisis would be over for generations 
says a principal backer of the switch sen jack danforth rmo 
on friday the senate gave voicevote approval to legislation by 
danforth and sen jay rockefeller dwva designed to encourage 
automakers to begin massproducing alternative fuel vehicles by 
1993 
although there are concerns about the effects of some fuels on 
the environment it is all but certain that congress will enact 
alternative fuels legislation in 1988 
a similar bill was passed overwhelmingly by the house earlier 
this year the bills differences will have to be resolved by 
negotiators from both chambers 
the proposals envision an america where cars are powered by fuel 
produced by abundant domestic resources ethanol is made from 
grains like corn methanol which powers indianapolis 500 race 
cars is produced from coal or natural gas 
but senate environment committee members are warning that 
alternative fuels are not a nirvana they say coalbased methanol 
will increase emissions of carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas 
that some scientists say contributes to a dangerous overheating of 
the earths atmosphere 
danforth says the legislation would break an impasse that now 
prevents any widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative 
fuels 
automakers are unwilling to produce alternative fuel cars 
for which there is no current demand he said consumers are 
unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily available 
fuel supply and service stations are unwilling to provide fuel for 
cars that are not on the road 
rockefeller said that besides lessening the growing us need 
for imported oil a conversion of just 10 percent of the us 
vehicle fleet to coalbased methanol would mean jobs for 20000 
miners in the depressed coal industry 
the senators say the legislation would make it easier for 
automakers to meet the federal requirement that their fleets have 
an average fuel economy of at least 26 miles per gallon 
encouraging the use of the alternative fuels 
sens robert stafford rvt and john chafee rri members 
of the environment committee are urging caution however because 
of possible environmental and health problems 
stafford said coalderived methanol would double emissions of 
carbon dioxide and bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions 
of formaldehyde a cancercausing chemical 
he said a growing number of scientists are warning that mans 
production of greenhouse gases is overloading the atmosphere 
trapping heat around the earth and threatening major climate 
changes 
once we commit to a program like this it will be too late

a group of union presidents and business 
leaders is seeking a thaw in labormanagement relations in part by 
encouraging experiments on employee participation in business 
decisions 
united steelworkers of america president lynn williams hailed 
the position paper endorsed friday by 19 labor leaders and 
corporate officers as a landmark in labormanagement relations 
the leaders are members of the collective bargaining forum a 
group formed in 1985 by bf goodrich co chairman john d ong and 
glenn watts president emeritus of the communication workers of 
america to increase dialogue between unions and businesses 
williams at a press conference friday conceded the strategies 
in the paper on new directions for labor and management were 
provoked in part by troubled times 
the nations unions suffered a net loss of 62000 members last 
year despite an increase of 25 million in the number of americans 
holding fulltime jobs 
the document published by the department of labor said it is 
widely recognized that american industry must enhance its 
competitiveness in world markets 
besides williams union officials on the forum included united 
automobile workers president owen bieber communication workers of 
america president morton bahr and howard samuel president of the 
industrial union department of the aflcio 
corporate officers included csx transportation co president 
john snow ameritech corp chairman william l weiss and ford motor 
chairman donald petersen 
the document encouraged labor and management to experiment with 
sharing information and participation of workers in strategic and 
management business decisions such arrangements it said could 
defuse tensions caused by unions whose positions force them to 
concentrate more on preserving current benefits than on increasing 
firms abilities to compete 
the report also said management should treat employees job 
security at the policy level considering it alongside other 
business strategies ameritechs weiss said 
but weiss said the newlydefined management responsibilities are 
by no means a oneway street unions too have to take a broader 
view of their responsibilities and of where their best interests 
lie 
the report said workers could enhance their own job security by 
taking advantage of educational opportunities and accepting new 
jobs with an employer if their old positions become obsolete 
the document was short on specifics not mentioning for 
example a sweeping trade bill on capitol hill williams and other 
labor leaders have been pushing for the bill to include a provision 
requiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60day 
notice of plant closings or layoffs under many situations

former president richard nixon told the 
nations newspaper editors vice president george bush will beat 
democrat michael dukakis in a squeaker in novembers presidential 
election 
one of only two men to have run five times for national office 
nixon told the annual convention of the american society of 
newspaper editors on friday that bush will carry the south and put 
together enough electoral votes through the farm belt and mountain 
states to carry him to the white house 
nixon ran successfully twice for president and twice for vice 
president and lost the presidential race in 1960 the other 
fivetime national candidate was franklin d roosevelt who won the 
presidency four times but lost as a vice presidential candiate in 
1920 
before the same group of editors in 1984 nixon correctly 
predicted that walter mondale would be the democratic nominee but 
incorrectly foresaw that mondale would choose thencolorado sen 
gary hart or sen lloyd bentsen dtexas as his running mate 
mondale ran with geraldine ferraro then a new york congresswoman 
on friday he gave a statebystate rundown of this years race 
to a packed room at the convention 
first on the east coast dukakis will win massachusetts new 
york pennsylvania said nixon speaking rapidly without notes 
bush will win florida south carolina virginia dukakis will win 
maryland 
north carolina i would call virtually a tossup a slight edge 
to bush 
nixon said the midwest is tough to call dukakis will win 
michigan bush will win indiana ohio and illinois they could 
go either way 
but he said bush should beat dukakis in the south 
the farm states unless you have kansas sen bob dole on the 
ticket or someone else with appeal in the agricultural areas 
were going to find a situation where dukakis is going to win in 
minnesota south dakota north dakota and iowa bush will hold 
kansas and nebraska and oklahoma missouri is a tossup always is 
the mountain states nixon continued bush will win all of 
them except montana and possibly new mexico 
the west coast washington dukakis oregon about even 
california the big enchilada you pay your money and take your 
choice 
and finally said nixon in the end i believe bush will win in 
a very close election

trustees for the multiple sclerosis society 
were told in advance of plans to hire attorney general edwin 
meeses wife ursula with money from the foundation of a wealthy 
washington realestate family the society attorney says 
attorney james bierbower said friday he had found minutes in 
society records that showed the board of trustees was advised of 
the plan at a dec 12 1985 meeting mrs meese started work in 
january 1986 
bierbower said the trustees didnt vote on the plan for mrs 
meese who was hired at 40000 a year with funds from the bender 
foundation 
independent counsel james mckay is investigating mrs meeses 
hiring as part of his inquiry into whether the attorney general 
violated federal law through any conflict of interest between his 
familys financial affairs and his government duties 
a partnership headed by howard m bender the foundations vice 
president later won a 50 million lease to provide offices for the 
justice department in a building the government once planned to 
move out of 
some ms trustees had complained that they only read of mrs 
meeses hiring in newspaper accounts in the last two weeks not all 
board members attend each quarterly meeting 
bierbower said the minutes revealed trustees were told a grant 
from the bender foundation would enable the chapter to hire a 
development consultant to work fulltime in seeking nongovernment 
funding for the job placement program 
the minutes continued ursula meese will be joining the staff 
in this capacity and also will continue to serve on the board of 
trustees 
bierbower said he thought the board was informed of the grant by 
jeanne bradley the societys executive director 
he said the minutes do not reflect that any vote was taken i 
would imagine it was just a noobjection notification he said 
mrs meese 56 had been a volunteer at the agency since 1981 
and was herself a trustee she was hired to expand operation job 
match which finds work for ms victims

the former underboss of the cleveland mob says 
narcotics trafficking has broken down the once ironclad obedience 
that us organized crime members had for their leaders 
angelo lonardo the former underboss of the cleveland family of 
la cosa nostra testified friday that younger members of the mob 
dont take orders like they used to 
these younger members go ahead and do things on their own 
he told the senate permanent investigations subcommittee 
lonardo blamed the breakdown on the willingness of younger 
mobsters to ignore their leaders rules against narcotics 
trafficking 
greed is causing younger members to go into narcotics without 
the knowledge of the families said the 77yearold lonardo who 
is currently in the federal witness protection program and was 
shielded from the public by a screen 
last monday a former member of the sicilian mafia told the same 
panel that drugs were causing the same problem in italy 
tommaso buscetta told the subcommittee i have seen money 
drugs and greed corrupt and destroy the cosa nostra code of honor 
and loyalty to the families 
i began to realize that drugs had changed everything the 
family loyalties and codes of respect that i had known as a mafioso 
were quickly becoming things of the past 
lonardo who testified under a grant of immunity said the mob 
leaders dont like the narcotics trade because it usually brings 
greater scrutiny from law enforcement organizations 
lonardo also testified that organized crime played a large role 
in teamsters union affairs including the elections of former 
president roy l williams and current president jackie presser 
he said he was part of a 1981 effort to line up organized crime 
support for williams successful candidacy 
and when it became clear that an indictment against williams 
would force him to step down lonardo said he traveled to chicago 
to obtain organized crimes backing of cleveland native presser 
presser who currently is under indictment was the protege 
of a man affiliated with the cleveland mob and it was felt his 
election would increase the cleveland familys prestige and 
respect lonardo said 
at teamsters headquarters in washington there was no one 
available to comment on lonardos testimony friday 
lonardo said many of the teamsters union officials were made 
inducted into organized crime families before getting their 
union positions 
they listen to the families that made them he said its 
mostly the delegates and the vice presidents they get their jobs 
through the families 
the delegates who elect the top teamsters are members of la 
cosa nostra nunn asked lonardo said that was the case 
presser who heads the cleveland local of the teamsters in 
addition to the international union is under indictment on charges 
of union racketeering and conspiracy to embezzle by having ghost 
employees on the union payroll 
presser said the fbi authorized his actions and faces trial in 
july in cleveland 
williams was convicted of offering a bribe to former sen howard 
cannon dnev in trying to block trucking deregulation 
legislation

president reagan and his top advisers 
discussed a us response to the mine explosion in the persian gulf 
that almost sank an american frigate according to an 
administration source who refused to say whether military 
retaliation was considered 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity also would not 
say if any decisions were made 
maj david super a pentagon spokesman said late friday he had 
no information on any plans for military action in the gulf area in 
response to the incident which injured 10 sailors aboard the uss 
samuel b roberts 
the pentagon said it believed the mines were made by iran but 
us officials say they do not know who placed the mines in the 
gulf 
the white house discussion occurred at a regular meeting friday 
of the national security council and was among many topics 
discussed at the session which was dominated by planning for 
reagans may 29june 2 summit in moscow with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev the source said 
bob hall a white house spokesman declined comment saying 
we never discuss these kinds of meetings at the white house 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked during a briefing 
earlier friday whether the administration planned to retaliate for 
the mining said we never discuss future military actions 
asked if the administration had determined who was responsible 
for the mining he said no we have not 
the pentagon meanwhile said two mines found later in the area 
near where the explosion occurred were identical to the ones 
recovered last autumn from an iranian ship but were new mines that 
had been put in the gulf recently 
these were shiny bright mines super said the mines are 
identical to the ones recovered aboard the iranian ship the ajr 
that we intercepted several months ago that had the mines aboard 
it 
the earlier mines were made by iran he said adding we 
believe that these were of iranian manufacture as well 
the washington post reported in todays editions that the group 
that met at the white house discussed a wide range of possible 
military responses to the roberts incident but the newspaper 
citing sources it did not identify said reagan settled for 
assessing military options rather than acting on any of them 
the newspaper said officials said one reason a military strike 
had not been ordered was the lack of hard evidence that iran laid 
the mines 
iran and iraq have been at war in the area for 7 years the 
roberts was in the gulf as part of the us operation escorting 
americanflagged kuwaiti tankers through the waterway to protect 
them from iranian attacks 
the options discussed at the meeting according to the post 
ranged from a simple show of force by sending the battleship uss 
new jersey to the region to launching a retaliatory strike against 
a long list of possible targets 
according to the pentagon the two mines spotted from the air by 
a reconnaissance helicopter were photographed and later destroyed 
by a navy team 
spokesman lt col keith schneider said the mines were moored by 
cables to the bottom of the gulf and the navy will search for more 
mines at daylight saturday 
the roberts on friday was being towed to dubai for repairs all 
10 sailors injured in the explosion remained hospitalized and two 
of them were in critical condition

michael dukakis got praise but no endorsement from gov mario 
cuomo but saw his support solidifying in the polls heading into 
the final weekend before new yorks pivotal primary 
the frontrunner argued long distance with vice president george 
bush friday over the reagan administrations antidrug efforts as 
jesse jackson mocked the claims of other candidates and said im 
the general in the drug war 
while dukakis and jackson were aiming their rhetoric at 
republicans tennessee sen albert gore jr took out more loans as 
polls showed his new york support languishing in the single digits 
a finish that could cripple his campaign 
dukakis made the same pilgrimage to the state capitol in albany 
on friday that jackson made earlier in the week and heard 
virtually the same words of praise 
cuomo said at a news conference that dukakis is a singularly 
important democratic leader 
two days earlier the governor had told jackson he was 
singularly important democrat 
questioned by reporters cuomo said all the democratic 
candidates including gore were singularly important no 
matter where they finish 
despite cuomos armslength praise the dukakis campaign is 
getting more encouragement from polls being released in the final 
days before new york democrats vote tuesday on their 255 delegates 
several showed the massachusetts governor with a comfortable 
lead over jackson with gore a distant third 
an abc newswashington post tracking poll released friday 
evening had dukakis with 44 percent jackson 37 percent and gore 10 
percent the poll was conducted wednesday and thursday among 268 
likely democratic voters in new york with a margin of error of 7 
percentage points 
and the marist college institute for public opinion indicated 
dukakis may have overcome the weakness of support that marked his 
early contests it said 67 percent of his support was strong 9 
points better than walter mondales in 1984 when mondale won the 
state 
while the candidates focused on highstakes new york arizona 
democrats trooped to caucuses today to register their preference 
that lowprofile contest with 36 delegates up for grabs was seen 
as a jacksondukakis duel 
in addition south carolina and north dakota democrats gathered 
at state conventions and put their final stamp on delegations to 
the democratic national convention in july at earlier caucuses 
jackson resoundingly won south carolina dukakis was the winner in 
north dakota 
dukakis and jackson turned to the drug issue friday blasting 
reagan administration efforts against drug trafficking 
in albany dukakis criticized the administration for putting 
drugpeddling panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega on 
the us payroll 
why do we have money for star wars and not money for a war 
against drugs he asked the greatest threat in this hemisphere 
is not the sandinistas its the avalanche of drugs 
jackson hit the same theme at a queens housing project 
ridiculing administration antidrug efforts as well as his 
democratic rivals 
he described dukakis and gore as captains and lieutenants in the 
battle against drugs and said im the general in this war 
late friday jackson addressed several thousand people at a gay 
and lesbian rally in greenwich village 
i stood with you because it was the right thing to do he 
told them 
his statement that testing for aids must be voluntary and 
confidential drew loud cheers from the crowd that extended a full 
block 
dukakis toured a greenwich village residence for people 
suffering from aids and encountered a handful of protesters nearby 
chanting gays vote too dukakis has stirred opposition from 
some militant gays because of his states policy of giving a low 
priority to gays in seeking to become foster parents 
he ended a long campaign day with a private meeting with costa 
rican president oscar arias at new yorks plaza hotel saying he 
had discussed with arias the progress of the central american peace 
plan 
bush held a unity meeting with former rival kansas sen bob 
dole and stepped up his criticism of the democrats saying their 
comments on drugs were demagogic statements 
it is this administration that has brought noriega to justice 
or at least taken the first step bush told the annual convention 
of the american society of newspaper editors 
meanwhile gore has begun to feel financial pressure 
gores campaign is 16 million in debt after taking out 
100000 in new loans from banks in his home state he has spent at 
least 700000 on new york television advertising about half of 
what dukakis has spent

him about money the prosecution said

patrolman from 1978 to 1985 when was fired for violating 
disciplinary rules

in april 1943 poorly armed fighters in 
warsaws walled jewish ghetto appealed to poles to join them in 
their dignified but doomed struggle to turn back the nazi tide 
fortyfive years later poles and jews painfully discussed the 
response to that appeal during a remarkable twoday conference on 
struggle and martyrdom during the nazi occupation emotional wounds 
reopened 
the conference attended by several hundred poles and jewish 
visitors coincided with the 45th anniversary of the ghetto 
uprising when jews held off the final nazi extermination drive for 
nearly a month 
it was attended by several polish government ministers senior 
polish communist party officials roman catholic bishops as well as 
jews from israel the united states and other western countries 
but the discussions onstage and in the corridors thursday and 
friday only showed that 45 years later jews and poles still find 
it difficult to talk with each other about the past 
israel gutman professor of jewish history at the hebrew 
university in jerusalem took sharp issue with what he called 
disastrous papers by some polish historians who claim the 
predominantly roman catholic poles played an active role in aiding 
residents of the jewish ghetto 
to my regret only a very small part of that is identical with 
the truth he said 
gutman is one of the few living survivors of the uprising in 
which hundreds of poorly armed jews fought a heroic but doomed 
threeweek battle resisting the final nazi drive to liquidate the 
ghettos last 70000 inhabitants 
the true picture is that until a certain period of time there 
was no contact between jews and nonjews said gutman who 
survived auschwitz and other nazi concentration camps before 
emigrating to israel after the war 
there was not help they poles did not lift a finger to help 
the hungry people in the ghetto gutman in an interview later 
in his conference paper gutman said the polish underground did 
not begin organized assistance for the ghetto until late 1942 
nearly two years after the nazis sealed off nearly 450000 jews 
within the ghetto walls 
most of them died of hunger disease or in the gas chambers of 
treblinka and other death camps 
kazimierz kakol chairman of the polish government commission 
for the investigation of nazi war crimes blamed the western powers 
for remaining deaf to calls to rescue polish jews despite 
receiving reports smuggled out by the polish underground about the 
nazis systematic annihilation of more than three million polish 
jews 
we poles did our utmost to help jews in their hour of 
death kakol said in a speech to the conference 
if the assistance was little it was because the possibilities 
for assistance were so small he said stressing that poles faced 
the death penalty from their nazi occupiers if they assisted jews 
some jews at the conference expressed outrage at what they 
considered attempts to distort the picture of polish assistance to 
jews 
abraham cykiert 62 of melbourne australia a polish jew who 
survived the auschwitz and buchenwald death camps said he returned 
to say goodbye to 1000 years of jewish history in poland 
they poles do not realize that by trying to show more than 
was done to help they only antagonize the jews who have suffered 
with their pain he said 
they are laundering their own history here said doris 
epstein of toronto a psychologist who works with holocaust 
survivors 
one polish speaker drew applause from both jews and poles when 
she expressed shame over an officially inspired antisemitic 
campaign following 1968 campus protests that led to the emigration 
of most of polands remaining jews only about 10000 mostly 
elderly jews live in poland today 
irena maciejewska a warsaw university faculty member said she 
felt awkward sharing the stage with people who injured the good 
name of poland in 1968 apparently referring to kakol a former 
editor who has been linked to the purge of jews from official posts 
as a university person i painfully remember that time and as 
a pole i should be ashamed of it she said

the knickerbocker news published its final 
edition in its 145year history topping it with a banner headline 
that read we say farewell 
capital newspapers which published the afternoon newspaper and 
the morning timesunion blamed the death friday of the 
knickerbocker news on declining circulation 
paid circulation for the last edition was 28000 down from a 
peak of almost 70000 in 1973 
the departure of the knickerbocker news leaves new york states 
capital with only one newspaper 
the knick as it was known locally began publication in 1843 as 
the albany knickerbocker from 1879 to 1928 when the gannett co 
purchased it the paper was known as the knickerbocker press it 
became the knickerbocker news in 1937 the hearst corp which owns 
capital newspapers purchased the newspaper in 1960 
the nearly 40 staff members who worked only for the news will 
join the timesunion which will become an allday newspaper 
monday officials said the two newspapers shared personnel in 
several departments 
four people were laid off as a result of the knickerbocker news 
demise and 39 took voluntary retirement said publisher joseph t 
lyons 
it is a strategic marketing decision lyons said it is 
somewhat sad to lose a newspaper and a flag on the other hand 
looking ahead were going to be able to devote our talents to a 
bigger better newspaper to serve our readers better its sort of 
a natural evolution 
current and retired staff members gathered in the newsroom 
friday and reminisced about their years with the paper said 
afternoon news editor warren carlson 
carlson a staff member for 31 years said he was too busy with 
his new duties to talk much about the old days 
im looking more ahead than back said carlson who now is 
on the timesunions editorial page staff its too bad but we 
know these things happen some of the younger people they take it 
in stride i cant get emotional now because its kind of hectic 
right now

the executive committee of harris countys 
democratic party on friday stripped the newly elected chairman a 
supporter of political extremist lyndon larouche of virtually all 
power 
the committee consisting of the 664 precinct chairmen approved 
by a quick voice vote final adoption of new party bylaws initially 
passed march 11 in the aftershock of claude jones stunning victory 
over incumbent larry veselka 
the bylaws were drafted within three days of jones election 
jones won the march 8 primary with 54394 votes or 51 percent 
to veseklas 51318 votes or 49 percent veselka an attorney 
blamed his loss on not being able to campaign because of a trial he 
was handling outside houston 
the new bylaws give powers to the party secretary that were 
previously held by the chairman including recordkeeping and 
managing party finances the secretary will be elected may 2 
about a halfdozen supporters of jones carried picket signs 
reading larry dont be a sore loser and will harris county 
executives reject majority rule during the meeting 
i kind of expected that it would be passed jones said it 
passed without a quorum so you know what that tells you 
on thursday state district judge melinda harmon denied without 
comment a request from jones to block the changes in bylaws jones 
had argued that the rule changes will interfere with his statutory 
duties 
there have been numerous wild and paranoid statements making 
it very clear they will do everything they can to contain me 
jones said thursday 
jones 40 said friday he did not know if the issue would be 
taken back to court 
jones who was defeated by veselka in 1986 said his sole 
occupation is working for larouche he said he staffs solicitation 
booths the larouche organization sponsors at airports and other 
public places 
jones said he will back the democratic presidential nominee 
although he supports larouche who has accused queen elizabeth of 
drug trafficking and espouses a quarantine of aids patients

leaders of the nicaraguan rebels met 
arrived friday night and began their first highlevel peace talks 
with the leftist government in an effort to end a war that is more 
than six years old 
the two sides began the longawaited talks about two hours after 
the contras arrival none of the negotiators spoke to reporters as 
they went into the meeting at the camino real hotel near the 
airport about four miles north of the capital 
the negotiators met for less than an hour and agreed to resume 
discussions saturday morning 
adolfo calero head of the rebels umbrella group the 
nicaraguan resistance led the delegation of more than 40 leaders 
which arrived on a commercial flight from san jose costa rica 
the staterun voice of nicaragua which carried details of the 
rebels arrival said the delegation included pedro joaquin 
chamorro alfredo cesar azucena ferrey her brother roberto and 
aristides sanchez 
it said relatives of the rebels gathered at sandino 
international airport to see their family members some of whom 
have not been in managua since 1979 
violetta chamorro coowner of the opposition newspaper la 
prensa waited with the others to see her son pedro joaquin 
the contras also were met at the airport by marta sacasa 
spokeswoman for the rebels and david stadthagen and jose davila 
members of the contra who had arrived on an earlier flight 
the flight carrying calero and the other leaders was delayed by 
more than four hours 
earlier friday leftist youths pelted the la prensa building 
with rocks about 300 teenagers demonstrated outside the building 
they said they were members of a group called sandinista youth and 
were protesting the papers support of the contras 
witnesses who insisted on anonymity said a young man was 
slightly injured by a pail thrown from the roof of the building 
la prensa is about two miles from managuas sandino 
international airport and near the hotel where the contra 
delegation was to stay 
the interior ministry immediately banned all demonstrations and 
alcohol sales around the airport and hotel and closed the main road 
to the airport 
the highlevel talks could set the stage for an end to the war 
that has claimed more than 26000 lives since it began in november 
1981 according to the government 
agreement on the technical issues of a ceasefire was reached 
during talks that ended friday in the southern border post of 
sapoa 90 miles from managua and the two sides agreed to further 
technical talks at the highlevel meetings 
details of the sapoa talks were not made public immediately but 
in a joint communique friday the contra and sandinista delegates 
said considerable progress had been made on reconciling earlier 
differences 
a tenuous 60day ceasefire has been in force since april 1 as 
part of an accord the two sides reached in earlier sapoa talks 
march 23 under that agreement the usbacked contras would 
gather in ceasefire zones until a permanent truce was negotiated 
but the two sides were unable to agree on important technical 
issues such as verification how the rebels would be resupplied or 
whether they should be allowed to keep their weapons 
as part of the deal the leftist sandinistas released 100 of the 
3200 political prisoners and rebels they hold and pledged to 
release the rest gradually as the contras gather in the ceasefire 
zones 
but the entire process has been marked by bickering with each 
side accusing the other of violating the accord 
contra leaders have also accused the sandinistas of releasing 
only 10 of the prisoners they wanted freed but the sandinistas 
claimed the agreement did not specify names 
each side threatened to cancel the talks several times but by 
friday they finally were able to compromise on most points 
fridays talks in managua mark the first time since the war 
began that the sandinistas have allowed contra leaders to openly 
come to managua 
apparently the toughest unresolved issue concerns weapons the 
sandinistas have insisted the rebels give up their weapons before 
they can participate in the countrys political activities 
some contra leaders say they will never disarm and others say

the army is refusing to provide the land or 
help to build a church for mormon employees at a utah military 
installation who claim the building they now share with other 
religious groups is too small 
the army is opposed in principle to the construction and 
exclusive use of a private house of worship by any religious 
organization on a military installation assistant army secretary 
delbert l spurlock wrote in a letter to congressional committees 
sen jake garn rutah had argued that better space is needed 
because so many members of the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints work at the isolated dugway proving ground which employs 
about 700 mormon workers 
but spurlock said in his letter no statutory authority exists 
which would permit this at dugway and if such authority were 
proposed by congress it would likely violate constitutional 
provisions against the government establishment of religion

federal officials say the roundup of 20 people 
in hong kong and the united states in the breakup of a chinese 
heroin importation ring reflects the growing influence of asian 
criminal gangs 
drugimporting asian criminal gangs are moving in to fill the 
void left by the successful prosecution of sicilian mafia members 
in the united states fbi director william sessions said in a 
statement friday 
cracking the chinese heroin ring with a series of arrests friday 
ended a twoyear undercover probe called operation bamboo dragon 
that was launched after federal agents were told a restaurant owner 
in the chinatown section of washington was buying stolen firearms 
and distributing cocaine 
eleven people were arrested in hong kong and nine in the united 
states as investigators seized 137 pounds of heroin worthover 100 
million 
five of those arrested in new york were charged with conspiring 
to supply 1000 m16 military rifles to undercover federal agents 
and to provide false documents so that the rifles could be shipped 
to libya said the us customs service and the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
this gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into the 
hands of terrorists and drug smugglers customs commissioner 
william von raab said in a statement federal officials said at a 
news conference that the ring had supplied 600 handguns mostly to 
chinese gangs 
the fbi and atf inserted undercover operatives into the 
operation including a chinesespeaking agent who portrayed himself 
as a drug dealer 
the cantonesespeaking federal agent frederick yau met with 
gang members in washington and hong kong to negotiate the purchase 
of heroin from asia 
the heroin came from burma and china and was transported to san 
francisco and new york citys chinatown it also was distributed to 
newark nj alexandria va and washington 
us members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen or 
illegally obtained pistols machine guns and rifles on the streets 
of new york city usually to chinese gangs 
many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulent 
identification documents from gun shops in fort worth dallas and 
houston texas the officials said 
the chinese gangs were buying ar15 semiautomatic rifles the 
civilian version of the armys m16 rifle and converting them 
into fully automatic m16s 
customs and atf undercover agents bought 10 weapons from the 
five people charged in new york city and ordered 1000 more m16s 
that were to be delivered to libya such shipments would have 
violated the arms export control act which sets up federal 
licensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries 
the drug enforcement administration was a major participant in 
the probe law enforcement officials said at a news conference in

a veteran us marine sergeants 
account of his companys alleged firefight with mysterious 
intruders at a fuel depot near panama city has left unanswered a 
number of major questions 
foremost among them who were the highly professional 
intruders he said moved in military formations wore dark uniforms 
carried sophisticated nightvision equipment and were trying to 
provoke the marines 
first sgt alexander j nevglovski declined to speculate friday 
on whether the intruders he said he and his men engaged in a 
twohour firefight tuesday night were panamanian soldiers 
but asked to assess the motives and actions of intruders he 
said appeared monday and tuesday night at the arraijan tank farm 
near howard air force base the 24year marine veteran replied 
they were training they were using us for training aides 
they were harassing us they were very provoking they were 
basically using us as training aides to see how they can get 
around and how they cant get around to see how they can get 
detected and how they cant get detected 
col ron sconyers chief spokesman for the us southern 
command said a full investigation into the two incidents was still 
under way and results would not be available for at least another 
day or two 
he said nevglovski spoke to reporters in light of skeptical 
reports in us newspapers and ridicule from the panamanian 
government 
panamas military has described the marines as inexperienced 
troops who were shooting at swaying palm trees 
a pentagon spokesman told reporters in washington tuesday that 
intruders at the depot monday night appeared to belong to panamas 
defense forces which are commanded by the countrys de facto 
leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
a marine corporal was killed in that incident when he and 11 
other members of his patrol tried to surround what nevglovski 
described as a group of eight intruders 
us officials said the corporal was accidentally shot by fellow 
marines 
the reagan administration has been trying for months to oust 
noriega who was indicted on drug trafficking charges in florida 
two months ago but a series of economic sanctions that have 
crippled panamas economy have failed to budge the general 
also friday panama sent a formal protest to the united nations 
alleging us troops violated its sovereignty by closing a highway 
just outside the capital for three hours tuesday night after the 
alleged firefight began 
nevglovski told of two separate firefights tuesday night one 
involving him and about 90 other marines the other involving eight 
marines and a sailor surrounded on a hill about a half mile away 
he said he and other marines were called to reinforce a patrol 
that first sighted about 12 intruders at a fuel storage depot 
shortly before sundown tuesday the sergeant said he later 
personally counted about 40 of the unidentified men all wearing 
black uniforms 
they were highly professional said the sergeant who 
arrived in panama from camp lejeune nc last week as part of a 
1300man us military buildup they were good at what they 
did 
while nevglovski said he had the intruders almost constantly in 
view with a nightvision device i didnt see a weapon on them i 
cant say why we could see them clearly 
the sergeant said at least 12 of the intruders were standing in 
plain view atop one of the 36 underground fuel storage tanks in the 
807acre reserve which is only partially fenced 
nevglovski said he not only did not see the intruders carrying 
any weapons he could not guess what they used to open fire 
we received the first three rounds and our return fire 
lasted about 15 minutes the sergeant said what i could 
identify was three or four muzzle flashes coming from a certain 
area 
at that time i immediately went to my machine gunner and 
tapped him on the shoulder and told him to return fire 
nevglovski said he returned fire approximately 10 or 15 
rounds 
nevglovski said the intruders were headed toward his position 
in three different directions as they came down as if to make an 
encirclement all along they had been harassing us trying to 
provoke us to open fire but we held our ground and once we were 
fired upon we returned fire 
nevglovski also said the marines did not chase the intruders 
into surrounding jungle because a month or so earlier two air 
force mps military policemen chased an intruder into the jungle 
and one was hacked to death with a machete and the other was cut up 
pretty bad 
no such incident has been announced by the southern command and 
military spokesman later said the sergeant had repeated a rumor 
that had no basis in fact

the target was a residence believed to be a house of illfame 
we went and set up on the other corner from them and just 
began to share the gospel samudio said 
he said a life of alcohol drugs and fast living had left him 
emotionally and physically drained and that he sat at a lonesome 
texas crossroads and prayed for a direction 
i said which way do i go lord which way do i go samudio 
recalled it wasnt a booming voice though god can speak in any 
way he wants but he impressed on me to go south to head for the 
water 
in 1979 he found work as a deckhand on an oilfield supply boat 
and eventually worked his way up to crewboat captain

the ambassadors for christ but says the project is moving at 
its own pace since it isnt aimed at making money

bully for a tv wine commercial 
samudio explained that his ministry would suffer if he appeared 
to be looking for material riches 
if i go to a prison it only takes about 30 seconds for the 
people in a prison to clock you he said if im not for real 
i wont be able to fool them and i certainly cant fool god

house and commit these murders ortiz said 
miss mann was found slain along with her sisters jenniffer 19 
and martha 14 and brother ernest 11 in their mobile home early

ireland 
miss hanley said she would take time while convalescing to 
answer the nearly 600 letters she received from wellwishers who 
heard of her plight some as far away as new mexico 
after tearful goodbyes and laden with gifts miss hanley left 
weiss memorial hospital with her parents a month later than she had 
planned but much sooner than doctors and wellwishers had dared 
hope 
it was a miraculous recovery said dr richard bigg a 
surgeon who headed the team that treated ms hanley everyone is 
absolutely amazed 
the blackhaired aspiring actress came to chicago in february to 
see her boyfriend daniel stokes who is jailed on murder and armed 
robbery charges in the death of his landlord

return to dublin and suffered a fractured leg and hip

where miss hanley was working as an actress for his fathers 
theater company 
i remember getting hit ms hanley said late thursday but 
to tell you the truth since i woke up i dont remember a thing 
about it except i think i told the people in the ambulance i 
cant stay overnight i have to go home tomorrow 
before reaching the hospital she slipped into a coma doctors 
said later that the broken leg created a blockage in blood vessels 
carrying oxygen to her brain 
her parents rushed to chicago from dublin and were at her 
bedside 26 of her 29 days in the hospital 
they kept a roundtheclock hospital vigil while she was 
comatose playing tapes of irish folk music and taperecorded 
messages from her 13 brothers and sisters 
shortly before easter ms hanley awoke 
reports of the cashstrapped familys plight brought an 
outpouring of support from the local irish community and readers 
around the country 
i couldnt believe it ms hanley said i thought i was 
just another tourist but these people have been so nice 
a nurse accompanied ms hanley on the return trip to ireland at 
the hospitals expense and will help her develop an exercise 
regimen to strengthen her broken leg 
everybodys been wonderful but we miss our kids said her 
mother ann hanley reached at ohare international airport as she 
her husband stephen and their daughter prepared to leave for new 
york and a connecting flight to ireland 
and to tell you the truth mrs hanley said we could do

a machine gunwielding commando unit of 
seven men and one woman killed plo military commander khalil 
alwazir and three of his bodyguards at his suburban tunis house 
early today plo officials said 
khalil caught reading plo reports in his study drew his pistol 
but was sprayed with bullets said a plo spokesman who refused to 
be identified 
the 52yearold khalil also known as abu jihad was killed 
about 115 am 815 pm edt by commandos who drove up to the 
house shot to death a tunisian bodyguard driver and burst inside 
where they killed khalils two palestinian bodyguards the 
spokesman said 
they then broke into abu jihads study everything happened 
within seconds he had drawn his pistol to defend himself but they 
mowed him down with literally hundreds of submachinegun bullets 
khalils wife imjihad daughter hannan 14 and son nidal 2 
were in the house but were not hurt plo officials said khalils 
three other children were not home 
the plo spokesman blamed the israeli terrorists of mossad and 
their american backers who are determined to liquidate our people 
mossad is the israeli secret service and khalil was responsible 
for the palestine liberation organizations military operations 
against israel 
khalil was deputy military commander of the palestinian armed 
forces behind plo leader yasser arafat a member of the plo 
executive committee and no 2 man in fatah the largest branch of 
the plo also headed by arafat 
he was among plo leaders closest to arafat and was widely 
regarded as among the most moderate of plo leaders 
in bahrain diplomatic sources said arafat was cutting short a 
tour of the persian gulf arab states and rushing back to tunis 
arafat had been discussing means of bolstering the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied territories and preparing for a 
panarab summit proposed for the first week of june the tour began 
in kuwait 
ibrahim sousse the plo representative in paris issued a 
statement blaming the assassination on israel which unable to 
confront the stones of palestinian children now has no recourse but 
to resort to the arm of terrorism 
the statement said the killing will not go unpunished 
the plo said in a statement issued in tunis that the 
assassination will not halt the determination of the palestinian 
people to pursue their struggle for the liberation of their 
homeland 
born in ramallah on the west bank khalil ibrahim alwazir left 
after the 1948 war moving with his family to the gaza strip 
referred to mainly by his nom de guerre abu jihad he became 
involved early on in the struggle against israel and in 1954 was 
briefly arrested by egyptian authorities for involvement in 
antiisraeli operations 
he first met arafat in the early 1960s after moving to kuwait 
together they founded fatah in november 1963 he moved to 
algiers where he opened the first fatah bureau in an arab country 
at the start of fatahs military operations in january 1965 
khalil left algeria for damascus syria and took charge of 
communication with commando units operating in israel 
he later became head of military operations against israel from 
jordan syria and lebanon just as fatah was beginning to gain 
political weight 
when the plo left lebanon in 1982 khalil went with arafat and 
other palestinian leaders to tunis where the plo established its 
new headquarters 
from 1984 to 1986 he moved to amman jordan copresiding with 
the jordanian minister for the occupied territories over a mixed 
commission to support the palestinian population in the occupied 
territories 
he was expelled from amman in 1986 after the plojordanian 
accord established between arafat and king hussein was abrogated 
returning to tunis

col emiliano templo commander of the raiding party said the 
plotters planned to approach the palace by rubber boats down a 
tributary of the pasig river which flows behind the palace in the 
heart of manila

quickly templo said we preempted the plan 
honasan led the aug 28 coup in which 53 people were killed and 
more than 300 others wounded including mrs aquinos only son 
benigno aquino iii 
in beijing today mrs aquino told reporters she was very 
happy to learn of the arrests she arrived in hong kong soon

honasan was arrested in december but escaped april 2 from a navy 
prison ship with the help of 14 guards from an elite navy group 
trained in demolition and commando attacks eight of those arrested 
friday were his guards the two others were civilians 
lt anselmo cabingan a military spokesman declined to give 
details of the raid on the shop but the governments television 
station quoted officials as saying they believed honasan had used a 
small room there as his sleeping quarters since his escape 
the station said that in addition to the motorcycle the 
raiders seized black military uniforms and a gadget used in 
reloading bullets 
the shop is near the house where honasans followers were 
arrested in suburban quezon city 
officials said the group offered no resistance although they 
were found in possession of 16 m14 rifles four m16s one light 
machine gun five israelimade uzi machine guns and a grenade 
launcher 
the house were they were captured belonged to ildefonso 
butch canoy a vice president of the radio mindanao network 
one of the countrys largest private broadcasting companies 
canoy was vacationing in new york and could not be contacted for 
comment but his networks news manager said canoy denied any links 
to honasans group and was surprised to hear of the raid on his 
house 
i talked to him by telephone and he was just as surprised as 
we were mike enriquez told the associated press we fell off 
our chairs when our guys reporters at the scene asked whose house 
it was and were told it was butch canoys 
he said he asked canoy if he had given anybody permission to use 
his house or if he knew that dissident soldiers were using it and 
he said no 
canoy is related to opposition politician reuben canoy who has 
been advocating selfrule for the southern island mindanao

a giant air force cargo jet 
transporting 45 tons of sophisticated gear to a historic experiment 
in the soviet union finished the first leg of its journey today 
officials said 
the giant c5b cargo jet lumbered down a rainslick runway at a 
remote desert base north of las vegas on friday and headed for its 
home base in dover del the first stop en route to a soviet test 
site at semipalatinsk 2000 miles southeast of moscow 
the plane reached dover air force base this morning refueled 
and continued on its journey said capt walter thorp a base 
spokesman 
the plane carried 12 scientists and engineers plus equipment to 
measure shafts being dug for joint verification experiments said 
roger harrison an assistant secretary of state and troy wade 
acting assistant secretary of energy 
the experiments are designed to demonstrate the reliability of a 
technology the reagan administration says is needed to verify the 
threshold treaties which were reached in the 1970s but never 
ratified by the senate 
negotiations in geneva are expected to produce an agreement in 
time for the moscow summit at the end of may spelling out 
conditions for the experiments 
energy department officials believe the tests could take place 
as early as this summer with us scientists on hand to monitor a 
soviet test and soviet scientists traveling to the nevada test site 
to monitor an american test 
we are walking very slowly down this path nick aquilina 
head of the does nevada operations office said in las vegas on 
friday before the flight departed we dont know if this takes us 
one step closer or 10 steps closer to a test ban we dont know 
if its a small step or a large step 
the nevada operations office conducts the nations nuclear 
testing program 
both sides claim to have observed treaties which limit tests to 
no more than 150 kilotons although the reagan administration has 
said the soviets probably exceeded the ceiling on some tests 
the next step would be negotiations on limiting the size and 
number of tests a complete ban on testing could come as the two 
sides near completion of negotiations on eliminating nuclear 
weapons harrison said 
as long as we have to rely on nuclear weapons for our 
security we will test harrison told reporters 
the soviets have been pushing for a ban on testing and 
unilaterally suspended testing for 18 months ending in february 
1987 the reagan administration refused to join the moratorium 
the equipment which left nevada on friday will be used for an 
experiment tentatively scheduled in july to test a us technique 
known as corrtex in which the size of a nuclear blast is measured 
through a cable within 15 yards of a test shaft 
the soviets have balked at using corrtex which stands for 
continuous reflectometry for radius versus time experiment saying 
tests could be monitored with seismic devices at long range 
our stand is that we need onsite verification chris west 
a doe spokesman in las vegas said friday 
a team of 40 to 50 americans will travel to the soviet test site 
to monitor the underground explosion of a soviet nuclear charge 
near the 150kiloton threshold 
a soviet team will set up its own equipment to measure a test to 
be conducted at the nevada site wade said 
both tests are expected to be completed by midjuly according 
to arms control officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
us officials had hoped to conduct the experiments in april 
but the tests were delayed by negotiations over technical details 
one official said

federal inspectors grounded at least 15 eastern 
airlines planes for safety violations said machinists union 
officials who vowed to derail a company plan to delay announcements 
on additional repair problems 
in addition to the 15 the airline pulled five planes from 
service at washington national airport on friday to repair problems 
found during federal inspections said jim hare eastern station 
manager at national 
the problems with the five planes included such things as oil 
leaks and worn seat belts but none presented a safety threat 
eastern officials said 
however eastern management ordered the planes pulled because of 
the intense scrutiny of eastern by the department of 
transportation hare said 
the latest temporary groundings ordered by the federal aviation 
administration were in kansas city mo boston st louis 
tallahassee and atlanta union spokesmen said 
about 400 passengers were stranded when three flights to boston 
were canceled two of the grounded planes had been scheduled to be 
used as backups for other flights 
eastern and federal aviation administration officials refused to 
continue listing the number of planes temporarily grounded 
they didnt want to see a running box score faa spokesman 
john leyden said of his departments policy change after two days 
well summarize it at the end of the inspection 
but members of the machinists union continued to keep the tally 
counting eight more safety violations friday that temporarily put 
planes out of service 
theyre calling in from around the country said a union 
spokesman who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
eastern machinists union district president charles e bryan 
issued a bulletin to easterns 12000 machinists urging them to 
report threats some employees have said they received from 
management after speaking voluntarily with faa inspectors 
bryan said easterns sister airline continental has even worse 
safety problems there are an estimated 1000 minimum equipment 
list safety violations at continental he said 
eastern and continental are owned by texas air corp which 
bryan has repeatedly accused of skimping on maintenance 
mr bryan continues to spout the kind of rhetoric that he has 
maintained for the many years even prior to texas airs 
acquisition of of eastern said texas air spokesman bruce hicks 
in houston it would appear that mr bryan knows as little about 
the operations of continental as he does about eastern

robert chambers apologized at his sentencing for 
strangling an 18yearold woman in central park but conceded that 
nothing i can do or say will ever bring her back 
chambers who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the socalled 
preppy murder trial was sentenced friday to five to 15 years 
in prison in the aug 26 1986 death of jennifer levin 
jennifers looking down on us now at this circus arena 
looking and wondering why it all happened and i dont know 
chambers said in court friday i never wished any of this to 
happen i wish to apologize to the family and to her friends 
for all the trouble they have gone through 
the sentence handed down by state supreme court justice howard 
e bell was agreed upon by defense attorneys prosecutors and the 
family when chambers 21 pleaded guilty march 25 
meanwhile steven levin released a letter he wrote to the judge 
describing the agony the family has felt since the death of his 
daughter 
the levin letter provided an instant response to the apology 
one that reflected the depth of emotion caused by miss levins 
death which chambers initially said happened accidentally during 
rough sex and the subsequent spotlight on the family and 
lives of manhattans affluent youths 
the outrageous lie conceived by jennifers killer to rid 
himself of all responsibility was used by his attorney to defame 
the memory of our lovely child never left to mourn our daughters 
death in privacy our lives became the media event of the year 
levin said in the 2page letter 
how can you talk of punishment what number of years can 
equate to her senseless death levin wrote a criminal 
sentence has a beginning and an end ours will last forever 
the letter concluded please do not belittle or devalue 
jennifers life by giving robert chambers less than the maximum 
sentence allowable under the law 
despite his statement of remorse chambers repeatedly shook his 
head in apparent disagreement with his plea and sentencing 
the levin family have gone through hell because of my actions 
and im sorry chambers said whoever said time heals all 
wounds is definitely wrong because how can these wounds heal 
to jennifer nothing i can do or say will ever bring her back 
but i am sorry chambers added

a rose is a rose for some purposes but 
not when it comes to those used on the blanket awarded to the 
winner of the kentucky derby 
kroger inc which makes the famed blanket of roses draped over 
the derby winner each may has commissioned a hybridizer here to 
develop the perfect bud 
the garland of roses for the winner of the kentucky derby is 
the most prestigious floral arrangement in the world said ben 
harper krogers kentucky advertising manager we feel it is 
important for the kentucky derby to have its own rose 
hybridizer von c weddle 76 said finding the perfect derby 
rose may take three to five years 
i hope i live so long weddle said it would be a great 
honor if i could get it done 
the rose must redefine brilliant red harper said it has to be 
large because it takes 550 roses to cover the blanket which is 14 
feet long and 21 inches wide and it must be hardy because after 
the roses are sewn into the blankets satin backing it sits for 
five to six hours at churchill downs before it is presented to the 
winner he said 
the rose must also be able to grow in a hothouse because a plant 
that grows outdoors would not bloom in time for the derby in the 
event of a long winter 
in his 37year career as a rose breeder weddle has created 25 
different varieties including one named for elizabeth taylor

about 300 people staged a protest at duke 
university saying there were not enough black faculty members and 
calling the prestigious school a racist institution 
about a dozen speakers at fridays demonstration also accused 
the school of giving janitorial and food service workers inadequate 
pay raises 
black student alliance chairman christopher foster said that in 
1968 duke had two black faculty members today there are 31 
thats not enough we need more he said 
university president h keith h brodie told the demonstrators 
that 18 blacks have been offered jobs for the fall semester and 
that he supports a resolution to add 50 new black faculty members 
by 1993 
we are on the right track brodie said 
the rally stemmed from a march 17 vote by the academic council 
which softened a resolution by the committee on black faculty to 
increase the number of black professors the resolution said the 
administration should require each department and program to add at 
least one black faculty member by fall 1993 
all seven committee members resigned in protest april 8 that 
action generated a petition of 2551 signatures including 
brodies asking the council to reconsider at a meeting next 
thursday 
joseph di bona an associate professor in the education 
department who resigned from the committee said the shortage of 
black faculty members means that black duke educators lead 
disembodied lives 
structurally this institution is a racist institution said 
di bona who attended the protest 
the resolution eventually passed by the academic council 
instructed the administration to provide incentives to meet the 
deadline 
there are 758 minority students among the 6423 undergraduates 
and 530 minorities among the 4368 graduate and professional 
students at duke school officials say

a clash between local tribesmen and 
paramilitary police in northwest pakistan has left seven people 
dead and 17 others injured reports said today 
the official news agency app and the newspaper frontier post in 
peshawar said the fighting between kukikhel tribesmen and 
pakistans frontier constabulary occurred friday near the khyber 
pass into afghanistan 
app said the fighting broke out when troopers tried to dislodge 
about 3000 tribesmen who had occupied and set up barricades on 
territory controlled by the military 
the frontier post said the kukikhel action was a protest over 
the contabularys attempt to set up a post in the tribal area 
which usually is selfruled and off limits to pakistani police 
neither report said whether all the dead were civilians but the 
newspaper said at least three of those seriously wounded were 
constables 
it said the paramilitary force used artillery and mortar fire in 
its attempt to oust the tribesmen who responded with automatic 
weapons fire 
family feuds and other clashes are frequent in pakistans 
volatile tribal areas nearly all men carry guns the most popular 
being soviet kalshnikov assault rifles

by kathy gannon 
peshawar pakistan ap about 75000 afghan guerrillas and 
refugees jammed into a sunbaked stadium today to denounce the 
geneva accord that paves the way for a soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan 
one by one the seven leaders of the islamic unity of afghan 
mujahedeen vowed to keep on fighting until the last soviet soldier 
is gone and they have toppled kabuls communist government 
resistance leaders have said they would reject any peace 
agreement reached without their participation 
the united states the soviet union pakistan and afghanistan 
signed an agreement on thursday that calls for soviet troops to 
begin leaving afghanistan on may 15 
in islamabad pakistans acting foreign minister returned from 
geneva today and predicted that afghanistans communist government 
will fall quickly after the soviet withdrawal 
i do not have any doubt about it the kabul government has 
been rejected by the people of afghanistan zain noorani was 
quoted as saying by the official news agency app 
noorani said afghan anticommunist guerrillas control more than 
80 percent of the country 
afghanistans marxist leader najib has acknowledged that 
sovietafghan forces are weak in the afghanistan countryside 
in peshawar ahmed shah a guerrilla designated by the alliance 
to head an allrebel interim government stood in the 95degree 
heat and told the refugees his administration would soon move 
inside afghanistan he gave no deadline 
well stay with you in afghanistan in the caves and snow not 
in pakistan he said an interpreter translated his remarks into 
english 
three rows of turbaned guntoting afghans stood in front of the 
stage 
a guard at the rear of the stage fainted outside the grounds a 
camel lay dead 
gulbaddin hekmatyar a hardline guerrilla leader and current 
chairman of the alliance told the crowd the geneva agreement 
provided for the return of about 5 million afghan refugees from 
pakistan and iran 
the blackbearded hekmatyar asked for a show of hands of those 
who would wait until the last soviet was gone to return virtually 
all hands went up 
the leader of one of the more moderate guerrilla parties 
threatened to boycott the rally if hekmatyar tried to get a vote of 
confidence for the proposed allrebel government 
sibghatullah mojaddedi recently resigned from the alliance then 
later rejoined it in protest over the plan which he said was the 
work of the hardline moslem majority 
mojaddedis afghan national liberation front also is the only 
alliance party to welcome the geneva accord as flawed but useful 
the hardliners say the accord is a sellout because the united 
states failed to secure a cutoff of moscows military aid to the 
kabul government under the agreement both the united states and 
the soviet union can aid their respective allies in the struggle

about 100 people evacuated from their homes near 
chernobyl after the nuclear disaster two years ago have sneaked 
back into the area where radiation levels are still above normal 
tass said today 
the official news agency said they are mainly elderly people who 
never fully adjusted to relocation after the april 26 1986 
nuclear reactor explosion the accident resulted in the death of at 
least 31 people and caused radiation sickness in more than 200 
others 
about 135000 people were evacuated from an 18mile zone around 
the plant two of 180 settlements evacuated have been deemed safe 
for rehabitation but most evacuees are still housed in settlements 
outside the danger zone 
tass quoted alexei demchenyuk deputy head of the interior 
department of the kiev region as saying people were returning to 
their houses and farms by going around checkpoints tass did not 
say to which settlements the people were returning 
we do not have either a moral or legal right today to force 
them to leave the zone demchenyuk told tass militiamen not 
only discharge their immediate functions to maintain public order 
but also help elderly people to cut firewood repair houses and 
deliver food 
tass reported that there had been several cases of theft in 
abandoned homes and public buildings over the two years 
demchenyuk said some people had attempted to smuggle 17th and 
18th century icons out of the contaminated region 
the radiation level of these cultural treasures exceeds 
somewhat the permitted radiation standard therefore the 
scientists and restorers summoned to chernobyl now work on how to 
decontaminate and preserve them demchenyuk said 
chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the ukrainian capital of 
kiev 
tass said 21000 houses and 1500 apartments were built for the 
evacuees in other parts of the ukraine and that 15 billion in 
compensation was given to the evacuee 
tass did not say how many militia patrols are assigned to the 
area but that they are responsible for keeping watch over the 
radiation zone decontamination measures have reduced the radiation 
level tass said but it still is higher than normal 
the report did not specify how high the radition level was

tony benn the aristocratturneddean of the 
radical left is running for the leadership of the labor party in a 
contest that could determine whether the socialists still can 
topple prime minister margaret thatcher 
labor leader neil kinnock appears certain to defeat benn but he 
needs a big win to demonstrate he has led the party away from the 
leftwing radicalism that has helped it lose three successive 
elections 
when benn 63 announced last month that he will contest the 
leadership at the partys autumn conference kinnock called it 
selfish and futile 
kinnock saw the challenge as a blow to his drive to woo back 
bluecollar and middleclass voters who have deserted to mrs 
thatchers conservative party but there are signs now that kinnock 
is relishing the contest as an opportunity to hand the left a 
decisive public defeat 
i didnt choose this contest kinnock 46 said in a 
television interview but i shall fight it and win it in a way 
that will bring strength and credibility to the labor party 
the opening salvos attracted the kind of publicity labor 
moderates dread benn back on prime time television with his calls 
for class struggle newspapers mulling over his demands for state 
control of the economy renewed trade union militancy the closure 
of us military bases and the removal of britain from nato 
in a party that lost power to mrs thatcher nearly a decade ago 
benn a former energy secretary is one of a diminishing band of 
opposition members of parliament who have held high government 
office 
born anthony wedgwood benn he inherited the title viscount 
stansgate but renounced it in 1963 
a pipepuffing intellectual with a mischievous wit and brilliant 
oratorical style benn once was seen as a prime 
ministerinwaiting in 1981 he came within half a percentage point 
of defeating denis healey for the labor deputy leadership 
benn now appears likely to get around 20 percent of the vote by 
an electoral college made up of union leaders members of 
parliament and branch leaders 
it is a mark of how far kinnock a welsh miners son and former 
leftist has shifted the party since taking over in 1983 
benn who sees himself as the bulwark against mrs thatchers 
stated aim of burying socialism maintains that labor loses because 
it is trying to ape her capitalist doctrine instead of siding 
squarely with leftwing causes it is an argument that infuriates 
labor moderates 
theres got to be a much stronger commitment to people in 
struggle much much stronger says benn 
he accuses kinnock of distancing the party from strikes by 
miners teachers printers and health workers you cant ask 
people to support you on polling day if you dont support them when 
theyre on picket lines 
benn is running with another veteran leftwinger eric heffer 
who is one of two candidates trying to unseat deputy leader roy 
hattersley a moderate 
labors showing in june 1987 when mrs thatcher won a third 
fiveyear term improved only marginally from the previous election 
in 1983 labor won 31 percent of the vote compared with the 
conservatives 42 percent while centrists and minority regional 
parties took the rest 
benn made his challenge for the leadership when it appeared 
kinnock was shifting further to the right 
a preliminary report on a wholesale review of labor policies 
ordered by kinnock is due in the summer 
party leftwingers suspect labor is about to ditch or at least 
fudge its pledge to dismantle britains nuclear arsenal and shut 
down us nuclear bases and will leave intact some major thatcher 
changes such as selling off stateowned industries 
many analysts see benns move as offering a new opportunity for 
the party splits among the centrist factions have reestablished 
labor as the only credible challenger to the tories but it remains 
five to 10 points behind the conservatives in poll ratings 
labor also hopes to benefit from mrs thatchers controversial 
thirdterm program of shaking up the welfare system and imposing 
unpopular new property taxes 
labor now has some chance of reuniting the centerleft into an 
electable coalition commented the respected weekly the 
economist the challenge for labors leadership from the failed 
old man of the left mr tony benn ought to provide mr neil 
kinnock with a golden opportunity

a 9yearold boy trying to beat a 
freight train across railroad tracks was tossed about 100 feet and 
killed by the trains engine witnesses said 
joshua d bischoff and three other boys were playing a game of 
chicken friday afternoon daring one another to cross the track 
on bicycles as the train drew closer witnesses said 
you could tell they knew better not to do it said chris 
harrington an eden prairie high school senior who saw the 
accident the first two boys to cross were dangerously close to 
being hit they just made it 
the engineer told police the train sounded a warning horn as it 
rolled along the track at between 30 and 40 mph according to lt 
les bridger of the eden prairie police department 
then they locked the brakes as they realized what was 
happening ahead of them bridger said but you dont stop a 
train on a dime it took another several hundred feet for the train 
to stop 
bischoff who was trying to cross the track on his bicycle was 
thrown about 100 feet down the track and then run over by the 
engine harrington said his small dirttype bicycle landed in 
pieces near him 
the boy who was a student at prairie view elementary school 
was returning with his brother and a friend from a book fair held 
at the school said his father doug bischoff 
i dont think it was a game of chicken they were playing 
his father said my oldest boy was there and he would not do that 
and their friend would not do that either 
all i can think is that he decided to try to get across the 
tracks and then didnt make it the best i can say is he was just 
going to beat the train across the tracks 
the accident is under investigation by the eden prairie police 
department

a priest dismayed by two funerals for gunshot 
victims has asked parishioners to turn in their weapons and pledge 
that they wont carry guns 
why do people need a gun on their hips this isnt tombstone 
why do they need a gun under the seat of the car when they go to 
king soopers asked the rev marshall gourley 
gourley began focusing on guns in january after the church had 
two funerals for gunshot victims one was a young man carrying a 
gun who was shot by police the other was a suicide victim 
gourley pastor of our lady of guadalupe roman catholic church 
wants church members and everyone else of goodwill in denver to 
turn in their pistols rifles and shotguns 
he also is asking parishioners to sign pledge cards that they 
wont carry guns or have them in their vehicles or in their homes 
unless they are used for hunting 
and theyd better be hunting wild animals not their 
neighbors he said 
as of last week he said more than 400 pledge cars and eight 
guns have been turned in to the parish he said the weapons will be 
handed over to the police department 
thats eight guns less out there gourley said 
gourley suggested that those who want to keep their guns should 
attend every rosary and every funeral for gunshot victims the 
church holds between now and next easter 
if they still think guns are a good idea maybe they can 
convince me he said

us policy has been buffeted 
in recent weeks throughout central america prompting suggestions 
that washingtons goals in the critical region ignore local 
aspirations and feelings 
president jose napoleon duartes government in el salvador 
given full us support since it took office in 1984 suffered a 
humiliating defeat last month in legislative and municipal 
elections 
gen manuel antonio noriego although described as a tinhorn 
in washington has taken the reagan administrations best punches 
and still runs panama 
in honduras long considered the strongest us ally in the 
region the american consulate was sacked and burned by a mob 
angered by what was seen as highhandedness from washington 
the reagan administrations goal of bringing down the leftist 
sandinista government in nicaragua has all but crumbled because 
congress ended military aid to the contra rebels and the two sides 
now are trying to negotiate a peace agreement 
a south american ambassador to el salvador told the associated 
press privately he believes washingtons recent problems are at 
least partially due to security concerns that isolate us 
diplomats from their surroundings 
they live in bunkers and when they emerge theyre surrounded 
by bodyguards he said with the result that they cannot get a 
feel for peoples concerns and feelings the diplomat represents 
a nation friendly to washington and has served in five latin 
american countries 
michael obrien spokesman for the us embassy in honduras 
said last week that us diplomats were somewhat surprised by 
the ferocity of the april 7 attack on the consulate 
the building was burned by a mob infuriated by the arrest and 
expulsion two days earlier of a honduran facing narcotics and 
murder charges in the united states 
honduran forces worked closely with us authorities in the 
operation against juan ramon matta which violated a constitutional 
provision that prohibits extradition of honduran citizens matta

many hondurans view the episode as evidence that us interests 
in honduras carry more weight than the nations own institutions 
resentment of the united states has been growing for years in 
honduras obrien and honduran authorities say the rioters 
represented a small radical minority but for a year before the 
attack the scrawled slogan yankee get out had proliferated on 
walls in tegucigalpa the capital 
a sore point with many hondurans is what they consider a loss of 
sovereignty caused by the reagan administrations use of their 
nation as a surrogate in its nicaragua policy 
this country has allowed its territory to be converted into a 
sanctuary for irregular forces attacking a neighboring country with 
which were not at war anibal puerto vice president of the 
honduran human rights commission said in an interview 
this raises the question of the allegiance of the honduran 
armed forces everything leads one to believe they are loyal to the 
government of the united states rather than to their own people 
in el salvador political leader alfredo cristiani accused 
washington of trying to impose solutions that do not suit local 
circumstances 
cristiani president of the rightist republican national 
alliance that beat duartes christian democrats in the march 20

reform that has gone nowhere 
it is not right that us professors with land reform 
experience in other contexts come here and destroy an entire 
agrarian system for a political end he said that is the great 
mistake trying to experiment without really knowing much about el 
salvador this creates resentment 
us policymakers clearly miscalculated about panama since 
washington cast its lot with eric arturo delvalle the figurehead 
civilian president noriega pushed aside feb 26 administration 
officials have been predicting the general would abandon power in a 
matter of days that was seven weeks ago 
harsh us economic sanctions imposed in the effort to force 
noriega out have crippled the economy hurting ordinary people the 
most 
american military reinforcements sent to improve security for 
the panama canal accidentally shot one of their own men to death 
last week a result of increasing edginess caused by the extended

a proposed christian blood bank wont 
open in oklahoma city because of a sparse response from hospitals 
and churches 
dr condon hughes proponent of the idea said friday that 
letters explaining his proposal were mailed to 40 hospitals and 175 
churches in the state but hughes said he received positive 
responses from only three churches 
thats not enough to make it work he said 
hughes said he will continue looking for the right place and 
the right time for his blood bank which was to be called 
lifeblood under his plan it would have accepted blood only from 
donors who signed a statement confirming that they have either 
abstained from sex or have been faithful to a faithful spouse since 
1977 
these donors hughes claims would not carry the acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome virus officials of other blood banks had 
objected saying that all blood banks screen potential donors and 
test donated blood for evidence of the aids virus

navy divers detonated two mines 
in the central persian gulf today while us mine sweepers and 
helicopters searched for more explosives 
meanwhile an american warship disabled by a mine thursday 
reached port ten sailors were hurt in that blast the first mining 
of a us warship in the gulf 
the us navy has found and destroyed 45 mines in the gulf since 
june all the same type iran has placed iran and iraq are fighting 
a 7yearold war and have attacked shipping in the gulf 
in bahrain shipping executives said today that a navigational 
hazard area had been declared within 10 miles of thursdays 
explosion 
western diplomats and the executives speaking on condition of 
anonymity said iran recently laid the mines in the area 
the shipping channel is frequented by the us navy and the 
implication is that the iranians have laid the mines for the 
americans said one of the executives 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr mark van dyke of the joint task 
force middle east indicated friday that strong evidence 
indicated the mines came from the same source as the ones the 
navy found in september 
van dyke was referring to an iranian boat iran ajr which was 
caught laying mines in the central gulf sept 21 it was attacked 
and disabled by us helicopters and nine other mines were found on 
the deck of the craft 
us officers said that marine helicopters spotted the two mines 
friday in the waters where the 3700ton guided missile frigate 
samuel b roberts struck the underwater explosive injuring 10 of 
the warships 225 men 
van dyke said the mooring cables appeared new and the mines 
themselves had no growth or barnacles he said that showed that 
they had been in the water a reasonably short amount of time 
the 445foot samuel b roberts its stern low in the water and 
its steel skin rippled and bent by the force of the blast reached 
dubai the capital of the united arab emirates near the mouth of 
the gulf under tow today 
navy officials said four of the injured were relayed by 
helicopter to a hospital in bahrain three were suffering from 
serious burns and the fourth from smoke inhalation 
six others returned to the roberts 
van dyke said the ship was currently considered stable 
asked about possible us retaliation for the mining van dyke 
said it would not be appropriate to comment on that 
the newport ribased ship on assignment in the gulf hit the 
mine about 55 miles east northeast of the qatar peninsula 
the waters where the roberts was hit make up a a major shipping 
lane used by commercial vessels including kuwaiti tankers the 
tankers were reflagged by the united states in july 1987 for 
protection from iranian attack

jerzy kosinski once one of official 
polands most reviled authors had the sweet revenge of being feted 
and showered with praise during a triumphal return to the country 
he fled 31 years ago 
the creator of the painted bird and being there 
delivered a vibrant message of intellectual independence to crowds 
who packed the auditoriums wherever he appeared last week 
speaking in flawless polish the us writer of polishjewish 
descent stressed the relationship between poles and jews over the 
centuries condemned prejudice against poles and jews blasted the 
official critics who pilloried his reputation here the late 1960s 
and bemoaned economic conditions in poland 
cutting a lithe elegant figure the 55yearold kosinski was by 
turns tragic and comic his outrageous statements rich wordplay 
and puns quickly won over his audiences 
judging by the 180degree turnabout by the authorities he 
seemed to be having the same effect on them 
before his scheduled departure sunday he had promises that 
poland would publish his nine novels and won agreement to build an 
institution of polishjewish heritage in kazimierz the ancient 
jewish quarter of krakow 
but kosinski speaking with american and british reporters 
friday said he has a healthy skepticism of official promises 
we are living in a country in which all plans fiveyear 
plans sevenyear plans 10year plans have all been very 
definite he joked he said he will believe his books are to be 
officially brought out in polish only when i see them published 
in more than five copies and not mimeographed 
kosinski who left his native city of lodz for the united state 
in 1957 came back april 6 his visit coincided with observances of 
the 45th anniversary of the doomed warsaw jewish ghetto uprising 
that preceded the nazi eradication of all but a few traces of 
jewish life in polands capital 
but he stressed that he had not come to poland solely to mourn 
the dead he objected to the deification of the jewish 
holocaust 
considering history only from the point of view of a fouryear 
drama in relation to 1000 years of polishjewish cultural 
development is for me a man who genuinely loves life 
unacceptable he said 
he went to auschwitz to show it to his wife but he devoted more 
time to visiting sites of former jewish life in poland kazimierz 
in krakow the old jewish quarter of lublin in eastern poland and 
his former home of lodz a textile center 
there he met his brother by adoption for the first time in 30 
years while in poland he also renewed close friendships from his 
student days 
only two relatives of kosinski survived the nazi occupation of 
world war ii he said he survived thanks to poles whose names he 
does not know he was 24 when he left the country a promising 
photographer and a sociologist who wanted to become a novelist 
asked about views that poland is a land of antisemitism he 
said this is disgusting 
i know enough about my history to say this if they if the 
architects of disaster the germans and the nazis are to be called 
antisemites then those poles who spat at me occasionally or 
even pogromized me historically speaking clearly should be called 
by another name 
to have the same name for those who burned my relatives in 
auschwitz thats not a polish name to have the same term for 
them is simply unfair as unfair as anything i can think of 
but kosinskis voice rose to greatest emotion when he discussed 
his own literary exile from his native land where no books by him 
have been published official and only fragments published in the 
underground press he had been attacked as a traitor to poland for 
the brutal images in the painted bird which reviewers assumed 
referred to poland 
it is an injustice that a man named jerzy kosinski who goes 
to the united states and becomes a writer there and is not a 
politician and is clearly apolitical that this man is not allowed 
to return to his own country 
polish journalists frequently asked kosinski about his decision 
to write in english which he said now puts him in the odd position 
of being translated into his native tongue he said it was largely 
a pragmatic choice motivated by his desire to be read in his 
adopted country 
but he said writing in english is an emotional filter for him 
the english language was necessary to create an emotional 
distance between myself and the other jerzy kosinski who maybe 
could write the book in polish but could he maybe he would 
shudder that he had lived through that war in polish and not want 
to write about himself 
he said he saw are promising signs of increasing literary 
freedom in poland 
but he noted the continued ban of the polish section of the 
international pen writers club since polands 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown and said he has reason to doubt the authorities 
sincerity kosinski served two terms as the president of the 
american pen 
its been 30 years of these authorities and i still have no 
trust of them he said 
i know almost nothing about those in power now but what the 
authorities used to write about me was fiction and i do know 
something about that because i am an expert on writing fiction 
still said kosinski he has been very much at home during 
his visit very much in love with the country thanks to my polish 
nature and at the same time very much like a foreigner

us failure to oust panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega is increasing calls from members of 
congress central american leaders and outside experts for a 
negotiated solution to the panama crisis 
administration officials also are listing negotiations as one of 
several options but they remain hopeful that panamas severe cash 
shortage and continued payless paydays for thousands of government 
workers still will induce noriega to depart 
costa rican president oscar arias said during a visit to 
washington last week that the economic sanctions the united states 
has imposed have punished the panamanian people more than they have 
military chief noriega 
arias is the author of a plan to bring peace to nicaragua and 
other central american countries and has been involved in an effort 
to resolve the crisis in panama 
he recommended a negotiated settlement and said that the united 
states should cooperate with other central american countries in 
finding a solution unilateral action only leaves the reagan 
administration isolated said arias 
former president richard m nixon said he too believes broader 
action by latin american nations offers the best hope for a 
solution 
following a briefing thursday by state department and pentagon 
officials senate foreign relations committee members generally 
agreed the administration must do more to seek a diplomatic 
solution 
this view was shared by committee chairman claiborne pell 
dri and sens nancy kassebaum rkan and john kerry dmass 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva sent a letter to 
president reagan asking that us policy give greater emphasis to 
the common hemispheric interest in combatting drugs noriega has 
been indicted in the united states on drug charges and has been 
accused of turning his country into a haven for drug traffickers 
sol linowitz a former ambassador to the organization of 
american states who helped negotiate the panama canal treaties 
said weve got to stop acting as if we can do it alone 
linowitz urged that the united states get behind a diplomatic 
effort begun last month by arias spanish prime minister felipe 
gonzalez and former presidents daniel oduber of costa rica carlos 
andres perez of venezuela and alfonso lopez michelson of colombia 
he expressed hope that a solution could be worked out with the 
help of panamanian archbishop marcos a mcgrath who offered last 
month to act as a mediator but backed off from the role after he 
was unable to get the government and the opposition together 
noriega has clung to power despite strikes demonstrations 
defections a coup attempt by disaffected military officers and 
most importantly a severe economic slowdown to which the united 
states has been a major contributor 
us officials believe that the panamanian governments 
inability to meet its payroll for more than a month is the single 
most potent force working against his continued rule 
additional us sanctions are being contemplated but linowitz 
believes the administration has gone too far already 
there is no guarantee that more pressure will drive noriega 
from power he said the consensus in latin america is that the 
united states should reverse the sanctions it has imposed on 
grounds that these measures are coercive and therefore 
inappropriate 
a former us ambassador to panama ambler moss said the 
administration has pursued its policies in a typically 
hegemonistic way he agreed with linowitz that latin american 
countries would be useful in the search for a negotiated solution 
a us official insisting on anonymity said that among the 
options still not ruled out is sounding out noriega on his proposal 
to leave his post as commander of the defense forces before 
elections scheduled for next year provided opposition groups agree 
to a national dialogue with the government 
the official gave the impression this option is being held in 
reserve for the time being a more likely course of action over the 
short term is a us attempt to devise a strategy that will enable 
opposition groups in panama to carry out their struggle more 
effectively he said 
some state department officials exasperated by noriegas 
resilience are urging military action to remove him but the 
pentagon is generally hostile to the idea 
arias warned against such action during his visit 
nixon said he believes that option is unwise because it would 
generate an antiamerican reaction throughout latin america 
former white house aide patrick buchanan wrote last week that 
sending the marines into panama is the wrong way to fight drug 
smuggling 
if the us refuses to deal seriously with the drug problem at 
home buchanan asked why should american marines risk their 
lives to take lives in the jungles of panama 
but michael g wilson an analyst at the heritage foundation a 
conservative research group believes military force would be 
warranted under certain conditions 
we should let noriega realize that if he makes any wrong move 
toward us citizens us bases or the canal or even against the 
panamanian opposition we would be willing to consider a surgical 
strike against him he said

a cross was burned early saturday near 
the home of a white woman living with a black man in what a fire 
official said was the third racially motivated incident 
directed against the couple 
although the ku klux klan has held rallies in this part of 
northeastern maryland officials do not know if the klan was 
involved said bob thomas state fire marshals spokesman 
in two previous incidents relatives of the woman were 
suspected according to a state police officer who declined to be 
identified however there is not necessarily a connection between 
saturdays cross burning and previous harassment the officer said 
police were looking for two white men in their early 20s thomas 
said 
the woman discovered the 8 foot by 6 foot cross before dawn 
thomas said the timbers were wrapped with cloth doused with a 
flammable liquid and then set afire next to the driveway thomas 
said 
thomas said last month someone shot at the couples car and 
there was another assault but had no further details

while the three democratic contenders are 
battling to the wire for votes in tuesdays new york primary 
republican george bush has the luxury of sitting back and watching 
his delegates pile up 
bush can receive as many as 96 delegates in tuesdays contest 
of which he already has 48 committed raising his total to a 
potential 970 and moving him ever closer to the 1139 needed for 
the gop nomination 
however bush strategists says that while the vice president is 
running virtually unopposed he plans to spend considerable time 
campaigning in the months ahead in delegaterich states 
rep guy molinari rny bushs new york campaign chairman 
said that bush will likely return to the state two or three more 
times between now and the august convention 
bush spent three days campaigning leisurely in new york last 
week including stops in syracuse buffalo rochester and new york 
city 
molinari said the withdrawal from the race of bushs only 
remaining major opponent sen bob dole changed the itinerary 
somewhat the vice president cut back days 
but he said that bushs visit was helpful in shoring up gop 
support and in giving the vice president some visibility in the 
state to help offset the constant coverage that has gone to 
democrats michael dukakis sen albert gore jr and jesse jackson 
bush planned to campaign in ohio on monday and pennsylavnia on 
tuesday and then spend several days back in washington he will 
spend considerable time next month on the west coast much of it in 
california aides said 
the candidacy of former television evangelist pat robertson 
however continues to stand between bush and a total lock on the 
gop nomination and may also be helping to keep president reagan 
on the sidelines for the time being 
reagan had vowed to remain neutral as long as there was a 
contest among republicans 
however even though robertson has not formally withdrawn from 
the race his recent campaign efforts have been minimal 
speaking to the american society of newspaper editors on friday 
robertson said it is obvious from the delegate count that has 
come out that george bush is going to be the nominee of the 
republican party absent any unexpected eventuality 
still robertson who has 17 delegates has not pulled out of 
the race and said he still hopes to energize the people who 
support me to take an active role in the convention 
there has been no direct contact between bush and robertson 
even though the two were backtoback speakers before the audience 
of newspaper executives 
i think hes plowed under bush said speaking with 
reporters on air force ii last week as he returned from his swing 
through new york 
asked if some prominent republican perhaps dole might serve as 
a mediator between the two camps bush said we dont need any 
mediation we need our facts clear 
bush spokesman peter teeley said there was no intention on 
bushs part to try to persuade robertson to throw in the towel in 
the name of party unity 
it would not be proper teeley said 
however the aide said his campaign for the most part is 
dormant hes doing very little traveling its almost as if his 
campaign is nonexistent 
as for reagans participation teeley suggested it may be the 
delegate count more than robertsons persistence that is sidelining 
the president teeley said that might change once we have the 
delegates to go over the top 
according to the associated press delegate count that will come 
no later than may 3 probably even sooner 
meanwhile bush has clearly changed his campaign tactics hes 
focusing much more on the democrats and his campaign speeches have 
become more assertive in their criticism 
claiming he cant distinguish much difference between dukakis 
gore and jackson on most issues bush has accused all three of 
seeking to take the united states back to the days of ships that 
couldnt sail and planes that couldnt fly of doubledigit 
inflation and interest rates 
do you want americans to go back to those terrible days of 
malaise and darkness he asks audiences 
on foreign policy bush accuses the democrats of advocating 
international policies that are dangerous naive and filled 
with wishful thinking 
wherever bush speaks he is dogged by questions about his role 
in the irancontra affair and the legal difficulties surrounding 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
on irancontra bush sticks by his assertion that he knew 
nothing about the armsforhostages operation until it had been 
terminated and he adds if he were a democrat hed raise it as a 
campaign issue too 
the democrats will be after it is his stock answer 
theyve got little else to run on

about 100 mostly elderly people evacuated from 
their homes near chernobyl have sneaked back to areas where 
radiation levels are still above normal two years after the nuclear 
disaster tass said saturday 
the official news agency said many never fully adjusted to 
relocation after the april 26 1986 nuclear reactor explosion the 
accident caused the death of at least 31 people and radiation 
sickness in more than 200 others 
about 135000 people were evacuated from an 18mile zone around 
the plant two of 180 settlements evacuated have been declared safe 
for rehabitation but most evacuees are still housed in settlements 
outside the danger zone 
tass quoted alexei demchenyuk deputy head of the interior 
department of the kiev region as saying people were returning to 
their houses and farms by going around checkpoints tass did not 
say to which settlements the people were returning 
we do not have either a moral or legal right today to force 
them to leave the zone demchenyuk told tass militiamen not 
only discharge their immediate functions to maintain public order 
but also help elderly people to cut firewood repair houses and 
deliver food 
tass said there had been several cases of theft in abandoned 
homes and public buildings over the two years 
demchenyuk said some people had tried to smuggle 17th and 18th 
century icons out of the contaminated region 
the radiation level of these cultural treasures exceeds 
somewhat the permitted radiation standard therefore the 
scientists and restorers summoned to chernobyl now work on how to 
decontaminate and preserve them demchenyuk said 
chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the ukrainian capital of 
kiev 
tass said 21000 houses and 1500 apartments were built for the 
evacuees in other parts of the ukraine and that 15 billion in 
compensation was given to the evacuee 
tass did not say how many militia patrols are assigned to the 
area but that they are responsible for keeping watch over the 
radiation zone decontamination measures have reduced the radiation 
level tass said but it still is higher than normal 
the report did not specify how high the radition level was

senate majority leader robert byrds decision 
to step down at the end of the year assures at the least a change 
in style at the top of the democratic party 
and it gave one retiring veteran of the senate a moment to pause 
and reflect on the changing style of leadership in what senators 
like to call the worlds oldest deliberative body 
in the 30 years i have been here said sen william 
proxmire dwis we have had the allencompassing dominating 
leadership of lyndon johnson the everysenatorisaleader 
consensus leadership of mike mansfield the gentle 
behindthescenes masterful compromising leadership of howard 
baker the forceful and yet always considerate leadership of bob 
dole and the diligent persistent truly dedicated leadership of 
robert byrd 
mike mansfield who served 16 years as majority leader before 
retiring in 1977 is now us ambassador to japan baker a 
republican is now white house chief of staff while dole the 
current senate republican leader recently gave up his bid for the 
gop presidential nomination 
senate democrats under byrd of west virginia now meet weekly to 
consider their agenda but proxmire recalled under johnson who 
ran the senate like a dictator from 1953 until 1961 we would 
have a party caucus literally only once every two years at the 
beginning of the new congress 
lyndon would deliver what we called lyndons state of the 
union message and that was that there was no need for a caucus 
because lyndon would decide everything and i mean everything the 
senate would act on 
the senate was a oneman show said proxmire who is leaving 
the senate 
the wisconsin senator said that byrd who served as party 
leader and majority leader when democrats controlled the senate 
from 1977 through this year was no dictator but proxmire added 
byrd has his convictions too 
just yesterday i called senator byrd to ask him to vote with 
me on a matter of great importance to this senator he flatly 
refused i entreated him he replied no way 
he said this is my position and thats that he would not 
yield his convictions i respect and admire him for that 
with byrd looking on from his desk proxmire wound up by noting 
a littleobserved side of our retiring majority leader 
he noted that the chaplain opens each days senate session with 
a prayer 
but often this body is treated to two prayers we have the 
chaplains prayer and then we have another prayer by the majority 
leader in effect the majority leader often offers a truly 
astonishing spurofthemoment analysis of the chaplains prayer 
senator byrd will often be inspired to launch into a flight of 
poetry or a passage from some longforgotten american or english 
author his recall is amazing he can quote at length from the 
bible from an infinite variety of speeches made by past political 
leaders he is able to recall wordforword something he must have 
read 10 or 20 years ago 
here is a unique leader one who is i think too little

khalil alwazir a bakers son who built 
a guerrilla army from what began as a secret student cell fought 
the war against israel for 35 years and was the heirapparent of 
plo chairman yasser arafat 
alwazir known throughout the middle east by his nomdeguerre 
abu jihad father of the holy war was slain early saturday at his 
home in tunis 
he was known in the plo as the revolutions honest man he 
rarely wore a uniform unlike arafat and listened more than he 
spoke 
bodyguards called him the wailing wall and complained that 
scores of people were allowed to visit him every day to tell their 
troubles and seek his help 
the palestine liberation organizations military commander was 
born in ramle in what was palestine on oct 10 1935 
in 1948 when he was 13 his family moved to gaza after israel 
was created he became leader of the students union in high school 
and formed a clandestine cell that challenged egypts rule over the 
gaza strip 
egyptian authorities arrested alwazir in 1954 and held him for 
several weeks he led his first major guerrilla operation the next 
year blowing up water tanks near beit hanoun 
during the 1956 middle east war alwazir went to egypt and 
enrolled in the alexandria university law school 
while in egypt he met two other students yasser arafat and 
salah khalaf they founded fatah an underground group dedicated to 
regaining the land palestinians lost to israeli 
fatah a reverse acronym in arabic for the palestine national 
liberation movement was to become the core of the palestinian 
movement 
arafat graduated with a civil engineering degree within a year 
and got a job in kuwaits public works ministry alwazir dropped 
out went to saudi arabia seeking work and in 1962 married his 
cousin intisar 
alwazir khalaf and arafat reunited in kuwait and began 
recruiting for their movement alwazir moved to algiers in 1963 to 
found asifa arabic for storm and persuaded the algerians to help 
train about 100 young palestinian fighters 
he and arafat went to china seeking help for fatah arafat soon 
returned to kuwait but alwazir stayed in asia for several months 
training in north korea china and north vietnam 
returning to the middle east he established military 
headquarters in damascus syria 
on jan 1 1965 alwazir made a raid into israel from syrias 
golan heights and claimed responsibility for fatah because of 
that jan 1 has become revolution day for the 5 million 
palestinians 
the syrians arrested alwazir and several fatah members in may 
1966 he was freed after 45 days 
arafat shuttled among arab capitals seeking political 
recognition and financial support for fatah alwazir recruited and 
trained young arab fighters and conducted more military operations 
into israel from syria and lebanon 
in 1967 he led asifa infiltrators into israels north his men 
fought the jordanian army in 1970 when king hussein drove the 
guerrillas from jordan 
after the 1970 black september fighting in jordan the plo 
set up headquarters in lebanon three years later alwazir was 
named deputy commander of the plo and led palestinian units who 
fought the israelis in the 1973 middle east war 
over the next nine years he concentrated on guerrilla raids 
into israel forming infiltration units and establishing 
underground cells in the iseraelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 the plo left and alwazir 
resumed his base in damascus relations with the syrians collapsed 
in 1983 and alwazir moved to tripoli in north lebanon but 
syrianbacked militiamen drove the plo out of the city in december 
1983 
alwazir retained the respect of dissident plo elements and 
syrian leaders and made several futile attempts to reconcile arafat 
and president hafez assad of syria whose personal feud had 
undermined the syrianplo alliance 
he moved to jordan in 1984 but was expelled in july 1986 after 
hussein terminated an agreement with arafat he then moved to 
tunis where the plo now has its headquarters 
survivors are his widow also known as umm jihad mother of the 
holy war sons jihad 24 bassem 21 and nidal 2 and daughters 
iman 18 and hanan 14

iraq fired six longrange missiles into 
tehran and two other iranian cities saturday and iran said it fired 
two back it was the heaviest missile barrage in the war of the 
cities in 10 days 
the us navy missile frigate samuel b roberts limped into 
dubai in the southern persian gulf after it was holed by a mine 
thursday ten of the warships 225man crew were wounded in the 
blast 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia said the iraqi missiles that hit tehran crashed into 
residential neighborhoods in the iranian capital it reported many 
casualties but gave no specific figures 
it said missiles exploded in the central city of isfahan 
persias 16th century capital and the holy city of qom 100 miles 
south of tehran 
irna said iranian revolutionary guards fired two missiles at 
military centers in baghdad the iraqi capital several hours 
later the official iraqi news agency said one missile hit the city 
and killed an unspecified number of civilians in a residential 
neighborhood 
the two sides in the 7yearold persian gulf war have fired 
more than 300 missiles into each others cities since feb 29 
more than 120 missiles have hit the iranian capital in that 
period until the latest phase of the war of the cities which 
iran and iraq have waged intermittently since 1984 tehran had 
never been hit by missiles 
the iraqis also said their fighterbombers raided the western 
iranian cities of dezful and hamadan irna said four civilians were 
killed 
the iranians reported 24 civilians were killed in iraqi air 
raids on nine iranian cities friday 
irna said iranian warplanes bombed military and economic 
targets in four iraqi towns including baqubeh 30 miles 
northeast of baghdad and the northern town of dukan 
it said other iranian jets bombed kut 80 miles southeast of 
baghdad and zako and erbil in the north 
shipping executives in bahrain said a 10mile stretch of the 
central gulf has been declared a navigational hazard area because 
of supected mines 
the executives and western diplomats speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they believe the iranians laid the mine there that 
holed the us frigate 
the mine was one of several spotted in the area and has 
rekindled fears that the iranians were again mining shipping lanes 
in the strategic waterway after laying off for several months 
following clashes with us forces 
associated press reporter richard pyle aboard the uss 
wainwright in the gulf reported that navy divers saturday 
detonated two mines in the central gulf near where the roberts was 
hit mine sweepers and helicopters searched for others 
the roberts was the first us navy ship damaged in the gulf 
since an iraqi warplane attacked the frigate stark with missiles 
may 17 1987 killing 37 crewmen the iraqis said the pilot mistook 
the stark for an iranian warship 
the us navy supported by warships from several western 
european countries increased its presence in the gulf last july to 
protect reflagged kuwaiti tankers from iranian attack 
the kuwait vessels were reregistered in the united states so 
they could fly the us flag iran accuses kuwait of aiding iraqs 
war effort

the amount of serious crime reported to police 
rose in 1987 for the third straight year and was up in all regions 
of the country except the west the fbi reported saturday 
nationally the 2 percent increase in 1987 followed rises of 5 
percent in 1985 and 6 percent in 1986 
the amount of violent crime reported to police in 1987 edged 
down 1 percent the fbi said but the level of property crime was 
up 2 percent 
the fbis crime index level was up 1 percent in the midwest 3 
percent in the northeast and 4 percent in the south the west 
experienced the only decline moving downward 1 percent 
across the country the number of reported aggravated assaults 
rose 2 percent from 1987 while larcenies rose 3 percent and motor 
vehicle thefts rose 5 percent according to the preliminary 
figures those three categories of offenses traditionally account 
for about 70 percent of the major crime reported to the fbi by 
police departments around the country 
the number of murders reported to police fell by 4 percent last 
year forcible rapes dropped by 1 percent robberies by 5 percent 
burglaries by 1 percent and arsons by 5 percent 
it is difficult to determine whether the fbi crime data gathered 
from police departments signifies an actual increase in crime 
levels or if the rise is due to the fact that victims are simply 
coming forward more frequently to report the offenses than they did 
in the past 
a survey last month by the justice departments bureau of 
justice statistics found that 37 percent of serious crimes were 
reported to police agencies last year compared with 32 percent 
when the bureaus survey was first instituted in 1973 
the bureaus survey of households which measures crime that is 
both reported and unreported to police found that the amount of 
crime in the united states last year remained stable 
the fbi report and the bureau study both recorded declines in 
crime levels during the first half of the decade many researchers 
forecast an increase in crime in coming years as young people in 
increasing numbers move into the most crimeprone age group of ages 
15 to 24

a detailed explanation by soviet officials of 
a mysterious anthrax outbreak in 1979 has left us experts divided 
over longstanding allegations that the epidemic stemmed from an 
accident related to 
biological warfare experiments 
according to a lecture and slide show presented by soviet health 
officials over the last week in washington baltimore and 
cambridge mass the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminated 
bone meal fed to livestock whose meat in turn caused the deaths 
of 66 people in sverdlovsk a city of 12 million in the ural 
mountains 
the longawaited soviet explanation leaves many questions 
unanswered said gary b crocker a state department analyst 
specializing in questions relating to soviet military use of 
biological and chemical weapons it does not fit with the 
evidence and facts we have collected on the issue he said 
the carter administration had demanded a full accounting from 
the soviets in 1980 saying it had disturbing indications that 
the epidemic was caused by some sort of lethal biological agent 
and in 1986 the pentagons defense intelligence agency released 
a report alleging that the anthrax came from the microbiology and 
virology institute a topsecret military research facility in 
sverdlovsk 
the pentagon report said a pressurized system probably 
exploded at the institute spewing as much as 22 pounds of 
anthrax spores into the air and that hundreds of soviet 
citizens died 
anthrax an infectious disease which occurs naturally is 
considered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons a 1975 
treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biological 
weapons and significant quantities of biological agents but allows 
research ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses 
james oberg author of the recent book uncovering soviet 
disasters said he believes the soviet health officials are 
telling the truth in blaming the outbreak on a batch of 
contaminated meat rather than germwarfare experiments but they 
are not telling the whole truth said oberg 
they should have said this eight or nine years ago said 
oberg who urged the soviets to open the sverdlovsk research 
facility to western observers the damage has been done he 
said it will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undo 
the damage that soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted on 
international relations 
the soviets had long denied the us allegations but had 
offered little evidence to refute them the more detailed rebuttal 
last week came from dr pyotr n burgasov former deputy soviet 
health minister dr vladimir n nikiforov chief infectious 
disease specialist at the moscow institute for the advanced 
training of physicians and dr vladimir p sergiyev of the soviet 
health ministry 
the heart of their argument bolstered by gory autopsy slides 
was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines 
indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax 
but the dia report said hundreds of soviet citizens died from 
inhalation of anthrax and that others suffered after eating the 
meat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores 
the soviet officials declined to answer questions about the work 
performed at the sverdlovsk research lab but in circumstantial 
refutation of the us allegations they said no one at the lab 
became ill during the outbreak 
moreover the soviets denied that any military personnel were 
involved in efforts to contain control and clean up the epidemic 
a contention that contradicts us intelligence reports that 
soldiers were among the first victims and that military chemical 
warfare teams may have been called in to fight the contamination 
a number of american scientists who saw the presentation said 
the soviets made a good case dr philip brachman of emory 
university called it a landmark report 
dr alexander langmuir the former chief epidemiologist at the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta said he found the 
soviet version credible 
and harvard university biologist matthew meselson who organized 
the soviet visit was quoted by the washington post as saying he 
found the soviet explanation completely plausible and consistent 
with what we know from the literature and other recorded 
experiences with animal and human anthrax 
in the past meselson and brachman have acted as consultants to 
the government on alleged soviet biological weapons but government 
officials said they remained skeptical and wanted to see a lengthy 
published account that the soviets first promised in 1986 but which 
has not yet appeared 
the soviets still have not given a full accounting of the 
episode to their own citizens and some of the data offered to the 
american audiences were at odds with past soviet explanations 
nikiforov a member of the visiting soviet team wrote in may 
1980 that in march and april 1979 isolated cases of anthrax among 
humans were recorded 
a soviet ministry of health official nikolai antonov told a 
world health conference in switzerland in september 1986 that the 
outbreak came after undisciplined workers threw contaminated 
meat into garbage cans and that stray dogs spread the meat to many 
neighborhoods in sverdlovsk

negotiators for nicaraguas sandinista 
government and the contra rebels started a second day of meetings 
today in the capital in an effort to end the nations 6yearold 
war 
after a brief round of talks friday night the first ever in 
managua between the ussupported rebels and sandinista leaders 
the two groups met this morning for more extensive discussions 
the meeting started at 9 am 11 am edt and was expected to 
last for about 12 hours 
forty highlevel contra officials some in managua for the first 
time since 1979 came in search of what they tried to attain 
for many years democracy and liberty for the nicaraguan 
people adolfo calero head of the rebels nicaraguan resistance 
told a news conference 
earlier he told reporters at sandino international airport that 
the contra leaders presence in managua is a triumph for their 
cause 
but defense minister humberto ortega the sandinistas main 
bargainer said the victory is when we reach a definitive 
ceasefire it doesnt involve mounting a publicity show but of 
complying with a preliminary peace plan signed march 23 
the talks mark the first time since the war began that the 
sandinistas have allowed rebel leaders to openly come to managua 
they are designed to move the two sides closer to halting the 
fighting that has claimed more than 26000 lives since it began in 
november 1981 according to the government 
agreement on details of the truce was reached during talks that 
concluded friday in the southern border post of sapoa 90 miles 
from managua 
the two sides in those talks issued a statement that said 
considerable progress had been made in narrowing their 
differences and that additional discussions would be held 
the talks were called for in the preliminary peace plan as part 
of that agreement a 60day ceasefire went into effect on april 1 
to give both sides time to work out a lasting peace 
but the two sides were unable to agree on important issues such 
as verification that the contra fighters have moved into seven 
designated ceasefire zones how the rebels would be resupplied 
and if they should be allowed to keep their weapons 
we will try to seek mechanisms in order to guarantee physical 
and moral security for our combatants said azucena ferry a 
member of the rebel directorate 
under the agreement the contras were supposed to have gathered 
in the zones by friday but there was no indication that occurred 
the sandinistas in return were to have released 700 political 
prisoners allowed humanitarian aid for the rebels and permitted 
the insurgents to send representatives to take part in internal 
political discussions 
the contra leaders arrived more than four hours late on a 
commercial flight from san jose costa rica and relatives gathered 
at the airport to greet them 
violetta chamorro the coowner of the opposition newspaper la 
prensa waited to see her son contra leader pedro joaquin 
chamorro returning to managua for the first time since 1986 
earlier her newspapers building was the target of a protest by 
about 300 teenagers who pelted the building with rocks to protest 
the publications prorebel stand 
the demonstrators said they belonged to a group called 
sandinista youth witnesses who insisted on anonymity said a young 
man was slightly injured by a pail thrown from the roof 
the interior ministry immediately banned all demonstrations and 
alcohol sales around the airport and hotel where the contras were 
staying and closed the main road to the airport 
contra leaders claim they have about 10000 rebels under arms 
the sandinistas claim they have an armed force of 300000 men and 
women including an 80000man army 
the ceasefire was called for under a central american peace 
plan signed by five central american presidents last august

with the fall of television evangelists 
jimmy swaggart and jim bakker many disillusioned believers are 
attempting to turn their backs on their fundamentalist faiths says 
the founder of fundamentalists anonymous 
people leaving the moonies actually get more support because 
people say oh my god you used to be one of them said jim 
luce referring to followers of the korean cult leader sun myung 
moon 
about 50000 people have contacted the support group for help 
since luce and richard yao a fellow wall street executive ran a 
twoline ad in new yorks village voice newspaper three years ago 
suggesting a selfhelp group for former fundamentalists luce said 
the concept that fundamentalism can go so far overboard that 
people can be hurt is being readily accepted said luce in a 
telephone interview from his office in new york 
we define fundamentalism as a mindset that sees the world in 
black and white right and wrong good and evil a mindset that is 
very authoritarian intolerant and compulsive about imposing its 
beliefs on others he said 
those seeking help from the group have included catholics 
jehovahs witnesses mormons and even a couple of japanese 
buddhist fundamentalists luce said 
were not saying that all fundamentalists have this problem 
but if you take your religious beliefs to the extreme to the point 
where you become dysfunctional then obviously you have a 
problem he said 
people trying to leave a fundamentalist faith often feel cut off 
from life since they typically have been attending several church 
functions a week and spending most of their weekends in religious 
activities luce said those who leave often are shunned by friends 
and family he said 
these people have no social skills outside of 
fundamentalism he said fundamentalism has its own rules its 
own social system so when you leave youre trying to make it in a 
system where idle chatter could be about movies or books these 
people dont have any of that social context 
low selfesteem is another problem for many trying to break with 
their past luce said 
youre told within the fold that youre nothing but a worm 
women are worse than that and of course you are told that if you 
leave the fold you are an evil person you are a bad person a 
damned person 
the group has developed a fivestep selfhelp program based on 
the alcoholics anonymous program people meet in support groups but 
can keep their identities secret 
the group has been criticized by fundamentalist organizations 
and is no 1 on jerry falwells hit list said luce but mark 
demoss a spokesman for the lynchburg vabased evangelist said 
falwell was basically unconcerned about luces group 
they appear to be about a twoman organization operating out 
of a church with a telephone number and a post office box number 
demoss said in a telephone interview it doesnt appear to be 
that big of a deal 
a spokesman for jimmy swaggart world ministries in baton rouge 
declined comment on fundamentalists anonymous 
reverend swaggart has specifically asked me not to respond to 
any criticisms said spokesman gus weill 
swaggart recently was defrocked by the assemblies of god after 
he refused a oneyear suspension from the pulpit over his 
confession of moral failure a prostitute said swaggart paid her to 
pose nude for him 
in addition to individual support efforts the group has been 
involved in legal efforts by ptl lifetime partners to recover 
their contributions following bakkers departure from the ministry 
over a sex scandal 
luce 28 who gave up a career as a bank manager to devote all 
his time to fundamentalists anonymous said swaggart was one of the 
earliest examples he used of the dangers of fundamentalism since 
swaggarts scandal calls to the group have increased dramatically 
he said 
luce who described himself as an american baptist said he was 
first exposed to fundamentalism when members of his family became 
involved in the pentecostal faith 
it caused serious damage when they would tell other members of 
the family that they werent christian they were going to hell 
he said

shiite moslem gunmen holding about 35 
hostages aboard a hijacked kuwaiti jet said today they want the 
plane refueled so that a massacre could be avoided in algeria 
one masked gunman addressing three reporters at the top of the 
gangway leading to the plane said the hijackers are now working 
to blow up this plane if 17 terrorists jailed in kuwait are not 
freed 
we are determined to obtain the liberation of our 17 brothers 
in view of the kuwaiti intransigence we are asking our algerian 
brothers to refuel the plane so that we can take off because we 
intend to settle our score with kuwait somewhere else 
we do not want the massacre to take place here in friendly 
algeria which welcomed us and which tried to settle the problem 
he said however that they were not abandoning the negotiating 
process and remained willing to examine every proposal 
the hijackers have killed two hostages during the 12 day ordeal 
three hijackers all wearing light blue hoods and one of them 
carrying a machine gun were seen by the journalists representing 
the new york times the french news agency agence francepresse and 
the algerian government agency algerie presse service 
the statement was read in arabic by one of the three who were 
standing in the planes doorway nothing was visible inside the 
plane 
the reporters were frisked at the bottom of the gangway by the 
man who read the statement 
they were each allowed to ask two questions after the statement 
was read and the entire episode lasted about 15 minutes 
one asked if it was possible to envisage a solution whereby the 
hostages would be freed in algeria and the hijackers would leave 
the reply was a solution will be proposed to us and we will 
examine it together with our algerian brothers in a comprehensive 
manner we must have a comprehensive solution 
the response appeared to soften the tone of other remarks 
indicating that the crisis could still be solved in algeria 
negotiations which began today at 1040 am were expected to 
continue 
the kuwait airways boeing 747 was hijacked april 5 with 112 
people aboard on a flight from bangkok to kuwait fiftyseven 
passengers were released in mashhad iran the hijackers killed two 
hostages in larnaca cyprus and released 13 before flying to the 
algerian capital on wednesday 
the hijackers are demanding that kuwait free 17 proiranian 
extremists convicted of bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in 1983 kuwait has refused 
on friday algerian mediators shuttled between kuwaiti officials 
and the plane entering to talk with hijackers at least five times 
two of the hostages pleaded for their lives via radio in an appeal 
to the kuwaiti government to give in to the hijackers demand 
in the name of god the merciful i greet my family and my 
friends and i ask the kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners 
held in kuwaiti prisons one hostage soleiman mohammed soleiman 
almashari in a message to the control tower friday in the 
event of refusal they are going to kill us 
reagan administration and western intelligence sources said they 
believe one of the eight hijackers is hasan ezzidine a lebanese 
national under us indictment for the june 1985 hijacking of the 
twa airliner 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states is seeking ezzidines extradition the sources said 
without elaboration that a coded radio message from beirut to the 
aircraft mentioned the name ezzidine 
ezzidine may have been directly involved in the killing of 
robert dean stethem a navy diver beaten and shot to death during 
the twa hijacking todays new york times quoted administration 
officials as saying 
the intelligence sources say they believe the seizure of the 
kuwaiti plane was masterminded by imad mughniyeh another of the 
four lebanese shiite militants indicted by us authorities for the 
twa hijacking 
they said mughniyeh 36 dropped out of sight in beirut several 
weeks ago after returning from iran mughniyeh is a security chief 
for the proiranian hezbollah or party of god a lebanese shiite 
fundamentalist faction 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for 
proiranian shiite moslem groups holding 22 foreign hostages 
including nine americans in lebanon 
some freed passengers said the gunmen were joined by another man 
after the plane was forced to land in iran 
algeria denied it had guaranteed that hostages aboard the 
aircraft would be freed when the plane reached algiers reinforcing 
a sense of stalemate in negotiations as the crisis entered its 12th 
day 
algeria agreed to welcome the plane at the express demand of 
the kuwaiti government and with a strictly humanitarian goal a 
government statement said friday 
cyprus government spokesman akis fantis had said his government 
received assurances from unspecified sources in algiers that 
the hostages and the plane would be released 
among the hostages are three members of kuwaits large alsabah 
royal family and at least four crew members

saadi qattaineh was dozing in his seat high above 
the indian ocean when a clamor woke him 
there were two men shouting hands up he said one 
grabbed the steward and the other started checking him for guns 
one of the longest air hijackings had begun it lasted nine days 
for qattaineh and was in its 12th day saturday for about 35 
hostages still held on the boeing 747 that left bangkok as kuwaiti 
airlines flight 422 and made its way in stages to algiers 
qattaineh and other freed hostages described the hijack which 
began before dawn april 5 in interviews with the associated press 
they said the gunmen quickly donned makeshift hoods cut from 
airline pillowcases and began herding their hostages to a central 
section of the jumbo jet 
as soon as they hijacked the aircraft they told us we have 
certain demands of the kuwaiti government just remain calm 
qattaineh said the hijackers demand the release of 17 proiranian 
extremists convicted of bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in december 1983 
the plane veered north to iran and landed at the airport in 
mashhad 
because the gunmen ordered the window blinds kept closed the 
passengers did not know where they were qattaineh said the first 
inkling came when they were served bread and cheese for breakfast 
and the napkins said iran air 
qattaineh a 61yearold retired fireman with a jordanian 
passport said the hijackers placed the passengers two to a row 
separated by several seats 
at least two gunmen watched the hostages at all times 
forbidding them to talk and ordering them to shift seats every few 
hours he said 
passengers were taken individually for questioning to a forward 
cabin beyond a curtain some said pillowcase hoods were slipped 
over their heads 
we were asked about our religion and how many children we had 
and our work said saleh ibrahim malik a kuwaiti 
ramadan ali an egyptianamerican engineer said hijackers asked 
whether he was a sunni moslem or shiite 
the hijackers are believewd to be shiites all kuwaitis released 
in the first 11 days of the hijacking are shiites the predominant 
faction in iran and south lebanon 
ali said the gunmen took the briefcase in which he had hidden 
his american passport and stowed it with other luggage in a baggage 
compartment 
hijackers confiscated passports ali gave them his egyptian 
documents and while inspecting wallets overlooking alis american 
driving license 
in iran moslem passengers stood several times to pray in the 
traditional islamic manner but ali said it made the hijackers 
nervous and they said hey guys if you want to pray pray in 
your seats 
on the ground in iran the gunmen produced plastic handcuffs 
after two days and put them on the hostages the freed passengers 
said 
some former hostages said the handcuffs were left on until their 
release but others said they were removed occasionally 
after three days in iran the plane flew to cyprus where it was 
permitted to land at larnaca because it was low on fuel it 
remained there five days 
passengers said they were unaware of the gunmens threats to 
blow up the plane unless their demands were met 
most agreed that small machine guns appeared after the plane 
left iran along with more hand grenades and ropes that were tied 
to the doors some said they saw explosives attached to the ropes 
several passengers also said one or two new gunmen appeared 
during the stop in iran and ali said they seemed to take charge of 
the six or seven young men who had seized the plane 
identification was difficult because the hijackers kept

troops raided a hideout of the 
fugitive leader of augusts attempted coup and scoured other 
neighborhoods for rebels the military said saturday 
the nations armed forces remained on full alert to block any 
coup attempt while president corazon aquino was on a fourday trip 
to china and hong kong she was to return sunday 
the raiders did not find former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan in the hideout an automobile repair shop in suburban 
quezon city but they seized his motorcycle and military uniforms 
the officials said 
the raid came late friday after troops captured 10 of his 
followers in a nearby house 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo said they included 
eight of 14 navy guards who helped him escape his prison ship april 
2 he had been held there since his december arrest for the failed 
coup on aug 28 that left 53 dead and 300 hurt 
the military said the 10 arrests foiled a plot to attack the 
presidential palace 
a report to defense secretary fidel v ramos said government 
forces were still looking for rebels it gave no details and ramos 
told reporters only that the operations were being carried out in 
undisclosed neighborhoods 
before flying to hong kong saturday mrs aquino told reporters 
in beijing she was very happy about the capture of the 10 
honasan followers 
the military believed honasan used a small room in the auto shop 
as his sleeping quarters the governments television station 
reported saturday it said the raiders also found a device used to 
reload 45caliber bullets a dictionary a bible and canned food 
inside the room 
col emilio templo commander of the 300member squad making the 
arrests said the plotters planned to approach the palace by rubber 
boats down a tributary of the pasigriver which flows behind the 
building in the heart of the capital 
but the military was tipped off about the plot so we acted 
quickly templo said we preempted the plan 
honasan was a key figure in the civilianbacked military revolt 
that ousted former president ferdinand marcos and swept mrs aquino 
to power on feb 25 1986 
but honasan became disenchanted with mrs aquino and led the 
august coup attempt the most serious of six bids to unseat mrs 
aquino since she became president 
a military statement said officials were questioning the 
arrested navy soldiers and some had admitted receiving bribes from 
honasan to help him escape one told investigators that married men 
in the group were given 100 and bachelors received 65 each the 
statement said 
officials said the group offered no resistance although they 
were found in possession of 16 m14 rifles four m16s one light 
machine gun five israelimade uzi machine guns and a grenade 
they told authorities they didnt know where honasan was hiding 
according to the military statement

president reagan under pressure from congress 
to take off the gloves in fighting foreign drug trafficking 
said saturday his administration has waged an unprecedented 
campaign against the flow of drugs from abroad 
the president who has threatened to veto senatepassed 
legislation calling for sanctions against mexico over drug 
trafficking devoted his weekly radio address from camp david md 
to the drug issue 
in addition to prevention education and drug law enforcement 
we have also been emphasizing the international side of the 
problem reagan said 
when we came into office there were drug eradication programs 
under way in only two countries he said today that number is 
23 
in fact this country has signed an unprecedented number of 
mutual legal assistance treaties extradition treaties and 
eradication agreements 
the senate voted 6327 on thursday to overturn a finding made by 
the president six weeks ago that mexico was fully cooperating 
with the united states in the war on drugs 
if passed by the house and signed into law the measure could 
deprive mexico of some of its trade benefits and would require us 
representatives in international lending institutions to vote 
against mexican loan applications 
during debate on the measure sen dennis deconcini dnm 
said nearly 40 percent of the cocaine entering the united states 
comes across the 1900mile usmexican border 
weve got to take off the gloves deconcini said 
the senate foreign relations committee has approved similar 
legislation regarding the bahamas 
the president has threatened to veto both of those bills 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters friday 
we think those are two good examples of counterproductive 
actions where congressmen have obvious frustrations and theyve 
taken them out in this area but its not helpful in the drug fight 
or in our broader relations with these countries fitzwater said 
state department spokesman charles redman said approval of the 
bill might lead to an increase in drug traffic because far from 
serving as a catalyst for action this vote castigates a friend for 
less than perfect behavior 
redman said the senate resolution failed to recognize mexicos 
substantial antidrug efforts and the extremely positive 
response of mexican president miguel de la madrid to reagans 
call for increased cooperation

samuel howard lived a hard life but the 
money he saved while he was in prison on his third of three murder 
convictions has been set aside to provide a brighter future for 
other inmates 
the university of alabama at tuscaloosa has established what is 
believed to be the nations first college scholarship for 
prisoners the 10000 samuel howard endowed scholarship fund 
of the 10000 about 6000 came from social security checks 
that howard who died in 1986 had deposited in a bank in dothan 
the joint bank account was set up by howard and jim loftin a 
former employer who had befriended him before howard went to 
prison for the third killing 
loftin and his wife marian provided the rest of the money for 
the fund 
we wanted to put the money in something that would help other 
people she said in an interview last week we felt that as 
hard a time as he had in his life there were people who helped him 
in prison it meant a lot to him we wanted to do something in his 
memory 
howard didnt care about the money loftin said he would 
have loved to have a scholarship in his name 
howard worked for the loftins for five years doing yard work 
and helping in the warehouse at loftins moving and storage 
business 
state prison system records show howard was convicted of two 
counts of firstdegree murder and one of assault with intent to 
murder and was sentenced to two life terms plus 20 years in prison 
in january 1952 he was paroled in 1961 
then in 1975 he was sentenced to 40 years on a seconddegree 
murder conviction said a prison spokeswoman the records 
immediately at hand gave few details of the crimes she said 
howard died in the state prisons facility for aged and infirm 
prisoners on july 20 1986 following his death the loftins 
started exploring the idea of a scholarship in his memory 
we couldnt find any university that had done that and it was 
difficult to work out the details because there was nothing like it 
to go on it was an idea that just happened said mrs loftin 
who is director of the universitys regional office at dothan 
a university committee will administer the scholarship and 
select recipients from among the prisoners who apply starting next 
january it is not set up according to age sex race or 
anything mrs loftin said anyone can apply the state 
prison system has more than 12000 inmates 
the universitys college of continuing studies will help inmates 
who want to take independent courses 
reports on illiteracy say people who have some kind of 
educational development while in prison are less likely to be put 
back in incarceration mrs loftin said 
despite his murder convictions howard was a very friendly 
person she said he was uneducated but was very interested in 
people our kids liked him and he liked them it was a friendship 
the loftin family occasionally visited howard in prison and 
often sent him items that he needed he didnt have anybody that 
we knew of so we just kept in communication with him said mrs 
loftin 
we kept hoping that one day he would get a pardon mrs 
loftin said he told us if you need any money you just take 
it but we never did

democratic candidate albert gore jr who 
is trailing badly in voter preference polling for tuesdays new 
york primary reiterated saturday he had to pick up more support in 
order to remain a viable candidate 
at a minimum we have to have a strong finish to demonstrate 
continued momentum gore said as he toured a market in the heart 
of buffalos polish community but im not going to put specific 
numbers on it 
in a poll released friday by a buffalobased public research 
firm goldhaber associates massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
holds a comfortable lead among the democrats with 43 percent jesse 
jackson was second with 28 percent and gore had 8 percent 
twenty percent of the 367 democrats surveyed by telephone on 
thursday and friday said they were unsure whom they would vote for 
in the primary the poll had a margin of error of 5 percent 
on friday gore dismissed the figures saying the polls have 
been consistently wrong about me 
he said there was time for him to improve his standing and that 
several recent endorsements from state and local officials were 
encouraging new york city mayor ed koch endorsed gore on thursday 
and state assembly majority leader james tallon endorsed him 
friday gore picked up the endorsements of a city councilman and 
state senator on saturday 
many voters have not yet decided on the candidates and those who 
have expressed a preference might still change their mind he said 
as a result support for the frontrunners may not be as strong as 
people think he said 
on another issue gore disagreed with party leaders such as 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk and new york gov 
mario cuomo who think the nomination should go to the candidate 
with a plurality of votes 
the rules provide that the candidate who has the majority of 
the delegates becomes the nominee gore said one or two people 
cant change the rules of the democratic party it has to be done 
according to due process and that hasnt taken place

police say the grisly killing of four 
teenagers was an isolated incident in an otherwise relatively 
quiet area but some residents say theirs is a neighborhood where 
crime is like eating and changing dresses an everyday thing 
at least two residents say they heard the victims screams in 
the middle of the night but the only call police got was from one 
of the victims 
mary mireles says its time to pack up and leave after 12 years 
my daughter just bought a place in the country there are some 
empty lots there i told my husband maybe we have been here too 
long i liked it here because it was quiet at one time she said 
in her yard across the street from the mobile home where the 
killings took place friday 
the victims stabbed with steak knives were identified as 
jennifer mann 19 shannon mann 17 martha mann 14 and their 
brother ernest mann 13 
leo narvaiz 20 a former boyfriend of shannon mann was 
arrested late friday and charged with four counts of capital 
murder narvaiz had a stab wound in the thigh and a cut on his 
hand and was being held in medical center hospital in lieu of 
405 million bond police said 
i heard a lot of screams mrs mireles said they were 
screaming help and they were crying and screaming and i told my 
husband and he said no lets not get involved 
he thought they would shoot at anybody who went out to see 
what was going on she said 
we heard yelling and the sound of someone climbing over the 
chainlink fence said virginia ytuarte who lives half a block 
away the next thing we know the cops are at the door telling 
us that something ugly happened next door that blood was 
everywhere like the charles manson murders 
police received word of the stabbings when a girl called the 911 
emergency number and said one of my sisters boyfriends is 
beating us up and has killed my sister said homicide 
investigator lt albert ortiz 
the only call that came through was the one where the mann 
girl was calling us police sgt mike akeroyd said saturday 
mrs mireles 58 said it was only the latest incident at the 
villa grande mobile home park 
its terrible we cannot help but see the people robbing one 
another and jumping the fence but were afraid to speak out she 
said 
this is like eating and changing dresses an everyday 
thing she said 
down the street mary hartman said she was not scared by the 
slayings but also figures it might be time to move away 
it was very quiet she said of the neighborhood she moved to 
10 years ago but years progress and things change this whole 
neighborhood has been robbed already 
like most of the residents in the neighborhood the hartmans 
have bars on their doors and windows 
but barry byers supervisor at the mobile home park said crime 
is not a problem there he said the park has a full patrol system 
operated by a private security company that keeps an eye on the 10 
acres 
this could happen anywhere he said of the murders 
although the southside of san antonio is known as a highcrime 
area an officer in the night magistrates court said the mobile 
home park actually is located between two of the worst crime areas 
it is kind of open in that particular area said robert 
grego the court officer theres an area farther west and some 
farther south that are a littler rougher this is on the fringes of 
both 
grego said he believed the case was an isolated incident and one 
of the first violent crimes for the area its no more dangerous 
than any place out there 
mrs ytuarte moved into a mobile home half a block from the 
murder scene eight months ago because it looked like a serene place 
for her her husband and their two small children 
i liked it here it looked so peaceful she said i never 
figured anything like this would happen 
im scared trailers are so easy to get into now that i think 
about it

israeli soldiers today 
killed 13 palestinians arab and hospital reports said in the 
bloodiest day in four months of violence as riots erupted to 
protest the assassination of a plo leader 
up to 90 other palestinians were wounded in the riots according 
to hospitals un officials and arab journalists curfews were 
slapped on 10 refugee camps 
at least six arabs killed in gaza by army gunfire were from 
refugee camps a palestinian from the village of abasan near gaza 
city also died in a clash with soldiers 
reports said three of the dead were from the jenin refugee camp 
in the west bank it was not immediately clear where the others 
deaths occurred 
the victims ranged in age from 17 to 45 
the army command which is normally slow to confirm casualties 
said four palestinians were killed all in the gaza strip it said 
it did not have figures on the number of wounded 
violence broke out early in the morning in gaza where khalil 
alwazir the assassinated plo leader lived at one time and had 
relatives 
alwazir also known as abu jihad was the no 2 official in 
yasser arafats fatah group he was killed today by a commando unit 
of seven men and one woman in a suburban home near tunis tunisia 
black flags of mourning flew across the west bank and throughout 
towns in the gaza strip 
at a memorial service for alwazir held by family members a 
confrontation developed between israeli soldiers who fired tear gas 
and palestinian youths who raised the outlawed plo flag and threw 
stones 
women carrying black flags gathered on the roof shouting 
allahu akbar god is great 
several shots were heard and the group dispersed with no 
injuries immediately evident 
reporters saw makeshift roadblocks and burning tires on nearly 
every street in gaza city palestinian youths their faces masked 
by kaffiyeh headdresses or shirts stopped motorists and questioned 
them 
the fatalities if confirmed would equal the highest singleday 
death toll since the uprising began dec 8 
un spokesman bill lee said 149 palestinians had been killed in 
riots not including todays clashes of those 124 have died from 
army gunfire one israeli soldier has been killed 
ariel merari a leading terrorism expert at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies predicted 
alwazirs assassination would have a divisive effect on the 
palestinians 
it is a blow to the morale of the palestinians in the occupied 
territories but it could also arouse feelings of revenge said 
merari 
he said there was a strong possibility the assassination early 
today was an outgrowth of a power struggle between alwazir and 
arafat over the appointment of commanders in southern lebanon 
where the plo was rebuilding its guerrilla force 
but merari also noted that alwazir had headed the plo appartaus 
that carried out thousands of military operations against israel 
since it seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war 
bassam shakaa the deposed mayor of nablus in the west bank 
blamed israel for alwazirs assassination 
no one else can benefit from his killing only israel and the 
zionists said shakaa a hardline palestinian leader whose legs 
were blown off in a boobytrap car bomb attack by the jewish 
underground 
ahmed alwazir cousin and brotherinlaw of the slain plo 
leader held a memorial service in gaza city that was attended by 
thousands of palestinians 
all i can say is that abu jihad had been carrying his coffin 
in his own hands for the past 30 years alwazir said 
alwazir was born in the city of ramle now in israel and moved 
to the gaza strip in 1948 
elias freij the mayor of the west bank town of bethlehem 
condemned the killing of abu jihad but said it was not easy to 
point a finger at anyone until more was known 
but he predicted the killing would have grave consequences 
rashad al shawaa the deposed mayor of gaza city said most 
palestinians were blaming israel for the attack i dont think 
his death is going to stop the plo from continuing its struggle 
perhaps his death will create more support 
on friday hundreds of jewish settlers defiantly marched in west 
bank hills and named a highway junction for a 15yearold israeli 
girl who was killed along with two palestinians in a clash in an 
arab village 
israeli soldiers surrounded mosques in the west bank cities of 
hebron and qalqilya and clamped a curfew on khan yunis in the gaza 
strip to prevent violent protests after moslem prayers

at first alice lisquez thought the 
100 bill she pulled from an envelope was play money and in a way 
it was 
a georgia woman had sent in an order to michigan bulb co and 
mistakenly enclosed 10 hundreddollar bills that she had been 
saving for her vacation 
it never occurred to me to take it lisquez said 
lisquez 47 found the big bucks about three weeks ago tucked 
into a 2184 order for creeping phlox and peonies sent to the 
company from mary duval of dahlonega ga 
lisquez told her supervisor sue barnstable about her 
discovery barnstable tracked down duval and sent her a 1000 
check to her to replace the cash 
on thursday lisquez received a 100 bill and a silk scarf from 
duval as a reward lord its the least i could do duval said 
saturday 
duval 63 a nurse said the return of the money has saved a 
monthlong trip to england she has planned for later this year 
itll be her first trip there 
dear alice duval wrote in a letter enclosed with the scarf 
i called your office to obtain your name and to thank you i 
like you am a working girl and i had saved most of the money 
haphazardly and converted it to the 100 bills as a twenty gets 
easily spent 
it was for a badly needed vacation and thanks to you my plans 
do not have to be changed 
a second note to barnstable praised lisquez for her honesty 
i still have difficulty accepting the fact that there is basic 
honesty practiced duval wrote i would never have known what 
happened to the money 
office manager lyle hansen said he has seen a few mistaken 
mailings over the companys 43year history but never more than a 
phone bill or house payment that got switched around in the 
shuffle and never before in cash

a commando unit of seven men and one woman 
burst into a suburban home early today and opened fire with machine 
guns killing the plos military chief and three bodyguards 
khalil alwazir caught reading plo reports in his study fired 
his pistol once but was sprayed with about 170 bullets said 
officials of the palestine liberation organization in tunis 
abdallah frangi the plo representative in bonn west germany 
blamed israeli security agents for the attack 
eight members of the israeli secret service armed with 
machine pistols equipped with silencers forced their way into the 
house and shot the bodyguards of abu jihad said frangi using 
alwazirs alias 
the israelis have proven with this bloodbath that they have a 
secret service which is capable of every kind of murder they have 
also shown that they do not want peace with the palestinians he 
said 
plo sources in tunis and elsewhere said a second commando unit 
was waiting outside while alwazir was killed one plo source in 
nicosia said a busload of people we think 30 altogether was 
involved in the operation 
it was not immediately clear how the commandos escaped 
alwazir led the palestinian armed forces acting as deputy 
military commander behind yasser arafat he was a member of the plo 
executive committee and no 2 man in fatah the largest branch of 
the plo 
an arab diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
alwazir was the prime mover behind the uprising against israel 
in the west bank and gaza 
alwazir was among plo leaders closest to arafat and was widely 
regarded as among the most moderate a softspoken man alwazir 
was obeyed even by dissident officers who split from fatah after 
feuding with cofounder arafat 
alwazir was the first of the three cofounders of fatah to be 
killed 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry spokesman aviv shiron said 
he had no information on alwazirs killing other israeli 
officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the 
jewish sabbath 
a threeday general strike and mourning was declared by 
palestinian activists in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip where riots broke out 
arab reports said more than 12 palestinians were killed today in 
the bloodiest day since antioccupation riots began on dec 8 
alwazir 52 was killed about 115 am 815 pm edt by 
commandos who drove up to his house in sidi abu saeed fatally shot 
a tunisian bodyguard driver and burst inside where they killed 
alwazirs two palestinian bodyguards the plo spokesman said 
they then broke into abu jihads study everything happened 
within seconds he said 
alwazirs wife imjihad daughter hannan 14 and son nidal 2 
were in the house but were not hurt plo officials said 
plo chairman yasser arafat was stunned by the assassination of 
his military commander but held meetings with bahraini leaders 
today aides reported in manama 
arafat was in bahrain to map stategy for the occupied 
territories where a palestinian uprising has raged for four months 
an arafat aide who declined to give his name said the news of 
the assassination made arafat determined to reply to it by 
stepping up a thousandfold the uprising in the west bank and gaza 
arafat called alwazirs wife and told her our march is long 
and you have to be patient and surmount your pain so we can carry 
on with the mission he started said the source who was in the 
room at the time 
arafat could not be reached for comment he has been touring 
persian gulf states for the last few days and today flew to riyahd 
the capital of saudi arabia for talks with leaders there 
diplomatic sources had said he was not expected to fly directly to 
tunis for security reasons 
alwazir was killed two months after three of his senior 
officers were assassinated in limassol cyprus as they arranged 
the charter of a ship to carry palestinian deportees on a protest 
voyage to israel 
the palestinians blamed the israelis for the deaths 
in cairo an egyptian official denounced the assassination as 
a criminal act directed against the palestinian leadership the 
brief statement by the minister of state for foreign affairs 
butros ghali made no mention of the plo charge that israel was 
responsible 
the assassination was similar to one carried out in beirut in 
april 9 1973 in which three palestinian leaders were killed by 
israeli commandos who came in from the sea 
the victims were mohamad najjar kamal nasser and kamal adwan 
najjar codenamed abu youssef was the head of fatahs military 
branch nasser was a member of the executive committee and adwan 
was responsible for activities in israelioccupied territories

democrat michael dukakis made one of his first 
visits to harlem on saturday and was challenged by a critic who 
said his presidential campaign was ignoring the areas black voters 
during a breakfast with 40 black bankers business and community 
leaders critic robert la prince said he saw no evidence that 
dukakis campaign had waged any effort in harlem and added it was a 
mistake for him to write off the predominantly black neighborhood 
despite rival jesse jacksons unquestioned strength 
dukakis responded the jackson campaign isnt that active in 
astoria a reference to the greek neighborhood of queens where 
the massachusetts governor drew more than 2000 people in an 
emotional outpouring of support two days earlier 
i understand jesses going to get the lions share of the 
votes in this community and thats understandable dukakis said 
adding that he has enjoyed black support too 
la prince pressed him on the absence of even placards and 
handbills well get some signs out dukakis replied 
la prince who described himself as president of the national 
council for culture and art said later its evident the 
campaign is ignoring the harlem community i think its 
unfortunate 
dukakis told reporters he couldnt recall if he had campaigned 
in harlem before saying the visit was one of the first 
as dukakis was confronted with the criticism his campaign began 
airing a radio commercial targeted at black audiences the ad says 
dukakis has appointed blacks to top jobs while the reaganbush 
administration turned its back on black americans it also 
accuses vice president george bush the inevitable gop nominee of 
cheerleading efforts to turn back the clock on equal 
opportunity 
dukakis flew upstate after spending the morning in new york 
city where he also walked with a small crowd along a street in an 
italian neighborhood in queens 
were going to begin to work with communities thats what 
america is all about dukakis said im a community guy 
a young woman shouted a question to him about fiscal 
discipline and followed up by asking if he would raise taxes 
i hope not dukakis said and then repeated his call for 
tougher enforcement of income taxes 
he was throwing out the ceremonial first ball at a minor league 
baseball game in buffalo where a light snow fell in a blustery 
cold and later joining jackson and tennessee sen albert gore jr 
for a league of women voters debate in rochester 
dukakis aides contended polls showed the new york race 
tightening as tuesdays primary drew closer dukakis sidestepped 
questions about whether his candidacy could sustain a loss in new 
york to jackson and contended he was not moved to overconfidence 
by polls that showed him ahead 
assuming one is going to win because one is ahead in the polls 
is very very bad policy the massachusetts governor said

here is a transcript of president reagans 
weekly radio address delivered from camp david md 
my fellow americans the news has been bad lately and thats 
good and heres why you probably have been hearing about 
panamanian strongman general manuel noriega whos been indicted 
in drug trafficking and his struggle to stay in power despite 
pressure from his own people and ou government to step down youve 
also been hearing about the drugrelated arrests of many street 
gang members in los angeles 
and then too theres the news about congressional 
investigations of organized crimes involvement in the drug trade 
now these news reports reflect an important change since the 
start of our administration in 1981 at the time we faced a crisis 
of crime stemming from the illegal drug trade especially in south 
florida 
at my urging vice president bush headed up a task force that 
performed invaluable service by coordinating the activities of all 
law enforcement agencies in the area and for the first time 
brought to bear against the drug smugglers the full weight of 
federal resources 
this included hightech military equipment and the resources of 
the intelligence community less than a year later i went over to 
the justice department to announce a sweeping effort to break the 
back of organized crime in america and a key part of this approach 
was the hiring of more than a thousand new agents and prosecutors 
as part of 12 regional drug task forces based on the south florida 
model 
we also set up a presidents commission on organized crime that 
did landmark work in tracing the international connections of the 
domestic drug trade pointing out the usefulness of drug testing 
and exposing not only the oldstyle mafias involvement in the drug 
trade but also the danger of new emerging crime gangs 
in addition to all this we got enacted sweeping legislative 
initiatives like the comprehensive crime control act of 1984 and 
the antidrug abuse act of 1986 this early attention to the 
criminal side of the drug problem which has translated into a 
tripling of the overall antidrug budget is now paying dividends 
cocaine seizures have increased by over 1800 percent arrest of 
major drug traffickers have increased by almost 200 percent and 
well over 500 million in drugrelated assets were seized in 1987 
alone 
and this kind of success at the federal level would not be 
possible without an unprecedented degree of federal state and 
local cooperation here in washington this commitment is best 
evidenced by our cabinetlevel national drug policy board as well 
as the vice presidents national narcotic border interdiction 
system and the department of justices organized crime drug 
enforcement task forces 
but emphasizing the criminal side of the drug problem is only 
part of defeating the drug menace thanks to the efforts of nancys 
just say no campaign americans are understanding that the 
permanent way to end the drug menace is to deny the drug pusher his 
market to stop demand and that means education and prevention it 
means understanding that drug use is not a victimless crime that 
drugs kill and maim and finance the criminal underground it means 
accepting the concept of user responsibility it means realizing 
that those who use drugs are in nancys words making themselves 
accomplices to murder 
now in addition to prevention and education and drug law 
enforcement we have also been emphasizing the international side 
of the problem when we came into office there were drug 
eradication programs underway in only two countries today that 
number is 23 
in fact this administration has signed an unprecedented number 
of mutual legal assistance treaties extradition treaties and 
eradication agreements 
the unprecedented indictment of panamanian leader noriega for 
drug trafficking by a us grand jury is a further indication of 
our nations resolve to end the foreign supply of drug his nation 
is in a crisis of his making 
but as i said at the beginning the fact that were seeing more 
media coverage of the drug problem and the heat put on people like 
general noriega and the street gangs in los angeles or organized 
crime in general is good news public awareness about the 
destructiveness of illegal drugs is at an alltime high americans 
are increasingly saying no to drugs a recent survey of high 
school seniors showed a significant drop in cocain and marijuana 
use 
we have a long way to go before we have a drugfree america and 
i hope the media keeps emphasizing that point but its also true 
america has awakened to this problem thats quite a change from 
just a decade ago 
so thats the good news the very good news about the bad news 
of drug abuse 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

brain cells from an aborted fetus were implanted 
into two britons suffering from parkinsons disease in a surgical 
procedure banned in the united states doctors said saturday 
the operations were the first of their kind in britain said 
neurologist edward hitchcock of the midland center for 
neurosurgery and neurology 
hitchcock operated on a severely disabled 60yearold woman 
march 3 and on a 41yearold man april 7 
both patients have been discharged from the hospital near 
birmingham in westcentral england and have discontinued the 
medication they were taking for the crippling disease hitchcock 
said in a statement 
the hospital would not release the patients names nor that of 
the woman whose aborted fetus was used in the procedure 
press association the domestic british news agency and 
independent television news said the woman was unaware that cells 
from her aborted fetus had been transplanted the hospital had no 
immediate comment on the report 
parkinsons disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is 
potentially fatal the implanted fetal tissue is believed to 
stimulate production of dopamine a brain chemical lacking in 
people who suffer from parkinsons 
hitchcock said the operations performed under local anesthetic 
involve transplanting the fetus cells into the patients brain 
through a surgical procedure that involves making a small hole in 
the skull 
the first documented use of the experimental procedure was 
revealed in january when surgeons in mexico city said they 
injected tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two 
parkinsons sufferers last september 
researchers in sweden also have reported using a similar 
technique 
the results obtained so far have been more than satisfactory 
giving a new revolution to world medical science particularly in 
the field of neurosurgery the mexican social security institute 
said in a statement in january 
in washington on friday government scientists were denied 
permission to attempt the procedure because of legal medical and 
ethical questions 
but the department of health and human services instructed the 
national institutes of health to appoint an outside advisory 
committee to examine the implications of using tissue from 
intentionally aborted fetuses 
the prohibition does not ban continuing research on tissue from 
fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths but that type generally 
is not feasible to use in the kind of transplant research the nih 
contemplated 
hitchcock a professor of neurology at the university of 
birmingham said the ethics of the procedure were reviewed by the 
hospitals ethical committee the government and the medical 
research council which sets professional standards were kept 
informed he said 
we have been preparing for this kind of operation for several 
years he said all the ethical issues have been carefully 
considered over a very long period 
hitchcock said the fetus involved was aborted well within the 
time limits set by current british law and within a proposed law 
before parliament 
women in britain now can have abortions until the 28th week of 
pregnancy although the proposed law would set a limit of 18 weeks 
dr michael harrison chairman of the sandwell health authority 
which administers the hospital said that if the ethical committee 
had any doubts about anything they turn it down 
any research that is done that has the benefits we hope to 
have is to be welcomed harrison said 
parkinsons disease is absolutely dreadful it is a disease 
that affects the brain and the patients ability to think and to 
move it makes them shuffle along it is dreadful and ultimately 
fatal 
hospital administrator glyn james said fetal tissue is often 
used for research in britain 
this is nothing like a brain transplant or even a 
quarterbrain transplant he said it only involves very very 
small pieces of cells

the worlds longest survivor of a fiveorgan 
transplant remained in serious condition saturday one day after 
doctors performed minor surgery to correct a problem with her new 
liver 
tabatha foster 3 has had periodic problems with her liver 
since the operation five months ago said lynn mcmahon spokeswoman 
for childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
the doctors on friday inserted a tube into her liver to drain 
bile that accumulated because of a compressed duct said ms 
mcmahon 
its usually a successful procedure the spokeswoman said 
the girls condition was lowered from fair to serious on friday 
the madisonville ky toddler is the worlds longest survivor 
of a fiveorgan transplant her parents roy and sandra foster 
were at her bedside in a private room 
shes still in the recovery stage but theres every 
expectation that when she fully regains consciousness shell 
return to the funloving state where she was prior to this 
procedure ms mcmahon said 
the doctors were not immediately certain whether tabatha 
sustained any permanent liver damage her other transplanted organs 
appear to be functioning well ms mcmahon said 
the girl was born with short gut syndrome a fatal congenital 
deformation of her intestines her liver later failed as a result 
of her highly concentrated liquid diet 
tabatha received a new liver pancreas small intestines and 
parts of a stomach and colon nov 1 she needed only a new liver 
and small intestine to survive but doctors said it was less 
complicated to transplant the fiveorgan group 
tabatha is such a resilient kid said sue cardillo another 
spokeswoman 
the multiple transplant considered experimental previously had 
been performed only twice in the united states both patients died

the president of denison university said 
his resignation does not have anything to do with student protests 
over a racial incident and called the timing a curious and 
fateful irony 
andrew g de rocco submitted his resignation friday after four 
years as president of the 2200student school charles a 
brickman chairman of denisons board of trustees said the board 
accepted with regret 
on tuesday de rocco suspended two white students for the rest 
of the current academic year the university judicial board had 
found them guilty of racially harassing a black student 
the judicial board had ordered the students suspended for the 
fall semester but blacks said the punishment was lenient and last 
week held rallies and called for class boycotts the protest was 
called off after de rocco ordered the two white students off campus 
my agonies about the next stage of my career began some months 
ago its a curious and fateful irony that the other events were 
coincidental with the resignation de rocco said friday night 
its accidental but not causal 
denison spokesman stewart b dyke said de rocco was not 
pressured by the trustees the board voted a resolution fully 
supporting the actions andrew de rocco took dyke said 
de rocco 58 became president of the central ohio liberal arts 
college in 1984 he came to denison from trinity college in 
hartford conn and had been a research physicist 
as the time draws near for implementing denisons longrange 
plan it has become clear to me that the commitment needed to 
realize it would be more than i could reasonably give and still 
contemplate future career options for myself de rocco said in a 
news release issued friday 
brickman said that trustee william t mcconnell president of 
the park national corp in newark would head a committee to search 
for a successor

trustees at miami university on saturday 
unanimously defeated a proposal by several student organizations to 
eliminate the term freshman for firstyear students 
trustees also voted 53 against changing the words of the 
schools alma mater to strike male references from the 1910 lyrics 
the trustees said changing the label to firstyear students 
would cause confusion and alumni disapproved of altering the 
school song the trustees said 
im disgusted and im glad im graduating said elizabeth 
braeman a senior from washington dc who proposed the changes 
she said it would have been appropriate to make the changes this 
year which marks the 100th anniversary of women being admitted to 
the school 
ms braeman also a student government leader said the student 
senate the student affairs council and the university senate had 
earlier approved the recommendations 
it wasnt just liz braeman on a rampage it was approved by 
the three governing bodies of the university said ms braeman 
who is a member of a campus group called the association for women 
students 
the feminist organization recently staged a sitin picketed a 
campus beauty pageant and criticized the administration for not 
doing enough to prevent sexual harassment or to assure the safety 
of women students walking on the campus at night university 
officials say they are dealing with those issues 
the womens group has about 30 members on miamis 15000student 
main campus here in southwestern ohio about 30 miles north of 
cincinnati 
the changes in the alma mater old miami new miami would 
have converted while thy sons have quested from thee to all 
thy students questing from thee men shall ever seek thy 
guiding to we shall ever seek thy guiding and youth and 
maiden throng thy gate to men and women throng thy gate 
ms braeman said the references are sexist and dated because 
they refer to males only and should be eliminated as part of a 
program to remove such terms from use in official university 
publications 
paul pearson miamis president recommended the trustees 
approve changing the song but took no position on the term freshman

experts on japans terrorist red army said saturday 
that the small but vicious leftist band is stepping up its 
activities with funds and supplies provided by radical arab leftist 
groups 
on tuesday new jersey police arrested a suspected member of the 
red army carrying three homemade bombs in italy a wellknown red 
army member is being sought on suspicion of planting a car bomb 
that killed an american servicewoman and four italians in naples on 
thursday 
the red army a radical splinter from the now defunct leftist 
general federation of japanese students was active in the 1970s 
after an estimated 30 members fled to the middle east calling it 
the center of world revolution 
their attacks included a massacre at tel avivs lod airport in 
israel in 1972 that left 28 people dead before last weeks 
violence the band most recently claimed responsibility for bomb 
and rocket attacks on the us and british embassies in rome 
no one was injured in those attacks which took place in rome on 
june 9 1987 while the leaders of seven western nations were 
holding their annual summit in venice 
police officials would not comment on local news reports that 
the red army was feared to be planning attacks on the summit of the 
advanced industrial nations in toronto in june and the summer 
olympic games in seoul in september 
but akio ohno a veteran police critic said the summit and the 
olympic games would be two possible targets 
the red army has openly criticized the south korean government 
for its proamerican stance and it maintains that its ultimate 
goal is a world revolution to destroy capitalism ohno said 
ohno who lead the once powerful student organization in the 
1950s said the red army is now believed to work with arab leftists 
and is led by fusako shigenobu a college dropout who once worked 
as a tokyo bar hostess to raise red army funds 
naples police said saturday that ms shigenobu is suspected of 
helping plant the bomb at the uso club that killed five people 
thursday she also has been identified as a key figure in the lod 
massacre 
another police critic ro takenaka said the arrest of yu 
kikumura 35 in new jersey might well suggest that the red army is 
trying to expand its theater of operations to the united states 
they have the talent of making bombs i believe kikumura 
himself made the three bombs he was carrying takenaka told the 
associated press 
ohno said the arrest last fall of osamu maruoka 37 who had 
been on the international wanted list for alleged involvement in 
the lod massacre was another indication the group might have 
planned attacks on south korean targets possibly including olympic 
facilities to dramatize its activity 
maruoka considered by police as the no 2 red army leader was 
arrested nov 21 in tokyo after arriving on a flight from hong kong 
with a false passport 
subsequent police investigations showed maruoka had reserved a 
oneway ticket to seoul the following month 
at lod airport on may 30 1972 kozo okamoto then 24 tsuyoshi 
okudaira 26 and yasuyuki yasuda 25 sprayed machine gun fire and 
hurled hand grenades into the airports crowded luggage collection 
area 
in addition to 26 civilian victims mostly puerto rican 
pilgrims okudaira and yasuda were killed okamoto was seized by 
israeli security officers 
okamoto was among 1100 palestinian and other prisoners freed by 
israel as part of an exchange for israeli soldiers in geneva 
switzerland in may 1985 
okudairas younger brother junzo now being sought in italy for 
the carbomb attack thursday first joined the red army in the 
middle east in 1974 after slipping out of japan with a false 
passport 
the younger okudaira allegedly joined in an attack on the french 
embassy at the hague later in 1974 and an attack on the us 
embassy in kuala lumpur in 1975 
he was arrested in jordan in 1976 on charges of possessing a 
false passport and deported to japan but was freed in 1977 when 
the red army hijackers of a japan air lines jet in bangladesh 
demanded his release 
the red army had no more than 300 members at its peak following 
its formation in 1968 according to police estimates following 
police crackdowns later in the 1960s about 30 members slipped out 
of japan to operate abroad 
police action and internal feuding climaxing with the murder of 
14 members at the groups mountain hideout in japan in 1971 
sharply sapped its strength within japan

here is a transcript of the democratic radio 
address delivered saturday by rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee 
this is congressman dan rostenkowski of illinois id like to 
talk to you about the trade legislation that is nearing completion 
in congress 
for too many years the united states has been without a 
coherent trade policy this has been true in both democratic and 
republican administrations trade has simply been ignored and the 
effect of this inattention has been devastating in the space of a 
few years we have gone from being the worlds largest creditor 
nation to the worlds largest debtor the result has been the loss 
of american jobs and a growing dependence on foreign investment 
in the coming weeks we will have an opportunity to begin the 
reversal of this alarming trend the house and senate are about to 
approve and send to the president the most comprehensive trade bill 
ever considered in the congress this legislation is the result of 
a threeyear bipartisan effort to develop a strong cohesive trade 
policy one that is designed to open markets centralize our trade 
decisionmaking process and assist us workers 
the legislative process has been both timeconsuming and 
controversial we had to resist strong protectionist sentiments 
that demanded we erect our own trade barriers we also had to 
overcome a business as usual indifference on the part of the 
current administration 
our legislative goal was a trade bill that was so strong our 
trading partners could not ignore it and so fair that the president 
would have to sign it i think weve succeeded 
the message this bill sends to our trading partners is strong 
and clear we expect their markets to be open to us goods we 
streamline the process of resolving trade disputes we give our 
trade negotiator the tools to attack trade agreement violations and 
we require him to use those tools but our message is not one of 
belligerence it simply says we want fair trade i have met with 
foreign trade ministers in europe and asia they not only expect 
this message they accept it 
like any bill of this size and scope the legislation is not 
perfect at various stages it has been criticized the president 
in particular has been a vocal critic of several provisions i had 
hoped for greater cooperation from the president in the development 
of the bill but he elected instead to simply list his objections 
although this made it difficult to reach compromises the final 
product addresses many of the presidents concerns 
many doubted we could agree on a strong trade bill that avoided 
protectionist measures in fact many in the administration were 
hoping for a bill that was so protectionist the president could 
easily veto it well they are going to be disappointed 
in recent days ive heard complaints that weve gone too far 
and complaints that we have not gone far enough my 30 years as a 
legislator tells me that when a bill is attacked by both sides 
its probably pretty good legislation 
the congress has done a responsible job in strengthening our 
trade laws and avoiding protectionist measures now its up to the 
president it took us three years to get this far we cant afford 
to let our trade policy drift any longer the president can put us 
on the right course by signing this landmark legislation

erosion from a storm wednesday that also damaged 30 homes along the 
outer banks 
gov jim martin flew in thursday and called for jetties to 
stabilize oregon inlets shifting sands a project authorized by 
congress 17 years ago has never been built mostly due to

state university veterinarians say 
its remarkable how easily she has adjusted said frank 
garry of csus veterinary teaching hospital she goes scooting 
off when she has her artificial leg on she enjoys having four legs 
again 
kosha lost much of her right front leg last december when she 
got tangled in fence wire she was part of a herd of 30 llamas 
owned by rudyard and katharine nelson and their son jim at a 
farm near kimball neb 
in many cases when a large animals limb is severely injured 
the animal has to be put to death because fitting artificial limbs 
is so difficult but veterinarians were able to replace the lower 
part of koshas leg with materials developed for the space shuttle 
kosha was fitted with the device wednesday officials say she 
moved somewhat awkwardly at first but soon was getting around with 
few problems 
the leg was designed to withstand almost allday use without 
causing sores and discomfort it is expected to be weather 
resistant and will allow natural movement

afghan rebel leaders told 75000 
supporters saturday they will fight on despite an accord to 
withdraw soviet troops from afghanistan two nearby bomb explosions 
killed five people 
but afghan president najib speaking in kabul warned the rebels 
that they will face the iron will of his people after the 
soviet troops leave his government controls about 75000 troops 
in islamabad pakistans acting foreign minister returned from 
geneva saturday and predicted that afghanistans communist 
government will fall quickly after the soviet withdrawal 
on thursday in geneva the united states soviet union pakistan 
and afghanistan signed an agreement to begin withdrawing an 
estimated 115000 soviet troops from afghanistan on may 15 
pakistan represented the guerrillas at the talks but the 
insurgents have vowed to oppose any agreement without their 
participation the soviets have been helping the marxist government 
fight the moslem insurgents since 1979 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen are believed to number 
about 200000 they are based in pakistan and receive support from 
that country as well as the united states china iran and other 
nations 
the two explosions near peshawar saturday also wounded at least 
11 people no one claimed responsibility but pakistani authorities 
have blamed a wave of bombings in the past two years on the afghan 
secret police 
in the village of rajjar about 40 miles north of peshawar four 
people including two women and a child were killed and 10 wounded 
when a 4pound bomb went off in a waiting room of a bus station 
one person was killed in another bomb explosion in landi kotal 
on pakistans border with afghanistan 
the guerrilla leaders told the insurgents and refugees in a 
stadium in this border city that they will fight until they topple 
the afghan government 
ahmed shah a guerrilla designated by the rebel alliance to head 
an allrebel interim government stood in the 95degree heat and 
told the crowd his administration would soon move into afghanistan 
he gave no deadline 
well stay with you in afghanistan in the caves and snow not 
in pakistan he said 
despite the withdrawal agreement the united states and pakistan 
have vowed to continue supplying arms to the rebels until the 
soviet union ceases its aid to the kabul government the kremlin 
says it will continue supporting the kabul government 
pakistans acting foreign minister zain noorani said he expected 
the afghan government to fall soon after the soviets withdraw 
i do not have any doubt about it the kabul government has 
been rejected by the people of afghanistan he was quoted as 
saying by the official pakistani news agency app 
noorani said afghan guerrillas control more than 80 percent of 
their country 
the official soviet news agency tass quoted najib as saying he 
no longer needs soviet support because the geneva accord guarantees 
his countrys sovereignty pakistan and afghanistan pledge not to 
interfere in one anothers affairs in the agreement 
najib said his government would need the help of afghan refugees 
to stave off the rebels he called on the refugees who number 
about five million and live in pakistan and iran to return home 
and offered to help them set up armed units 
under the geneva accord the soviet union will pull half its 
troops out of afghanistan in three months and the rest after six 
additional months 
many us analysts believe najibs government will collapse 
during or after the soviet withdrawal

a supreme court decision upholding a childs 
right to sue a school principal over corporal punishment could 
drastically reduce use of the paddle not so much because of the 
courts but because of insurance companies an expert says 
as a result of the courts decision last month said temple 
university psychology professor irwin hyman more cases will come 
to the courts and insurance companies will question the use of 
corporal punishment in the schools and possibly raise rates for 
schools which practice it 
the decision also means teachers will now be more vulnerable 
to litigation because the existence of a basis for legal 
challenge has been recognized he said 
hyman is director of temples national center for the study of 
corporal punishment and its alternatives 
on march 21 the supreme court let stand without comment a new 
mexico appeals court decision that said students could challenge 
excessive corporal punishment in the federal courts on the basis of 
their 14th amendment right to due process 
that case was brought in us district court five years ago it 
charged that teresa garcia an elementary school student in 
penasco nm was seriously beaten twice 
court documents said that in 1982 teresa then 9 was held 
upside down by a teacher and beaten severely with a paddle she was 
bruised and scarred she was beaten again the following year the 
suit said 
the court ruled in the schools favor but the 10th us circuit 
court of appeals reversed the decision saying that punishments 
that are so grossly excessive as to be shocking to the conscience 
violate substantive due process rights 
the supreme court upheld the appeals court clearing the way for 
the federal lawsuit to be tried on the issue of whether the 
punishment given teresa was indeed excessive 
this case sets a precedent which other district courts will 
look to and apply in other jurisdictions said john roesler a 
santa fe attorney who represented teresa 
though the case could bring insurance company pressure to bear 
on schoiol districts that practice paddling hyman said there is 
still tradition to contend with 
there is a strong religious and historic precedent for 
inflicting physical pain as a form of discipline in this country 
he said even today teachers believe that they should do to 
children what was done to them 
hyman said that a growing number of states have abolished 
corporal punishment in the schools there are now 14 states where 
school paddling is illegal hyman said

native americans who generally do 
not vote as a matter of principle must get involved in the 
nations political process in order to improve life on the 
reservation democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson said 
saturday 
we want to reach out to them and urge them to vote jackson 
said at a rally at an indian museum so many native americans 
have simply been brokenhearted theyve been hurt so long they 
feel a sense of betrayal we have to get them involved 
jackson urged indians to join his rainbow coalition of 
minorities and workers he said racism and poverty experienced by 
indians was no different from that of blacks and other minorities 
while some native american communities have become involved in 
american politics new york is a stronghold for sovereign indian 
governments such as the six nations of the iroquois confederacy 
most of the tribes in the confederacy believe that voting would 
abrogate the treaties establishing their reservations as distinct 
nations 
tribal governments are on guard against any incursion by 
nonindians and have often rejected economic development they could 
not control partly as a result the reservations have unusually 
high unemployment rates 
we all want the same things dignity respect and equal 
opportunity jackson told about 800 people who gathered at the 
native american center for the living arts on the banks of the 
niagara river near the falls most of the crowd was black 
wanda shoe a director of the native american center said that 
while most indians are not even registered to vote many identify 
with jackson as a candidate 
hes the only one who has demonstrated any interest in us 
shoe said adding that the candidate was causing many indians to 
reevaluate themselves she said shes not registered to vote nor 
are members of her family and most friends 
we see what he is doing for black people she said its 
hard not to get excited by it 
jackson spoke for almost an hour calling for a war on drugs an 
increase in the minimum wage better educational opportunites and 
more money spent rebuilding roads and bridges 
his supporters often interrupted him with chants of win 
jesse win 
following the speech the directors of the center gave jackson a 
necklace and a printed shirt that read remember us native 
americans

sen jesse helms rnc on saturday said the 
new ussoviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will cost the 
taxpayers billions of dollars contradicting a congressional report 
that said the pact would save money 
helms a leading opponent of the treaty which would eliminate 
the two superpowers mediumrange nuclear missiles from europe 
said the united states would have to strengthen its conventional 
forces to counterbalance soviet forces in warsaw pact nations 
thus he estimated the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
would cost taxpayers between 258 billion and 326 billion over the 
13year life of the pact 
most americans are unaware of the price tag on this treaty 
because the administration particularly the department of defense 
has gone out of its way to cover up the taxpayer expense helms 
said in a statement accompanying a draft of a report by the 
republican staff of the senate foreign relations committee 
helms the ranking minority member of the committee contradicts 
a report released april 6 by the general accounting office 
congress watchdog agency it said the treaty would save about 17 
billion through the fall of 1995 
the gao said the savings will come because the pentagon will no 
longer need to maintain its pershing and groundlaunched cruise 
missile force in western europe it said money will also be saved 
on associated costs for military personnel procurement and 
construction of housing for military family members 
however helms committee report using the gao data and other 
information from the congressional budget office and the army 
reevaluated the costs and savings associated with the treaty 
department of defense endstrengths will remain the same or 
even increase since compensating steps will have to be taken to 
repair nato defenses in europe once the inf systems have been 
eliminated the republican report said 
and helms said even if the united states does not boost its 
convential forces in europe the treaty would still cost at least 
366 billion to scrap missiles to guard against soviet cheating 
and to keep track of soviet personnel assigned to monitor treaty 
compliance 
helms said the soviets will have costs too but said in their 
slavelabor economy their expense will be insignificant when 
compared with ours 
the treaty was endorsed last month in lopsided votes by both the 
senate armed services and foreign relations committees and awaits a 
vote in the full senate 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva has refused to 
call it up for a vote until a dispute is resolved over whether the 
treaty covers futuristic weapons such as lasers the administration 
has been pressing for ratification before the may 29june 2 
superpower summit meeting in moscow

palestinians blamed israel saturday for the 
killing of plo military commander khalil alwazir but an israeli 
expert on terrorism suggested he was assassinated in an internal 
power struggle 
it was certain the slaying will intensify the rioting in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where israeli soldiers killed 
more than a dozen arabs on saturday in the highest singleday death 
toll since antioccupation violence began dec 8 
israels government had no official reaction to the 
assassination alwazir whose code name is abu jihad was killed 
saturday at his home in tunis by commandos with machine guns 
it is only natural that the plo would blame israel they 
always blame israel said avi pazner spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
ariel merari a terrorism expert at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said tensions had been growing inside 
the palestine liberation organization between chairman yasser 
arafat and alwazir arafats military chief and no 2 man in 
fatah the plos largest branch 
i would say that its most likely an internal operation an 
operation that originated from within fatah and most likely was 
carried out with the complicity knowledge and perhaps at the 
invitation of yasser arafat said merari 
he said arafat and alwazir had disagreed over arafats 
appointment of commanders in south lebanon where the plo has been 
rebuilding its guerrilla force 
but prominent palestinians saw the killing as an attempt to stop 
antioccupation resistance in the occupied territories 
i am certain the only party that will profit from the 
assassination is israel said hanna siniora editor of the 
proplo daily al fajr in jerusalem 
siniora said alwazir was responsible for giving guidelines to 
local palestinian activists who led the fourmonth uprising in the 
occupied lands 
by planning the assassination the thought was they can 
contain and nip in the bud the present uprising in the occupied 
territories said siniora he noted that the slaying followed 
mass arrests and other tough measures in the occupied areas 
palestinians said another indicator that israel was involved was 
the similarity between the assassination and israels april 10 
1973 commando raid in beirut 
several senior plo officials were shot to death including kamel 
adwan alwazirs predecessor as operations chief of fatah the 
commando teams leader was amnon lipkin now head of israeli 
military intelligence 
israel carried out similar attacks 
the jan 22 1979 car bomb attack that killed ali hassan 
salameh also known as abu hassan fatahs chief of intelligence 
who israel believed helped mastermind the massacre of israeli 
athletes at the 1972 olympics in munich 
the oct 1 1985 air raid on the plo headquarters in tunisia 
1500 miles from israel in which 50 people were killed including 
an arafat bodyguard 
there also have been cases of arab moderates slain by arab 
militants 
abu nidal leader of an extremist group that split from 
arafats organization claimed responsibility for the april 1983 
assassination of issam sartawi an adviser to arafat who advocated 
talks with israel 
on july 22 1987 palestinian cartoonist ali naji awad al 
adhami was shot outside the office of the kuwati newspaper al qabas 
in london no one claimed responsibility but investigators believe 
members of one of the arab groups he satirized killed him 
even though he believed the assassination was the work of 
palestinians merari said israel had motives to strike at alwazir 
i would say that israel had very good reasons to do that 
alwazir was personally involved in some of the more atrocious 
terrorist acts against israel said merari 
merari cited the march 1978 hijacking of a bus on the coastal 
highway near tel aviv in which 35 israelis were killed and the 1975 
takeover of the savoy hotel in which 11 hostages were slain 
as head of the socalled western sector military apparatus 
alwazir was also responsible for thousands of antiisraeli attacks 
in the occupied lands since 1967 when israel seized the 
territories merari said 
despite the violent protests in the west bank and gaza strip 
israeli military correspondent zeev schiff of the daily haaretz 
newspaper predicted the assassination would have a demoralizing 
impact on the palestinians 
he said it also may touch off feuding among the plos eight main 
factions 
i estimate that there will be a power struggle maybe a quiet 
one and a younger generation will emerge its a blow to arafat 
and as a result the plo will probably become a little more 
extreme said schiff

a cub reporter kept an armed man on the 
telephone for three hours and helped persuade him to surrender 
saturday after the man barricaded himself in his home to draw 
attention to the drug problem 
raymond a garcia 36 fired several shots in his home during 
the sevenhour siege no one was injured 
garcia had armed himelf with an ak47 combat rifle police said 
neighbors were evacuated and police and agents from the state 
division of criminal investigation urged him to surrender by 
telephone 
diana reed 23 who has worked for radio station kbur for three 
months said she got a call from garcia late friday i initially 
had a reporter reaction miss reed said but she emerged as a key 
player in resolving the standoff 
i felt like it was all on my shoulders the police and the dci 
kept telling me to stay on the line she said 
garcia said that his 16yearold son had a drug problem but that 
police refused his request that they arrest the teenager and send 
him to a drug dependency center miss reed said 
garcia said he did not want to go to jail and threatened to 
leave the house firing into the air so police would have to shoot 
him miss reed said 
she advised him to surrender so police could answer his 
complaints he finally agreed on the condition that he not be taken 
to jail 
garcia was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation 
said police lt david wunnenberg the man was charged with a 
misdemeanor count of discharging a firearm said capt robert sloan 
im going to look into what he said miss reed said i 
guess it takes arrest or charges filed by police to get children 
into a drug rehabilitation program 
police said four to six shots were fired during the siege but 
were not aimed at anyone outside the house

the rocky bayou christian school says it 
will let the internal revenue service steal four years of 
social security taxes it has refused to pay on grounds they violate 
religious freedom 
the nondenominational school of more than 300 students agreed 
friday to place nearly 90600 in a bank account that the irs can 
then seize said school director bob grete 
since we are not going to write a check for that amount 
theyre going to steal it grete said neither side can 
tolerate continuing this conflict 
irs officials who met with grete at the school friday declined 
comment 
the school has refused to pay social security contributions for 
its employees since 1984 claiming the levy amounts to a tax on god 
the irs withheld efforts to force collection until the us 
supreme court last month refused to hear an appeal in a similar 
case involving the bethel baptist church of sellersville pa 
we have an obligation to proclaim the authority of god were 
being asked by human government to do what god would forbid 
grete said we cant pay the tax sin is sin regardless of 
whether the supreme court will give us a hearing or not

the trustee for the financially troubled 
ptl ministry says he will try to save its religious activities 
even if it means selling its heritage usa theme park 
ptl is something much more important than a water park or a 
hotel david clark said friday the heart of ptl must be the 
ministry 
during a hearing friday us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
who extended the deadline for ptl to present a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan by two weeks to may 16 said it looks like 
the end of the road for the ministry 
ptl officials told reynolds at the hearing in greensboro nc 
that they couldnt raise the 57 million needed by the previous 
deadline of may 2 
reynolds ordered clark to present a plan that would enable the 
ministry built by jim and tammy bakker to sell whatever is 
necessary while continuing to operate 
its definitely a liquidation reynolds said its just a 
matter of how orderly a liquidation 
the internal revenue service is seeking more than 55 million in 
back taxes and opposes ptls plan to qualify as a taxexempt 
organization 
ptl plans to sell 1700 undeveloped acres it owns on the south 
carolinanorth carolina border and a small attraction at heritage 
usa in fort mill called farmland usa 
clark said other assets may have to be sold to preserve the 
ministrys religious activities including the daily ptl club 
show and the satellite tv network 
he told reynolds the 10 million water park at heritage usa will 
not open this year for lack of money 
clark also told the judge that people who once financed the 
ministry arent contributing any more we had a moral bankruptcy 
in the ministry that led to a financial bankruptcy he said 
he said the ministry laid off about 125 employees friday 
leaving the fulltime payroll at about 685 when clark arrived at 
ptl on nov 1 the ministry had about 1100 employees 
clark said representatives of a major us financial 
institution will meet next week with ptl officials to discuss a 
possible longterm loan of 45 million 
but reynolds was skeptical i dont know who would loan you 
money the judge said 
the financial troubles renewed talk that bakker who stepped 
down last year in a sex and hushmoney scandal may return 
the second that clark fails jim will be back said inez 
brown vice president of the bring bakker back club which has been 
urging supporters to withhold contributions until bakker returns

seven masked commandos burst into the home 
of plo military chief khalil alwazir early saturday and opened 
fire with submachine guns killing him two bodyguards and a 
gardener 
government and plo officials said alwazir fired back with a 
revolver but his body was riddled by about 170 bullets plo sources 
in cyprus and tunisia said a second group of commandos provided 
cover outside the building but those reports were not confirmed 
leaders of the palestine liberation organization blamed israel 
for the killings in suburban tunis palestinians protesting the 
slaying rioted in the israelioccupied territories and israeli 
soldiers killed more than a dozen arabs in the worst singleday 
toll since violence against the occupation began dec 8 
alwazir 52 also was called abu jihad father of holy war he 
was the most senior palestinian official assassinated since the 
fatah the largest guerrilla group in the plo was founded 1964 
he was plo chairman yasser arafats closest aide a member of 
the executive committee and the no 2 man after arafat in fatah he 
led fatahs troops the main plo force and supervised military 
operations inside the israelioccupied gaza strip and west bank 
the plo said the assassination team which included a woman 
fired about 170 bullets into alwazirs body the commandos 
escaped and tunisian sources said three vehicles possibly used in 
the early morning attack were found on a beach about 25 miles north 
of tunis 
israel gave no official reaction to the killings and us 
officials refused to comment on whether the israelis were 
responsible 
arafat who was in bahrain at the time was quite shocked and 
angered said a plo source there speaking on condition of 
anonymity arafat went later to saudi arabia and then on to tunis 
a special investigation commission formed by president zine 
elabidine ben ali of tunisia said in a preliminary report saturday 
night a commando group armed with silenced submachine guns and 
pistols made up of seven members including a woman attacked the 
residence of abu jihad at 130 am 
it said the killers fired several bursts at the palestinian 
leader his two bodyguards and a tunisian gardener and 
alwazir responded using his personal revolver before being hit 
in different parts of his body 
the commandos immediately left on the road to the forest of 
raoued about 40 kilometers 25 miles north of tunis aboard three 
vehicles a peugeot 305 and two volkswagen minibuses found 
abandoned by their occupants saturday at dawn the report said 
it said the investigation indicated the vehicles had been 
rented under false identities 
palestinian officials vowed to intensify the guerrilla war 
against israel and the uprising of palestinians in the west bank 
and gaza 
the plo is an umbrella group for eight palestinian factions 
including fatah three plo groups and a guerrilla organization 
outside it challenge arafats loyalists 
a plo spokesman in tunis said the attack was carried out by the 
israeli terrorists of mossad the secret service and their 
american backers who are determined to liquidate our people 
bassam abu sharif a top arafat adviser said in a telephone 
interview contrary to what the israeli government thinks the 
murder of abu jihad will only increase our determination and we 
shall upgrade both the uprising and military operations to avenge 
this act of terrorism 
plo officials said alwazir was in the study of his house 
reading when the attackers drove up killed a tunisian bodyguard in 
a car outside then burst into the house and killed a palestinian 
bodyguard and a gardener 
they then broke into abu jihads study said a plo spokesman 
who refused to give his name everything happened within seconds 
he had drawn his pistol to defend himself but they mowed him 
down 
alwazirs wife intisar his daughter hanan 14 and son nidal 
2 the youngest of his five children were in the house at the time 
but were unhurt 
palestinian officials said alwazirs wife told tunisian 
authorities that the attackers were masked dressed in military 
fatigues and armed with silenced weapons 
the area around alwazirs home was sealed off by tunisian 
security forces police set up roadblocks and were checking 
identities throughout the area all routes out of the country were 
being watched 
saturdays killing was the second strike at the plo on tunisian 
territory since the group moved its headquarters there after it was 
driven from lebanon by the invasion of the israeli army in 1982 
on oct 1 1985 israeli jets bombed plo headquarters at tunis 
killing about 80 palestinians and 20 tunisians and injuring at 
least 100 other people

the us government acted improperly when it 
denied the widow of former chilean president salvador allende a 
visa in 1983 by saying the speeches she planned to give were a 
potential threat to foreign policy a federal appeals court has 
ruled 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court 
ruling that denying a visa to hortensia allende violated the 1952 
immigration and nationality act 
but the court also noted that after the lawsuit was filed the 
government approved a multiple entry visa for mrs allende valid 
through the end of 1987 and has said it presumably would approve a 
visa application in 1988 
mrs allende has visited the united states several times under 
the visa said one of her attorneys allan rosenberg 
the court rejected the reagan administrations argument that 
mrs allendes presence would cause general harm to foreign 
policy 
the government may not exclude allende on the bare assertion 
that her presence in the united states at any given time may 
prejudice foreign policy interests the court said in a decision 
wednesday upholding a us district court ruling last year 
mrs allende had planned to address several groups in california 
that had invited her to speak on womens and human rights issues 
her husband salvador allende was slain during a 1973 coup that 
overthrew him and his marxist government 
the case was brought by the national emergency civil liberties 
committee the boston area council on latin america the northern 
california ecumenical council and four massachusetts university 
professors who had invited mrs allende to speak 
in a statement attorneys for the civil liberties organization 
said the ruling is of historic significance because of the clear 
ruling that mrs allende was denied a visa because of the content 
of her intended speech and the courts rejection of the 
governments right to do so

north dakota democrats settled on a largely 
uncommitted slate of national convention delegates but jesse 
jackson supporters said saturday they considered it a victory to 
win two delegates in this rural predominantly white state 
three of the 15 delegates picked at the partys state convention 
are pledged to massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 10 are 
uncommitted 
jackson barely qualified for any national delegates at all 
receiving support from 16 percent of the state convention 
delegates under democratic party rules a candidate must receive 
at least 15 percent of the available support to claim any national 
convention delegates 
dukakis received support from 25 percent of the state convention 
delegates while the uncommitted group accounted for 59 percent of 
the state convention delegates 
we feel its a very good showing for jesse in a state that 
does not have many blacks said tom disselhorst state 
cochairman for the jackson campaign 
he said he hoped that jacksons showing sends a message to new 
york that jesse can do well in conservative predominantly white 
states 
nearly 96 percent of north dakotas population is white 
north dakota democrats began their process last month with 
precinct caucuses in which dukakis appeared to have enough 
strength to claim as many as five national convention delegates if 
those results had been followed at the state convention jackson 
would have received three delegates and seven would have been 
uncommitted 
north dakotans however tend to focus on issues rather than 
candidates and more than half of those who are counted as 
uncommitted actually were supporting issues related to labor and 
agriculture 
ellen austin state coordinator of the dukakis campaign said 
she expected her candidate to attract a number of uncommitted 
delegates 
six state party leaders including gov george sinner and rep 
byron dorgan automatically receive seats as delegates to the 
national convention 
sinner is uncommitted and dorgan a former supporter of rep 
richard gephardt is backing dukakis

the last synagogue in warsaw was filled 
saturday with hundreds of young jews who prayed danced and sang 
the israeli national anthem to mark the jewish ghetto uprising 
against nazi occupation troops 
an overflow crowd of 1000 people packed the rebuilt nozyk 
synagogue where the weekly saturday morning services usually are 
attended by only several dozen polish jews most of whom are 
elderly 
there are no rabbis still in poland but several from israel 
the united states canada and england led the sabbath services on 
saturday 
several thousand jews from around the world have come to poland 
to mark the 45th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising in 
which poorly armed insurgents fought a heroic but doomed battle to 
resist the final nazi drive to liquidate the 70000 jews left in 
the ghetto 
israeli deputy prime minister itzhak navon who is heading the 
official israeli delegation for the anniversary observances gave 
an emotional speech to the worshipers speaking in hebrew 
i want the hebrew language to be heard here the language of 
the resurrection of the jewish people said navon who later 
translated his remarks into english 
navon the highestranking israeli official ever to visit this 
communist country said nothing is left of warsaws 
oncevibrant jewish community 
before the 1939 nazi invasion warsaw was home to about 380000 
jews or 30 percent of the citys population most died of hunger 
disease or in the gas chambers of nazi death camps 
there are no remains of the ghetto and of the revolt said 
navon for all those who survive there is only one way back to 
zion 
afterwards several hundred young jews from israel and other 
countries sang hebrew songs and joined hands to dance inside and in 
front of the synagogue which was destroyed by the nazis and 
reopened in april 1983 during observances of the 40th anniversary 
of the ghetto uprising 
they also sang the hope the israeli national anthem 
im very excited said 15yearold tsul shafil of tel aviv 
i think it is very important for us to come because the blood is 
here and we must be here to say that israel is living 
stanley shapiro of venice calif a member of a usbased 
committee set up to preserve sites of the holocaust in poland said 
watching the young jews dancing at the synagogue was an emotional 
experience 
i think its a reaffirmation of the vitality of the jewish 
people he said it shows that the jewish people remember and 
do not forget

the quietest political election campaign in 
america is being fought in the us senate 
no bands banners or bumper stickers for these candidates for 
one of the nations most powerful offices no gladhanding media 
events staged for television indeed news coverage is discouraged 
its the ultimate insider election 
the winner becomes the democratic leader of the senate and if 
the party keeps its hold in the november elections the winning 
candidate will become senate majority leader 
the campaign which has unofficially been under way for more 
than a year began in earnest shortly before 230 pm last tuesday 
when robert c byrd of west virginia announced he would not seek 
reelection as majority leader 
within minutes three senators let the press know they wanted 
the job others were said to have sniffed the winds but were 
quietly discouraged by fellow democrats 
because the three who are running didnt call any formal news 
conferences and because they wont even want to be seen as 
campaigning brief profiles are in order 
sen daniel k inouye of hawaii inouye is 63 has served five 
terms in the senate and is secretary of the democratic caucus the 
no 3 position in the senate democratic leadership inouye was 
handed a plum last year when he was named chairman of the select 
committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan 
opposition the man who ran the senates summerlong irancontra 
hearings 
inouye rates his chances as very good despite some quiet 
party criticism last year that he allowed lt col oliver l north 
to steal the show disclosure of his maneuvering to get money for 
religious schools in france included in a budget bill last december 
also hurt but inouye has a long record of distinguished service 
in 1973 he gained prominence as a member of the watergate 
investigating committee during world war ii he lost his right arm 
fighting in italy he holds the distinguished service cross the 
nations second highest military decoration 
sen george j mitchell of maine at 54 mitchell is the 
youngest of the three declared candidates a federal court judge 
who resigned his lifetime appointment to the bench in 1979 to 
accept an appointment to the senate he won on his own in 1982 and 
is running again this year 
mitchell is considered by some the favorite in the race for 
democratic leader although its a contest with a tradition of 
surprises byrd won the job in 1977 when hubert humphrey conceded 
defeat a week before the vote 
mitchell gained favor in 1986 as chairman of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee a year the party reclaimed its 
majority in the senate consequently mitchell was named to the 
prestigious irancontra committee and was given the honorary 
position of deputy president pro tempore of the senate 
sen j bennett johnston of louisiana johnston is 55 has been 
in the senate since 1972 and is midway through his third term 
serving as chairman of the energy and natural resources committee 
johnston tried to unseat byrd for the job in 1986 but conceded 
defeat a week before the election he remains popular with fellow 
southern and oilstate democrats and says hes very encouraged 
by the support he counts this time around 
byrd voluntarily stepped down after 10 years in the office 
maintaining he had the votes to keep the job but he said he 
would rather devote himself to helping povertyridden west 
virginia using his seniority to become chairman of appropriations 
committee and president pro tempore of the senate first of 
course he must win reelection in november and the democrats must 
retain control of the senate which they now hold by a 5446 margin 
each candidate offers democrats a change of image 
byrd who used his knowledge of the senate and its rules and his 
collection of ious to originally gain the job is now perceived by 
some party leaders as unsuited to be chief spokesman in the age of 
televised senate proceedings 
a washington post editorial said after his announcement that 
byrd was more the attentive stationmaster than a smooth front man 
for his party and articulator of its views 
he also was a stickler for senate rules procedure and historic 
custom his sometimes ponderous leadership style did little to 
alleviate the quality of life issue that left younger senators 
fretting and chafing as the senate sat idle through hours of 
quorum calls only to get down to business at midnight 
it was that quality of life issue that helped sen dan 
evans rwash decide against reelection this year those who 
remain complain darkly that if that quality keeps declining so 
will the quality of future senators 
sen alan dixon dill says inouye mitchell and johnston 
already have been to see him seeking his vote and all three 
voiced concern about the qualityoflife issue around here 
dixon said the candidates have probably each visited most of the 
other voters too with only 53 men and one woman eligible to vote 
the campaign is personal very personal 
the democrats wont elect their leader until after the november 
elections 
should the democrats keep control theyll be electing not just 
a party leader but the senator who controls the floor deciding 
when or even if to call up bills for senate action 
the role of leader also could be shaped by the presidential 
election if the democrats win both the white house and the senate 
democrats may want a leader who can forcefully move the partys 
agenda through congress if they lose the white house they could 
turn more to someone who can speak eloquently for the loyal 
opposition 
but far more important factors are observations of how able 
the candidate is to work with the process and his colleagues

workers throughout the soviet union participated 
saturday in the 69th annual subbotnik a day of unpaid labor 
donated to the communist state 
in moscow workers bustled about their jobs on a sunny but cold 
spring day 
the official tass news agency said nearly 150 million people 
turned out for the subbotnik that would provide millons of rubles 
for building clinics hospitals schools libraries clubs and 
stadiums the oncologic and cardiologic centers in moscow were 
built with subbotnik funds according to tass 
subbotniks have become a part of soviet life since the first one 
in april 1919 when fifteen workers at a moscow railway depot 
voluntarily repaired a steam locomotive without additional pay a 
few days later after word had spread of the deed many moscow 
workers put in a day at their usual jobs without pay 
vladimir i lenin founder of the soviet state joined in the 
expanded subbotnik in 1919 the annual subbotniks now are held on a 
saturday close to lenins birthdate of april 22 1870 
but subbotniks also can be held to commemorate other dates such 
as the anniversary of the founding of the soviet state in 1917 and 
the defeat of nazi germany in 1945 
there have been complaints about bosses who forced unpaid work 
days on workers 
the literaturnaya gazeta in december said a volgograd woman was 
asked to resign from her job at a wood processing plant after she 
wrote a letter to a newspaper saying subbotniks sometimes were 
imposed rather than being a voluntary contribution to the public 
good 
tass reported also in december that a group of factory 
employees objected to being ordered into the plant on saturdays to 
make up for production problems during the week the report said 
that over a oneyear period workers were told to report for work 
on 20 saturdays

that he concoted quotes for president reagan 
asked about his job during a news conference at the university 
of colorado soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said one difference is i dont put my own words in someone 
elses mouth 
gerasimov who later gave a lecture at the university also 
called the war in afghanistan a bleeding wound and were very 
happy to have this wound heal by withdrawing soviet troops 
on thursday the soviet union the united states pakistan and 
afghanistan signed an agreement calling for soviet troops to begin 
leaving afghanistan on may 15 
gerasimov said soviet intentions to help the revolution in 
afghanistan may have failed because maybe this revolution does 
not have enough local roots to be a real socialist revolution 
maybe they were too early 
speakes in his upcoming book speaking out said he twice 
attributed remarks to reagan that the president never said 
in one instance speakes said he quoted reagan as telling 
gorbachev during their 1985 geneva summit meeting there is much 
that divides us but i believe the world breathes easier because we

gang violence has disrupted the easygoing 
life of this sunny city where gangrelated killings last year 
claimed more than four times the 1987 death toll in northern 
irelands sectarian bloodshed 
i cant even walk to the store at night complains john 
stewart 69 a retired custodian who ives near one of the many 
houses used as drug dens in southcentral los angeles 
its hell around here its crazy said stewart whose 
poodle tiffy was killed by a stray bullet two years ago 
many residents of the nations secondlargest city live in fear 
of gunmen who often are not men at all but rather children with 
guns 
the good old days of tire irons and chains are over laments 
ira reiner district attorney for los angeles county 
todays young thugs prefer weapons such as uzi submachine guns 
and chinese copies of the soviet ak47 assault rifle 
this isnt west side story reiner said referring to the 
musical about new york city gangs 
west side story featured a love story and fights staged like 
dances a new movie called colors starring robert duvall and 
sean penn has heightened worries about the los angeles violence 
because it depicts on film the real rivalry between the citys 
biggest gangs the bloods and the crips 
minor scuffles at two theaters in the los angeles area marred 
the opening of colors on friday and resulted in 13 arrests but 
predictions that the movie would incite violence failed to 
materialize as police provided heavy security at soldout theaters 
police and community service experts estimate between 70000 to 
80000 young people belong to about 600 gangs across los angeles 
last year 387 people were slain by this citys baby gangsters 
who battle each other over drug profits or kill on a dare or over 
taunts that become battle cries 
during the same period the troubles in northern ireland 
claimed 93 lives 
there have been at least 89 deaths in los angeles county this 
year many of them innocent bystanders 
there are mostly revenge killings unfortunately they arent 
very selective on these revenge killings said police lt fred 
nixon 
the gang killers are children of poverty and come from the 
citys toughest streets in the mostly black neighborhoods south of 
downtown or the largely hispanic districts on the citys east side 
before the 1980s said police cmdr lorne kramer most gangs 
were hispanic their violence was sporadic and related to 
territorial disputes and machismo 
this changed in the 80s with the emergence of black gangs and 
drug profits 
the scene was further transformed by the emergence of rock 
or crack cocaine a crystalline form of the drug that is 
portable and affordable even in the citys poorer neighborhoods 
tension over gang killings has been at an alltime high in 
recent weeks with police chief daryl gates deploying 1000 
officers at a time to intimidate gangs and make mass arrests of 
suspected gangsters 
public awareness rose after violence moved from the inner city 
to upscale neighborhoods a young woman was slain on jan 30 in 
gang crossfire in the fashionable westwood theater district near 
the university of california at los angeles 
that was followed by a good friday gang attack that killed one 
person and wounded a dozen others 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
complains that too many innocent people are being rounded up in the 
sweeps 
arrests for littering blocking sidewalks jaywalking and 
spitting have been common since the sweeps started in march said 
raymond johnson branch president for the naacp 
american civil liberties union attorney carol sobel also said 
we are troubled and that the organization is examining possible 
legal action 
on a recent weekend stewarts neighborhood resembled a combat 
zone when police raided a cocaine den and were greeted by shotgun 
blasts 
afterward police units that surrounded the house roared off on 
another call sirens blaring in the night while a police 
helicopter thundered overhead 
its like this every weekend now stewart said 
los angeles is not the only city in the nation where dangerous 
gangs are active police in jackson miss were seeking several 
gang members in connection with a shootout that injured at least 
five youths in a crowd of about 200 students apparently celebrating 
senior skip day friday 
officer ronnie thrash said the shooting at old trace park in 
madison county apparently involved two rival gangs 
and in trenton nj police say they are increasing their 
presence in a tough crimeridden neighborhood blocks from the 
statehouse while they investigate gangrelated shootings and an 
allegedly drugrelated death early last week 
its going to be a long hot summer said city police sgt

a venezuelan marine sergeant was 
killed and two other soldiers were wounded when colombian 
guerrillas fired on their barge on on the arauca river the defense 
ministry said saturday 
colombians fired on another venezuelan vessel in the same area 
two hours later but there were no casualties the ministry said in 
a statement 
the death is the first this year of a venezuelan soldier in a 
border clash with colombians 
the fatal attack occurred when the dredging barge was clearing a 
section of the river about 360 miles southwest of caracas the 
river forms part of the border between the two countries 
a group of presumed colombian common criminals in a canoe 
opened fire suddenly upon the dredge mortally wounding sgt luis 
malave cordoba and inflicting minor wounds on two other marine 
infantrymen the ministry said 
the ministry did not say if the venezuelans returned fire or if 
there were colombian casualties 
gen humberto camejo arias said military reinforcements have 
been sent to the area to search for foreign subversives and 
probable accomplices 
venezuela increased its military presence on the border in 
january because of an increase in kidnappings of venezuelans by 
colombians and the use of venezuelan territory by colombian cocaine 
gangs 
in january venezuelan soldiers killed five colombians in an 
exchange of fire across the arauca river 
the two nations agreed to coordinate efforts to cut down on 
border activity by colombian criminals

fortyfive years after us fighter 
pilots killed the mastermind of the japanese attack on pearl 
harbor american survivors of the mission dispute who actually shot 
down admiral isoroku yamamoto 
yamamoto was killed april 18 1943 when american fighter planes 
intercepted his bomber near the solomon islands capt thomas g 
lanphier jr of detroit who died last year was credited by the 
military with the kill 
but the eight survivors among the 16 americans who carried out 
the mission said at a reunion saturday that they could not 
corroborate the official account because they had not been 
debriefed immediately after the attack 
they said they also could not determine how many japanese zero 
fighters accompanying yamamotos bomber were shot down 
at this time its a toss up on who shot down the betty 
bomber carrying admiral yamamoto which one was he in we didnt 
know at that point said ret lt col besby frank holmes of san 
francisco the passage of years hasnt clarified the subject 
these accounts add great confusion to the subject 
i wish there would have been a debriefing years ago he 
added 
holmes and the seven other survivors spoke at a symposium along 
with one of the japanese zero pilots 
the gathering was held here because fredericksburg is the home 
of admiral chester nimitz nimitz and his superiors approved the 
mission after the americans broke japans code and learned that 
yamamoto was going to be in the solomon islands 
yamamoto planned the japanese raid on pearl harbor on dec 7 
1941 that triggered the united states entry into world war ii 
capt roger pineau a retired naval intelligence officer said 
yamamotos death gave the american war effort a major boost 
in addition to the strategic and tactical effects of the shoot 
down of yamamoto it was a fantastic morale blow to the japanese 
people pineau said there was mourning in japan after the 
announcement of his death like is seldom seen except for emperors 
he was highly thought of 
the americans attacked two japanese bombers one carrying 
yamamoto and the other his chief of staff vice admiral matome 
ugaki the bombers were escorted by six zeros 
holmes said he shot down the bomber carrying ugaki and ret 
col rex barber of culver ore claimed on saturday he shot down 
yamamotos plane 
holmes said fights broke out after other pilots challenged their 
account of the number of zeros shot down 
kenji yanagiya the lone zero pilot at saturdays gathering 
added to the controversy when he said through an interpreter that 
all six zeros made it back to base safely that brought jeers from 
a crowd of about 400 
of the 16 americans on the mission one was listed as missing in 
action two died during later combat and five have died since the 
war 
items once belonging to yamamoto were unveiled in a new exhibit 
saturday at the nimitz museum here including swords yamamoto gave 
to his men with the inscription the fate of japans future 
depends on the outcome of this war 
the items were loaned by kansas city mo resident bernard 
brannon whose brother attorney john brannon acquired them after 
world war ii 
john brannon who died last year defended japanese naval 
officers charged with war crimes in return for his services the 
japanese officers gave him some of yamamotos personal items said 
bruce smith superintendent of the admiral nimitz state historical 
park

the sheriff of louisianas secondlargest 
parish told by a federal judge he may no longer withhold news 
exclusively from new orleans daily newspaper extended his news 
blackout saturday to all media 
sheriff harry lee said in a statement that none of his jefferson 
parish employees will talk with any reporter except in an 
emergency until his lawyers examine the injunction issued friday 
by us district judge robert collins 
until this problem has been resolved the sheriffs office 
shall communicate with the press in the form of written press 
releases lee said 
collins ruled that the sheriff cannot adopt a policy of treating 
the newspapers reporters any differently than those from other 
news organizations the injunction was obtained by the 
timespicayune which has been the target of a news embargo by lee 
since january when the newspaper refused to change a story the 
sheriff objected to 
in testimony friday lee also complained the newspaper 
louisianas largest daily with a weekday circulation of about 
280000 published inaccurate stories about him and his department 
because of lees news blackout timespicayune reporters 
sometimes were physically barred from news conferencesthe

happened in a parish with a population of nearly half a million 
equal almost to that of new orleans

jesse jacksons supporters failed to take 
control of the south carolina democratic party on saturday but did 
pick up nearly twothirds of its delegates to the national 
convention 
the jackson forces lost in their attempt to block the election 
of frank holleman as state party chairman and lost in races for 
several other leadership posts 
the feuding leading up to the state convention had become 
heated but kevin gray state campaign coordinator for jackson 
said the party was not damaged 
no ones walking out of this convention mad he said 
jacksons support slipped somewhat since the march 12 precinct 
caucuses when his 54 percent showing appeared to be strong enough 
to win him as many as 33 national convention delegates when the 
final step in the process was completed saturday at the state 
convention jackson had won 28 delegates 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis whose 7 percent finish in 
the precinct caucuses was too weak to claim any national convention 
delegates won seven delegates chosen saturday 
tennessee sen albert gore jr whose 18 percent support in the

fbi agents investigating a possible link 
between the arrest of a japanese man carrying pipe bombs on the new 
jersey turnpike and the fatal bombing of a uso club in naples went 
to italy on saturday officials said 
forensics experts and other fbi agents traveled to italy at the 
request of italian authorities who believe the bombing there was 
carried out by members of japans terrorist red army said fbi 
agent jeff maynard in washington 
yu kikumura identified by the japanese foreign ministry as a 
suspected red army member was arrested tuesday at a new jersey 
turnpike service area in ridgefield after a state trooper found 
three sophisticated homemade bombs and falsified papers in his 
possession authorities said 
on thursday a bomb planted in a car and parked at the uso club 
in naples exploded killing five people including an american 
servicewoman 
fbi bomb experts were attempting to learn if the explosive used 
in the naples bombing was the same as that found in new jersey 
authorities said 
there is a lot of interest in this maynard said it would 
be common sense for us to look into it to see if there is any 
connection 
kikumura 35 was ordered held without bail friday by a us 
magistrate in newark 
he was charged with using a fraudulent visa to enter the 
country and possession of firearms a preliminary hearing was set 
for april 25 
authorities with the fbi and us attorneys office have refused 
to discuss any information they may have about where kikumura was 
headed at the time of his arrest 
they also declined to comment on a report in saturdays editions 
of the new york times that suggested kikumura might have been 
headed for a meeting of finance ministers of the worlds seven 
major industrial democracies in washington the ministers 
sometimes referred to as the group of seven ended their meeting 
wednesday 
there are all sorts of press reports and were not going to 
comment on any of them said jim knights an fbi spokesman in 
newark 
the red army claimed responsibility for bomb and rocket attacks 
last june 9 on the us and british embassies in rome while while 
the leaders of seven western nations were holding their annual 
summit in venice 
the groups attacks also include a massacre at tel avivs lod 
airport in israel in 1972 that left 28 people dead 
meanwhile saturday attorneys william kunstler and ronald kuby 
who frequently have taken up the cause of radicals said they were 
denied permission to meet with kikumura after he had requested to 
talk with them 
they said officials at the jail in new york city where kikumura 
was being held told them they had orders not to allow anyone to 
meet with him 
its a flagrant constitutional violation kuby said for 
two days kikumuras been smeared all over the newspapers as an 
international terrorist and now hes not allowed to see an 
attorney 
lt marcus fernandez an official with the justice departments 
bureau of prisons at the jail directed all inquiries to the 
assistant warden on monday 
officials said kikumura used a passport stolen from a japanese 
hospital worker to obtain a us entry visa from the us embassy 
in paris on feb 29 he entered the country on march 8 authorities 
said 
an fbi explosives expert has described the bombs found in 
kikumuras car as antipersonnel devices twothirds of the 18inch 
containers were packed with gunpowder and the rest with steel 
pellets 
in italy meanwhile the chief investigator of the bombing said 
the terrorist suspected of parking the car outside the uso club was 
aided by a japanese woman and a man from the middle east or north 
africa 
romano argenio head of the naples antiterrorist police said 
investigators had identified two of the three as known members of 
the red army

windows blocked streets with flaming barricades and clashed with 
riot police saturday in a violent demonstration demanding the 
ouster of gen manuel antonio noreiga 
police fired tear gas and birdshot as about 400 demonstrators 
most of them members of a womens group rallied on the north side 
of the capital there were no reports of injuries or arrests 
about 300 women joined later by about 100 residents of the 
batania section of the city set up blazing barricades of trash and 
tires across some streets and hurled rocks at police 
some windows in homes and shops were shattered by stones 
the women members of a union of civic women marched in the 
streets following a mass at the roman catholic church of perpetuo 
socorro in batania they said they prayed to god to bring 
conscience to the panamanian military to force noriega to resign 
at least 10 small police trucks waited outside the church before 
the protest began the rev manuel villarreal nunez who presided 
over the mass said police approached him during the protest 
i said what a large number they had used to repress a group of 
women he said it was an exaggeration 
they said shut up get out of here and one gave me a 
violent push on the chest 
carmen cecilia capriles a leader of the protest said the 
demonstrators wanted noriega to resign because he has the country 
in bankruptcy because of his evil corruption 
she said the united states did nothing as long noriega was under 
its control but this monster has gotten away from them 
for 20 years we have been shouting not to arm this nation and 
they the unitd states have been arming it she said 
meanwhile government spokesman jose hernandez said paychecks 
due friday to employees of the cashshort government were delayed 
but would be distributed on monday 
he said the delay was one of the governments ways of dealing 
with the situation of economic asphyxiation in the country 
noriega chief of panamas defense forces and the countrys 
strongman is under indictment by a grand jury in federal courts in 
florida on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering 
the reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on 
panama including freezing panamanian assets in the united states 
in an effort to oust noriega the measures have caused an acute 
cash shortage in panama that has helped spur antinoriega protests 
after the mass the women rallied outside the church waving 
white handkerchiefs as a sign of protest they marched carrying 
rosaries and chanting justice justice and we want 
hospitals we want medicines 
the economic crisis has forced many hospitals to close or 
restrict services and reduce staff doctors and pharmacists say 
there is an acute shortage of medicines 
riot squads in trucks used water cannons that sprayed a mixture 
of tear gas and water at the demonstrators 
the women scattered but gathered again in small groups and 
began pelting police squads and the cannontrucks with rocks and 
trash police retaliated by firing tear gas and birdshot into the 
air 
there have been few antigovernment demonstrations here in

a soviet plane fueled by liquid hydrogen has 
completed a test flight in a major development in aviation the 
official tass news agency reported saturday 
a new page has thus been turned in the history of the aircraft 
industry in the ussr and the whole world tass said 
it reported a tupolev154 aircraft with jet engines modified to 
burn liquid hydrogen had flown sucessfully friday but did not say 
where the flight occurred 
the evening television news program vremya showed a videotape of 
the flight that it said was conducted at an airport outside moscow 
but did not identify the airfield 
tass said the converted tu154 renamed tu155 is a significant 
advance in aviation because it will not pollute the atmosphere like 
conventional jet aircraft with engines that burn oilbased fuels 
and produce hydrocarbon pollutants 
vremya showed the aircrafts takeoff and landing and a segment 
of what it said was the 21minute flight the tape showed the 
refitted jet accompanied by a conventional tu154 and in the 
footage the conventional planes exhaust was black smoke while 
vremya said the tu155 emitted harmless steam 
in an interview with vremya vk orlov the chief engine 
designer of the tu155 said the engines combined aviation and 
rocket technology he said the liquid hydrogen was stored in tanks 
aboard the plane at subfreezing temperatures 
most us and soviet space rocket boosters burn liquid hydrogen 
and liquid oxygen 
neither tass nor vremya said how the engines operated gave any 
cost estimates or said if they would be installed on commercial 
jetliners 
tass said special fire and explosion safety devices had to be 
designed for the plane and ground support equipment

after four years of bitter conflict with frank 
lorenzo and his airline empire aviation labor is getting the 
sweeping government investigation it wanted 
but transportation department officials reject suggestions by 
lorenzo and his texas air corp that the probe announced wednesday 
is unioninspired 
officials say instead a series of financial red flags and 
texas airs own request for approval to spin off eastern airlines 
lucrative northeast shuttle put senior department analysts on the 
alert 
with that backdrop the deciding factor that triggered the 
unprecedented investigation say department officials was word 
from the federal aviation administration of continuing safety 
violations at eastern airlines 
other carriers have been in precarious financial positions in 
the past and others have had safety violations in the past but 
were not aware of a carrier having both come together this way at 
the same time said matthew scocozza whose dot office monitors 
the major airlines 
the broad investigation of texas air and its two subsidiary 
airlines eastern and continental stunned executives at the 
houstonbased airline company texas air stock dropped 150 per 
share to 1025 in two days and executives at both eastern and 
continental worried what impact the publicity would have on 
customers 
but the turmoil surrounding texas air has been years in the 
making 
lorenzo gained the wrath of organized aviation labor in 1983 
when he shut down continental airlines threw out its labor 
contracts and within days started a new airline with employees 
earning 50 percent less since texas air purchased eastern airlines 
in 1986 there have been continuous and rancorous confrontations 
over management demands for deep labor concessions 
lorenzo blames his troubles with labor for the government probe 
there is no question that this issue is founded in an 
oldfashioned labor dispute said a corporate statement the 
union leaderships have mounted a continuing campaign of 
distortion and lies it is unfortunate that this campaign has 
swayed others into action 
eastern airlines put advertisements into major newspapers the 
day after the investigation was announced saying it welcomed the 
probe and hoped it would clear the air about the unions charges 
and show unfair treatment of eastern by the faa 
on sunday texas air put a fullpage advertisement in several 
major newspapers that featured an editorial from fridays new york 
times the editorial concluded texas air has offended organized 
labor the industry establishment and a lot of important people in 
washington the airline has also irritated a lot of travelers 
it would be a pity though if these complaints distracted 
attention from texas airs constructive role in forcing a 
selfsatisfied cartelminded industry to come to terms with 
competition 
ironically the order to investigate texas air came from a 
transportation department that over the years has been considered 
anything but friendly to labor in nearly two dozen airline 
mergers the department not once has approved formal 
laborprotection provisions sought by the unions 
while the department denies being forced into action by labor 
there is little doubt that the unions wellfinanced and determined 
campaign drew the governments attention 
the faas intense look at eastern airlines last year for 
example was in part prompted by union reports of alleged 
maintenance and safety violations including charges repeated at 
congressional hearings that management was trying to force crews to 
fly unsafe aircraft 
pilots began sending postcards to aviation committees in 
congress the faa and its parent dot whenever there were 
maintenance problems with eastern planes 
labor challenges in court to the transfer of the northeast 
shuttle from eastern into a separate texas air subsidiary also 
caused dot officials concern after a federal judge came down on the 
side of the unions 
when the judge stopped the transfer and found texas air in 
contempt of court for violating an earlier court injunction the 
department began to question the airlines attitude about complying 
with government requirements said wayne vance the dots general 
counsel 
we had been aware of what was going on within the world of 
texas air corp said vance but he added that with the court 
decision on the shuttle concern grew and grew 
an internal department alert memo was prepared noting texas 
airs record losses of 466 million in 1987 and its debts of more 
than 5 billion requiring 600 million in interest payments 
new filings meanwhile by texas air with the securities and 
exchange commission raised additional red flags vance and 
scocozza noted the sec filings provided more details on a series 
of bothersome transactions between texas air and eastern that 
suggested assets were being drained from eastern 
texas air had moved easterns valuable computer reservation 
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note likely 
worth less than the systems fair market value texas air charged 
substantial fees for various services to eastern and the 
parent company never paid eastern 16 million it promised as a 
reimbursement from costs incurred during its 1986 acquisition of 
the airline 
amid this backdrop came word from the faa that a year after 
eastern agreed to pay 95 million in fines for safety violations 
many of the same violations seemed to persist eastern faces an 
additional possible fine of 823000 and a new round of special 
inspections 
that say scocozza and vance sealed the case for a broader 
inquiry into the lorenzo aviation empire 
the ball is now in the governments court said jack bavis 
head of the pilots union at eastern we know what the problems 
are what remains to be seen is how well the dot and faa follow 
through on their announcements

despite congressional pressure the army said 
friday it wont provide the land or help build a large church for 
the exclusive use of mormon employees at a utah military 
installation 
the army is opposed in principle to the construction and 
exclusive use of a private house of worship by any religious 
organization on a military installation assistant army secretary 
delbert l spurlock wrote in a letter to congressional committees 
some 700 mormon workers at the isolated dugway proving ground 
are asking for their own religious facility claiming the building 
now shared by all the installations religious demominations is too 
small 
sen jake garn rutah has argued that better space is needed 
because so many members of the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints work at the isolated base 
but spurlock said in his letter no statutory authority exists 
which would permit this at dugway and if such authority were 
proposed by congress it would likely violate constitutional 
provisions against the government establishment of religion 
moreover while the army building now being used by mormon 
employees at dugway as their church is substandard that 
building by itself is more than twice the religious education 
facility size authorized for the entire dugway population the 
service said 
if the army obtains money to build new religious facilities at 
dugway those buildings would have to be shared by all 
denominations and will certainly be smaller than the buildings now 
used the army said 
spurlocks comments were contained in a cover letter that 
accompanied a special report to the house and senate appropriations 
committees on friday the report was requested by congress in 
december at the urging of garn who is a mormon 
the mormons at the base are currently allowed exclusive use of a 
warehouse they have renovated as a chapel but would like to build 
a larger modern facility at the base 
dugway is a research and test site for chemical weapons located 
about 90 miles west of salt lake city and about 40 miles from the 
nearest town there are about 700 mormons at dugway which employs 
roughly 1700 people most of the workers are civilians 
the mormon workers turned to garn for help after the army 
rejected the churchs request for a longterm lease on 25 acres of 
land to construct a building garn has said through a spokeswoman 
that if the army doesnt come up with an acceptable plan to provide 
adequate space he will ask congress to order the army to issue a 
lease 
laurie snow the senators spokeswoman declined comment friday 
saying garn had not yet seen the report 
the report however hardly appears likely to satisfy the mormon 
workers 
given the current austere budget conditions it says it 
is not anticipated any money could be requested from congress 
during the next five years to upgrade the existing facilities at 
dugway 
there are at least 55 critical army religious projects with 
a higher priority the report states 
and the army is opposed on principle to construction of a 
private house of worship by any religious organization on any 
military installation the service concluded 
to allow such construction favors religious groups with the 
financial resources to build it also places religious groups that 
are without those resources at a disadvantage

robert chambers apologized for the first time 
friday for the preppie murder case death of 18yearold 
jennifer levin as he was formally sentenced to five to 15 years in 
jail for manslaughter 
the levin family have gone through hell because of my actions 
and im sorry chambers said whoever said time heals all 
wounds is definitely wrong because how can these wounds heal 
despite his statement of remorse the 21yearold chambers 
repeatedly shook his head as if to say no to his plea and 
sentencing and miss levins uncle said afterward the apology 
carried little weight 
chambers stood silently while state supreme court justice howard 
e bell handed down the sentence which was agreed to by lawyers 
for both sides when chambers entered the guilty plea to a reduced 
charge of manslaughter march 25 
the plea came after the jurors in the highly publicized case 
reported they were deadlocked on the murder charge in their ninth 
day of deliberations chambers began his sentence the day after the 
plea was entered 
miss levins partially nude body was found in central park early 
in the morning of aug 26 1986 a few hours after they had left a 
fashionable east side bar together 
chambers had claimed that the death occurred by accident when 
miss levin hurt him during rough sex by pleading guilty to 
manslaughter chambers admitted he intended to hurt miss levin 
miss levins father steven who had also asked to address the 
court was not allowed to but he later released a statement 
saying that chambers outrageous lie had defamed the memory 
of our lovely child 
chambers sighed deeply before starting his remarks he 
apologized to his family and friends as well as miss levins and 
thanked more than 150 supporters for letters he said he has 
received since being jailed on his guilty plea 
jennifers looking down on us now at this circus arena 
looking and wondering why it all happened and i dont know 
chambers said i never wished any of this to happen i wish 
to apologize to the family and to her friends for all the trouble 
they have gone through 
miss levins father his wife and his exwife left their 
courtroom seats and exited without comment on the sentence or the 
chambers apology they had approved the plea bargain deal prior to 
chambers march 25 guilty plea 
but miss levins uncle did comment saying chambers apology 
in no way cancels out what he did which was to murder my niece 
in cold blood to me it was just something he rehearsed by rote 
and spit out to get away with the least possible sentence 
in a 2page letter he had initially wanted to read in court 
miss levins father wrote the outrageous lie conceived by 
jennifers killer to rid himself of all responsibility was used by 
his attorney to defame the memory of our lovely child never left 
to mourn our daughters death in privacy our lives became the 
media event of the year 
the plea bargain also took care of three burglary charges 
against chambers who received a concurrent fiveto15year 
sentence for a burglary count on friday 
also in the courtroom for the sentencing were several chambers 
trial jurors whose deliberations ended with chambers guilty plea 
i feel sorry for robert chambers in that he cannot come to 
grips with what he did said juror cole wallace 31 after the 
sentencing personally i thought it his statement was somewhat 
selfserving

coast have submitted documentary evidence proving that they 
belonged to a volunteer anticommunist militia formed by 
italian occupation authorities to fight partisans during the war 
the nin weekly said 
media reports said the citizens of ljubusko got the idea after 
several thousand yugoslavs from the northern region of istria 
recently received back payments from italy for wartime service 
the istria residents were forcibly mobilized by the italian army 
during the war 
in a critical commentary titled i request to be declared an 
enemy the borba daily said the fascist italian militia committed 
atrocities and terrorized the local population during world war ii 
nazi germany and italy invaded yugoslavia in 1941 and fought 
yugoslav partisan troops until 1945 when they were driven from the 
country 
but thousands of yugoslavs joined the occupation forces and 
fought the partisans 
the ljubusko citizens submitted their request for italian 
pensions to yugoslav authorities said the nin newspaper it said 
local authorities told the applicants to address their requests 
directly to italy 
but the press said there was little chance for the claimants to 
get italian war pensions even if it is proved they joined the 
italian occupation troops because they belonged to a volunteer 
body of antipartisan fighters and not to a regular army unit 
the italian embassy in belgrade said only italian pension 
officials could decide on the claims

the supreme court has severely trimmed a 
list of questions us prosecutors want answered by a general who 
led the chilean investigation into dissident orlando leteliers 
1976 assassination in washington 
in its ruling the court said gen hector orozco could not be 
questioned about any official activities related to his role as 
military prosecutor in chiles probe of the killing 
it said permitting such questions would violate national 
sovereignty and the justice system and orozco could only be 
questioned on matters not directly related to his official actions 
the court threw out all but 12 of the 33 groups of questions 
included in a 25page document prepared by washington prosecutors 
and presented to chilean authorities in january 
it made the ruling thursday and the decision was reported friday 
letelier and an american aide ronnie moffitt were killed when 
a remotecontrolled bomb exploded in their car on sept 21 1976 
as it traveled on washingtons embassy row 
letelier a former ambassador and cabinet minister in the 
government of the late president salvador allende was a critic of 
the rightwing military government of president augusto pinochet 
gen pinochet commander of the army led the coup in september 
1973 that ousted allende a marxist 
a washington court in 1978 indicted three chilean army officers 
all secret police agents in connection with the letelier killing 
the chilean supreme court rejected an extradition request but in 
early 1987 one of the officers maj armando fernandez larios 
surrendered in washington and confessed to an accomplices role 
last year washington again called on chile to hand over the 
other two officers former secret police chief gen manuel 
contreras and his aide col pedro espinoza 
on the basis of fernandez larios confession us prosecutors 
decided to seek to question orozco fernandez larios said orozco 
ordered him to lie to the supreme court and deny any role in the 
assassination in its new ruling the court tossed out all 
questions about the alleged order 
the court also struck several questions related to an alleged 
conversation between orozco and contreras in which contreras was 
said to have acknowledged ordering espinoza to arrange the killing 
contreras also allegedly said he himself was acting on orders 
and when asked by orozco from whom replied ask the chief 
fernandez larios who said he heard about the conversation from a 
third party to it told us authorities he believed the chief 
meant pinochet who was contreras immediate superior

hospitalized for excessive drinking at two of the ivy league 
schools eating clubs 
joining the university in its efforts are the medical center at 
princeton the mercer council on alcoholism and the state division

superior court 
princeton borough police are seeking access to records of 39 
students treated at the university infirmary and six students 
treated at the medical center after parties at the charter club and 
cloister inn on feb 6 
the eating clubs are private clubs similar to fraternities

former officers at the two clubs with maintaining a nuisance which 
carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a 1000 fine 
police capt thomas michaud said the medical records will help 
in the prosecution of the defendants but are not vital to the case 
superior court judge neil shuster granted police access to the 
medical records march 23 but the university won a suspension of 
the court order until next weeks hearing 
the university and medical center argued in court papers that 
releasing the information breaches the students privilege of 
doctorpatient confidentiality 
alexander p waugh jr an attorney for the medical center and 
the university said friday that release of the records would 
discourage students from seeking treatment for drug and alcohol 
problems

the government on friday 
warned two antiapartheid newspapers and a magazine that they would 
be shut down if they continue to print material it consideres 
subversive 
home affairs minister stoffel botha who has stateofemergency 
powers to close publications considered subversive issued the 
threats in a government gazette published friday 
receiving the warnings were grassroots and saamstaan two 
community newspapers and out of step a magazine published every 
two months by the end conscription campaign that opposes the 
mandatory military service for white males 
botha said the publications were a threat to public safety 
he recently closed one blackoriented weekly newspaper the new 
nation for 12 weeks and has told several other antiapartheid 
publications they face similar action 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
alistair teelingsmith national secretary of the end 
conscription campaign said shutting down his magazine would be 
pointless 
even if the publications are silenced the issue of 
conscription and its problems remains he said a more 
satisfactory way of addressing these problems would be to provide a 
reasonable system of alternative service 
white south african males must serve two years of military 
service initially and then are liable for annual training camps 
the antidraft group says it particularly opposes the deployment 
of conscripts in black townships and in wars in southwest africa 
also known as namibia and in neighboring angola

dozens of offers to adopt clark the 
wander dog have been made since the story of the mutt who hangs out 
at a nowvacant transportation complex was circulated but clark is 
staying put 
attempts by leora reed to coax clark from the complex to a new 
life with a new owner have been fruitless 
clark has been roaming the former horizon transportation 
services corp site and the adjacent former clark equipment co 
property workers at both companies provided a dog house and food 
until clark equipment closed last fall followed by horizons 
demise in march 
when horizons last employee barbara renbarger left last 
month clark was alone except for reed his new friend she noticed 
the dog several weeks ago and began trying to find him a home 
i have a great love for dogs and i just sort of felt sorry for 
the little guy she said i fell in love with him 
clark has returned the friendship through approving wags of the 
tail when reed brings food to him but he has frustrated her 
attempts to capture him or coax him off the properties she even 
hired a veterinarian to use a dart to tranquilize clark but two 
attempts have failed clark was scared and maintained his practice 
of keeping his distance from all humans 
more than 25 people wanted to adopt the dog including one woman 
in louisville ky who offered to fly clark to her home 
the publicity that brought the adoption offers has also brought 
clark a local windfall of edible contributions 
some have brought prime rib bones or hamburger or chicken 
reed said he has at least a 10course meal every day 
reed said she has given up trying to get clark to leave 
horizons new owners who have asked that the name of the company 
be kept secret for now have told her clark can stay and she can 
visit him anytime 
i have learned that possibly my way is not the best way 
reed said even though he is living in the wild he is capable of 
taking care of himself i hate to take his freedom away 
clark will still have his dog house and can wander the property

twenty years later the columbia university 
student uprising is remembered less for issues than images 
the statue of alma mater with a raped sign around her neck 
a student sitting at the presidents desk puffing one of the 
presidents cigars 
police vans rolling across college walk 
for a time it seemed revolution had come to the ivy league the 
dean was held hostage a professor lost a decades research when a 
protester torched his files two students were married in an 
occupied building by a minister who crawled through the window 
about 1000 people mostly students barricaded themselves 
inside five campus buildings for a week closing the college and 
drawing international attention to their opposition to racism the 
vietnam war and the status quo in general 
columbia was just one stop on the bumpy road from berkeley to 
kent state but a memorable one the atmosphere was like the 
french revolution said fred friendly a journalism professor and 
former cbs news producer you expected to see robespierre on the 
next block 
today mark rudd chairman of students for a democratic society 
at columbia in 1968 still refers to university officials as war 
criminals and paul vilardi who as a student led opposition to 
the revolt characterizes the protesters as nobodies loners and 
oddballs 
the rebellion began almost by accident 500 students led by the 
sds and the student afroamerican society tried to invade the 
administration building april 23 but found the doors locked 
someone in the crowd urged a march to the site of a gymnasium 
the school had started to build in morningside park a buffer 
between elite white columbia and impoverished black harlem 
for months three issues had festered the gym which became a 
symbol of columbias neighborhood expansion columbias links to 
the institute for defense analyses which commissioned military 
research and school disciplinary action against sds leaders for 
previous demonstrations 
at the gym site the students tore down a construction fence and 
fought with police then they marched back to campus into hamilton 
hall and up to the door of acting dean henry coleman 
when coleman refused to discuss the students demands under 
those circumstances the students told him he could not leave 
later that night sds left the building to the black students and 
went off to seize low library the domed administration building 
whose steps provided a stage for the ensuing drama 
coleman was released after about 24 hours but other groups of 
students seized three more buildings faculty members ringed the 
buildings to prevent violence and tried to negotiate a settlement 
the rebellion quickly became a happening with extensive news 
coverage and appearances by tom hayden abbie hoffman rap brown 
stokely carmichael william kunstler herbert marcuse allen 
ginsberg and the grateful dead 
columbia president grayson kirk called in the police april 30 
they cleared the buildings and made 692 arrests about 75 percent 
of them columbia students or teachers hospitals treated 103 
patients 85 of them students or teachers 
a student strike ensued and a month later students again 
occupied hamilton hall to protest the discipline of protest 
leaders again the police moved in this time with fewer arrests 
68 and more injuries 177 
today those who fought the battle of columbia reminisce like 
the veterans of any war 
we feel good about what we did and under the same 
circumstances wed do it again said andrea egan 44 who was 
married in occupied fayerweather hall some people talk about the 
strike now as if it was a panty raid but its important for those 
of us who were there to say it had great significance 
working from an old arrest list ms egan has organized a 
protest reunion on campus april 2223 
my guess is that nine out of 10 still put their principles 
into practice in some way she said not many of us can afford 
to be fulltime activists but you see the strikers convictions in 
the type of law or medicine they practice the films they make or 
the way we raise our children 
few if any have run for political office most of us could 
not stand the scrutiny candidates get ms egan said not only 
the strike but sex and drugs and rock n roll we couldnt do a 
us circuit judge douglas h ginsburg and say i only did it 
twice 
after the rebellion the veterans scattered cicero wilson a 
black student leader wound up at the conservative american 
enterprise institute ted gold a member of the radical weather 
underground was killed when a homemade bomb exploded in a 
greenwich village townhouse david gilbert is serving a 75year 
prison sentence for his role in a 1981 armored car robbery 
rudd the most celebrated protest leader resurfaced from the 
underground in 1977 and now lives in albuquerque nm where he is 
writing his autobiography and working against us involvement in 
central america 
today he claims victory what we did wasnt futile we won 
we stopped the war 
to vilardi leader of the antiprotest majority coalition that 
is nonsense i dont really see where anything happened as a 
result of the rebellion said vilardi a surgeon in huntsville 
texas youd have to be incredibly naive to think that the people 
who made the decisions in washington cared what a bunch of jerks 
were doing up in new york 
orest ranum the professor whose papers were burned moved to 
johns hopkins university in 1969 he says hes glad he spoke 
against the occupation i got out of the library and took a step 
further into the types of human experiences that change the world 
coleman now an educational consultant says he later wrote law 
school recommendations for some of the students who held him 
captive bill sales one of the black students who took over 
hamilton hall is back on campus finishing a stint as a revson 
fellow 
columbia has changed a whole lot and not for the better 
said sales who lives in harlem theres less sense of social 
responsibility among students and faculty and more separation of 
town and gown 
the university eventually dropped its criminal case against most 
students school disciplinary measures bogged down for months in 
the triallike proceedings established after the uprising 
a few students were suspended permanent censure was stamped 
on some transcripts fellowships were lost law school admissions 
denied 
columbia severed its link with the institute for defense 
analyses although some professors continue to do classified 
military research the university regularly incurs the wrath of 
some neighbors in its role as a large institutional lanlord and 
developer

james e olsons sudden absence from the helm of 
american telephone amp telegraph co due to cancer has raised 
unsettling questions about how companies prepare for abrupt 
management changes and tragedies at the top 
to a lesser extent the episode also has underlined the 
responsibility a public corporation faces not only to employees 
but shareholders in disclosing that a boss is ill or incapacitated 
such information can affect stock values 
responding to press queries about olsons rumored ill health 
atampt said last monday that the 62yearold chairman and chief 
executive officer was recuperating at home after colon cancer 
surgery march 25 the telecommunication giants stock fell 25 cents 
a share to 2787 in heavy trading 
company officials said they had not promptly disclosed olsons 
disease because it wasnt clear at the time that he faced a 
longterm incapacity 
moreover they said the delegation of authority in olsons 
absence was clearly understood because he had created a fivemember 
office of the chairman robert allen president and chief operating 
officer is running atampt for now and there is no question that 
olsons outline for its future remains unchanged 
despite the outwardly smooth transition in atampts case such 
crises almost always have an impact on companies especially those 
that arent prepared for them management experts say 
there isnt much catastrophe preparation of that sort its 
not seen as that consequential especially in larger companies 
where there is an obvious chain of command like the government 
said leonard sayles a professor of management at columbia business 
school 
the more serious problem that should be taken into account is 
how do you reassure people particularly at more senior levels 
that if there is a true disaster there are continuities sayles 
said they need assurances that a successor has the same values 
as a former ceo 
some say the management style of an incapacitated boss also 
plays an important role in how a company fares in his or her 
absence the most vulnerable companies are those run by managers 
who dont relinquish authority 
when entertainment conglomerate mca incs autocratic chief 
executive lew wasserman was hospitalized last summer for example 
speculation swirled about his health and the company became a 
takeover target forcing it to take steps to thwart any unwelcome 
suitors 
though wasserman 74 has given no indication he plans to 
retire he has since made clear that his successor would be sidney 
sheinberg president and chief operating officer who has been with 
the company for 14 years 
a serious management crisis befell gulf amp western industries 
inc five years ago when its handson leader charles bluedorn died 
of a heart attack while returning from a business trip nobody was 
prepared to replace him 
that corporation was totally thrown into a barrel of writhing 
question marks said gerald meyers a management consultant and 
former chairman of the defunct american motors corp it took them 
a long time to get sorted out 
meyers who has written a book titled when it hits the fan 
detailing management crises and how to avoid them estimated in a 
telephone interview that only about 150 of the fortune 500 
industrial companies have good contingency plans in the event of a 
chiefs death or incapacity 
its just a part of that overall mentality that we carry 
around with us he said we plan for success we allow no 
negative thoughts to invade our thinking and we get rid of people 
who bring up the possibilities as real as they may be that we 
could face difficulty with that formula its a surefire 
prescription for chaos if you face an event like that and youre 
unprepared 
the impact of tragedy at the top is lessened considerably when 
the burden of management is shared as in atampts case 
another good example was the passage of power at singer co when 
its chairman and chief executive joseph b flavin died suddenly 
last october 
flavin who had helped transform singer from a sewingmachine 
and furniture maker into a leading aerospaceelectronics concern 
was replaced immediately by its president and chief operating 
officer william f schmied 
there was nothing that went on in singer in terms of a 
management process that bill schmied hadnt been involved in 
thats the kind of thing most companies hope for said singer 
spokesman thomas l elliott it was an exceedingly smooth 
transition though it was a shocking event for all of us

halfway between the 1987 crash and the 1988 
election wall street finds itself at an uneasy crossroads 
in the view of many analysts just about all the standard 
signals these days seem to be pointing toward higher interest 
rates tighter credit and a tough setting for a stock market that 
is still feeling aftershocks from the collapse last fall 
the economic news lately has produced a series of 
disappointments only a bear could love 
hopes for continued progress on the nations trade problems were 
dashed on thursday when the commerce department reported that the 
trade deficit unexpectedly widened in february 
investors were especially unhappy to see that while exports 
remained strong imports grew even more rapidly 
then on friday the labor department said the producer price 
index of finished goods rose 06 percent in march for its largest 
increase in 11 months 
all that seemed to give the federal reserve two significant 
reasons to think about new steps toward tightening credit not 
only to support the dollar in foreign exchange but also to keep 
the domestic economy from heating up to an inflationary pitch 
even before the latest economic developments the fed had shown 
signs that it was pulling in the reins a bit in its credit policy 
allen sinai economist at boston co and economic advisors inc 
described this as an apparent strategy of earlier preventitive 
action intended to forestall the need for more drastic measures 
later on 
but sinai added that the fed might have trouble making this 
approach work throughout postwar history he said when the 
economy and inflation have picked up momentum small changes of 
interest rates have not had much effect 
in the crush of adverse news on trade and inflation the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials fell 7626 points to 201393 in 
the past week after touching new postcrash highs on monday and 
tuesday 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 503 to 
14700 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 793 to 37390 and the american stock exchange market value 
index decreased 125 to 29924 
volume on the big board averaged 18357 million shares a day 
against 17089 million the week before 
with alan greenspan a republican at the helm some say the fed 
might be predisposed to keep credit conditions relaxed enough to 
avoid hurting the gops chances in november 
but david levine at wall streets sanford c bernstein amp co 
says the historical record contains nothing to support this case 
detailed analysis of the year preceding the last eight 
presidential elections shows that the fed has not hesitated to push 
interest rates upward provided that the underlying conditions 
warranted such a move he observed 
analysts also point out the fed doesnt operate in a vacuum if 
bond traders think conditions warrant higher interest rates they 
will push rates higher without waiting for any signal from the 
central bank 
even if it were operating on political motives some wall 
streeters believe the fed might be inclined to lean in the 
direction of tighter credit right now 
one risk of an overly stimulative credit policy they say would 
be a new boombust cycle in the stock market making headlines just 
before the election

wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in march 
according to a government report that heightened fears of inflation 
and sent interest rates up to levels not seen in three months 
market reaction to the bad news was restrained friday although 
interest rates climbed back to january levels the dollar held its 
ground with the support of central banks and stock prices were 
mixed 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip stocks dropped 10146 
points on thursday but rose 829 on friday even though stocks in 
the broader market were down by a 9to5 ratio 
the labor department said its producer price index for finished 
goods rose 06 percent last month marking the biggest increase 
since april 1987 and more than erasing a 02 percent decline in 
february 
energy and food prices shot up as did wholesale prices for a 
wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital equipment 
the price report came on the heels of thursdays surprising 
commerce department report that the nations trade deficit expanded 
by 14 billion to 138 billion in february 
the twin reports raised speculation that the federal reserve 
would act to curb inflation fears and support the dollar by 
tightening credit which would raise interest rates 
lawrence hunter an economist for the us chamber of commerce 
expressed fears that the fed will overreact to perceived 
inflationary pressures that some see in the recent data and 
stymie economic growth 
oversteering in the face of monthly price swings can only feed 
fears of inflation hunter said referring to figures that show 
the annual wholesale price increases of just 31 percent when 
averaged over the past three months 
however donald ratajczak a georgia state university economist 
who specializes in wholesale price trends said increases in april 
will match if not exceed those in march 
this isnt a onemonth aberration ratajczak said strong 
increases in raw material prices that have been going on for six 
months are widening and spreading its not runaway inflation but 
its a little worrying 
in another report friday the commerce department said that 
businesses planning to increase their capital spending by 8 percent 
this year after raising it by only 17 percent in 1987 
the commerce report reflected increasing optimism about the 
economy among businessmen who when last surveyed in december said 
they planned to increase their capital spending by 73 percent this 
year 
meanwhile the federal reserve reported that industrial 
production edged up just 01 percent in march analysts said that 
report was the only indication that the economy is not overheating 
following a long string of data suggesting that it is

larry speakes slalomed through 2000 press 
briefings during his sixyear stint as white house spokesman but 
he made a major public relations miscalculation when it came to his 
own foray into selfpromotion 
the presidents former pr man quit his lucrative job as chief 
spokesman for merrill lynch amp co on friday following the 
revelation in his upcoming book speaking out that he 
concocted quotes for president reagan 
fabricating quotes is not an offense of such magnitude to lock 
speakes out of the public relations profession altogether but his 
credibility has been severely damaged and it probably will be 
reflected in his paycheck pr people said 
one new york public relations executive speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said clients would be very reluctant to 
hire speakes because he showed a certain amount of 
insensitivity in confession to the creation of quotes 
if we went out and said we did this or that for a client it 
would make anyone else look at us twice before trusting us with 
confidential information the executive said 
industry insiders said speakes is going to have a hard time 
matching his 200000plus merrill lynch salary 
there arent that many 250000 jobs around in my 
profession said howard j rubenstein president of an 
influential new yorkbased public relations firm that bears his 
name 
but because speakes remains a major name in the business with 
powerful connections he probably wont be standing in 
unemployment lines said pamela talbot manager of the chicago 
office of the public relations firm daniel j edelman inc 
she predicted speakes would find a job but not one with as 
high a profile or at such a high level 
lawrence w fisher president and chief executive of the los 
angeles public relations firm braun amp co agreed that speakes 
will not have any trouble finding a job but maybe not in the 
communications field 
meanwhile industry executives recommend speakes jump on the 
lecture circuit where he can make a fine living just like spiro 
agnew one insider said 
ultimately his peers predicted speakes will be absolved just 
as richard nixon and gary hart regained some public dignity 
quitting merrill lynch will probably hype sales of his book 
and thats fortunate for him because it may be a long time before 
he finds a job as lucrative as the one he gave up said one new 
yorkbased public relations executive speaking on condition of 
anonymity

the phony quotes that larry speakes ascribed to 
president reagan while running the white house press office have 
come back to shatter his 14monthold wall street career as chief 
spokesman for merrill lynch amp co 
the 48yearold senior vice president of communications at the 
investment giant quit friday after creating an uproar by admitting 
in a new book that he twice concocted quotes for reagan 
the confession had raised serious questions about his 
credibility as a communicator for merrill lynch which like other 
wall street firms have become extremely sensitive to their public 
image since the stock crash six months ago 
sources inside merrill lynch who spoke on the condition they 
not be identified said the companys senior management was alarmed 
over the impact of speakes disclosure and relieved when he told 
them he was resigning 
we took the attitude that he being the communicator knew 
very well what this torrent of publicity was doing to him as our 
chief spokesman and the image of merrill lynch as its chief 
spokesman one source said 
speakes said in a brief written statement that his decision was 
the best course of action for merrill lynch and for me 
personally merrill lynch is a great firm and the industry leader 
and ive enjoyed being part of it 
merrill lynch said in the statement we accept larry speakes 
resignation with regret larry has made a significant contribution 
to our firm during his time here and we wish him well in every 
regard 
fred yager a merrill lynch spokesman declined to elaborate on 
speakes resignation saying i think the statement speaks for 
itself im not going to veer from the statement 
speakes was not in merrill lynchs new york headquarters when 
the announcement was made and company officials said they did not 
know his whereabouts 
he joined merrill lynch with much fanfare in february 1987 
earning an annual salary that sources said tripled the 77400 he 
made at the white house he oversaw a staff of about 70 people with 
responsibility over merrill lynchs press relations corporate 
advertising and inhouse communications 
the controversy began monday when speakes disclosed that in his 
upcoming book speaking out he recounted two occasions when he 
attributed to reagan quotes that the president never said 
in restrospect it was clearly wrong to take such liberties 
he wrote in the book but he added i had been able to spruce up 
the presidents image by taking a bit of liberty with my pr mans 
license 
in one instance speakes recalled he quoted reagan as saying 
after soviet gunners shot down a korean air lines passenger jet in 
1983 that the incident didnt pose a sovietus problem but a 
soviet versus the world problem 
speakes said that comment really came from secretary of state 
george shultz speakes said he also credited reagan with some 
suggestions for possible retaliatory measures which also had been 
made by shultz 
in the other instance speakes said he quoted reagan as telling 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during their geneva summit 
there is much that divides us but i believe the world breathes 
easier because we are talking here together 
he said in the book that he and a press aide mark weinberg 
concocted this quotation 
the disclosures created an uproar among the present white house 
press office staff and was criticized by a broad range of 
professionals in the public relations business who said it damaged 
his credibility 
although speakes said he had told reagan about the phony quotes 
reagan denied it wednesday and expressed anger over what he called 
a kiss amp tell piece of fiction reagan said no comment 
friday when asked for a reaction to speakes resignation 
speakes successor marlin fitzwater who had denounced speakes 
earlier in the week for the bogus quotes told reporters friday 
im sorry for him personally fitzwater said he would comment 
no further 
asked for reaction to his resignation some public relations 
executives said he might have trouble finding another prestigious 
pr job 
credibility is requirement number one in this business when 
you have lost your credibility you have lost a hell of a lot 
said lawrence w fisher president and chief executive of braun amp 
co in los angeles

united airlines has begun to put the squeeze on 
frequentflier freebies 
alarmed by the mushrooming popularity of the bonus programs and 
their potential financial impact the chicagobased united 
announced new restrictions friday that could be imitated by other 
major us airlines 
the frequentflier plans reward passengers with free tickets or 
upgrades to first class after they have flown a set number of 
miles uniteds new program sets up a twotier system of travel 
awards 
on the one hand it increases the mileage that must be 
accumulated in order to fly free without restrictions at the same 
time the program creates a new category called saver miles 
allowing travelers to qualify for free flights with fewer miles 
earned than before but with restrictions on the bonus tickets 
the frequentflier programs were getting out of control and 
quite frankly they were heading toward extinction said united 
spokesman dan sheehy we wanted to bring some logic and order to 
the program 
under uniteds current system for example a passenger can get 
a free roundtrip coach ticket to hawaii after flying 35000 miles 
with the carrier with the new plan the mileage requirement rises 
to 60000 for a normal unrestricted ticket to hawaii with 30000 
miles in credits a flier can get a restricted free ticket 
a limited number of the restricted tickets will be available for 
use on each united flight and they cannot be used during holiday 
periods 
on the plus side united is allowing frequent fliers to transfer 
their travel awards to other people while currently they can only 
be given to relatives 
the number of awards available has been reduced from 140 to only 
34 
were giving a little and were taking away a little sheehy 
said the airline a subsidiary of allegis corp has about 45 
million members in its frequent flier program 
many observers had expected united to make even more drastic 
cuts in its program after one of its senior executives said in a 
speech in early march that the airline was considering imposing 
restrictions john zeeman executive vice president for marketing 
and planning had said the options under review included requiring 
that travel awards be redeemed by a certain deadline and even 
eliminating free trips and providing only firstclass upgrades 
instead 
many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their 
bonus programs most notably by limiting the number of free 
tickets for any one flight 
mike ribero vice president of marketing programs for eastern 
airlines said eastern is studying possible changes to its program 
operated jointly with continental airlines like eastern a 
subsidiary of giant texas air corp 
american airlines spokesman al becker said the carrier ranked 
no 2 after united also is studying the issue 
delta air lines the third largest doesnt plan to make any 
changes in its program said spokesman jim lundy 
the us airline industry is facing a staggering revenue loss if 
the estimated 8 million people enrolled in frequentflier programs 
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers the 
accumulated value of those bonuses is around 124 billion 
according to julius maldutis senior airline analyst for investment 
firm salomon brothers inc 
that compares with total industry revenue of around 467 
billion in 1985 505 billion in 1986 and just over 60 billion 
last year
