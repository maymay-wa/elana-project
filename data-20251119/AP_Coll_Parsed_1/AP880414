the national institutes of health may not 
conduct experiments using tissue from aborted fetuses considered 
promising in early work on parkinsons disease under a ruling by 
the reagan administration according to a published report 
this is a very difficult process dr robert e windom 
assistant secretary of health at the department of health and human 
services said thursday about his decision last week 
the washington post reported the decision in fridays editions 
the morality and science are all mixed together windom 
said they need to be evaluated before we rush ahead we just 
cant afford to move too hastily on this 
windoms decision was prompted by an nih proposal to implant 
fetal tissue into patients with parkinsons the newspaper reported 
windom in a letter to nih director james b wyngaarden said he 
was withholding my approval of the proposed experiments due to 
ethical and legal questions that had not been addressed 
satisfactorily he directed wyngaarden to create an outside 
advisory committee to examine such questions the post said 
windom wrote that he does not oppose the use of fetal tissue 
from miscarriages or stillbirths but researchers contacted by the 
post said proper planning is necessary to retrieve the tissue while 
it is useful and that it is rarely possible to use fetuses that 
have been aborted spontaneously 
researchers contacted by the newspaper expressed dismay over the 
decision with dr bernard liebel professor of medicine at the 
university of toronto saying nih sets the pace and this will 
cripple fetal research in the united states it is an 
extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense potential 
depriving research scientists of this material is a great 
disservice to humanity 
but abortion opponents praised the decision 
if the parents were a part to the killing they have no right 
to assign organs to another person said dr john c willke 
president of the national righttolife committee that is 
desecration of a corpse

earl clanton jr went quietly to his death 
in the electric chair thursday night for strangling a neighbor 
during a 1980 robbery 
clanton 33 was pronounced dead at 1107 pm six minutes 
after the first of two oneminute jolts of 2500 volts each was 
administered said state department of corrections spokesman wayne 
farrar 
clanton who had escaped from death row in 1984 had no final 
statement and showed little emotion as he went to his death the 
prison chaplain russ ford turned his back on the electric chair 
as the sentence was carried out 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
earlier in the day had set the stage for the seventh execution in 
virginia since 1982 when it unanimously overturned a stay granted 
tuesday by a federal judge 
later thursday the us supreme court in a 72 vote denied a 
stay and gov gerald l baliles refused clemency an hour before 
clanton went to his death 
clanton was convicted by a petersburg jury in 1981 of murdering 
38yearold wilhemina smith a school librarian who lived in his 
apartment building he was on parole at the time for a 1972 murder 
conviction in new jersey 
the execution was the 98th in the nation since the us supreme 
court in 1976 allowed states to resume use of the death penalty 
besides his mother a sister two aunts and lawyers clantons 
last visitors included jay north the 1960s child tv star of 
dennis the menace north has been working on a movie about the 
1984 escape of clanton and five other virginia death row prisoners 
we became extremely close friends said north weve been 
in contant communication wrote and called we became like 
brothers 
about 50 death penalty opponents conducted a vigil and prayer 
service outside the prison a single supporter of capital 
punishment shouted pray for the woman that died 
the appeal to the us supreme court had centered on abuse 
clanton contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until 
after being sentenced to death 
the appeal cited a psychiatric report saying clanton suppressed 
memories of his violent childhood thus hampering defense efforts 
to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life 
sentence 
however the federal appeals court said that clantons case had 
been given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that 
his sentencing had been found constitutional 
in addition the court said clantons attorney had failed 
during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse 
clanton was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the 
mecklenburg correctional center in 1984 he was recaptured a day 
later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at 
a coin laundry in warrenton nc 
at his 1981 trial clanton refused his lawyers request to 
submit to a psychiatric examination and the only mitigating 
evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that 
he attended bible classes while in jail awaiting trial 
after the trial clanton said he was beaten as a child by his 
father and was sexually abused by his stepmother after leaving his 
father he moved to new jersey to live with his mother and was 
convicted of a murder he was later paroled

kellogg co has refused to change or 
cancel one of its tv commercials for nut amp honey crunch cereal 
despite claims by an activist group that the ad promotes violence 
against homosexuals 
in the commercials cereal eaters play off the nut amp honey name 
by answering the question of what they are eating with the reply 
nothing honey 
the chicagobased coalition against mediamarketing prejudice 
called offensive one version that shows a western chuck wagon 
cook being threatened by guntoting cowboys who believe he has 
called them honey 
the commercials send a serious and dangerous message that 
gays and lesbians or anyone perceived as sexually or behaviorally 
different are easy and acceptable targets for trivialization the 
group said wednesday outside kellogg headquarters 
kellogg however said it would be overreacting to change the 
commercial or pull it off the airthe company refused to accept 
evidence from experts on psychology advertising and violence who 
backed the groups claim said spokesman arthur johnston

the one ton bronze statue of rice university 
founder william marsh rice has been festooned with such things as 
hats coats and military regalia since it was placed on campus 58 
years ago 
but on tuesday it was facing south instead of north 
just before dawn a campus police officer spotted about 20 
people around the statue and noticed a spotlight that usually 
illuminates it was dark as he approached the group scattered 
said campus police chief mary voswinkel 
ms voswinkel said the officer was able to stop one student who 
was driving a pickup truck away from the quadrangle the officer 
took the students name and let him go then sped back to the 
statue to investigate 
the statue appeared intact but was facing the fondren library 
to the south instead of the lovett building to the north 
it took 3 hours for a crew of professional movers using a crane 
to fix the statue 
it was a student prank said bill noblitt rices director 
of university relations it was a riteofspring type thing 
noblitt said the vandalism could have had serious consequences 
because students apparently used an aframe built from 4by6 beams 
to lift the statue the devices that were found had cracked and 
the statue could have fallen 
the pranksters apparently climbed to the roof of the 
architecture building to disconnect the spotlight and had painted 
the aframe black to help conceal it 
the student who was questioned will face disciplinary action 
from the university but officials did not release further details

jaime escalante focuses on the 
blackboard with absorbed frustration reporters and photographers 
have invaded his classroom and hes concerned his students are 
losing their concentration 
although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the 
subject of the critically acclaimed film stand and deliver 
escalante has more important things on his mind like mathematics 
and helping his james garfield high school students to learn as 
much as they can 
we have so many people working at jack in the box fastfood 
restaurants and pumping gas he said like the movie teacher 
portrayed by actor edward james olmos escalante wants more for his 
students and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their 
ticket out of menial jobs 
its like a sport he said you have to practice every day 
to be in shape 
his scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical 
athletes photos show beaming students holding banners heralding 
their achievements 
each year the number of escalante students passing the advanced 
placement calculus test given by the educational testing service 
for college credit has grown tremendously 
in 1979 five students took the test and all had a passing mark 
of 3 or better by last year 87 garfield students passed the test 
higher than any other school in southern california 
the movie concerns an incident in 1982 when 18 students took 
the exam and all passed surprised that the predominantly hispanic 
class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its 
academic accreditation the ets accused the students of cheating 
twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of 
5 or near perfect scores of 4 
last year scores made by garfield students taking the advanced 
placement calculus test placed garfield second in the nation out of 
the 4197 schools with students taking the tough exam said janice 
gams with the educational testing service 
just 2 percent of american students even attempt the test 
this year a record 160 garfield students are expected to take 
the test and escalante has set his sights on attracting even more 
students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to 
continue teaching 
hes your friend hes your mentor and hes your father 
said former student josie richkarday who was one of the 18 
students suspected of cheating 
he just didnt teach said richkarday 23 who is studying 
to be a math teacher herself he brought something out of me if 
youre willing to go 50 yards hell go 100 
escalante has seen stand and deliver four times and likes 
it although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype 
because the warner bros release depicts more gang activity than 
really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more 
destitute than they really are 
his students have become doctors and engineers they work at the 
jet propulsion laboratory which does work for nasa and for trw 
inc and atlantic richfield co 
armando islas a 1976 garfield graduate and an oral surgeon with 
two offices in the los angeles area credits escalante with 
challenging him to be more than a c student with athletic talent 
he was a fantastic instructor islas said he kept you 
motivated and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but i 
think in that particular environment thats what you needed 
in the 14 years escalante has been at garfield he has watched 
the gang influence dissipate due mostly to a tough line by school 
administrators and teachers the graffiti is more or less gone 
and thanks in part to the reputation of escalantes math 
achievers the school is respected within the mostly hispanic 
barrio where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride 
the days when students didnt want to go to garfield are over 
said principal maria tostado who grew up in the area 
theres no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what 
you do youre not going to get ahead she said today the school 
is wellknown for academic prowess 
escalante a 57yearold father of two sons was a respected 
teacher in bolivia for 11 years before coming to the united states 
at his wifes urging in 1964 once here he tried a career in 
computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching 
i got real tired he said in an interview i didnt want 
to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics 
now he spends his days in a stagelike arena before as many as 
52 students who sit on tiered rows and demands that late comers 
get the chair a tots seat meant to embarrass tardy students 
into promptness 
his classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate a 
foothigh banner curls around the rooms corners greeting students 
with calculus need not be made easy it is easy already 
another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if 
they master math feel ready to attend any college or university 
feel prepared to go into real estate business engineering feel 
really good about myself 
the students do feel good about themselves boredom is replaced 
with laughter smiles and friendly jests as escalante tries to 
reach them through cheers swats them with a battered and faded 
pillow practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically 
anything to promote learning 
he was given the nickname kimo sabe by four gang toughs in 
his class the name translates loosely from spanish as the one 
who knows hes accepted the nickname but shakes off such 
glorious titles as american hero which newsweek dubbed him in 
a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it 
what i tried to do is improve things in my school he said 
hes a master said tostado describing escalantes 
teaching hes a genius at it 
news crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now 
but while the media intrusion disturbs him escalante believes the 
rewards from the movies exposure will offset the hollywood glare 
its going to motivate parents to control to help because 
the schools alone cannot educate he said its going to 
motivate the students the teachers are going to see its better to 
teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk

the working class neighborhood 
that taught edward james olmos respect for humanity and watched the 
miami vice star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his 
latest movie 
olmos returned to an east los angeles high school last spring to 
make stand and deliver a movie about a magnetic demanding 
math teacher who led an unruly hispanic class to academic triumph 
in 1982 
the 41yearold actor was no stranger to the halls of garfield 
high school his cousin teaches computer science there only 1 
miles from his childhood home it is ethnically mixed like the 
neighborhood he remembers 
stand and deliver was a smash when it opened in los angeles 
it brought in 411000 during its first week last month averaging 
14000 at each of 30 theaters he said 
olmos an actor of mexicanamerican heritage who won an emmy 
award for his role as lt castillo on the nbctv series miami 
vice was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home 
area 
this film is probably the most inspirational film ive done to 
date he said of the warner bros release 
stand and deliver is about overcoming racial stigmas it 
advances the humanities something olmos said he holds close to his 
heart something he learned in a family of eight living in a 
neighborhood crowded with russian mexican jewish and american 
indian families 
olmos who coproduced and helped write the movie claims he is 
not making a political point 
im not a political animal he said its the advancement of 
the humanities through acting that inspires olmos 
its always been that way it serves me well and makes me 
stronger he said 
that doesnt mean i have to make message movies i think that 
art forms especially films should be used to entertain now if by 
chance your entertaining and allowing your audience to experience 
an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness 
to it well even better 
the criterion no 1 is the story if that story happens to 
be socially relevant well thats wonderful but if it isnt 
thats ok too 
stand and deliver is about an event that drew national 
attention to garfield high schools 1982 calculus class the 
predominantly hispanic class took and passed an advance placement 
calculus test in stark contrast to the rest of the school which 
faced loss of accreditation 
the 18 students who were badgered and inspired by computer 
specialistturnedteacher jaime escalante were stripped of their 
honors when the educational testing service which tests us 
students and provides their scores to colleges and universities 
accused the entire class of cheating 
in the movie olmos in his role as escalante accuses the 
educational testing service of racism students from wealthy 
beverly hills would not be questioned if they passed an advance 
placement calculus test but students with hispanic names from a 
barrio high school were suspect he says in the movie 
eventually the students are vindicated with a second test 
the movie is not meant to be manipulative olmos said it 
presents an event that allows you to experience with your own 
values 
we dont give results he said we only give the facts

nation of islam leader louis farrakhan told 
a cheering audience at the university of pennsylvania you should 
thank god jesse jackson has emerged as a leading presidential 
candidate 
the black muslim minister whose appearance set off a week of 
controversy and a protest rally by up to 1000 people brought most 
of the 2000 in the auditorium to their feet when he said 
jackson is running to save a people he is running to save the 
nation 
america is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black skins 
but it hasnt grown up yet farrakhan said 
jackson during his 1984 presidential campaign accepted 
farrakhans support leading to harsh criticism particularly from 
jews farrakhan has been reported to have praised hitler and called 
judaism a gutter religion but he denied wednesday ever making the 
statements 
during this campaign jackson has had no contact with farrakhan 
the muslim minister whose visit was guarded by strict security 
measures that cost the university 6000 insisted that those 
opposing jackson especially in the democratic primary next week in 
new york are using me to galvanize jews against jesse jackson 
they are using me to try to derail him he added 
the comments came in twohour speech in which he predicted 
without being specific that a very dark and tragic day is coming 
to america to israel and to humanity 
over and over farrakhan told how whites dominate the western 
world 
referring to the days more than 125 years ago when blacks were 
slaves in the united states farrakhan said he was joining my 
dear jewish friends in saying never again referring to the 
phrase jews use in condemning the nazi holocaust 
i am considered a hater but i am a reminder to the black 
people of what has happened to us he said for if we forget it 
will happen again 
before his evening speech the black muslim minister said the 
community would benefit by the controvery his visit has generated 
even though the atmosphere is charged i did not charge it 
he said at a news conference my presence hopefully will help the 
students to judge me better 
students gathered for an hourlong demonstration before the 
speech waving signs saying unity yes antisemitism no and 
free speech yes hatred no 
no matter what farrahkan says it doesnt erase what he said 
in the past said daniel genulka the rally organizer and 
chairman of the council of jewish students we must work together 
as a community instead of being at odds 
last week university officials refused a jewish groups request 
to cancel the visit saying they respected farrakhans right to 
free speech a letter condemning farrakhan and signed by more than

theres not much you can buy for a 
penny these days but with 1000131 of them you can make your way 
into the guinness book of world records 
this weekend a local group trying to raise money for a 40000 
playground will try to lay down at least that many coins in a high 
school gymnasium to set a world record in length for a line of 
pennies 
volunteers plan to begin creating 58 lanes 3 feet wide and 44 
feet long on the gym floor friday night when they are finished 
sometime saturday they hope to have 1540500 pennies set down in 
rows an inch apart creating a line 1366 miles long 
the guinnessrecognized record is 1000130 onecent coins put 
down in a 1229mile line nov 15 1985 by students at blacktown 
girls high school in new south wales australia 
we figured out that in order to accomplish the whole thing in 
a 12hour period we would have to lay down something like 30 
pennies a second volunteer coordinator carolyn smith said 
coordinators have lined up 30 people for each twohour shift of 
pennylaying the group also has planned ahead how to get the 
pennies picked up after the record attempt 
well start vacuuming them up on sunday morning said 
volunteer martha wolf 
the group received donations for the effort from children 
businesses and service groups one problem however was that the 
three banks in fort madison only keep about 300 each in pennies at 
one time 
the banks arranged for 800000 pennies to be shipped in by 
armored car from davenport and paid 1000 to have the pennies 
wrapped and shipped which took about three weeks

federal agents fighting americas war against drugs 
got a hefty boost of firepower wednesday with the announcement here 
that they will carry semiautomatic submachine guns 
each of south floridas 341 drug enforcement administration 
agents will be issued a 9mm colt semiautomatic submachine gun that 
will fire three bursts every time an agent pulls the trigger 
officials said 
the increased firepower was welcome news for dea agents who 
until now had to go into battle carrying sixshot 38caliber 
handguns and shotguns against drug dealers firing 50 and 100 rounds 
a pop from fully automatic uzi and mac10 machine guns 
dea spokesman jack hook called it parity 
it gives you a sense of confidence we never had in miami in 
the last 10 years with the 38 revolver anybody who levels a gun 
at a dea agent now is going to have some problems said hook 
all 3000 dea agents will be issued submachine guns as quickly 
as possible officials said but south florida was chosen to be 
first because it is a mecca for drug dealers 
from october to january the dea seized 31 machine guns 
nationally of those 11 were seized in south florida 
the colt smg weighs 575 pounds and is nearly 29 inches long 
deas version is modified to carry a clip of 32 rounds of 9mm 
ammunition 
the dea is not using fully automatic guns because of concerns 
about the safety of bystanders hook said automatic guns tend to 
spray wildly and have muzzles that are difficult to control he 
said 
the dea is the first federal agency to routinely issue 
submachine guns customs and fbi still carry 38 and 357caliber 
weapons 
as of wednesday all dea agents were also issued 15shot 9mm 
automatic sidearms as their primary personal weapons the 
submachine gun is considered secondary firepower 
the price of the guns was not disclosed hook said that was a 
government secret

us authorities unsealed three indictments 
wednesday involving two companies accused of selling radar 
navigational equipment to iran in violation of a us embargo 
the companies named in the indictments are marsh aviation co 
of mesa ariz and beechcraft vertrieb und service company of 
munich west germany said us attorney peter nunez at a news 
conference 
marshs owner floyd stilwell 61 of phoenix ariz was 
arrested wednesday in phoenix and arraigned on charges of 
exportation of defense articles conspiracy to export items to 
iran and making false statements to authorities nunez said 
hans schneider 57 who owns beechcraft vertrieb und service is 
charged with conspiracy to export equipment to iran exportation of 
defense articles and making false statements to authorities he 
said 
the indictments were the result of an investigation prompted by 
a tip from teledyne ryan electronics of san diego and aided by two 
west germans who have pleaded guilty to related charges he said 
the charges against both companies and their owners stem from 
the alleged diversion of usmade equipment from west germany to 
iran which shops around the world for military equipment for its 
war with iraq 
an export embargo on usmade equipment was first placed on 
iran by president carter during the height of the american hostage 
crisis 
stilwell allegedly submitted false export information to 
teledyne ryan the us state department and the us customs 
service in an attempt to conceal that the equipments final 
destination was iran 
stilwell who was arraigned in phoenix on wednesday is 
scheduled to be extradited to san diego to appear in court monday 
the sept 25 1987 indictment against schneider accuses him of 
directing his managing director bernd pleuger to continue 
negotiating and servicing iranian contracts with the illegal 
diversion of equipment through their company 
schneiders company sells service and distributes parts for 
beechcraft aircraft corp of wichita kan and other aircraft part 
manufacturers 
nunez said he doubted that schneider will be extradited to stand 
trial in san diego because the offenses he faces do not warrant 
extradition under the west german extradition treaty 
pleuger 51 of stuttgarde west germany and a juergen 
zimmermann 37 of augsberg west germany have pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy charges in the case and have been cooperating in the 
investigation nunez said

a hospital will continue to harvest 
organs for transplant from babies born with most of their brains 
missing despite a prior announcement that the program had been 
suspended officials said 
dick schaefer a spokesman for loma linda university medical 
center said wednesday he was mistaken when he announced earlier in 
the week that the hospitals program of keeping such babies alive 
had been temporarily halted until new guidelines could be issued 
on tuesday night hospital spokeswoman anita rockwell issued a 
statement saying the program to admit anencephalic babies is to 
continue without interruption 
the hospitals policy was slightly revised however so that 
such babies will be placed on respirators only if their heart rates 
slow or they have trouble breathing schaefer said from the 
hospital 60 miles east of los angeles 
anencephalic babies those missing most of their brains 
inevitably die within days to weeks loma lindas experimental and 
sofar unsuccesful program is aimed at using such infants as organ 
donors to save the lives of babies who otherwise would die of fatal 
heart defects or other deadly ailments 
previously the hospitals policy was to place the anencephalic 
babies on respirators as soon as they were admitted to the hospital 
so their organs wouldnt deteriorate as they died 
a sevenday limit for keeping them on the respirators was 
established to counter criticisms that the doomed anencephalic 
babies were suffering only to benefit infants who need transplants 
the revised lifesupport policy which still maintains the 
sevenday limit apparently is aimed at increasing the proportion 
of babies who can be declared braindead 
schaefer said wednesday his earlier statement was a 
misunderstanding on my part i assumed that the program wouldnt be 
started until the statement of revised policy was released 
only one of the first six anencephalic babies admitted to loma 
linda hope lovette mount of knoxville tenn remained alive 
wednesday she was taken off lifesupport monday and will be 
allowed to die schaefer said

a monthslong recall effort to oust mayor federico 
pena failed wednesday when an elections official announced that 
petitions submitted fell more than 2000 names short of the number 
required by law 
the backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to 
the denver election commission wednesday afternoon beating a 5 
pm deadline by several hours 
they said they believed there were enough valid signatures to 
support calling a new mayoral election 
but late wednesday felicia muftic president of the denver 
election commission said that even without checking for validity 
the number of signatures was only 36960 
for a recall the petitions would have to bear the valid 
signatures of 39091 registered denver voters which is 25 percent 
of the number of votes cast in the last mayoral election said sam 
tarkington executive director of the election commission 
it appears that unofficially theres just not enough 
signatures to continue muftic said 
pena 41 one of the first hispanics to be mayor of a major us 
city reacted immediately with pleasure 
the time for negativism and doubt is behind us to those 
people who opposed the recall i thank you to those who supported 
the recall i urge you to join with the city to help move the city 
forward these are critical times facing our city and we cant 
afford to have disunity he said at a news conference at his 
office late wednesday 
recall organizer marge doty said earlier wednesday that she had 
no exact count on the number of signatures but said she was 
confident there were more than enough to continue the recall 
process 
doty who launched the recall effort in january requested a 
police escort to and from the election commission office after she 
reported receiving threats 
the recall drive was started by a group angry over what its 
members claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the pena 
administration the group gathered support among residents stranded 
for several days by a major holiday snowstorm when maintenance 
crews plowed only major traffic arteries while pena was vacationing 
out of state 
while there is some dispute about precise procedures denvers 
charter calls for an entirely new nonpartisan election if the 
petitions are validated to recall pena a secondterm democrat 
any candidate who collected 300 names on a nominating petition 
could run and if no candidate mustered a clear majority a runoff 
would be held next 
there have been hints of illegalities in the petition campaign 
pena appeared on a koa radio callin show wednesday morning and 
one caller informed him her daughter had been approached by 
petitioners the daughter said she was told she had to sign 
and when she said she was not a denver resident she was allegedly 
told well give you a denver address

the hijacking of a kuwait airways jumbo 
jet is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks in the middle 
east and europe that began when kuwait convicted 17 proiranian 
bombers in 1984 
since those men all but one of them shiite moslems were put 
behind bars their comrades have hijacked airliners kidnapped 
americans and other foreigners and carried out bombing attacks and 
assassinations 
the shiites who hijacked kuwait airways flight 422 on april 5 
have one demand the release of the 17 men convicted of a series of 
bombings in kuwait in december 1983 that killed five people and 
wounded 61 kuwait refuses 
the bombings were part of an iranianinspired campaign to 
destabilize kuwait which has a substantial shiite minority and 
which tehran accuses of helping iraq in their 7yearold war 
dozens of other shiites have been jailed in kuwait for bombings 
but no one has demanded their release 
theres a thread running through all these events that began 
with the 1983 bombings ian geldard of the londonbased institute 
for the study of terrorism said in a telephone interview 
he and other specialists traced the chain of violence to one 
mastermind imad mughniyeh 36 a lebanese shiite who is a security 
chief of iranianbacked hezbollah an umbrella organization whose 
name means party of god 
among the 17 three have been sentenced to death one of the 
three is elias saab whose real name is mustapha youssef badreddin 
he is mughniyehs cousin and brotherinlaw 
at the end of the day its mughniyeh whos been responsible 
for most of this violence geldard said 
some passengers freed by the hijackers of the kuwaiti jet said a 
man boarded the plane last week when it landed at mashhad in 
northeast iran shortly after being seized 
palestinian negotiatiors in cyprus where the plane flew next 
said the hijackers leader who they called experienced never 
showed himself and they speculated that he might be mughniyeh the 
plane later flew to algeria where the hijackers refused to free 
their 32 remaining hostages 
mughniyeh disappeared in beirut where he has his headquarters 
several weeks ago after returning from iran informed souces said 
on condition of anonymity 
another leading shiite militant in lebanon hussein musawi 
leader of islamic amal which is linked to hezbollah also has been 
involved in the violence geldard said 
one of musawis cousins hassan youssef musawi is among the 17 
held in kuwait and is serving a life sentence 
the family connections involved here are the reason theres 
been such a passionate intensity involved in this campaign 
geldard said 
the 17 are members of the iranianbased aldawaa or the call a 
movement of dissident iraqi shiite fundamentalists opposed to the 
baghdad government of president saddam hussein aldawaa is closely 
linked with hezbollah 
in baghdad in 1980 hussein publicly beheaded the movements 
founder mohammed bakr alsadr a shiite cleric and close friend of 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
us and lebanese intelligence officials said mughniyeh and his 
clan were behind the kidnappings of americans and frenchmen in 
lebanon that began in 1984 
intelligence organizations consider hezbollah aldawaa and 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war one and the same part of an 
increasingly potent terrorist network that leads to tehran 
here are some of the events that stemmed from the conviction of 
the 17 bombers 
dec 4 1984 five arabs hijack a kuwaiti airliner and demand 
the release of the 17 they fly the plane to tehran and kill two 
american passengers iranian security men storm the plane after 
five days and capture the hijackers who later vanish western 
intelligence believes the iranians let them go 
march 16 1985 terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press is kidnapped in beirut by 
islamic jihad twentytwo foreigners including nine americans are 
now held in lebanon 
may 4 1985 islamic jihad warns there will be catastrophic 
consequences if kuwait does not free the 17 
may 25 1985 the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah narrowly escapes assasination when a shiite suicide 
bomber rams a car loaded with explosives into his motorcade in 
kuwait two of the emirs bodyguards and the bomber were killed 
islamic jihad claimed responsibility 
june 14 1985 shiites hijack a twa airliner and fly it to 
beirut demanding the release of the 17 and more than 700 arabs 
held by israel a us navy diver is killed and 39 americans held 
hostage for 17 days before being freed after syrian intervention 
us authorities name mughniyeh as one of the suspected hijackers 
july 24 1987 after a string of bombings in kuwait a 
21yearold lebanese shiite member of hezbollah hussein hariri

on spring nights pearls of light from lanterns 
and campfires sparkle along chicagos dark seawalls and breakwaters 
as thousands of people wait for tiny silvery fish to wander into 
their nets 
the smelt are spawning again a decadesold rite of spring that 
is part social event part business and part recreation along the 
great lakes during the sixweek season from april 1 to may 15 
smelting is almost a way of life 
ive been doing it for 30 years and ive run through friends 
family my kids nobody loves it quite as much as i do said 
herman telkamp who staked out his spot four hours before he could 
legally lower his net at 7 pm 
my wife wont clean fish anymore so i spend all night 
smelting and all day cleaning 
rainbow smelt 6 to 8inch members of a family resembling the 
trout have been eaten in europe and canada for centuries 
in the midwest the rite began after 1912 when the smelt 
orginally a saltwater fish escaped into the great lakes from a 
small lake in michigan where they had been stocked 
the best smelting at montrose harbor was on the breakwater 
which was lined with vietnamese cambodian and korean families and 
a few polish immigrants 
fathers lower and raise the nets children pull the fish from 
the mesh and mothers gut and clean 
a lot of those fish are going to argyle street said one 
onlooker referring to a nearby neighborhood with vietnamese and 
cambodian restaurants 
with the right water temperature current and wind the smelt 
head in from open waters in great numbers chicago smelters run 
their square gill nets out on anchored ropes raising the nets 
several times an hour 
nightly yields can reach 5000 fish a person but on nights when 
the fish are fewer its time for sixpacks and smelt stories like 
the one rob ohagan 24 of darien tells about the tipsy smelter 
who weighted his net with his keys 
a lot of guys fish without licenses and just abandon their 
nets when the wardens come by ohagan said they figure its 
cheaper to lose a 35 smelt rig than to pay a 50 fine 
this guy remembered that his keys were on the net and he 
couldnt get into his car so he had to take the fine ohagan 
said 
theres also the matter of upholding a tradition observed by 
younger smelters biting the head off the first smelt of the season 
ed flowers 25 of la grange pulled up his first net of the 
spring and saluted the four dangling fish with a beer but he 
wouldnt take the bite 
now you wont have any more luck said jim falduto 25 of 
park ridge 
chuck roth and his wife laurie had set up a net a fire and a 
tent for their two young daughters nicole and chris 
weve been smelting about five years always at this very 
same spot roth said we only ran out of last years frozen 
smelt last month 
the roths of park forest like their smelt marinated in 
homemade hot sauce but larry wolfgang also casting his net along 
the breakwater cooks his in a beer batter 
i keep a couple of gallons for myself and give the rest away 
to friends or in the tavern wolfgang said theyre a lot 
easier to give away than zucchini or tomatoes 
wolfgang 45 said this night he was catching a wedding present 
my sisters getting married tomorrow in eau claire 
wisconsin he said she likes smelt but theyre hard to come 
by that far from the lakes

question when are the presidents words not 
the presidents words 
answer a lot of the time 
past and present white house aides say former presidential 
spokesman larry speakes went too far when he quoted president 
reagan as saying things in meetings the president didnt say 
it is nevertheless common practice for press secretaries and 
other aides to craft statements of various kinds which usually 
after being approved by the president are issued in his name 
the whole business of communication is the drafting of 
materials that the president may use in one form or another 
whether its a speech or a statement or quotes on a various issue 
that tell what the president thinks says white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
as long as it is approved by him and reflects his thinking and 
so forth that is what it is fitzwater told reporters tuesday 
it is the presidents thinking 
but said fitzwater it is wrong to attribute fabricated quotes 
to the president in the way speakes did it 
former presidential press secretaries made similar distinctions 
you try to portray what the man is what his thoughts are and 
you try to put them in words that would be his kind of words but 
you always have to rely on his approval of those speeches and those 
words thats a given said gerald ter horst who was president 
fords first press secretary 
ron ziegler who was president nixons press secretary said 
its common practice for press secretaries to develop quotes and 
get somebodys approval thats been practice since the beginning 
of time 
both ter horst and ziegler however said speakes was out of 
line why what was he doing that was different 
what he did on one occasion was to have an aide make up 
quotes polish the quotes himself and then pass them off as things 
the president said in his geneva summit meeting with mikhail s 
gorbachev 
speakes defended the practice saying i think it was an 
accurate reflection of the presidents thinking the way i 
approached it we talked many times in the preparation for the 
summit so i knew how he felt 
on another occasion speakes says he put words that were spoken 
by secretary of state george p shultz into the presidents mouth 
after a korean air lines jet was shot down in 1983 with 61 
americans aboard 
any president has much of his material written for him by aides 
who presumably help him to express his own view there is a speech 
writing department to turn out speeches for him he goes into 
meetings armed with talking points from which to speak if he 
misspeaks at a news conference a clarifying statement prepared by 
aides is issued in his name when foreign journalists submit 
questions in writing the answers are in his name but are 
staffwritten 
even his answers at news conferences are frequently not 
spontaneous according to speakes and others the president is 
given briefing books in questionandanswer form for study and 
practice before each session 
reporters who cover the white house however know and often 
report that such materials are written for the president they did 
not know and were not able to report that the quotes given them 
by speakes in geneva were not actually spoken by reagan 
in addition as george reedy former press secretary to lyndon 
johnson noted at least some of the speakesreagan quotes were 
fabricated in the context of a major international meeting 
bob ellison white house reporter for the sheridan broadcasting 
network when asked whether he was surprised to find that the 
quotes had been faked replied these quotes yes were not 
talking about the president speaking to the jaycees or the future 
farmers of america were talking about a meeting with gorbachev

president reagan insists that he was never 
aware his spokesman concocted quotes for him and says he is getting 
tired of kissandtell books written by his former aides 
reagan answering questions at a meeting of the american society 
of newspaper editors also said jesse jacksons policies have not 
been scrutinized adequately in the democratic presidential race 
because it might be misinterpreted into some kind of racial 
attack 
in a wideranging questionandanswer session on wednesday the 
president commented for the first time on two issues the 
sensitive topic of race in the 1988 presidential race and the 
controversy over the new book by his former spokesman larry 
speakes 
speakes in his book speaking out reveals that he twice 
gave quotes to the press corps claiming the words were reagans 
when in fact they were not one incident occurred after the downing 
of a korean air lines jet in 1983 and the other came during the 
1985 geneva summit between reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
when the story surfaced earlier this week reagan aides 
described the president as angry to learn of the deception 
speakes however said in subsequent interviews that reagan knew at 
the time of the practice and did not object 
on wednesday reagan said i was not aware of that and just 
learned it recently as all the rest of you did and i can tell you 
right now that i have no affection for these kissandtell books 
that are being written and i find it entirely fiction 
reagan did not directly answer the question of whether he 
approved of the practice or would allow it to continue his current 
spokesman marlin fitzwater has condemned the practice 
reagans reference to kissandtell books evidently refers 
not only to speakes book but to behind the scenes written by 
his former deputy chief of staff michael k deaver and a 
forthcoming volume by former chief of staff donald t regan 
the president also was asked about speakes contention that he 
does not read many newspapers thoroughly 
well i begin with the comics reagan said confirming part 
of speakes account and drawing a laugh from his audience in the 
process 
the president said that was a lifetime habit and that he 
then turns to the editorial pages he said he also looks through 
news clippings prepared by his staff because of the volume of 
papers published outside of washington 
but hes wrong when he implies that i dont read the papers 
yes i do reagan said 
later discussing the presidential campaign and jackson reagan 
said i hope that race will not be a part of this campaign in any 
way 
reagan went on to say of jackson it seems that more attention 
is being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what 
he is actually saying 
and i have to believe that a great many of us would find 
ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is 
proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasnt 
concern that thatd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial 
attack reagan said 
jackson has advocated deep cuts in pentagon spending and an 
array of costly social programs 
reagan acknowledged the republican field is down to one 
candidate vice president george bush but he did not give bush his 
endorsement saying there still is a convention to be held 
the president also refused to predict the outcome of the 
democratic contest 
on other topics 
he said he expects afghan rebels to continue fighting the 
marxist regime in kabul despite an agreement being signed thursday 
for the withdrawal of 115000 soviet forces after an eightyear 
occupation 
reagan said nothing in the agreement prevents the united states 
from supplying the rebels as long as they need it and as long as 
the soviet union continues to supply the afghan forces in their 
puppet government 
reagan said the us banking system has some troubles but 
he also said i dont think it is a problem that could suddenly 
bring disaster down upon us

secretary of state george p shultz says he is 
confident the soviets will keep their promise to withdraw from 
afghanistan under an agreement hailed as the first step toward 
ending the bitter afghan struggle 
shultz flew to geneva today to join soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze at the ceremonial signing of a series of 
settlement accords among them is a soviet pledge to withdraw an 
estimated 115000 red army troops from afghanistan 
shultz and shevardnadze also plan to issue statements 
reaffirming their nations right to continue aiding the afghan 
factions assuring that the war will go on as a civil conflict 
there was fresh evidence of continued warfare on the eve of the 
signing 
us government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed reports from western diplomats in pakistan earlier in the 
week that soviet forces near kabul were sent to relieve gardez a 
beleaguered afghan army garrison south of the capital amid fierce 
fighting with usbacked guerrillas 
the units were said to consist of an undetermined number of 
soldiers and 420 vehicles including t72 tanks armored personnel 
carriers and mobile rocket launchers 
gardez is 80 miles south of kabul and 60 miles from pakistan 
staging area for us aid to the resistance 
mujahedeen guerrillas recently cut the road to gardez where a 
soviet special forces regiment is garrisoned said one source 
another source said convoys of trucks also were sent into 
afghanistan from the soviet union in the past week but it was not 
clear if the trucks were filled with troops or were empty 
before leaving for geneva shultz told members of house and 
senate foreign affairs committees that he had faith in the soviet 
promise committee members said 
rep charles wilson dtexas one of capitol hills ardent 
champions of us support for antisoviet guerrillas in 
afghanistan said after meeting shultz he accepted the assurances 
the bottom line is that the soviets are getting out wilson 
said 
under the withdrawal agreement the soviets are supposed to pull 
out 50 percent of their troops within 90 days and the entire 
contingent by feb 15 1989 
that would mark the end of a soviet troop presence in 
afghanistan that began with a december 1979 airlift of red army 
forces into kabul to back promoscow afghan leaders in their war 
against insurgents us analysts believe the red army will pull 
back from exposed positions and concentrate in kabul and around the 
northern city of mazarisharif 
the united states had hoped to reach agreement with the soviets 
to cut aid to both sides the us backed guerrillas and the 
sovietsponsored afghan government but moscow rebuffed an aid 
cutoff and now both sides will continue arming their clients 
shultz said he hoped united nations mediator diego cordovez who 
arranged the soviet pullout will be successful in arranging a 
peace accord between the afghans 
pakistan and the afghan government have agreed under the accords 
to stop interfering in each others affairs and the superpowers are 
signing the pact as guarantors 
despite the likelihood of continued fighting the prospect of a 
soviet withdrawal has been hailed by us officials as a potential 
milestone in superpower relations 
since 1979 the carter and reagan administrations have told the 
soviets that their continued presence in afghanistan has made it 
difficult for the united states to trust soviet professions of 
peaceful intent

at the immigration service assistant commissioner kennedy said 
it was his job to recommend to commissioner alan c nelson whether 
to stay in the chester arthur building or move 
if nelson a close friend of meeses from the days when they 
worked together in california had demanded a move the gsa would 
have found a new building according to kennedy and gsa officials 
but kennedy recommended staying even though he was displeased 
with the building management particularly its maintenance of the 
air system 
at one point a downtown new building came on the market and 
people thought about that for a while kennedy said but when 
you look at the logistics of uprooting your entire headquarters 
staff for a month its not worth it 
kennedy said other events tied his hands the first immigration 
reform bill in a generation was enacted oct 17 1986 
we couldnt even consider a move at that time because of the 
demands of the new act kennedy said we had to get thousands 
of new employees on board 
kennedy said when he discussed the lease with nelson there 
were no options when you look at the cost of moving and all that 
its kind of the decision that doesnt have to be made 
but during this period the immigration service outgrew chester 
arthur some employees were put in two other buildings five and 10 
blocks away 
kennedy says no one pressured him and that he never heard 
whether meese had an opinion on the lease or about ursula meeses 
salary being paid indirectly by the building owners 
sources familiar with mckays investigation have said he is 
interested in the role played by meeses confidant and former 
attorney e robert wallach in obtaining the benders job offers 
to ursula meese wallach has been indicted for allegedly trying to 
peddle his influence with meese in other matters 
george walker wallachs attorney told the washington post that 
wallach played a peripheral role in ursula meeses taking the ms 
job instead of the radio program walker did not return numerous 
telephone calls over a week 
meanwhile the man who sold chester arthur to the bender 
partnership still wonders why they bought it and gave him such a 
good deal 
we are still laughing because we did a very good deal there 
said dirk van westreenen president of dutch property investment 
ltd the sale price more than tripled his 12 million investment 
five years earlier 
he decided to sell because the gsa gave us notice that they 
wanted to get rid of a floor and a half that was the risk are 
they going to stay who is going to take this space because it is 
not firstclass space and it is not a firstclass location 
of howard bender van westreenen said i dont know how much 
of a gamble it was but he took the gamble that we didnt want to 
take

a real estate developer whose family pays for 
the salary of attorney general edwin meeses wife ursula was 
granted a 50 million lease renewal on a building the government 
said risked the health and safety of justice department workers 
thirteen days after obtaining the new lease the developer and 
his partners sold the building for 226 million more than they had 
paid for it two years earlier a 60 percent profit according to 
district of columbia land records 
the developer howard s bender was the principal owner of the 
building in late 1985 when the bender foundation his familys 
taxexempt philanthropy donated 120000 to the multiple sclerosis 
society to hire ursula meese at 40000ayear for three years the 
societys lawyer said 
the lease a renewal at more than three times the previous rent 
was signed even though the landlord had not cleaned up an air 
system environmental inspectors said was a health hazard that could 
explain aboveaverage sickness there according to government 
documents 
and the lease was signed even though the easy public access 
required by another tenant jeopardizes justices ability to 
provide adequate security and increass the opportunity for 
sabotage and other covert activities a government document said 
an attorney for the meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part 
in the transactions but acknowledges that the benders and meeses 
know each other the benders refuse to discuss the matter a key 
government official said meese played no role in the real estate 
decision 
but the ms societys records on mrs meeses job have been 
subpoenaed by independent counsel james mckay as part of his 
investigation into whether meese committed federal crimes 
according to james bierbower attorney for the ms society 
federal law makes it a felony for a federal official to take any 
governmental action that would affect the financial status of his 
spouse further a presidential order forbids federal officials 
from conduct that might give the appearance of a conflict of 
interest even where one does not exist 
the sevenstory chester arthur building on the rundown fringe of 
downtown washington houses the headquarters of the justice 
departments immigration and naturalization service 
in march 1985 bender vice president of the bender foundation 
and other investors acquired the building at an apparently 
inauspicious moment in its history 
public records show that bender and his associates paid 375 
million nearly twice the assessed value for the building 
at the time the buildings most valuable asset was the federal 
lease which was due to expire within a year and would be put up 
for bids by other landlords 
in fact the federal government had already taken steps to move 
out 
on aug 8 1984 congress had approved a reagan administration 
plan pushed by thenattorney general william french smith to 
begin moving some federal offices out of the building the plan 
called for a new lease there in 1986 for only 63 percent of the 
space the government had before 
however three months after the bender partnership bought the 
building the administration told congress that its plans had 
changed dramatically 
in june 1985 the general services administration the 
governments housekeeping agency notified congress it wanted to 
keep the immigration service in the full 264000 square feet at 
chester arthur 
that same month immigration officials complained of illnesses 
among ins employees apparently caused by the buildings air system 
on sept 26 1985 assistant immigration commissioner james 
kennedy formally requested an environmental inspection from the 
general services administration 
against this background in the fall of 1985 the benders made 
two separate efforts to get mrs meese on a payroll 
first they tried to interest mrs meese in a public affairs job 
at their radio station wwdc which has a rockandroll format but 
mrs meese declined ms attorney bierbower said 
then in october 1985 the bender foundation indicated it would 
contribute 120000 to the ms society for a development director 
bierbower said 
there was no question that ms had in mind that ursula would 
become the development director at the time the bender foundation 
put up the money for the position bierbower said we were after 
ursula meese she had previously worked there as a volunteer 
howard benders wife sondra is president of the family 
foundation and a member of the ms society board 
mrs meese 56 a former probation officer in oakland calif 
has done mostly volunteer work since coming to washington with her 
husband in 1981 she also has worked as the paid executive director 
of the william moss institute a foundation to study the future 
meanwhile the chester arthur lease negotiations dragged on 
during 1986 finally on may 14 1987 after the bender partnership 
promised to clean up the air system the government signed a new 
lease for 259000 square feet 
the 10year lease was worth 50 million on may 27 the bender 
partnership sold the building for 601 million cash public 
records show 
one of the new owners asking not to be identified by name said 
the new lease was clearly one of the most desirable things from 
our standpoint 
bender family members referred all questions to attorney seymour 
glanzer who said im not going to answer your questions i have 
no comment 
james rocap an attorney for the meeses denied the attorney 
general played any role in the decision to renew the lease he 
was aware that the lease was up and so on but thats it he had no 
involvement in the lease matter in any substantive way there is no 
indication that the meeses had anything to do with his benders 
making 22 million

a student judicial board at the university 
of massachusetts wednesday declared invalid an election in which an 
avowed communist and another student were chosen as copresidents 
of the student body 
the board said the constitution of the student government 
association prohibited more than one person from holding the 
presidency 
only one person can run for and hold the office of sga 
president the threemember student court said in an opinion 
issued late wednesday night 
the student court whose decisions are binding on the student 
government ordered a new election a date was not immediately set 
student attorney general william collins asked the court to 
declare the jason rabinowitzshari silkoff ticket invalid because 
of the joint candidacy 
rabinowitz a 20yearold member of the young communist league 
is believed to be the first such member elected campus president 
since the group was formed five years ago he and silkoff also 20 
and a selfdescribed progressive were elected march 15 with 1454 
votes 391 more than conservative candidate aram hamparian at the 
19000student campus 
this was a travesty of justice rabinowitz said after the 
decision was announced were going to beat this we want to 
fight for the rights of the students 
a professor who testified at the hearing last week on behalf of 
rabinowitz and silkoff said the constitutions language about the 
presidency was vague 
it could be read in different ways said political science 
professor dean alfange said 
on whether it prohibited copresidents he said that language 
does not necessarily mean that to me as a layman reading this 
document 
conservatives in the student senate had filibustered last week 
to keep the election from being ratified and to stop rabinowitz and 
silkoff from taking office

sen ted stevens thinks its time to remember 
what he calls a forgotten piece of history 
well at least its forgotten down here but certainly not 
back home says the alaska republican a lot of people down 
here in the lower 48 think were overseas were some kind of 
foreign country 
the history to which stevens referred is the littleknown role 
played by alaska in world war ii when the aleutian islands were 
invaded and occupied by japanese troops for 14 months until the 
summer of 1943 
it was the first time since the war of 1812 that a foreign 
nation had occupied american territory 
the story is eloquently told in alaska at war which will 
air april 25 on the public broadcasting system the onehour film 
written and produced by laurence goldin for the alaska historical 
commission was previewed wednesday in a senate hearing room at a 
reception hosted by stevens and other alaska legislators 
in 1942 alaska was a us territory still 17 years away from 
statehood it was largely undeveloped a frontier land where 
conditions were primitive and life was hard there were few paved 
roads and little development 
goldin a new york native who has lived in alaska since 1970 
spent two years making the film spending much of that time digging 
up rare historical footage among the film he used was rare color 
footage taken by the late director john huston 
alaska came under attack on june 3 1942 when japanese planes 
bombed the us base at dutch harbor in the aleutians chain 
although damage was relatively light 25 americans were killed 
the attack was part of the overall japanese drive on midway 
island the small but vital american outpost in the middle of the 
pacific ocean the aleutian attack was intended as a feint a move 
designed to draw away from midway some of the already thin american 
forces which were still reeling from the attack on pearl harbor six 
months before 
but unknown to the japanese american intelligence had broken 
japanese codes and didnt fall for the aleutian gambit instead 
adm chester nimitz concentrated his forces at midway and dealt the 
japanese navy a crushing attack in one of historys greatest sea 
battles japan never recovered 
while the japanese navy was reeling at midway japanese army 
troops were landing in june 1942 on two aleutian islands at the 
western end of the farflung chain about 2600 troops landed on 
attu and another 5600 at kiska 200 miles away 
for the next year as goldins film makes clear american 
bombers steadily pounded the two japanese installations but were 
unable to dislodge the invaders 
one tragic footnote was the forced removal of about 900 aleut 
indians to a new home 2000 miles away but conditions at the new 
location were harsh and preparations were few many of the aleuts 
died many people dont realize what was done to the aleuts its 
time their story was told stevens said 
in the spring of 1943 us forces prepared to retake the two 
aleutian islands and the decision was made to attack the smaller 
base at attu 
on may 11 1943 11000 american troops invaded attu under 
dreadful weather conditions what was supposed to be a threeday 
job took three weeks of oftenbrutal fighting through the rocky 
hills and valleys of the desolate island 
when the japanese on attu realized they were surrounded the 
hundreds of soldiers remaining alive committed suicide a fact well 
documented by the film only 29 of the 2600 japanese troops 
survived american casualties totaled 549 
two months later under cover of fog the japanese navy was able 
to evacuate its base on kiska 
even now attu remains a littlevisited place and for good 
reason stevens noted 
there are still a lot of japanese relics out there he said 
we believe there are some unexploded shells on the island so 
people are kept away we considered making it a historic site but 
it would cost a fortune to sanitize it and so the job has never 
been done

an agriculture department analysis says the 
recovery in farmland prices is putting a healthy glow back into the 
financial complexion of american farmers 
when new figures based on readings as of feb 1 are released 
they are expected to show the average price of farmland is up 
nationally for the first time in six years although there are 
still areas where land values are lagging 
meanwhile the departments economic research service says that 
as stability returned last year to farm real estate which 
includes land and buildings the financial returns to farmers as a 
share of equity became positive for the first time since 1980 
equity the value difference between assets and debts plummeted 
34 percent to 5366 billion in 1986 from 8144 billion in 1981 
land values the mainstay of farm assets plunged 256 billion 
between 1981 and 1986 especially in the corn belt and northern 
plains states 
as land values declined more and more borrowers were unable 
to pay existing obligations without restructuring their debts or 
selling their assets the report said even some farms with 
positive cash flows were considered poor credit risks because of 
low or negative equity positions 
the report added an improved land market in the remainder of 
the 1980s represents an important indicator that the agricultural 
economy has turned the corner 
one measure of the importance of the land market to us 
agriculture is the agencys computations on the total return to 
equity from farm income and real capital gains 
in 1987 when net cash income rose to a record level of 57 
billion by usda estimates a couple of other things happened 
interest rates declined and farm debt which climbed to a peak of 
1927 billion in 1983 began to recede as credit tightened and 
farmers began paying off at a faster clip 
more than 50 billion was paid off in the next few years and 
agency economists think the 1988 debt balance may be whittled 
further to a range of 128 billion to 138 billion 
real estate debt of 75 billion to 81 billion in 1988 will be 
25 percent lower than in 1984 the report said nonreal estate 
debt of 53 billion to 57 billion will be nearly 37 percent less 
thus according to the economists the return to farmers on 
their equity in 1987 averaged 44 percent nationally nearly the 
average of 49 percent a year in the period of 195970 
net cash income is expected to decline this year to a range of 
50 billion to 55 billion because of reduced federal supports as 
a threeyear drop in production expenses comes to an end and 
because livestock earnings are likely to decline after two years of 
growth 
as a consequence farm returns on equity are forecast to 
decline perhaps ranging from no gain at all or an increase of 2 
percent but that reflects the estimated stable prices for 
land the report said

exporters have sold china an additional 
350000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices for delivery

a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
china bought more than 49 million tons of wheat under previous 
eep arrangements which allow exporters to sell commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged 2828 per 
ton or about 77 cents per bushel of wheat the bonuses will be 
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the departments 
commodity credit corp 
china has more than 19 million tons remaining for use under the 
eep initiative announced april 5 he said 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said india will be 
allowed to buy wheat under eep arrangements it is the first time 
india has been eligible to buy subsidized wheat under the program

economic prospects have improved slightly over 
the past six months in the united states and other industrial 
countries but have dropped sharply in poor countries according to 
estimates made public today by the international monetary fund 
in the united states the fund predicts that production will 
increase this year by the same 29 percent as it did in 1986 and 
1987 with a slower increase of 27 percent in 1989 it predicts 
declining unemployment from 62 percent last year to 6 percent this 
year and 59 next year 
inflation in the industrialized countries is pegged at 3 percent 
in 1988 but in the third world the report says prices paid by 
consumers will go up by 467 percent 
total growth in the third world is put at 37 percent 
the report does not include population figures but since third 
world birth rates are high the rise in income for each individual 
may be only about half as much for industrial countries the new 
growth figure is 3 percent 
an important positive development in 1987 was the 
strengthening of policy coordination among the major industrial 
countries says the funds new world economic outlook 
the us federal budget deficit fell substantially as did 
deficits in other large countries with troublesome fiscal 
positions 
in the imfs parlance a country gets into a troublesome 
fiscal position when its government fails to collect enough taxes 
to cover its expenses 
the fund says the three most economically important latin 
american countries brazil mexico and argentina have had 
serious setbacks in curbing inflation and there are signs of rising 
prices elsewhere fund officials doubt if their governments can do 
anything effective to stabilize their economies 
sluggish growth in the third world is blamed in part on a 
slowdown in india due to drought and to lower pay and less 
investment in brazil because of rising inflation 
growth in china south korea and taiwan on the other hand was 
called particularly buoyant 
the predictions are made on the assumption that government 
policies and currency exchange rates will not change 
for the major industrial countries taken as a group the 
predictions include these for the years 1990 to 1992 a 28 percent 
increase in production and a slight increase in the jobless rate to 
69 percent

the assertion by gov michael dukakis that the 
united states reserves the right to use nuclear force in europe 
is a restatement of a longstanding but sometimes confusing policy 
of the north atlantic treaty organization 
in the arcane parlance of nuclear weapons there is a distinct 
difference between the phrases first strike and first use 
as used by nuclear strategists the term first strike refers 
to a preemptive nuclear attack by one superpower against the 
other us officials have repeatedly said no such strike will be 
undertaken by the united states 
the phrase first use generally refers to the use of atomic 
weapons in europe an option the united states has long kept open 
us policy is that the united states and its nato allies might 
have to resort to nuclear weapons to stop a soviet attack with 
conventional weapons supporters of nato have argued that the 
possibility of a us nuclear strike is the main threat feared by 
the soviets 
the american threat arises from the soviets large numerical 
advantage in a variety of conventional weapons such as tanks and 
artillery 
dukakis was attacked on tuesday by democratic presidential rival 
albert gore for his reference to the possible use of nuclear 
weapons in europe gore said the united states should not tip its 
hand on the use of nuclear force 
dukakis responded that he was merely restating longstanding 
policy and the record largely bears that out 
retired army gen bernard rogers the former commander of nato 
repeatedly told congress that because of the soviets advantage in 
conventional weapons nato might have to resort to the first use of 
nuclear weapons within a matter of days to halt a largescale 
soviet attack 
the policy has received new attention in the debate over the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the ussoviet pack 
eliminating mediumrange atomic weapons 
critics of the inf pact such as conservative republicans have 
argued that eliminating the nuclear threat posed by the us 
pershing ii and groundlaunched cruise missiles was one of the main 
reasons the soviets agreed to the pact 
even supporters of the treaty have argued that nato needs to 
upgrade its conventional forces to keep the peace in europe 
while american doctrine for strategic or longrange atomic 
weapons is based on a no first strike plan us officials have 
been intentionally vague about spelling out just what would cause 
the launching of the united states strategic arsenal 
for example american strategic doctrine is generally thought to 
be based on the philosophy that the united states would be able to 
ride out a soviet first strike and then deal a devastating 
counterattack that doctrine of absorbing the first strike arises 
from the desire to avoid a nuclear war caused by computer error no 
matter how small that likelihood

if you are among millions of taxpayers waiting 
until the last minute to file federal returns you might save time 
and expedite any refund by avoiding the long form 1040 
the general accounting office an arm of congress found during 
a check of one of the 10 irs processing centers that 141 percent 
of filers had used 1040 when they could have filed the simpler 
1040a or the onepage 1040ez 
many of those probably were taxpayers who in the past itemized 
deductions and thus had to file the long form and stuck with it 
this year even though repeal or reduction of several deductions 
made it no longer profitable to itemize 
the shorter forms are less complicated to fill out and present 
fewer opportunities for errors the irs requires less time to 
process them 
but the shorter forms are not for everyone if your itemized 
deductions total more than your standard deduction youll save 
money by itemizing which requires the long form and you must file 
the long form if taxable income is 50000 or more 
midnight friday is the deadline for most individuals to file 
their returns the first that reflect the farreaching taxlaw 
revision enacted in 1986 so far despite confusion about the law 
and new forms taxpayers and the irs seem to be holding their own 
this has been a very good filing season to date gibbs said 
but it has been challenging because of the number of changes 
made in the 1986 act 
through april 8 the irs had received 645 million returns 
compared with 657 million before the last week of the 1987 filing 
season the agency has processed 527 million this year down 
slightly from 528 million at this time last year 
refunds have been certified for 78 percent 41 million of the 
returns that have been processed compared with 79 percent at this 
time last year refunds are averaging 830 up from 815 
new restrictions on itemized deductions and higher standard 
deductions have significantly reduced the number of couples and 
individuals who are itemizing gibbs said 
the one dark spot on this tax season irs and gao agree is that 
taxpayers still find it difficult to get the correct answer when 
they telephone tax questions to the irs gao said irs provided the 
right answer to only 62 percent of the 1523 test calls made by 
gao a broader irs survey 15000 calls produced the correct 
response to 721 percent of the questions 
in each survey the accuracy rate was up slightly from a 
february check 
you get better odds in las vegas grumbled rep jj pickle 
chairman of the house ways and means oversight subcommittee 
we must and will improve our accuracy rate for our 
customers gibbs promised he mentioned plans to make telephone 
assistors fulltime rather than seasonal employees to raise 
their pay and to give each immediate access to computerized 
information necessary to answer questions 
despite all the confusion about new laws and complicated forms 
the subcommittee was told taxpayers are having fewer problems than 
anticipated 
the irs has received 157 million telephone calls for 
information this year up 126 percent from last year but 78 
percent fewer than expected 
errors are showing up on 207 percent of returns about 14 
percentage points above last year the amount of the increase has 
been less than expected said gao deputy director johnny f finch 
about 42 percent of the returns filed so far have been prepared 
by professionals up from 40 percent last year but less than in 
1986 some experts had predicted most taxpayers would have to turn 
to professionals because of the new law 
finch said 48 percent of 892 taxpayers surveyed in four states 
and the district of columbia had more trouble filling out this 
years returns than last years another 30 percent found little 
difference and 12 percent said this years were easier ten 
percent were not sure

consumer advocate ralph nader wants congress 
to reject efforts to restructure the nations financial system to 
allow banks and securities firms broad latitude to affiliate for 
the first time since 1933 
nader representing the center for study of responsive law told 
the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee wednesday 
that congress should not repeal the provisions of the 1933 
glasssteagall act which prohibit banks and bank holding companies 
from underwriting and dealing in corporate securities 
specifically nader said banking organizations should continue 
to be barred from dealing in the following securities activities 
underwriting or dealing in corporate debt or equity securities 
sponsorship or investment management of mutual funds comprised 
of corporate debt or equity securities 
underwriting securities collateralized by their own loans 
nader told the subcommittee that commerical bank underwriting 
and dealing in corporate securities involves serious conflicts of 
interest that can injure public investors undermine the integrity 
of capital markets and are not readily controlled by any 
realistically available set of safeguards 
before nader testified david s ruder chairman of the 
securities and exchange commission told the subcommittee the 
regulatory agency endorses senatepassed legislation to permit 
banks to enter the securities business so long as adequate 
safeguards are established to address investor protection 
concerns 
ruder said the sec believes the senate legislation sponsored by 
william proxmire dwisc has adequate safeguards for the repeal 
of glasssteagall act which separated banking from the securities 
business in the aftermath of the 1929 financial crash 
the commission supports modification or repeal of the 
glasssteagall act as long as the investor protection concerns 
arising from the entry of banks into securities activities are 
simultaneously addressed he said

hollywood will add its touch to the 
readymade theater of the democratic national convention this 
summer but producers say the professional flourishes will be 
tasteful and relevant 
the democratic national convention committee hired the 
entertainment production company of smithhemion to produce and 
stage the atlanta convention believed to be the first time the 
democrats have brought in theatrical producers to stage their 
convention 
smithhemion has a history of staging events and has earned 
20 emmy awards over the years for its television extravaganzas 
said partner gary smith 
festivities like the liberty weekend celebration in washington 
dc televisions we the people 200 featuring walter cronkite 
and disneylands 25th anniversary party were produced by the 
company 
smithhemion will work with the media create the look of 
the arena design the podium oversee the sound and use big screens 
to provide visual elements that have been pretaped in support of 
the speeches smith explained 
even in a convention there is room for relevant entertainment 
tasteful and relevant he said adding that in his opinion a 
convention should be more than a series of speeches 
the agenda of the convention is up to the democrats he 
emphasized but the producers will supply things that are 
emotionally effective or emotionally motivated and good information 
that is visually enhanced 
smith said it was too early to identify entertainers or special 
effects to be used during the convention those things will be part 
of the it he said but the democrats have not gone into show 
business the most important priority is the need to maintain their 
agenda 
smithhemions team of about 100 people started working six 
weeks ago and will continue working until the convention is staged 
july 1821 in the omni 
this is a news event that tvs are picking up opening ceremony 
on liberty weekend was a bit created this convention is an 
official american event we would do it whether it was on 
television or not smith said 
he said the convention is more meaningful to him because if i 
have ever been affiliated with any party it would be democratic 
but i have always voted for the person not the party 
in addition to the staging and production work smithhemion 
will provide closed circuit gaveltogavel coverage that will be 
available by satellite to every television station in the country 
he said 
the art director for the convention is rene lagler who worked 
on both liberty weekend and the 1984 olympics in los angeles he 
is designing the look of the podium and how the arena will look 
from a scenic standpoint smith said 
how will smithhemion rate the success of its work 
i dont think ratings will enter into it whatsoever he said 
of the television ratings which usually tell networks whether they 
have scored a commercial success 
emmy nominations and awards are a measure of creative success 
but that wont be a good gauge in this case either he said 
it will come down to whether the dnc says we did a good job 
said smith who refused to identify a favorite candidate 
if the democratic nominee wins the presidential race in 
november that would make us feel pretty good obviously that is 
the ultimate goal to win the election come november he said

the hijacking of a kuwaiti jet by shiite 
moslems and the killing of two kuwaiti hostages have embarrassed 
arab leaders who want world attention to remain focused on the arab 
uprising in israel 
sheik sabah alahmed foreign minister of kuwait asked by 
reporters about the hijackers said regrettably we have to 
concede they are arabs 
the 4monthold palestinian uprising in israelioccupied 
territory has brought an unusual degree of unity among arabs 
radical and moderate supporting arabs youths defying israeli armed 
forces with stones and bottles 
pictures of the two kuwaiti bodies thrown out of the jumbo jet 
in cyprus on saturday and monday and wired to newspapers and 
television stations around the world shook that unity this 
incident has spoiled the image of the arabs in the world said 
president hosni mubarak of egypt 
mubarak said israeli attempts to put down the uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where more than 140 palestinians 
have been killed since dec 8 were our prime preoccupation 
yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation organization 
issued a message to the hijackers of the kuwait airways boeing 747 
that their action is not only hurting the kuwaitis but the arab 
and islamic nation 
arafat said the hijacking which has taken the plane and 
hostages from mashhad iran to larnaca cyprus to algiers 
algeria in nine days took away the glare of world publicity from 
the palestinian revolt 
this action diverts world attention from the uprising in the 
west bank and gaza and from the brutal and oppressive measures of 
the israeli occupying authorities foreign minister taher masri 
of jordan told the associated press in amman on wednesday israel 
captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war 
marwan dudin jordanian minister of occupied territories said 
the hijack contributed to harming the image of arabs worldwide 
dudin said most europeans link islam and arabs and connect any 
moslem group with the fundamentalist revolution in iran of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
masri said the hijack should not affect the arab image after 
all we are the victims he said furthermore he said it is 
clear they the hijackers are backed by the iranian regime 
although the current hijack is complicated by an alleged role 
played by iran which is persian not arab it is not the first 
time arabs have hurt the image of their cause by violent disunity 
infighting including assasinations have plagued the plo 
for 13 years the world has been seeing gory scenes of arab 
killing arab in the complicated carnage of the lebanese civil war 
in the summer of 1977 border clashes brought egypt and libya to 
the brink of war

a new general accounting office report shows 
that drug and alcohol abuse by railroad crew members has become a 
runaway train a senator says 
sen john heinz rpa offered that characterization on 
wednesday after the report was released by gao the investigative 
arm of congress it reported that one in five crews involved in 
train accidents during 1987 had at least one member test positive 
for drugs or alcohol 
the finding came during a review of the federal railroad 
administrations policy of requiring railroad workers in major 
accidents to submit to drug and alcohol tests 
on feb 11 the testing was struck down as unconstitutional by 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco but the 
program remains in place while the reagan administration appeals 
substance abuse on the rails is fast becoming a runaway 
train said heinz who requested the gao study 
of 179 accidents during 1987 gao found at least one positive 
drug or alcohol finding in 37 or about 20 percent however the 
report did not identify in how many of those cases the drugs or 
alcohol actually figured in the accident 
in all 42 or 55 percent of 770 rail workers sampled last 
year following accidents tested positive for alcohol or illicit 
drugs said the fra which released its own figures this week in 
answer to a reporters query 
gao also reported that the amount of time needed to report drug 
and alcohol test results has substantially improved 
in april 1987 it took an average of 162 working days to report 
initial screening test results for accidents where all crew members 
tested negative by october the reporting time had been reduced to 
48 working days gao said it takes longer when positive results 
are found because they must be confirmed 
heinz had complained that long lags were hampering 
investigations and unfairly placing suspicion on innocent crew 
members 
fra ended an agreement with a federal aviation administration 
laboratory in oklahoma city in march 1987 because it said it 
discovered discrepancies in the results according to gao in 
april fra contracted with a toxicology center at the university of 
utah for the tests

elderly people living alone are more likely to 
maintain their independence and live longer if they visit with 
friends and neighbors and attend church or other group events a 
government study reports 
and people over age 70 who live alone are more likely to survive 
over a twoyear period than those who live with someone the 
national center for health statistics found in the study made 
public wednesday 
both living alone and engaging in various activities were 
indications of better health the less active elderly were more 
likely to die or become institutionalized over time 
there is a noticeable difference for those people who have 
contact with friends ands neighbors who go to church or synagogue 
or attend sports events reported dr mary grace kovar author of 
the study 
her findings in aging in the eighties people living alone 
two years later are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with 
people who were 70 and older in 1984 
of those living alone who reported regular meetings with friends 
and neighbors in 1984 925 percent were still alive two years 
later and 893 percent were still living on their own 
on the other hand of those who had no such contact 866 
percent survived two years and 815 percent still lived alone 
for regular churchgoers in 1984 949 percent survived two years 
and 919 percent were still alone of those who didnt attend 
church or synagogue 862 percent survived and 819 percent lived 
on their own 
but regular contact with family did not seem a significant 
factor in longer life and more independence perhaps those 
reporting extra family contacts needed the help because they were 
not well kovar speculated 
children may have come around more frequently just to make 
sure the older folks were all right she said 
the most important thing found in the study is the 
stability kovar said in a telephone interview 
most of these people two years later are still living in the 
community those who were living alone are still alone and those 
with someone else are still with someone else she said 
as you would expect because these people are 72 or older 
death rates are high but relatively few of them are in nursing 
homes she noted 
of nearly 64 million elderly people living alone in 1984 898 
percent were still alive two years later she found 
by comparison 890 percent of those living with a spouse 
survived two years and 843 percent who had been living with 
someone else were still alive 
of those who had been on their own in 1984 kovar found that by 
1986 778 percent were still living by themselves some 74 
percent of them had moved in with someone else most often family 
and 46 percent were in an institution 
it certainly appears that for some of them life is better 
two years later she added some have remarried not many but 
some and when we asked those who had moved why we got 
answers ranging from health to being nearer to children to spending 
the summer in maine and winter in florida one she said even 
cited lower golf fees for moving 
a major factor in continued independence is likely that those 
living alone were more healthy at the start of the study she 
concluded in the report 
health was also a factor in the stability of those living alone 
she found 
for example people who needed help with basic daily activities 
such as bathing dressing eating or using the toilet were much 
more likely to have died over the two year span 
while only about 10 percent of all those living alone died in 
the two year period 25 percent of those who had needed help in 
basic daily activities died and 16 percent were in nursing homes 
after two years 
it is very difficult to disentangle all the factors 
affecting these people she said another followup series of 
interviews is scheduled for this summer to compare the same group 
of elderly in 1988 
overall she found that nursing homes appear to be a last resort 
for the elderly 
these is evidence of a progression she reported people live 
alone then with other people if others are available then they 
may become nursing home residents

some 88 billion in lingering debt owed by 
agricultural producers will be wiped from the books of the farmers 
home administration under a measure approved by lawmakers last 
year the agencys administrator says 
it is true that we are probably writing off upwards of 8 
billion to 9 billion over the next couple of years and the 
agricultural credit act is responsible for a substantial portion of 
that fmha administrator vance clark told a senate appropriations 
panel wednesday 
under provisions of the farm credit act approved last year fmha 
will write down or defer payments on 21 billion in debt 
owed by farmers who will be restored to profitability as a result 
the agency said 
eventually it said the government may still be able to recover 
some of that money 
but it said would simply write off 67 billion in 
nonperforming loans to farmers who even with such help will not be 
able to turn a profit 
last years legislation required the government to take such 
actions if they would be less expensive for the taxpayers than 
foreclosure 
clarks disclosure followed an unconfirmed report last month 
that the government most likely would write off 7 billion in fmha 
loans 
the disclosure came in response to a question from sen charles 
grassley riowa who had seen the earlier published report and was 
concerned about it 
grassley was critical of clark however for saying that it was 
the farm credit act that was costing the money 
he said that in every case foreclosure would have been more 
expensive and thus the taxpayers were not losing anything that they 
would not have lost anyway 
theyre including costs that would have been there even if 
congress had not passed the bill grassley said 
he called the foreclosureexpense test a very objective 
bottom line decision that really means what congress passed isnt 
costing the federal government anything

an electric shock device intended to help keep 
disturbed people from injuring themselves is being labeled medieval 
torture by opponents while supporters call it a miracle 
this thing works said retired marine col bernard mcshane 
the father of severely retarded 37yearold twins there is a 
case for this device 
mcshane jumped up to praise the socalled selfinjurious 
behavior inhibiting system sibis wednesday at a news conference 
organized by 13 national groups seeking to stop its sale to doctors 
and psychologists 
he interrupted the presentation to say his daughters lives had 
been transformed from the first hour they started wearing the 
selfactivating device which administers an electric shock when a 
person inflicts a blow on himself 
theyve stopped tearing their clothes off theyve stopped 
hitting themselves mcshane said of his daughters who are living 
in an italian institution run by nuns 
they now sit and have their dinner with their two roommates 
they can participate i fully intend to let them wear them for 
the rest of their lives he said 
an estimated 50000 severely retarded or autistic people suffer 
from the mysterious syndrome in which they bang their heads against 
the floor or wall or beat their heads and faces with their fists 
drugs and physical restraints are often used to try to stop the 
selfinflicted blows when other approaches fail 
sibis was reviewed by the food and drug administration and 
registered last june for commercial sale and distribution it 
consists of lightweight headgear and an arm or leg band and 
delivers a shock an opponent described as painful and a supporter 
compared to a onetenth of a second pinprick 
the association for retarded citizens the mental health law 
project and the autism society of america were among the groups 
denouncing sibis as unconstitutional and punitive 
frank laski a lawyer from the public interest law center of 
philadelphia said the device violates the most fundamental 
concepts of personal dignity personal autonomy and due process 
he said it was neither humane nor effective 
let us not return to the dark ages said janet salzano 
mother of a 30yearold autistic son it is my philosophy that 
the disabled have the same rights as everyone else in america 
several speakers said other approaches are effective in treating 
the problem and have a longerlasting impact than sibis they said 
they are concerned that the fda approved the device without 
published evidence that it works and without standards for its use 
thomas linscheid a professor of pediatrics and psychology at 
ohio state university who observed the news conference said he is 
compiling data that prove very definitively that this has been a 
very effective procedure 
he said psychologists who support sibis do not necessarily 
oppose positive behavior modification techniques and in fact the 
two can complement each other if i can stop this person from 
hitting himself 3000 times in a sixhour school day i can do more 
positive reinforcement he said it gives me a window of 
opportunity 
linscheid also said desperate parents should not be deprived of 
anything that seems to work he cited a south carolina teenager 
who was in restraints for 10 years but has gained 60 pounds feeds 
himself and is toilet trained since starting with sibis its 
pretty hard to say to parents take that away he said 
asked about potential misuse of the device linscheid said the 
disabled are protected by many advocacy groups and added we 
cant say that because theres a chance for abuse we cant use it 
at all

former attorney general ramsey clark is 
representing the survivors of 15 libyans killed during the us 
bombing raid of libya two years ago in a civil suit for damages 
against the reagan administration 
clark who has been criticized in the past for dealing with 
nations hostile to the united states filed the lawsuit wednesday 
to collect unspecified damages for the deaths property damage and 
injuries to 40 other libyans 
the suit filed in us district court charged that the april 
14 1986 bombing violated settled principles of international 
law in the united nations charter and numerous treaties and 
declarations 
it charged the reagan administration purposely hid the real 
purpose of the bombing which the suit said was to kill libyan 
leader moammar ghadafi and to terrorize libyans by inflicting 
injury upon the civilian population in order to undermine support 
for their leader 
president reagan said the raid was in retaliation for the 
antiamerican attacks authorized by ghadafi including the bombing 
of a west berlin discotheque frequented by us servicemen that 
killed two and injured 150 others 
the lawsuit charged that top governent officials including 
president reagan are guilty of conduct constituting clear 
violations of settled principles of international law prohibiting 
the use of force by a state against the territorial integrity of 
political independence of another state 
among the victims of the bombing raid was a 3monthold girl who 
died when hit by shrapnel while asleep in her home in benghazi the 
childs 38yearold father was also killed by shrapnel according 
to the complaint 
the suit filed under the alien tort statute and the federal 
tort claims act said claims for compensation by the victims or 
their survivors were rejected last october by the air force 
the suit named reagan individually and in his capacity as 
commander in chief of us armed forces british prime minister 
margaret thatcher was sued for approving the use of us military 
bases in britain to launch the attacks 
also sued were former defense secretary caspar w weinberger and 
top military officials including adm william j crowe jr the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and retired gen bernard w 
rogers former supreme allied commender in europe 
the estate of the late cia director william j casey was also 
named as a defendant in the case which was assigned to us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson 
clark who served as attorney general under president johnson 
has been criticized over several years for dealing with foreign 
governments whose interests conflict with this country 
in 1980 he attended a crimes of america conference in iran 
while american hostages were being held in tehran he also was 
criticized in 1972 for traveling to hanoi to investigate the 
effects of us bombing during the vietnam war

the armys new tank plating which uses 
depleted uranium may not curb the large soviet advantage in the 
race to develop the best armor and the deadliest way of attacking 
those defenses according to an army armor specialist 
its too early to tell how effective it is retired army 
gen donn starry told reporters 
starry specialized in armor systems before he retired last year 
as commander of the armys training and doctrine command where he 
was responsible for helping develop tank warfare doctrine 
the new us armor was unveiled last month by army officials 
who said it would be a significant enhancement of us 
capabilities for the m1a1 abrams the main us battle tank a 
statement by the service said the new armor would allow the 
abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s 
speaking to a senate armed services subcommittee wednesday 
starry offered an extremely negative assessment of the ussoviet 
balance in armor and antiarmor weapons 
none of the top us antitank weapons is likely to work against 
frontline soviet tanks because the soviets have developed 
innovative armor starry told the conventional forces subcommittee 
the soviets have a roughly 31 advantage in tanks stationed in 
western europe but pentagon officials have argued that many of the 
soviet weapons are far older and thus likely to be less effective 
than western tanks 
in addition the army and other nato nations have stockpiled 
thousands of antitank missiles such as the dragon several types 
of tows and the hellfire 
none of them would work starry said because the soviets have 
developed reactive armor that uses both a ceramic cover and a 
series of applique boxes the latter developed by the israelis 
a decade ago are specially designed boxes containing explosives 
which blow up when hit by an incoming explosive the explosion of 
the box dissipates and dilutes the force of the incoming weapon 
the unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top of 
builtin glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quite 
likely defeat the warheads of all deployed weapons used by 
western forces he said 
starrys views took some senators by surprise 
sen william cohen rmaine asked starry are you including 
hellfire his reference was to the missile carried by the apache 
the armys newest attack helicopter and a weapon that was designed 
specifically to defeat soviet tanks 
yes said starry 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of the subcommittee asked 
are you saying that if we went to war our bullets and missiles 
would bounce off soviet tanks 
thats correct said starry 
in 1985 starry took part in a study by the pentagons defense 
science board which concluded that the soviets had an advantage 
over the united states in armor and in attacking armor the study 
described the situation as a matter of national urgency 
the situation is worse now he said today it is my judgment 
that we have crossed the threshold the situation is now a matter 
of considerable national urgency 
army officials told the subcommittee wednesday they agreed with 
starrys assessment of the dsb report in 1985 and the current 
situation 
the army agreed with the dsb conclusions in 1985 and still 
agrees with the conclusion that we are behind the soviets we need 
to regain the lead and maintain that advantage said lt gen 
donald s pihl deputy to the assistant secretary of the army for 
research and development

most black and jewish voters have coalesced 
around the two chief competitors in new yorks democratic 
presidential primary but other potentially large voting blocs 
remain fragmented political analysts say 
sen albert gore jrs attempt to outflank gov michael dukakis 
for the jewish vote appears destined to fall short an expert in 
jewish opinion said wednesday and jesse jacksons strength remains 
greatest with blacks said other experts 
the analysts said other major groups such as union members 
homosexuals and roman catholics do not seem to be drawn to any of 
the candidates by a single overriding issue in next tuesdays vote 
what then may come into play for these democratic voters is the 
pragmatic issue of which candidate is most likely to win the 
presidency said meyer s frucher a leading political strategist 
a key battle has been for jews up to a quarter of the 
democratic vote gore has sought their support by placing himself 
to dukakis right on middle east policy flatly opposing formation 
of a palestinian state 
the hard line may help gore in brooklyn where 25 percent of the 
400000 jews are in the orthodox sect said steven m cohen a 
sociology professor at queens college who has polled jewish 
attitudes for a decade 
but the effort likely will fail overall cohen said because 
dukakis and gore are close enough on middle east policy for either 
to be acceptable to the majority of jews and dukakis appeals to 
them on other grounds 
dukakis is seen as friendly because hes a northeast liberal 
ethnic cohen said hes our type of guy 
jackson has received black backing in the 90percent range in 
other states and blacks like jews account for up to a quarter of 
the democratic vote in new york he also may count on broad support 
from hispanics said victor alicea a hispanic leader but in 1984 
hispanics made up just 4 percent of the state primary vote 
organized labor is divided said theodore w kheel a longtime 
labor mediator in the city the central labor council and the state 
federation of labor are neutral he said while local leaders are 
all over the lot 
in the absence of a defining issue catholics also do not 
constitute a strong voting block and i dont think theres going 
to be a catholic groundswell for any democratic candidate said 
ed wilkinson editor of the tablet the newspaper of the 
archdiocese of brooklyn and queens 
nonetheless said pollster lee miringoff of the marist college 
institute for public opinion i think the white ethnic vote is 
going to dukakis at this point 
dukakis a greekamerican also expects enthusiastic support 
from the greek community which has about 65000 adult us 
citizens in the city 
homosexuals are in far more of a quandary many activists reject 
dukakis because of his opposition to homosexual couples as foster 
parents said thomas b stoddard director of the lambda legal 
defense and education fund but many fear jackson or gore would 
lose to the republican 
the result is that some voters will go for jackson who is 
viewed overall as better on homosexual issues said stoddard those 
less concerned about the foster parent issues will back dukakis a 
few will vote for gore whose standing is uncertain on 
homosexual issues other than aids 
some stoddard added will simply stay home

democratic leaders are asking unions to go 
along with dropping mandatory notice of plant closings from the 
sweeping congressional trade bill because of threats of a 
presidential veto 
but union representatives refused to relent wednesday in a 
threehour meeting with the leaders behind closed doors according 
to sources who asked not to be identified by name 
were still searching house speaker jim wright dtexas 
told reporters following the session in the office of senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva wright declined to go into 
detail 
warnings that the plantclosings measure could prompt president 
reagan to use his veto power and thus scuttle the entire 1000page 
trade bill failed to move representatives of the united auto 
workers and several other labor groups according to the sources 
under the provision in question companies with at least 100 
employees would be required to provide 60 days notice of plant 
closings and layoffs involving at least onethird of their work 
force 
layoffs involving 500 workers or more would have to be preceded 
by notice even if less than onethird of the work force is involved 
labor representatives called on the leaders to push forward with 
the plantclosings provision in defiance of repeated veto threats 
from members of president reagans cabinet treasury secretary 
james a baker iii issued the latest warning tuesday 
labor representatives left the session without commenting to 
reporters as did a number of congressional participants 
besides byrd and wright those on hand were house ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill senate finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas and sen edward m 
kennedy dmass 
the disputed measure part of the senate version of the trade 
bill but not that passed by the house has aroused passionate 
opposition among several business groups they say it could be the 
first step toward taking control of companies away from management 
supporters say something must be done to end circumstances in 
which factory workers with families arrive at work to find that the 
plant is closed permanently and their job has vanished 
at the heart of the trade bill are provisions that would 
transfer to the us trade representative authority to retaliate 
against international violations by the nations trading partners 
and other unjustifiable practices the president currently has 
that authority 
main provisions also would streamline machinery for imposing 
import curbs to aid threatened us industries 
the bill contains scores of other provisions ranging from repeal 
of the windfall profits tax on oil companies to tighter monitoring 
of lamb imports 
in recent days a chief concern of lawmakers has been finding a 
formula that would guarantee that president reagan would sign the 
bill 
a hint that leaders were leaning toward dropping the provision 
came earlier wednesday when wright told reporters it would still 
represent a good bill if shorn of the plantclosings feature 
he did say it would be a better bill with that provision 
included 
republicans who furnished much of the opposition to the 
plantclosings provision were not party to the talks with labor 
representatives 
but dropping the provision could prove a touchy matter 
sponsors including sen howard m metzenbaum dohio and rep 
augustus f hawkins dcalif pressed ahead and succeeded in 
inserting the feature in the bill amid a hailstorm of 
administration veto threats 
kennedy the only plantclosings sponsor in the afternoon 
session was asked during a brief break whether he was making any 
progress in saving the measure he said merely well see 
the bureau of labor statistics in a study last year estimated 
that two out of every three workers are not told they are losing 
their job until the day they are taken off the payroll 
the national academy of sciences said in a report last june that 
the voluntary notices advocated by the administration and business 
do not now provide workers with the minimum two or three months 
necessary to adjust successfully to job loss

senators are criticizing the reagan 
administration for taking four years to implement a law aimed at 
reducing the number of dolphins that drown when they are snared by 
huge tuna nets in the eastern pacific 
wholly inadequate says john kerry dmass 
an embarrassment adds john breaux dla one of the 
authors of the 1984 law passed by congress in an effort to put 
teeth into the marine mammal protection act of 1972 
the 1984 statute requires the national marine fisheries service 
to bar importation of tuna caught by a foreign nation if its tuna 
boats fail to take steps to protect dolphins as the us tuna 
industry is required to do 
the foreign tuna fleet in the eastern tropical pacific is 
killing over 100000 dolphins a year and our government agencies 
have done little to implement the 1984 changes designed to address 
the problem kerry said wednesday at a commerce committee hearing 
dolphin kills began increasing in the late 1950s when tuna 
fishermen switched from baited hooks to gigantic seines for 
reasons unclear to biologists the popular yellowfin tuna 
congregate beneath groups of surfaceswimming dolphin which then 
serve to mark the tuna schools to fishing boats 
conservationists estimate that some 6 million of the mammals 
have drowned over the years after being trapped in tuna nets 
we face a serious situation in the tropical pacific 
testified william fox a member of the marine mammal commission he 
said preliminary findings from a dolphin census show some stocks 
are smaller than thought and others are declining 
because of improved netting techniques the number of dolphin 
kills by us tuna boats has dropped from 368000 in 1972 to 13992 
last year the hearing was told foreign kills reportedly fell from 
423678 in 1972 to an estimated maximum of 82000 compared to 
108767 in 1986 and 37505 in 1985 
only recently did the fisheries service publish regulations to 
carry out the 1984 law they would give foreign tuna fleets until 
1991 to match the performance of the us fleet which is allowed 
to kill up to 20500 dolphins a year 
why are we waiting until 1991 asked sen pete wilson 
rcalif i think we should pursue why it will take until 1991 to 
impose these import restrictions 
kerry said it bothers me enormously weve allowed this 
situation to drag on its really sad i dont know what you people 
are doing sitting down there 
james douglas the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations acting assistant administrator for fisheries 
said were not particularly proud of the amount of time it took 
to do these regulations 
he said regulators walked a tightrope wanting to reduce foreign 
fleet dolphin kills without causing other nations to give up the 
us market and continue to fish for tuna without adopting 
techniques to save dolphins 
david burney of the us tuna foundation an industry group 
said foreign tuna fleets should adopt us methods there is no 
excuse for them not having done that he said it should have 
been done three years ago

democrat albert gore jr says michael 
dukakis lacks foreign policy experience and simply doesnt know 
what hes talking about when it comes to using nuclear weapons 
and american military power 
trying to catch up with dukakis and jesse jackson before 
tuesdays important new york primary gore maintained wednesday 
that dukakis had made a major blunder by discussing in a 
newspaper interview when he would use nuclear weapons against the 
soviet union 
he stood by his criticism in the face of a strong denial by 
dukakis the massachusetts governor said he had merely reflected 
existing american and nato policy in holding open the option of a 
nuclear response to a successful soviet invasion of western europe 
with conventional forces 
the tennesse senator offered broader criticism as well faulting 
dukakis for advocating a ban on flight testing of ballistic 
missiles and for what he said were remarks supporting the 
commitment of american troops in the event of communist invaders in 
west germany or south korea 
i think in a lot of these matters he simply doesnt know what 
hes talking about and he needs an opportunity to clarify his 
remarks and i want to give him an opportuhity to do so gore said 
to reporters 
a longdistance exchange between the two candidates was touched 
off by an interview with dukakis published wednesday in the daily 
news of new york gore characterized dukakis remarks as amounting 
to saying he would launch a nuclear first strike against the 
soviet union if they invaded europe with conventional forces 
dukakis in boston insisted gore was distorting his comments 
dukakis said his position was that he would consider the use of 
nuclear forces as an option in the event of a successful soviet 
invasion of europe that has been the policy of our government 
dukakis said it is the policy of the nato alliance 
in a transcript provided by the newspaper dukakis was asked if 
he could conceive of a scenario in which he would use nuclear 
weapons first as a strategic weapon his response began 
yes yes i would hope i wouldnt have to he said he was for 
a policy of no early first use but our present strategy in 
europe assumes that if the soviets were to invade and conventional 
forces couldnt stop them that wed reserve the right to use 
nuclear force 
james steinberg the defense and foreign policy adviser to 
dukakis said dukakis started answering the question thinking he 
was being asked about tactical nuclear weapons the reference to 
strategic was made after dukakis had started speaking 
steinberg said 
steinberg said he assumed dukakis would have given a different 
answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear 
weapons 
gore campaign manager fred martin insisted gore had not 
distorted dukakis words both gore and martin said dukakis had 
erred in getting into a discussion of nuclear first use 
i think it is most unwise for a president of the united states 
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a 
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces 
and trigger destruction of human civilization gore said to 
specify in advance when we would make that fateful step is most 
unwise and irresponsible 
appearing later before westchester county democrats in rye 
brook ny gore stressed that dukakis had been asked about 
strategic nuclear weapons 
nato has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical 
gore said the president of the united states has traditionally 
refused to respond to that hypothetical 
gores criticism and the ensuing flap overshadowed an event 
wednesday when gore went to the love canal toxic waste site at 
niagra falls to underscore his commitment to environmental 
protection and blast the reagan administration 
as a congressman gore chaired congressional hearings that 
looked into the dumping of toxic wastes at the site

mikhail gorbachev called it the nations 
bleeding wound 
andrei d sakharov the human rights activist and nobel peace 
laureate branded it one of the great tragedies of our times 
costly in lives money and soviet prestige the kremlins 
military intervention in afghanistan has become a national trauma 
with the stroke of a pen in geneva today the soviet union 
committed itself to withdrawing its troops from afghanistan but 
that cant remove all the shadows cast over soviet diplomacy and 
peoples lives 
by agreeing to pull out forces sent into afghanistan beginning 
dec 27 1979 to replace one promarxist regime with another the 
soviets like the americans in vietnam have acknowledged their 
inability to keep bearing the human and diplomatic costs of an 
antiguerrilla war in a foreign land 
but while the red army may end its engagement few expect the 
fighting to cease outright and there are indications the soviets 
may continue shipping weapons to their former comrades in arms 
after their estimated 115000 troops return home 
the red army has been on the ground in afghanistan for more than 
eight years more than twice as long as it took the soviets in 
world war ii to drive the invading german armies back to berlin 
thousands of young soviet men have been killed in the afghan 
fighting thousands more wounded and billions of rubles poured 
into the war and accompanying efforts to make mountainous and 
underdeveloped afghanistan into a socialist country 
this year the soviets abandoned any pretense of seeking to 
define their neighbors future with gorbachev saying on feb 8 
that the political and economic system of afghanistan is none of 
our business 
the drive into afghanistan launched when the late leonid i 
brezhnev was in power in the soviet union poisoned the kremlins 
relations with other moslem and third world countries and doomed 
detente between the superpowers 
from the us withdrawal of the salt ii arms control treaty and 
the boycott of the 1980 moscow olympics by the united states and 61 
other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements 
involving foreign suppliers the soviets paid the price for sending 
tanks and troops across the afghan border 
last november at the un general assembly 123 nations the 
largest total to date voted for a resolution calling for the 
immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from afghanistan 
the main question about afghanistan is not the truth about the 
horrors and the deaths but why are we there one soviet war 
veteran wrote in the weekly magazine ogonyok last year 
many soviets say that question has never been answered 
afghanistan is one of the great tragedies of our times that 
has caused a worsening in international relations led to the death 
of many people and created a foyer of tension in the world 
sakharov said in february 
a moscow newspaper editor recently told a western reporter of 
receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in 
afghanistan now the others are coming home the writer of the 
letter said but what did my boy die for 
the editor said he anguished over how to reply and confessed 
i have a stack of those letters on my desk and i must answer 
each one but i dont know what to say 
gorbachev said in february that the memory of those who have 
died a heros death in afghanistan is sacred to us and that 
soviet soldiers sent there have been performing their duty 
honestly performing acts of selfdenial and heroism 
in recent weeks staterun media have issued gloomy and 
pessimistic reports on afghanistan presumably to prepare soviet 
citizens for continued strife there and the media has accused 
moslem guerrillas of accelerating fighting in that countrys 
10yearold civil war just as chances for peace improve 
terror on the eve of settlement was the headline on one 
tass news agency dispatch this week which accused the guerrillas 
fighting the sovietbacked government of president najib of 
planting mines on the road to a peaceful settlement 
under the agreement negotiated at the unsponsored talks in 
geneva soviet troops are to begin their march home may 15 in a 
pullout to be completed within nine months all should be back home 
by the end of the year soviet officials have said privately 
under gorbachevs campaign for more openness soviet newspapers 
and television have become more frank about the hardships faced by 
soldiers sent to afghanistan and by returning veterans who meet 
with official indifference or hostility 
however the horrors of the fighting in afghanistan which 
western sources say has resulted in up to 1 million civilian deaths 
and 5 million refugees have only been spottily reported in soviet 
media 
the soviet people have never been told how many of their sons 
have been killed or wounded in the war and officials refuse to say 
publicly even how many soviet troops are deployed 
the us state department has estimated soviet casualties since 
1979 at 3300038000 more than onethird of whom were killed 
those figures do not include heavy losses to disease the 
department said in a report issued in december 
reluctance to admit the full tragedy of the war and the scope 
of kremlin involvement exists throughout soviet society

in a junior high classroom in a state with 
fewer than 3000 jews sociologist charles hildebrandt holds up a 
photograph of adolf hitler and speaks about the need to be a 
witness to the holocaust 
what were aryans hildebrandt asked his keene junior high 
school students wednesday hildebrandt directs the keene state 
college holocaust resource center a library of more than 1400 
books thousands of articles films slides and videotapes that 
opened in 1983 
the five gifted and talented children whose parents 
permitted them to attend the optional afterschool course screwed 
up their faces indicating they didnt know about aryans 
they were supposed to be the superrace with blonde hair blue 
eyes tall and strong said hildebrandt the supermen that 
would conquer the world the superrace that would destroy all 
these inferior races like the jews 
the children who like hildebrandt are christian nodded 
solemnly 
this week as groups across the country hold holocaust memorials 
to mark the 45th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprisings 
hildebrandt is doing his part to ensure that the 6 million jews who 
died in nazi death camps are not forgotten and that similar 
atrocities never happen again 
education is what its all about he said his lesson is not 
lost on some of his students 
its not going to happen again because we listen and because 
theyre teaching us about it if no one had said anything then it 
could easily happen again said 11yearold erin buzuvis 
hildebrandt was asked why new hampshire needed the holocaust 
center since its jewish population is estimated by the jewish 
federation of greater manchesterat at fewer than 3000 or less 
than onethird of one percent of the population 
why not he replied there should be a center everywhere 
as the states handful of concentration camp survivors and 
liberators die its even more important to convey the facts he 
said hildebrandt says many textbook writers are minimizing the 
holocaust some even question the facts 
there has to be a witness he said 
hildebrandt does not dwell on the horror but believes that 
explaining the true events gradually is important but how does a 
teacher gradually describe genocide how can gas chambers and 
starvation be introduced without trauma 
hildebrandt advises elementary school teachers simply to begin 
with classes on prejudice and less gruesome topics for more 
advanced children he recommends two books 
one is about a little girl rose blanche who sneaks food 
through the barbed wire fence at a death camp her name which 
means white rose is also the name of a german youth group that 
resisted hitler and eventually was eliminated 
another is about a little girl discovering concentration camp 
numbers tatooed on her grandfathers arm and his explaining how 
they got there the book illustrated by photographs of a girl and 
an auschwitz survivor ends with the granddaughter saying you 
shouldnt be ashamed to let people see your number you didnt do 
anything wrong its the nazis who should be ashamed 
by junior high and high school hildebrandt says students 
generally are better able to hear a more complete truth 
still a couple of the children displayed some prejudices that 
seem to indicate why holocaust education is important especially 
in areas with few minorities 
it couldnt happen again because jews arent so jewish 
anymore said one 
theyre more civilized said another they know more they 
act more like regular people

the federal government has chipped 
in 11000 to help save the 12foot gurgling earthworms that 
transformed korumburra from a near ghost town to a bustling tourist 
attraction 
several years ago korumburra decided to promote the 
invertebrate which has 16 hearts and is a hermaphrodite meaning 
it is both male and female 
the great gippsland gurgling earthworm is so named because of 
the sucking and gurgling noises it makes when it burrows sounding 
like a bathtub draining water townsfolk credit the earthworm 
whose scientific name is megascolides australis for helping turn 
their fortunes around 
an annual worm festival called karmai after the aboriginal word 
for giant earthworm is held each march it celebrates the worm 
with parades carnivals and even an earthworm queen 
recently however intensive farming in the worms small habitat 
has raised fears the worms days are numbered 
korumburra is in gippsland an area of the southeast state of 
victoria that once was covered by a rain forest where the worms 
thrived today that habitat has been reduced to an area of 100 
square miles around the bass river 
settlers who thought the worms were snakes cleared gippslands 
rain forest with its 300foot trees in the 1880s to make room for 
dairy farming and cattle raising 
although not officially protected the earthworm is now listed 
as endangered according to worm expert georgina hickey of the 
australian museum 
federal environment minister graham richardson announced an 
11000 savetheworm grant last week as part of a 383000 package 
to study other threatened species in victoria such as the koala 
bear and the fairy penguin korumburra began exploiting the 
earthworm as a tourist attraction in 1977 after the local coal mine 
went bust a butter plant shut down and young people began heading 
to melbourne 75 miles away in search of jobs 
the worm saved the town said mark holmes on whose property 
most of the worms are found the worms helped people have an 
identity i dont know if theyre proud of what theyve got but 
weve got something unique weve got a thing that is dropping off 
the face of the earth 
promoting the giant worms wasnt easy local tourist offical 
judith nicholl admits of all things in the world how do you 
promote a worm she told a recent visitor it started out as a 
fun thing but now its very serious now when visitors arrive the 
first thing they ask is where is the worm 
visitors now flock to korumburra population 2800 the towns 
shops display fluffy toy worms and cute cutouts on windows colored 
pink because brown the worms natural color isnt attractive 
festivities climax with a 100foot fake worm resembling a 
chinese dragon that is hoisted and weaved through main street by 60 
or 70 children 
a nocturnal animal the worms are difficult to dig up and 
residents discourage the practice because the worms can break apart 
and bleed to death when yanked from the rich clay on which they 
thrive 
townsfolk proclaim the worm as the worlds largest although 
long worms are found elsewhere in the world 
despite their fame the local worms remain underground there is 
no worm museum in korumburra or even a display however 
entrepreneurs john matthews and tony zoanetti opened a worm 
attraction at bass 25 miles down the highway toward the phillip 
island penguin reserve a major tourist attraction 
there visitors enter a 300footlong building shaped like an 
earthworm and can walk through a section that simulates the 
internal view of the worms stomach complete with gurgling noises 
visitors also experience a worms eye view of its world below 
ground with a 3 entry fee for adults up to 1000 people visit 
the attraction daily

he said thursdays release in washington of us trade figures 
for february would have a greater effect on the movement of the

a couple who sought to adopt the baby of 
an unmarried navajo woman have agreed to give the girl back but vow 
to fight alongside the mother to regain custody of the child from 
tribal authorities 
despite the wishes of allyssa kristian pitts 21yearold mother 
and the couple that has cared for her since her birth july 20 a 
judge has ruled that the child must be turned over today to navajo 
authorities 
patricia keetso who gave up allyssa so that she could have a 
life away from the reservation in arizona says shell fight to get 
her back and return her to the wouldbe adoptive parents cheryl 
and rick pitts 
i love my baby and want her to get something out of life 
she said tearfully at the pitts home wednesday 
the pittses saying they are devastated by the prospect of 
losing the baby they love and helped bring into the world still 
hope to get her back but arent sure what will happen next 
keetso said her mother who was brought to california for the 
court hearings was threatened with prison if the baby were not 
returned 
theyve hassled my whole family said keetso who has eight 
brothers and sisters 
the navajo nations tribal department of justice citing the 
indian child welfare act filed a complaint in santa clara county 
superior court in february to gain jurisdiction of the case and 
stop the pittses adoption petition 
navajo officials said the adoption was illegal and demanded the 
baby be sent to the reservation 
after two hearings judge leslie nichols ordered the pittses to 
give up the child ruling that keetso was under tribal jurisdiction 
and legally resided on the arizona reservation she has visited only 
occasionally in recent years 
rather than appeal nichols ruling the pittses decided 
wednesday to drop their adoption petition and fight to return 
custody of allyssa to keetso eventually they hope to get allyssa 
back 
keetso and mrs pitts planned to accompany allyssa back to 
arizona and try to persuade navajo authorities to let them care for 
the baby who suffers from severe asthma 
keetso was pregnant when she met the pittses through an adoption 
attorneys advertisement 
the couple both 33 and parents of an 8yearold boy took 
keetso into their home they gave her 200 a month spending money 
paid medical costs coached her through labor and brought allyssa 
home 
keetso said the indian child welfare act was designed to protect 
children 
it was never supposed to do this to take a baby from its 
mother or interfere with a mothers decision about her child she 
said 
the welfare people dont really care about anyones feelings 
theyre treating my baby like an object they just want to take her 
to prove a point 
indian welfare officials in arizona declined to comment about 
the case violet ap lui the attorney handling the case at the 
tribal department of justice did not return several phone calls 
the pittses have been encouraged by dan and patricia carter of 
spanish fork utah who recently won a highly publicized 
sevenyear custody fight with navajo authorities over 10year 
michael halloway carter 
we spoke to them last night and they told us the only way we 
can win is to go public and tell our story to anyone wholl 
listen mrs pitts said 
i love my baby ive waited a long time for her the bond we 
have is very strong she said sometimes she wont go to 
anybody else she wakes up at night crying and doesnt want to let

scientists have found small residues of a 
potentially cancercausing animal drug in milk being sold in 10 
us cities according to an official of the food and drug 
administration 
the drug sulfamethazine is approved for use in pork and beef 
cattle feed but is not supposed to be used in dairy cattle feed 
the levels we were finding in milk should not cause a public 
health problem but we are concerned because this is an illegal use 
and that drug must not be used in dairy cattle gerald guest 
head of the agencys center for veterinary medicine said in a 
statement wednesday 
we have been meeting with the appropriate industry groups and 
they already have programs under way to communicate this concern to 
their respective industries guest said 
fda officials in early march bought and sampled pasteurized 
whole milk from five grocery stores in each of the 10 cities 
boston baltimore atlanta dallas chicago kansas city denver 
san francisco seattle and new york 
of the 49 samples 36 showed some sign of the drug fda 
spokesman chris lecos said of the 36 he added only five were 
above trace levels 
there is no reason for the public to be concerned about the 
safety of the milk lecos said the point is we dont want to 
find it sulfamethazine in milk at all

lawyers police officers and new york city 
officials are endorsing a bill that would give american citizens 
greater protection against crimes committed by foreign diplomats 
and dependents who are immune from arrest or prosecution 
the passage of this bill will send a clear message to those 
lawbreakers who know our hands have been tied by the present laws 
that they will no longer be able to wave a paper called diplomatic 
immunity and walk away scotfree said dennis ray martin deputy 
sheriff of saginaw county in michigan and president of the 
68000member american federation of police 
under an international agreement which was approved by the 
senate in 1965 and implemented in 1978 ambassadors and other 
diplomats and their family members enjoy complete immunity from 
criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits but various exceptions are 
made for lesser personnel 
the bill sponsored wednesday chiefly by rep stephen j solarz 
dny would put congress on record as favoring state department 
action to obtain waivers of diplomatic immunity or the forced 
departure of diplomats who are charged with serious crimes 
the state department said recently that it generally supports 
the draft legislation but objects to several provisions as 
unnecessary or potentially harmful to us relations with other

the university according to the newspaper 
officials at kentucky denied any wrongdoing i can promise you

his supervisor paul perry said he called over several 
employees as witnesses and counted out 1000 in 50 bills and then 
had the package sealed by security personnel 
claud mills acknowledged he received a videotape from casey on 
march 31 he said his son signed for the package and that when he 
got home he found the videotape but no cash in the opened packet 
i didnt receive no money from dwane casey claud mills 
said nobody from kentucky gave me no money they sent me a tape 
but i dont know nothing about no money 
claud mills said his son a twotime parade magazine 
allamerica picked the university of kentucky because of coach 
sutton and the style of play there 
claud mills said an ncaa investigator had questioned him earlier 
about a car he bought for his son he said he paid 6800 for the 
car a 1984 datsun 300zx with the proceeds of a lawsuit

a federal judge has refused one request to 
temporarily block legal action to close the palestine liberation 
organizations united nations observer mission 
but us district judge edmund palmieri has scheduled an april 
20 hearing on another request to block enforcement of the 1987 
antiterrorism act the law declared the plo and its affiliates a 
terrorist organization 
meanwhile lawyers for the plo are seeking to dismiss a federal 
lawsuit that would force the closing of the mission 
the governments lawsuit seeks a court order barring the plo 
zehdi labib terzi head of the observer mission and five other 
mission officials or employees from continuing to operate the 
mission or any other plo office in this country 
but plo counsel ramsey clark a former us attorney general 
said in papers filed monday at federal court that no us court has 
jurisdiction to issue such an order because it would violate 
international law as well as the treaty setting up un 
headquarters in new york 
the justice department has yet to file a response 
in a related matter palmieri refused on tuesday to grant a 
preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the antiterrorism 
act 
he ruled that a group of us citizens who say the act violates 
their first amendment rights had shown insufficient proof they 
would suffer undue hardship or irreparable harm unless an 
injunction were granted 
palmieri has scheduled a hearing for later this month on another 
aspect of the lawsuit riyad mansour a us citizen and no 2 
official at the plo mission said the law does not apply to him in 
his official capacity at the united nations or if it does it is 
unconstitutional

the mistrial granted to a murder defendant whose 
case was prosecuted in the wrong county has triggered debate on 
whether he should go free and on the ethics of his lawyer who 
knew about the error but kept mum 
all this guys got going for him is me public defender bob 
joiner said wednesday if ive got to help the prosecutor my 
god hed be better off without a lawyer 
stephen craig schiefelbein 38 was accused of fatally stabbing 
a man who invited him to dinner christmas eve 1986 at an atlanta 
home that purportedly straddles the line between fulton and dekalb 
counties 
the mistrial was granted april 6 the second day of his trial in 
fulton county superior court when a prosecutor learned that the 
house actually is in dekalb county and that joiner had known it all 
along 
joiner contends that his client should go free because a second 
prosecution this time in dekalb county would violate the 
constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy 
it would be a miscarriage of justice if he were able to escape 
because of a problem like that said steve roberts chief 
assistant district attorney in dekalb county where the state may 
press for a trial 
law officers in both counties assured prosecutors the house was 
in fulton county said assistant district attorney linda finley 
who learned the truth when she telephoned a witness after the first 
day of schiefelbeins trial 
ms finley said she was reviewing the next days testimony with 
the owner of the house when he informed me that his house was in 
fact about two houses over the line in dekalb county 
the next day joiner said he had known of the mixup and judge 
philip etheridge declared a mistrial telling joiner he had 
wasted a lot of time and did your client absolutely no service 
whatever 
joiner said wednesday it never even occurred to me to tell 
the judge earlier because ethics rules for lawyers require him to 
use any defense that is not frivolous 
joiner had an obligation not to say anything said geoffrey 
c hazard jr a yale law school professor of legal ethics and the 
main draftsman of the american bar associations model code of 
ethics 
the defendant in a criminal case is permitted to require the 
state to go to its proof on every possible issue and its the 
states responsibility to carry the burden in that respect 
hazard said the defendant did nothing to mislead the 
prosecution and i think joiner did the right thing 
university of georgia law professor l ray patterson said legal 
codes of ethics discourage disclosures of information by defense 
lawyers but conflict with a lawyers duties as an officer of the 
court 
frankly i sympathize with the lawyer said patterson a 
former dean of emory universitys law school the courts have not 
given good guidance on this theyve waffled on the issue 
joiner says federal courts have held that part of a criminal 
case is proving it is being brought in the right court so failure 
to prove that voids the entire prosecution another trial would be 
double jeopardy he said 
etheridge disagreed with that argument saying his court never 
really had jurisdiction over the case so anything we did would be 
a nullity 
roberts said the dekalb county prosecutors already have found 
legal precedents supporting a retrial but no decision will be made 
until the case file and the judges order are received from fulton 
county 
joiner also contends that there are factual issues in the case 
he said victim michael g hadden schiefelbein and others in the 
house had been drinking that no one thought haddens wound was 
serious enough to summon help and he might have died simply from a 
lack of medical attention 
schiefelbein also contends hadden was choking him he said

a pilot held five years in sandinista prisons said 
he was threatened with death and denied medical treatment as part 
of systematic psychological torture apparently directed by cuban 
intelligence agents 
roberto amador 42 shot down during a contra supply flight in 
1983 was one of the first prisoners freed as part of last months 
truce agreement between the nicaraguan resistance and the leftist 
sandinista government 
he arrived here saturday to join his wife and three children 
amador and other contra officials said at a news conference here 
wednesday they believe there are up to 12000 political prisoners 
inside nicaraguan jails despite government claims to the contrary 
amador said he had been threatened before leaving nicaragua and 
told not to talk to reporters 
they told me if you make declarations to the press in the 
united states we will put a bomb in your car in miami or anywhere 
else you go said amador they reminded him of the assassination 
of former nicaraguan dicator anastasio somoza in paraguay after he 
fled the sandinista revolution in 1979 
amador 42 said at least three of the seven crew members on his 
doomed 1983 flight died in sandinista hands even though all 
survived the crash of their plane which he said was flying 
medicine books and clothes to the rebels 
when they were captured some of the men were bound hand and 
foot and flown to el chipote prison in managua 
we expected death at any minute said amador they said 
they were going to kill us 
two crew members stayed behind and were never heard from again 
and he later found a third was officially reported dead 
at the prison where he was kept in solitary confinement for 1 
years amador was regularly seated for 12 to 16 hours in a chair 
while he was threatened and interrogated 
in the partially darkened room he said he could hear 
cubanaccented men speaking spanish and occasionally heard german 
which he believed was spoken by east german advisers two cuban 
exile contra sympathizers still in prison in nicaragua later told 
him they were being interrogated by cuban g2 intelligence agents 
he said 
he said he believes the cubans were teaching their techniques to 
the sandinistas 
they worked on the mind with constant death threats said 
amador they told me if i didnt talk they would get my family in 
the united states they would kill my children and they would kill 
me at one point they falsely claimed they were holding someone 
i loved the pilot said 
he said the guards held drills in which they would send soldiers 
to the door of each cell and point a sovietmade rifle at the 
prisoners 
they were waiting for an american invasion said amador 
they said as soon as the 82nd airborne division landed we 
would be eliminated 
amador said he was told his family the united states and the 
resistance had abandoned him 
the pilot suffered what he later found out was a crushed disc 
during his crash landing and was in constant pain which his 
interrogators used against him he said 
they would open the cabinet and show me the medicine for my 
pain he said then they would say are you going to talk 
he said he refused and was never given the painreliever doctors 
in the united states later said his jailers had unintentionally 
helped him by forcing him to sleep on the floor giving some relief 
to his back

a monthslong effort to recall mayor federico pena 
on grounds of mismanagement was rebuffed when a city official 
announced the number of signatures on petitions fell more than 
2000 short of the total needed 
the backers of the drive delivered 21 bundles of petitions to 
the denver election commission on wednesday beating a 5 pm 
deadline by several hours and expressing confidence there would be 
enough valid signatures to support a new mayoral election 
but late wednesday felicia muftic president of the election 
commission said only 36960 names were counted short of the 
minimum 39091 needed the validity of the signatures was not 
checked 
pena reacted with pleasure saying to those people who 
opposed the recall i thank you to those people who supported the 
recall i urge you to join with the city to help move the city 
forward these are critical times and we cannot afford to have any 
disunity 
critics however said the troubled city government will only be 
worse unless pena gets the message and starts running things in a 
little better way as city councilman paul swalm said 
if he doesnt why you know i just think the city is going to 
be in very bad shape in a year or two its already in bad shape 
now but itll be worse he said 
pena 41 one of the first hispanics to be mayor of a major us 
city was elected to his second term last june by 3000 votes in a 
hotly disputed contest that required a runoff of top contenders 
the recall drive was started by a group angered over what they 
claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the pena administration the 
group gathered supporters among a number of denver residents left 
stranded for several days by a major holiday snow storm 
maintenance crews plowed major traffic arteries leaving side 
streets filled with snow for several days at the time pena was 
vacationing outofstate 
the 39091 votes needed for the recall represented 25 percent of 
the voters in the last mayoral election said sam tarkington 
executive director of the election commission

the head of the kgb secret police blamed ethnic 
unrest that broke out in two southern republics and other areas of 
the soviet union on poor education and foreign secret services 
viktor chebrikovs speech on wednesday in the volga river city 
of cheboksary was his first public comment on ethnic tensions in 
the soviet union since rioting occurred in the azerbaijan republic 
on feb 28 
at least 32 people were killed in the rioting 26 of them ethnic 
armenians thousands of people began mass protests in neighboring 
armenia in midfebruary to demand that the nagornokarabakh region 
of azerbaijan be annexed to armenia 
threequarters of the regions residents are ethnic armenians 
who traditionally are christians azerbaijanis traditionally are 
moslems 
chebrikov did not mention azerbaijan and armenia but said 
antisocial actions of a nationalistic nature took place in a 
number of regions of this country according to a report issued 
by the tass news agency 
i believe that one of the major reasons for those antisocial 
actions is a serious negliect of the internationalist education of 
popular masses chebrikov was quoted as saying 
he also blamed wrong approaches to solving socialeconomic 
problems and said groundless notions about the problemfree 
development of relations between nationalities also played a part 
the latter was an apparent reference to the soviet unions 
claims in the past to have solved the problem of relations among 
nationalities 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said at a communist party 
central committee meeting in february that the problem is one of 
the countrys most serious and that the central committee will 
devote an upcoming meeting to it 
the soviet union a country of more than 100 ethnic groups 
tries to teach citizens to deemphasize nationalistic feelings in 
favor of what is termed a spirit of friendship and equality with 
other ethnic groups 
but ethnic groups often resent domination by russians and other 
slavs and agesold tensions exist among some of the ethnic groups 
chebrikov also said that foreign secret service organizations 
that he did not identify played a part in stirring up ethnic 
tensions it is an open secrety that secret services of 
imperalist powers and foreign antisoviet centers actively join 
extremist nationalistic actions he said 
later on they start playing the part of open instigators of 
hostile actions aimed at kindling hostility among nations 
chebrikov said 
one should not underestimate the danger of this method of 
subversive actions against this country however in my opinion 
the main attention should be concentrated on a timely solution of 
the emerging socioeconomic problems on the education in patriotic 
and internationalist spirit he said 
in a televised speech in september chebrikov accused the west 
of trying to undermine soviet economic reforms and sow discord 
among nationalities 
besides the tensions in armenia and azerbaijan there also has 
been an increase in nationalist activities in the baltic republics 
of lithuania latvia and estonia in kazakhstan and among crimean 
tatars who were deported from their homeland by stalin because of 
alleged cooperation with nazi invaders in world war ii

rush hour traffic came to a twominute 
standstill today as the wail of air raid sirens opened israels 
annual memorial day for the 6 million european jews slain by the 
nazis in world war ii 
the nations radio stations played melancholy tunes throughout 
the day restaurants and houses of entertainment were shut by law 
for 24 hours ending at sundown today 
more than 100 memorial ceremonies were scheduled throughout the 
country 
holocaust day officially called martyrs and heroes remembrance 
day is commemorated on the anniversary of the start of the warsaw 
ghetto uprising of 1943 when polish jews used pistols to fight 
nazis in tanks 
this year the commemoration comes amidst a fourmonth spate of 
antiisraeli violence in the occupied territories that has claimed 
the lives of 144 palestinians and two israelis 
the conflict played a prominent role in an emotional speech 
given by prime minister yitzhak shamir at a memorial ceremony at 
jerusalems yad vashem monument wednesday night 
we again face the phenomenon of eternal hatred for the eternal 
people when will the nations learn that they can never overcome 
us and decide to leave us alone shamir said 
even today when we dwell in our own land evilhearted and 
unfeeling people shoot poison arrows at our youngsters and they 
wander the countryside turning it into a valley of death he 
added 
his statement was seen as an allusion to the killing of a 
teenaged jewish settler during a clash in the west bank village of 
beita last week as well as other attacks against israelis in the 
occupied areas 
a foreign ministry official said israel would seek 
clarifications from poland today about reports a government 
spokesman in warsaw criticized israels tactics in the occupied 
territories and linked it to the holocaust 
the polish spokesman jerzy urban said on tuesday at a news 
conference that israels brutal behavior was an offense to 
the memory of the defenders of the warsaw ghetto 
despite the controversy 2000 israelis including teenagers 
two cabinet ministers and six legislators flew to warsaw this week 
for observances of the 45th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto 
revolt which took a month to crush 
although the generation of holocaust survivors has dwindled in 
numbers interest in the tragedy has been rekindled in young 
israelis in part because of the war crimes trial of retired ohio 
autoworker john demjanjuk which was televised nationwide judges 
are expected to issue a verdict next week 
demjanjuk is accused of operating the gas chambers at the 
treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland where 850000 jews 
perished he claims he is a victim of mistaken identity 
the renewed interest in the holocaust was dramatized by a 
wellattended concert wednesday night staged by two popular rock 
singers shlomo artzi and yehuda policker whose parents survived 
concentration camps 
polickers new album the stop for treblinka is about the 
trains used to ship jews to the death camps 
in an editorial al hamishmar daily wrote this years 
holocaust day distances us another year from those days of horror 
but does not weaken their memory

the rightwing nationalist 
republican alliance said it will appeal to the supreme court a 
decision denying its request for a recount of votes for a disputed 
assembly seat 
the central elections council on wednesday turned down the 
partys request for a new vote tally in eastern la union province 
the council said in a statement the demand was inappropriate 
the decision effectively denied the party known as arena a 
majority in the new legislative assembly 
arenas president alfredo cristiani said his party would 
appeal to the supreme court to reverse the council decision he 
said the panels ruling was no surprise 
it was difficult to hope for a response favorable to us when 
the accused is also the judge he said in a telephone interview 
arena contends its candidates won 31 of the 60 seats in the 
national assembly during nationwide elections march 20 
final election results announced last week by the council gave 
arena 30 seats the christian democratic party 23 and the national 
conciliation party seven the christian democrats had held a 
majority before the election 
arena claims the national conciliation party conspired with the 
christian democrats to commit fraud national conciliation party 
members have indicated they will align with the christian democrats 
to form a voting bloc in the assembly 
the results could produce a legislative deadlock during 
christian democratic president jose napoleon duartes final year in 
office 
the supreme court could delay ruling on arenas appeal for many 
months effectively putting an end to the dispute by inaction 
all parties have agreed the dispute will not prevent the 
installation of the new assembly may 1 with the composition 
announced by the council

a un health official who visited 
israels occupied territories said today that palestinians are 
suffering abdominal pain miscarriages and muscular weakness from 
tear gas israel is using against them 
dr john hiddlestone un relief and works agency director of 
health affairs said in a telephone interview that he saw 
palestinians experiencing symptoms which were not those usually 
associated with tear gas 
but he added im not actually accusing anybody of anything 
the agency said the gas was being used improperly the israeli 
army denied the charge 
agency spokesman ron wilkinson reported several cases in which 
tear gas had been thrown into closed areas houses schools and a 
clinic in israeliheld territory 
it says right on the canisters that it must not be used in a 
confined area so it the gas has particular toxic effects when it 
is thrown into a room he said 
one label says for outdoor use only contents may cause 
severe injury if not used in accordance with this warning 
instruction 
in the israelioccupied gaza strip agency spokeswoman christine 
debaigh said a 70yearold woman wadfah farraj allah was dead on 
arrival at jabaliyas un clinic on wednesday after troops hurled 
a tear gas canister into her home 
shifa hospital officials said mrs allah suffocated after 
inhaling the gas an army spokesman denied the account and said 
that results of an autopsy carried out by the governmentrun 
pathological institute in abu kabir showed the woman died of 
natural causes 
unrwa is providing shelter education and medical assistance to 
palestinian refugees living in the middle east 
i am a physician and my worry is that people are having other 
symptoms than normal tear gas symptoms hiddlestone said 
we need to know whats being used in the hope we can do more 
for these people because the abdominal pain is extremely severe of 
women who have been miscarrying and have had premature labor he 
said 
the doctor said he also met people suffering from great 
muscular weakness after exposure to gas used by the israelis 
he said those ailments occurred without eye nose or throat 
irritation so that even though you have tear gas which is in 
improper concentrations when its put into closed spaces the 
symptomatology of some people is not that which is normal as a 
result of tear gas 
an army spokesman said there is no truth to the report we are 
using a new type of toxic gas the purpose of tear gas is to limit 
casualties and to cause as little damage as possible by avoiding 
physical confrontation with the rioters 
he said tear gas could be lethal if inhaled by people already 
suffering from heart or other health problems or if used in a 
small enclosed space 
the army does not use tear gas in small enclosed spaces at 
least not on purpose said the spokesman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the bostonbased physicians for human rights has expressed 
concern that the israelis may be misusing tear gas 
the americanarab antidiscrimination committee a lobbying 
group contends that more than 30 people have died in israel and in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip from exposure to tear gas

fire raged out of control for eight hours along 
the baltimore waterfront shooting flames 100 feet into the air and 
filling the sky with thick black smoke three businesses were 
destroyed 
more than 200 firefighters battled the intense heat and flames 
of the sevenalarm blaze which was not brought under control until 
630 am today five firefighters suffered minor injuries 
the fire was discovered about 1030 pm wednesday at an 
automotive lubricant company and arson was suspected said fire 
department spokesman capt patrick flynn 
its a very hot fire flynn said during the night battle 
the solvents and motor oils added a lot of fuel to the fire the 
troubling thing about this you dont know whats going to happen 
next 
the fire threatened the vacant allied chemical plant but did 
not reach the building fire officials had been afraid the heat 
would trigger an explosion there 
the fire apparently began at autoline lubricants inc and sent 
55gallon drums of oil and lubricants rocketing into the sky it 
spread to atlantic mill and lumber co then engulfed lacy 
foundries 
it looked like the world was on fire said meg craft 36 
who was awakened when an explosion shook her home 
the area lies on a peninsula across the water from the inner 
harbor and a few blocks from the historic fells point area 
the flames soared 100 feet into the air and could be seen for 
several miles drawing fells point residents into the streets to 
watch dense black clouds of smoke hung over the area 
the fire went to seven alarms within a halfhour flynn said 
firefighters stood poised on hydraulic booms aiming their hoses 
down onto the blaze while others manned fireboats in the harbor 
autoline president edward peres 46 and executive vice 
president bob scott 45 watched somberly peres said the company 
had about 12 million in inventory 
autoline receptionist sally nowicki 33 was near tears its 
terrible its awful my heart just aches for them she said of 
peres and scott theyre watching everything they owned go up in 
smoke they worked so hard they dont deserve this

gettough criminal laws may satisfy public 
opinion but they are failing to cut crime rates and are forcing 
prison officials to cope with even more prison crowding a new 
study concludes 
the prison route the idea that we ought to send everybody to 
prison and keep them there just doesnt work said john austin 
of the national council on crime and delinquency 
in california for instance the number of inmates has tripled 
since 1977 and the crime rate has not dropped 1 percent he said 
wednesday 
the mandatory sentencing laws socalled gettough measures 
will play a key role in the projected 21 percent increase in the 
nations prison population by 1992 said austin director of 
research for the san franciscobased criminaljustice think tank 
the study based on the crime and incarceration rates for nine 
states projects a 30 percent increase in parolees over the same 
fiveyear period 
the nine states studied were california florida illinois 
louisiana nevada ohio oklahoma tennessee and virginia 
again using california as an example austin said its current 
inmate population of 69000 could almost double to 125000 within 
10 years 
im not saying its going to happen he said but it 
certainly could happen if we keep the current policies intact 
austin said the money for prisons is siphoning off funds that 
could be used for other human services medical education and 
welfare that eventually might make a dent in prison population 
growth 
the generation we need to be concerned about is not the one in 
prison right now but the kids who are 10 11 and 12 years 
austin said at a news conference 
the most immediate solution to crowding is earlyrelease 
programs for prisoners not in maximum security he said 
austin said the average prison term is two years and simply 
trimming three months from each would provide significant relief 
especially since studies have shown us that releasing these 
people early doesnt drive up the crime rate 
the new study also highlighted several problems correctional 
officials likely will face in the future including an aging inmate 
population requiring expensive medical services and an increasing 
number of black and hispanic males in prison

president mohammed zia ulhaq said 
today that sabotage caused an explosion at an ammunition dump that 
killed at least 96 people 
zia also denied that the weapons in the dump were intended for 
guerrillas fighting the government of neighboring afghanistan 
my personal assessment is that it couldnt be anything but a 
very effective way of sabotage zia told reporters at an informal 
briefing at the presidential place 
somebody who is not in line with us was responsible he 
said the president would not elaborate citing the ongoing 
investigation into sundays blast at the ammunition depot between 
islamabad and rawalpindi 
the latest death toll stands at 96 but officials said scores of 
people were still missing more than 1000 were reported injured by 
the explosion which send rockets flying into the cities 
zia said the depot was used only by the army of pakistan and 
that none of the weapons was destined for the afghan guerrillas 
who have headquarters in pakistan the guerrillas receive foreign 
military aid inlcuding us arms through pakistan 
eyewitnesses said that after the explosion and fire they saw 
burning trucks with afghan license plates near the dump 
moslem guerrillas have been at war with the afghan government 
for 10 years since a communist coup installed a government 
friendly to the soviet union

the mother of 7monthold twins conceived 
under contract has agreed to relinquish custody of the children to 
their father and avoid a court battle 
laurie and richard yates decided to let barry and glinda huber 
of jonesboro ark have permanent custody of the twins lawyer 
kathleen boyle who represented the hubers said 
it was probably the ultimate act of love on laurie yates 
part attorney robert macalpine who negotiated the settlement 
for the yateses said wednesday 
they realized that in their precarious financial condition 
they could never provide the kind of home for the twins that the 
hubers could he said both laurie and richard yates of ithaca 
are unemployed 
noel keane the dearborn attorney who arranged the contract that 
led to the twins birth said he believed the babies ended up 
where they should and where i think would be obviously in their 
best interest 
the hubers paid keane 10000 for matching them up with mrs 
yates and arranging for her to be inseminated with hubers sperm 
there was no payment to mrs yates boyle and macalpine said 
the custody agreement was approved late tuesday by circuit judge 
timothy green who voided the surrogate parenting contract last 
january calling it unenforceable and contrary to public policy 
a trial to determine which couple should be awarded custody was 
scheduled to begin next week 
under the agreement the birth certificates of the children 
born sept 4 1987 will be changed to give them the surname of 
huber boyle and macalpine said their first names will remain 
stephanie and anthony macalpine said 
the yates couples decision was influenced in part by reports of 
a psychologist and psychiatrist who both concluded the hubers were 
the better choice to raise the twins according to lisa vogler the 
yateses attorney 
briefs filed in the case showed that mrs yates once pleaded 
guilty to receiving stolen property and that her husband was twice 
convicted for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of 
alcohol 
in contrast the arkansas farm couple was portrayed as stable 
loving and hardworking with no history of criminal activity or 
drug or alcohol abuse 
mrs yates who filed her custody suit before the twins were 
born has actively supported a drive to outlaw commercial 
surrogacy appearing at news conferences testifying before 
legislative committees telling her story on television interview 
shows 
good housekeeping magazine paid 25000 to mrs yates legal 
defense fund for rights to her story 
under the terms of the court order part of that money will be 
used to reimburse the state for the cost of the twins delivery 
which was paid through the medicaid program

former white house political director lyn 
nofziger said today he felt a total lack of remorse as he 
continued to claim innocence despite his recent conviction for 
illegally lobbying his former government colleagues on behalf of 
the scandalridden wedtech corp and others 
you have to be guilty before you can feel remorse i do not 
think im guilty nofziger said in an interview on abctvs 
good morning america 
if you want me to go out and grovel in order to avoid this 
kind of a sentence im going to get the sentence said nofziger 
last week he was given a 90day prison sentence and fined 30000 
for three counts of illegally lobbying thenpresidential counselor 
edwin meese and other white house aides 
when he was sentenced nofziger charged that prosecutor james c 
mckay was out to get him because i would not cop a plea and 
because i would not say i was remorseful 
we were not allowed to plead that we had advice of counsel 
nofziger said today we did talk to lawyers 
nofziger 63 also repeated his criticism of the ethics statute 
saying we also find the law very vague we think its 
unconstitutionally vague it doesnt really tell you what you can 
do and what you cant do 
nofziger said he does think there should be some kind of ethics 
law applicable to former government employees but it should not 
interfere with constitutional rights the former white house aide 
charged that the current law tells you you cant do what the 
constitution tells you you can do 
nofziger was asked whether he thought president reagan has been 
hurt by the cases of former aides being accused and convicted of 
violating laws in connection with their service in his 
administration nofziger a longtime reagan friend said most of 
the people who have gotten in socalled trouble its been after 
they got out i dont know why anybody should blame the 
president for things that have happened to people after they left 
the white house

the environmental protection agency today 
declined to establish a new clean air standard to protect 
asthmatics from peak exposures to sulfur dioxide that might last 
only a few minutes 
those exposures might occur around sources that meet all current 
standards based on longer measurement times sources like 
coalburning power plants smelters and factory boilers 
a burst of emissions from a plant or even rare wind patterns 
might cause people living nearby to face high concentrations 
briefly 
environmentalists denounced the decision embodied in a draft 
affirmation of current standards 
there is a whole slew of evidence accumulated since 1980 
that many asthmatics are not being protected by current standards 
said david doniger of the natural resources defense council 
claiming that for this administration the wishes of the utility 
industry always come first 
bob yuhnke of the environmental defense fund said his 
organization would try to get a court to order a shortterm 
standard established 
at the edison electric institute the principal trade 
association for utilities spokeswoman susan roth said epas 
decision reflects a careful weighing of all the scientific 
evidence she said current standards reduced average sulfur 
dioxide concentrations by 37 percent between 1977 and 1986 the 
institute has said a stringent shortterm standard could be as 
costly as an acid rain control program perhaps 5 billion a year 
sulfur dioxide is the major raw material for acid rain but acid 
rain is not an issue in epas decision about groundlevel 
concentrations of sulfur dioxide 
according to epas announcement new studies have found 
measurable changes in respiratory function and symptomatic 
effects shortness of breath wheezing coughing in asthmatics 
exposed for short periods five to 10 minutes up to one hour to 
04 parts per million of sulfur dioxide or more 
but it said these response occurred predominantly in subjects 
who were exercising and not using preventive medication at the 
time 
it added that the effects appear to be transient and 
reversible and at lower concentrations are similar to those most 
asthmatics typically experience from exercise or other stimuli for 
example cold air 
these effects are not like an asthma attack and asthmatics 
on medication will likely not experience a response to a 
shortterm peak the agency said 
doniger said i dont know of any responsible group of 
scientists that takes that position the agency argument is just 
because there are other things that make asthmatics ill its ok 
for power plants to make asthmatics ill 
only about 1 percent of the national population of asthmatics 
estimated by the american lung association as 30 million people 
would be exposed to shortterm peaks epa said

nation of islam leader louis farrakhan urged 
cheering students at the university of pennsylvania to support 
jesse jackson for president outside other students protested 
farrakhans oncampus lecture 
jackson is running to save a people he is running to save the 
nation said farrakhan who endorsed the chicago minister four 
years ago and campaigned with him farrakhan has not been involved 
in the 1988 jackson campaign 
i dont care if he jackson rejects me said farrakhan who 
told reporters at an earlier news conference wednesday the 
democratic contender does not want my help nor needs my 
support 
america is growing up to respect men of wisdom in black 
skins farrakhan told the mixed black and white crowd of 2000 
most of whom stood and applauded you should thank god jesse 
jackson has emerged 
jackson accepted farrakhans endorsement in 1984 and refused to 
denounce some of farrakhans antiwhite antijewish statements 
farrakhan was quoted as praising adolf hitler and calling judaism a 
gutter religion 
the counterdemonstration on the sidewalks outside penns irvine 
auditorium attracted a crowd which police estimated at 1000 but 
which university leaders said was no more than 400 
it preceded a memorial service held nearby commemorating the 
holocaust in which 6 million jews were exterminated during world 
war ii by hitlers nazis 
at the antifarrakhan rally speakers denounced the muslim 
leader for what they said was his antisemitic antiwhite rhetoric 
and called on students to denounce the remarks 
students held signs saying unity yes antisemitism no 
and free speech yes hatred no 
no matter what farrahkan says it doesnt erase what he said 
in the past said daniel gemulka the rally organizer and 
chairman of the council of jewish students we must work together 
as a community instead of being at odds 
last week university officials refused a jewish groups request 
to cancel the visit saying they respected farrakhans right to 
free speech a letter condemning farrakhan and signed by more than 
700 students and teachers appeared in the student paper wednesday 
university president sheldon hackney defended the farrakhan 
visit insisting that in an academic community open expression 
is the most fundamental value we cant have free speech just some 
of the time for some of the people 
farrakhan spoke for more than two hours he called america a 
racist white society he claimed the rev martin luther king jr 
was assassinated with the express consent of the us 
government 
how can i ask black people to fight for this country that 
dont give a damn for us he asked cheers roared from a crowd of 
2000 who had to pass through electronic metal detectors to enter 
the auditorium the university spent about 6000 in additional 
security for the lecture 
he predicted that in less than 100 years blacks will equal the 
number of whites in america and we wont have to ask will there 
be a black in the white house 
he also denied he was an antisemite had denigrated judaism or 
had boasted about the greatness of hitler despite his negative 
comments about jews in the past and during the speech 
it was these charges he said that jews are repeating in new 
york which will hold a presidential primary next week 
they are using me in new york to try to derail jackson 
farrakhan said 
farrakhan was paid 10000 plus travel expenses by the two 
groups sponsoring the appearance the organization of black 
consciousness and the predominantly white penn political union

troops since an arab uprising was launched last december 
most of the 110000 palestinians with jobs in israel didnt show 
up for work arab shopowners closed their doors in the cities of

fatah branch that had provided community services for 6000 
residents and created a system of guards israel television said

business inventories rose a slight 01 percent 
in february much slower than the pace in recent months the 
government said today 
the commerce department said the gain in inventories pushed them 
up by 825 million during february to a seasonally adjusted 7159 
billion the inventory gan came as total business sales were 
climbing 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted 4683 billion in 
february reversing a 05 percent decline in january 
the february gain in inventories held on shelves and backlots 
followed a 07 percent gain in january the february rise was held 
back by a 11 percent fall in inventories held by retailers 
this decrease reflected primarily a 52 percent drop in the 
backlog of unsold cars 
analysts had worried that the rise in unsold inventories late in 
1987 and in january would force production cutbacks and weak 
economic growth in the early part of 1988 
but recently economists have modified their views contending 
that the slowdown in growth in the early part of this year will not 
be as severe as they had first feared 
the 11 percent decline in inventories held at the retail level 
was accompanied by increases of 09 percent in inventories held at 
the wholesale level and 05 percent in inventories held by 
manufacturers 
the 06 percent overall sales rise was led by a 12 percent 
increase in wholesale sales in february a 06 percent rise in 
sales by retailers and a 01 percent rise in sales by manufacturers 
in an advance report on wednesday the government said retail 
sales increased 08 percent in march 
the combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories 
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 154 in january to 
153 in february that means it would take 153 months to exhaust 
inventories at the february sales pace that ratio is not 
considered abnormally high

president mohammed zia ulhaq said 
today that he foresees more bloodshed in afghanistan because an 
accord to end soviet military involvement there does not address 
the issue of a new afghan government 
zia said that as long as the kabul government remains in power 
and the guerrillas fight to overthrow it the war will continue and 
an estimated 5 million afghan refugees will not be able to return 
home safely 
i see trouble and turmoil in afghanistan through the 
insurgency through the mujahedeen trying to achieve their 
objective to overthrow this regime and establish their own 
authority and that will mean more loss of life zia told 
reporters at an informal news briefing 
that will mean insurgency in afghanistan will not stop unless 
the afghan mujahedeen have achieved their end 
when asked why pakistan agreed to sign the accord in geneva 
today zia cited the provision calling for the withdrawal of soviet 
troops backing the kabul government pakistan which borders 
afghanistan and hosts about 3 million of the 5 million afghan 
refugees represented the rebels in the talks 
he said the withdrawal made the task of the mujahedeen less 
strenuous implying that it would be easier for the guerrillas to 
overthrow the communist regime 
once theyre soviets withdrawn the logical conclusion 
is that it will be a little difficult for the present regime to 
stand for a longer period zia said 
the accord signed in geneva does not guarantee the end of the 
10yearold war in afghanistan but it calls for the estimated 
115000 soviet troops to begin leaving the country by may 15 
it does not address the issue of an interim government to 
replace the one in power now the guerrillas have said they will 
continue fighting until the government is deposed 
in addition to pakistan the united states soviet union and 
afghanistan signed the agreement 
the civil war began 10 years ago after a communist coup 
installed a government friendly to the soviet union red army 
troops intervened in december 1979

a fierce northeaster pounded the midatlantic coast with heavy 
rains winds near hurricane strength and waves that covered 
highways toppled at least two houses into the sea and threatened 
the only bridge to hatteras island 
the storm bore down hardest on north carolina where whipped sea 
foam covered beaches like a blanket of snow winds gusted up to 70 
mph and waves crested at nearly 25 feet off cape hatteras no 
serious injuries were reported 
forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would linger off 
the coast meteorologist harry gordon at the national weather 
services severe storms forecast center in kansas city mo said 
today 
in sandbridge va dick schumacher said his 200000 oceanfront 
home tumbled into the surf and officials said about 20 other homes 
were threatened by high water and pounding surf 
my house is in the ocean its finished schumacher said 
wednesday night im heartsick 
about 5000 people mostly in virginia beach temporarily lost 
electricity in the storm which also tore up roads and washed out 
trees road signs and utility poles and toppled portions of at 
least four houses tides rose to their highest level in six years 
officials said 
by this morning the storm was far enough off the coast for 
winds to die down and residents began cleaning up the tons of 
debris from their scoured beaches 
the northeaster which takes its name from the prevailing wind 
direction during the storm pushes tides to abnormal heights 
eroding beaches and turning storm drains into geysers 
the wind literally forces the water up against the coast 
said terry ritter meteorologist in charge of the norfolk office of 
the national weather service 
flood warnings also were issued for the delaware and maryland 
coasts 
in ocean city md police reported minor flooding police 
spokesman jay hancock said the water was very high and it was 
difficult to say how much beach has eroded until the water goes 
down no beachfront properties were damaged however 
at least one cottage in north carolina fell into the ocean and 
state highway 12 was closed late wednesday stranding some outer 
banks residents in the town of manteo overnight said tc 
mckimmey of the dare county sheriffs department 
the cottage already had suffered severe erosion and had been 
leaning last spring but the storm took the final toll mckimmey 
said several other houses also were threatened by waters that 
rolled over the beach road in nags head 
heavy surf washed away about 100 feet of sand from the south 
side of oregon inlet threatening to damage the approach to the 
herbert c bonner bridge that leads to hatteras island about 20 
miles off the north carolina coast 
further erosion could wash away much of the sand from south 
point exposing the bridge and approach to direct waves highway 
officials said 
that point is the protection for our south bridge abutment 
state highway administrator george wells said the ocean is 
eating away rapidly at that point 
aides said gov jim martin planned to fly to the coast today 
with highway officials to survey the damage 
at carolina beach nc heavy rain and wind caused erosion 
almost as fast as a dredge pumped sand in a 14 million beach 
replenishment project 
were losing sand fast due to this inclement weather town 
manager david serrell said it happened almost overnight but 
theres nothing you can do about it i dont know how much is being 
lost in dollar figures 
in virginia the downtown tunnel between norfolk and portsmouth 
was closed for three hours wednesday as water in the tube rose as 
high as 7 inches the flooding was caused by water that poured into 
an electrical junction box left uncapped by construction workers 
state transportation department spokesman john hanke said 
it was a combination of freak occurrences that will never 
happen again in a million years hanke said

a terrorism task force is investigating 
a japanese national arrested on the new jersey turnpike with three 
homemade bombs each powerful enough to destroy a building 
authorities said 
the suspect was identified by tokyo police today as yu kikumura 
35 a former bookstore owner who was extradited to japan by the 
netherlands two years ago on charges of illegal possession of 
explosives 
in tokyo acting foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi 
said the national police agency has a strong suspicion that he 
kikumura might have a relationship with the japan red army a 
terrorist group that gained notoriety for a series of attacks 
abroad in the 1970s 
however japanese police havent made a final conclusion that 
he is a member of the red army haraguchi told a news conference 
kyodo news service in tokyo said kikumuras arrest had raised 
suspicions the red army might be planning attacks during the summit 
of leaders of advanced industrial nations june 19 in toronto 
canada 
the task force was formed by state police and fbi agents in 
response to concerns about the sophistication of the bombs found in 
the suspects car and inquiries from overseas state police 
superintendent clinton pagano said at a news conference wednesday 
the material was loaded and charged and ready to use pagano 
said it was intended to injure people 
kikumura was arrested tuesday at a turnpike rest stop after a 
state trooper noticed him acting oddly stopped his car and found 
explosive devices and three homemade bombs resembling fire 
extinguishers in his car 
the suspect was carrying a stolen japanese passport and 
international drivers license the man named on the passport and 
license masatoshi kishizono had reported his passport was 
missing pagano said 
kikumura was charged with possession of explosive devices and 
possession of explosives state police experts who defused the 
bombs say each of the devices contained enough power to destroy a 
building 
a bail hearing was scheduled this afternoon in superior court 
for the suspect who was being held at the bergen county jail 
pagano and john c mcginley special agent in charge of the 
fbis newark office told the news conference they would not 
speculate on where the suspect was headed or what he planned to do 
with the bombs 
during a hearing wednesday bergen county assistant prosecutor 
paula dumas told judge charles r digisi that authorities were 
unable to identify the suspect 
the address he had given us immigration officials upon 
entering the country may 8 1987 turned out to be that of an 
unoccupied new york city apartment police said 
also the man had indicated he did not understand questions 
posed in english although he had spoken in clear english to the 
trooper who arrested him ms dumas said 
japanese police said kikumura a dropout of tokyo university of 
foreign studies was deported to tokyo by the netherlands in august 
1986 three months after police at a local airport found 22 pounds 
of dynamite in his luggage 
he was acquitted of the dutch charges in a japanese court later 
in 1986 and dropped out of sight police said 
the japanese police spokesman refused comment on news reports 
that authorities believed kikumura established links to the red 
army a japanese terrorist group in 1974 when he ran a bookshop in 
athens greece 
the red army was a radical splinter faction of the leftist 
general federation of japanese students which claimed support from 
850000 of the nations 13 million college students in the 1960s 
after gaining notoriety from a series of terrorist activities 
abroad in the 1970s including the attack on israels bengurion 
international airport in which 28 people were killed the red army 
has been relatively silent in recent years

director dennis hopper defended his new film 
colors a gritty streetgang drama as a story told from a 
police viewpoint while a downtown theater scratched the movie for 
fear it would spark violence 
the film scheduled for release friday used active los angeles 
gang members as extras and advisers as well as the actual 
identifying colors of blue for the crips and red for the bloods 
gangs 
colors has drawn criticism from police city officials and 
community leaders who claim it glorifies the violent youth gangs 
that have been plaguing the city 
outside a private celebrity screening wednesday night 10 
guardian angels chanted dont show colors while hopper 
defended the film starring sean penn and robert duvall as 
gangfighting police officers 
the guardian angels claims that colors glamorizes the 
streetgang lifestyle and wants distribution of the film halted or 
some of its proceeds donated to community organizations that combat 
gang violence 
there is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a 
gang hopper said adding that the film is told from a police 
viewpoint i dont know how people can twist it around and say 
im glorifying gangs 
at the celebrity screening the movies producer robert h 
solo called the protests misguided 
i think the people who are making those predictions are 
whipping up the probability and the possibility of violence the 
producer said the people who are saying blood is going to flow 
in the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets i think 
its very irresponsible behavior 
attending the vip screening were best actress oscarwinner cher 
and last years winner marlee matlin richard dean anderson of 
abctvs mcgyver u2s bono hewson and actordirector emilio 
estevez 
the downtown laemmle grand adjoining the posh sheraton grand 
hotel decided not to show the film because its staff feared a 
reaction from nearby gangs 
the staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf 
of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from 
downtown said bob laemmle coowner of the theater chain 
about 70 theaters in the los angeles area plan to show the movie 
the beverly hillshollywood chapter of the national assocition 
for the advancement of colored people joined police and city 
leaders who objected to the film premiering in los angeles during a 
period of heightened public concern about gang violence

nasa gave a bad newsgood news report to 
congress today on the impact of money cutbacks for building a us 
space station completion will be delayed one year but a robot 
laboratory on the station will be in operation earlier than planned 
the realities of the federal budget environment are clear 
james c fletcher administrator of the national aeronautics and 
space administration wrote to the chairmen of the house and senate 
committees that oversee the space agency 
nasa had asked for 767 million for the space station in the 
current fiscal year but received 425 million the agency wanted 
18 billion in the year that begins next oct 1 but the 
presidents budget proposal would give it 1 billion 
in letters to rep edward p boland dmass and sen william 
proxmire rwis fletcher said that left the agency three options 
cutting down on the station changing the way the program is 
managed or stretching out the time to build the station 
fletcher said the third approach is the only sensible way 
since more than four years and 600 million already have gone into 
planning the station configuration and because the program 
management is solid and is producing results 
under the schedule he outlined the first flight ferrying 
building materials for the station into space will be early in 
1995 a year later than planned it would be completed in late 1996 
the fourth flight rather than the sixth will carry aloft a 
laboratory that can be mantended visited and serviced 
periodically by astronauts 
this approach basically involves a reordering of the assembly 
sequence leading towards this nations goal in the mid1990s a 
permanent presence in space fletcher wrote 
originally the plans had been to have the station up and 
running in 1992 the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of 
america 
fletcher said the new assembly sequence delays the bulk of 
attached sicence payloads until later in the construction sequence 
it will take 16 flights to have the full station in operation and 
11 flights before crews can be housed on the station

the united states and the soviet union today 
signed an accord to end moscows intervention in afghnistan and 
allow the red army to start pulling out its 115000 troops on may 
15 
afghanistan and pakistan also signed the agreement in a solemnm 
10minute ceremony in a marble and gold council chamber at un 
headquarters pakistan was representing the afghan guerrillas who 
have vowed to continue their war to oust the marxist government in 
kabul 
secretary of state george p shultz who signed for the united 
states said the agreement would allow the people of afghanistan to 
determine their own future and to restore the independence they 
have earned through blood and sacrifice foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze signed for the soviet union 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of the united nations 
said the unmediated agreements represent a major stride in the 
effort to bring peace to afghanistan 
also signing the accord were foreign minister abdul wakil of 
afghanistan and acting foreign minister zain noorani of pakistan 
shultz said the united states will continue to aid the afghan 
guerrillas until the soviets stop arming the afghan government but 
he also said the agreement will improve the atmosphere of 
ussoviet relations and could help end soviet intervention in 
other regional conflicts 
the settlement followed six years of onagain offagain 
negotiations between afghanistan and pakistan which neighbors 
afghanistan and is home to an estimated 3 million afghan refugees 
the moslem insurgents fighting the marxist afghan government for 
10 years have headquarters in pakistan pakistan also serves as the 
conduit for foreign military aid to the guerrillas 
perez de cuellar opened the 10minute ceremony by thanking 
afghanistan and pakistan for their tireless efforts he thanked 
the united states which supports the guerrillas and the soviet 
union which backs the government for agreeing to guarantee the 
accord 
aides carried the leatherbound documents from one minister to 
the next for signing copies go to each country and the united 
nations 
the agreement commits pakistan and afghanistan to not support 
directly or indirectly rebellious or secessionist activities 
against each other and it provides from the withdrawal of soviet 
troops who entered afghanistan in 1979 to help the government 
shultz said he was confident the soviet union would begin its 
troop withdrawal on schedule may 15 
but in pakistan president mohammed zia ulhaq said today he 
foresees continued turmoil in afghanistan because the agreement 
doesnt address the issue of a new government to replace the one 
headed by president najib 
there is no provision in accord to end the war and it says 
nothing about the composition of future afghan governments 
pakistan said it would continue to withhold recognition of the 
kabul government pending formation of a new one in a letter to 
diego cordovez the un mediator in the talks noorani said that 
in view of the realities of the situation in afghanistan and 
notwithstanding the accords signed today pakistan will continue 
to withhold extending recognition to the regime in kabul 
the afghan guerrillas have said they will continue their war 
until the government is deposed no guerrilla leaders attended the 
signing ceremony 
shultz and perez de cuellar stressed that the accord will let 
the afghan people determine their fate 
the challenge facing the afghan people is great but it can 
and must be met by them alone the secretarygeneral said 
through their blood and sacrifice the afghans have earned the 
opportunity to resume their independence shultz said let us 
help them realize it 
the united nations estimates 15 million afghans have been 
killed in the war which began after an april 1978 communist coup 
more than 10000 soviets have died in the fighting western sources 
estimate 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told american business 
leaders in moscow on wednesday that the accord may have 
international implications on a par with the superpower treaty 
signed in december to ban mediumrange nuclear missiles 
the afghan agreement provides for withdrawal of all soviet 
troops pledges by pakistan and afghanistan of noninterference in 
each others affairs and the safe return of about 5 million 
refugees from pakistan and iran moscow and washington will 
guarantee afghanistans future nonalignment and the united nations 
will supervise the settlement including the return of refugees 
cordovez will continue promoting an intraafghan settlement by 
shuttling between the fighters and the government in kabul 
another point left out of the accord is military aid 
an informal understanding has been reported between the soviet 
union and united states diplomatic sources say each superpower 
will phase out such aid while reserving the right to resume it if 
the other side does

april in paris is supposed to smell of blossoms and 
perfume but for residents in some neighborhoods it reeked of 
rotten eggs 
fire department officials said thursday that for the second time 
in a week they had received telephone calls inquiring into the 
source of the unpleasant odor that greeted them when they woke up 
wednesday 
officials said they did not know where the smell was coming 
from but that it posed no health hazard 
the stench permeated three southern paris neighborhoods and 
suburban areas 
people start to worry when they leave their own neighborhoods 
and find the same awful smell in other parts of the city said 
the official who declined to be identified in keeping with 
departmental policy 
the spokesman said the fire department had received about a 
dozen complaints he said pollution levels were normal and that 
there was no evidence a toxic substance had leaked over the city 
no industrial facilities warned of spills he said 
the smells could not be identified he said because smells 
are very subjective and different people smelled different things

crop yields in the soviet ukraine have increased 
despite the chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago tass reported 
thursday 
the official news agency said the april 26 1986 disaster 
caused no irreparable damage to the regions agriculture 
chernobyl is about 80 miles north of the ukrainian capital of kiev 
in the seven months after a blast and fire split open one of 
chernobyls reactors 31 people died thousands were exposed to 
dangerous levels of radiation 
there were concerns that the agriculture of the ukraine 
traditionally one of the breadbasket regions of the soviet union 
might suffer from the release of radiation 
tass quoted alexei denisenko deputy chairman of the state 
agroindustrial committee of the ukraine as saying all farm 
products within the chernobyl area are checked for radiation and 
pronounced safe before they are sold 
he said grain yields per hectare in the kiev region which 
includes chernobyl were up by 31 percent in 1987 as compared with 
the previous year such increases are not believed linked to 
mutations in plants that might be caused by radiation he said 
crop rises are attributed only to introduction of intensive 
technologies of cultivation as well as to intrduction of contract 
forms of labor organization denisenko told tass 
denisenko said the type of crops grown at some farms were 
switched on the recommendation of scientists for instance farms 
which had been growing vegetables now are planted in grain and 
potatoes which do not accumulate radioactive decay products tass

the rev jerry falwell whose moral majority 
helped elect president reagan in 1980 said today he does not 
believe the american people are ready to put religious leaders such 
as jesse jackson and pat robertson in the white house 
falwell speaking to nearly 700 newspaper editors also said the 
sexandmoney scandals that have toppled jimmy swaggart and jim and 
tammy bakker from their ministries signaled the end of celebrity 
status for televangelists 
there will never again and i thank god its true be a person 
that people look up to as god falwell said celebrity status 
is history 
asked about jacksons bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination falwell said i have no problem with reverend jackson 
running as long as he loses 
i dont think the american people want a reverend it has 
nothing to do with democrat republican black white liberal 
conservative i dont think the american people are ready for a 
reverend to be in the white house and i think its a pretty good 
idea one never is 
falwell participating in a panel discussion on the second day 
of the threeday american society of newspaper editors convention 
said he was heartened by a decision by a television committee 
within the national religious broadcasters to punish swaggart 
the committee members are recommending to all christian 
stations in america that are members of the national religious 
broadcasters to drop jimmy swaggarts program if in fact he 
does not comply with the oneyear required penalty placed upon him 
stations do not have to comply but my guess is most of them 
will 
earlier today house speaker jim wright dtexas urged the 
editors to support him in his battle to get a comprehensive trade 
bill passed by congress 
you hold the key to developing a thoughtful commentary on 
events wright said later adding i challenge you to report 
the bill in some depths 
in a session late wednesday bigcity mayors gave generally good 
grades to newspapers for coverage of the plight of the urban poor 
but said the media misunderstand the rise of blacks political 
power and often fail to put a citys problems into a national 
context 
detroit mayor coleman young said he has been pleased that the 
number of black reporters covering city hall has increased in 
recent years while philadelphia mayor w wilson goode noted the 
new prominence given to black columnists 
but goode said he was concerned that some newspapers are not 
adequately covering the growth of black political power in cities 
maybe some newspapers even resent it he said 
goode said he also believes the local media tend to report 
problems such as homelessness and inadequate housing from a local 
context rather than explaining that cities across the country are 
facing similar troubles 
san antonio texas mayor henry cisneros faulted the media for 
failing to report more on the problems of the underclass 
these issues are not minority issues cisneros said these 
are americas issues 
former new york mayor john lindsay said blacks and other 
minorities have made major strides in the 20 years since a national 
commission warned that america is moving toward two societies 
one black one white 
but lindsay said there are still miles to go 
lindsay criticized the reagan administation for doing nothing to 
erase the economic differences between blacks and whites and 
concluded we probably have a worse problem now in relations 
between whites and blacks 
the discussion of coverage of urban affairs followed a session 
earlier wednesday in which arnold rosenfeld editor of the austin 
texas americanstatesman delivered an asne report on minority 
employment on newspaper staffs a survey of 67 percent of the 
nations 1630 daily newspapers showed a slow growth in the past 
year in employment of blacks hispanics asians and american 
indians from 656 percent to 702 percent 
obviously much needs to be done rosenfeld said 
linda grist cunningham editor of the trenton nj times 
reported on a survey of journalists that found the people who 
gather and process the news today are predominantly white and male 
but women and minorities are gaining in numbers

an escaped murderer who had vowed revenge 
on the people who helped imprison him was recaptured today a 
weekandahalf after he and two other killers fled the west 
virginia state penitentiary 
meanwhile deputies in marshall county wva were chasing one 
of the other two escapees who ran away when police checked his 
identification at a routine traffic stop this morning 
robert dean stacy 35 was arrested this morning at the 
apartment of a friend where he was hiding in a closet the fbi 
said

questioning the fbi said 
stacy had been convicted of killing a huntington wva police 
officer and accused of shooting a huber heights officer and had 
vowed revenge on those who had helped convict him officials said 
police had assigned protection to the judge and prosecutor in 
his case and a columbus woman who testified against stacy 
a federal court magistrate ordered stacy returned to west 
virginia to face a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution 
a charge that stems from the april 3 escape of the three men from 
the 122yearold penitentiary 
in marshall county wva today tommie mollohan 45 one of 
the other two men who escaped with stacy ran away after deputies 
pulled him over 
mollohan said marshall county sheriffs dispatcher lynell 
kearans gave deputies his correct last name social security 
number and date of birth but added a fictitious first name he 
fled when the deputy radioed headquarters for confirmation of the 
information she said 
he ran down over the hill and were in the process of a 
manhunt right now ms kearans said authorities found a shotgun 
and shells in the car as well as 22caliber ammunition with no 
corresponding weapon and said they assume mollohan is armed 
mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a grocer in 
1973 at the time mollohan had escaped from a florida prison and 
also was wanted in georgia and north carolina on armed robbery 
charges 
the third escapee is david williams 28 he was convicted of 
felony murder arson and robbery in the december 1980 slaying of a 
marytown wva resident who was found bludgeoned in the rubble of 
his burned home 
all three men were serving life terms numerous sightings of the 
escapees have been reported since the three used stolen bolt 
cutters to escape from the prison at moundsville wva

secretary of state george p shultz on thursday 
pledged continued supplies of us arms to moslem guerrillas 
fighting the communist government in afghanistan after he signed 
the accord on the withdrawal of soviet troops 
after eight years and four months of american pleas with the 
kremlin to pull its soldiers out of afghanistan shultz and foreign 
minster eduard a shevardnadze put their signatures on an accord 
requiring soviet withdrawal by feb 15 1989 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 now are there helping fight the moslem insurgency 
the secretary acknowledged that afghanistans future remains 
cloudy although the red army is leaving he said the superpowers 
will continue arming the factions and more work by the united 
nations will be needed to establish an independent government and 
bring home the estimated 5 million afghan refugees 
i dont think anyone knows how that will take place he told 
a news conference but added history has been made today 
un mediator diego cordovez negotiated the agreement signed 
thursday by afghanistan and pakistan and by the united states and 
soviet union as guarantors 
shultz told reporters for over eight years the afghan people 
have suffered a brutal war that has brought unmeasurable death 
dislocation and destruction 
the world community has long sought to remove the cause of 
this agony the soviet military of afghanistan this effort has 
succeeded and the soviet union is now committed to firm dates to 
comment and complete the withdrawal of its forces 
half the soviet forces are to withdraw within 90 days beginning 
may 15 and afghanistan and pakistan pledge not to interfere in 
each others affairs about 35 million afghan refugees live in 
pakistan most in border camps and cities that serve as bases and 
supply points for the guerrillas 
shultz said the pledge by pakistan through which hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of us military aid has flowed does not 
prevent the united states from continuing to arm the insurgents 
he said the united states does not recognize the afghan 
government and we have made clear to soviet leaders that 
consistent with our obligations as guarantor it is our right to 
provide military aid to the resistance 
at the same time the secretary added we are ready to 
exercise that right but we are prepared to meet restraint with 
restraint 
through their blood and sacrifice the afghans have earned the 
opportunity to resume their independence he said before signing 
the accord 
after soviet troops entered afghanistan president jimmy carter 
retaliated with economic sanctions against the soviets including a 
grain embargo and kept the us team out of the 1980 olympics in 
moscow 
president reagans administration softened the sanctions but 
reagan and his aides continued berating the soviets at 
international conferences including three summits with mikhail s 
gorbachev 
shultz said soviet withdrawal from afghanistan will remove a 
major burden to sovietamerican relations 
the faithful implementation of the withdrawal commitments 
embodied in the accords signed today will do much to improve the 
atmosphere for our bilateral relations and for the resolution of 
other regional conflicts he said 
the settlement demonstrates that a major power cannot impose 
its will by force of arms on even the smallest country when its 
citizens are united in their resistance shultz declared

the us trade deficit widened dramatically in 
february to 138 billion its biggest shortfall since october and 
the second straight jump the government said today 
prices of stocks and the value of the dollar fell almost 
immediately in reaction to the announcement that the gap between 
imports and exports rose 14 billion from januarys 124 billion 
imbalance 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell nearly 45 
points in the first few minutes of market activity but regained 
about 8 points of that loss through the first 90 minutes of trading 
the federal reserve bank and central banks in europe intervened 
in the foreign exchange markets buying dollars in large volumes 
after the currency lost 2 percent of it value against the japanese 
yen and the german mark almost immediately after the announcement 
analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the february 
deficit would shrink slightly 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented the overall 
report is discouraging in the sense that it went up instead of 
down however he said the average trade deficit for january and 
february is 12 billion less than for the fourth quarter of 1987 
the trade figures released this morning should be seen in 
context as we have said before too much emphasis should not be 
placed on any one months figures treasury secretary james a 
baker iii told reporters 
weve stumbled here a little bit said jay goldlinger an 
analyst for capital insight an economic consulting firm based in 
los angles it reminds us that we have a major major problem 
for the first two months of 1988 the deficit is running at an 
annual rate of 1576 billion below the record 1712 billion of 
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of 1562 
billion in 1986 the commerce department said 
imports of foreign manufactured goods oil and farm products 
increased by 23 billion in february leading the surge were 
imports of electrical equipment from abroad up 323 million and 
auto and truck parts up 298 million 
us exports also rose but by a smaller 13 billion from 
january 
commerce secretary c william verity who is in moscow said in 
a statement released by his office here that the february figures 
were disappointing despite what he called an underlying favorable 
trend 
the figures show a substantial improvement from the average 
15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987 
verity said we look forward to continued exportled growth 
analysts had anticipated an improvement in the trade balance in 
february because of the normally slack winter demand for imported 
goods lower oil prices0and the fact that the month is the shorvest 
of the yally is too early to tell howard said underwater 
explosion is the way to describe it we dont know what caused the 
explosion all weve got is an underwater explosion at this point 
howard said the roberts was steaming in the area after 
completing an escort operation wednesday night the spokesman said 
he assumed there were no other us vessels in close proximity 
but couldnt say for sure 
they say the flooding is under control and theyre pumping the 
thing out and doing that under auxiliary power howard said 
the roberts is the same type of guidedmissile frigate as the 
uss stark the frigate that was hit last may in an iraqi air 
attack thirtyseven americans died in that attack 
ships of the oliver hazard perry class normally carry a crew of 
about 190 sailors and 13 officers but howard said he could not 
immediately provide a precise count of the number of men on the 
roberts 
one pentagon official who asked not to be named said the 
explosion does not appear to have been caused by any failure of 
systems on board the ship 
another source added the roberts hit something we are 
assuming it was a mine 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan had been told of the incident fitzwater said that he did 
not know how reagan was told but that the president was 
routinely informed about such matters by national security 
adviser colin powell or a member of the national security council 
staff 
fitzwater said the incident only emphasizes our concern for 
stopping the iraniraq war which has led to the mining of the 
gulf 
he said the administration intended to step up pressure in the 
un security council for a resolution that would not only put an 
end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions 
against belligerents in the war

terrorists 
a military honor guard escorted the flagdraped bodies of khalid 
ayyub bandar 20 and abdullah shibib alkhalidi 24 into the 
ghostlike sea of mourners in traditional white arab robes and 
headdresses 
hundreds of men stretched out hands to touch the biers as 
relatives carrying the bodies forced a weaving path through the 
throng to reach the graves dug in sandy soil 
traditional moslem chants of allahu akbar god is 
great and la illah illa allah there is no god but 
god resounded across the cemetery as tightly packed mourners 
passed stones over their heads to reach those at graveside who were 
covering the bodies 
the crown prince sheik saad abdullah alsabah led the 
procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male 
relatives of the slain men

all of those interviewed said they supported the governments 
refusal to grant the hijackers demands and some blamed iran for 
the jets seizure 
everybody agrees on one point that we should not give in 
no matter what the sacrifices said abdullah alsaleh a 
businessman 
i think if we get the hijackers we should kill them one after 
the other so therell be no one to do such a thing again said 
ghassahn alkunaini a mechanical engineer i do not accept 
anything no deals 
he denounced the hijackers claims to be acting for islam 
these people they know nothing about islam kunaini said 
marzouk said kuwait has set an example that you never ever 
negotiate with terrorists 
i think its unfortunate that the united states germany 
france they have always wanted to negotiate for the release of the 
hostages in lebanon he added once you give in to blackmail 
once you always give in to blackmail 
kuwait has repeatedly refused to consider freeing the 17 islamic 
radicals who were imprisoned for a series of bombings 
on wednesday the defense minister sheik nawaf alahmad 
alsabah said kuwait would not cave in and would not change its 
attitude toward blackmail 
the radical kuwaiti newspaper alwatan said thursday the 
hijackers in algiers were demanding that kuwait commute the death 
penalty for three convicts condemned to death who are among the 17

uninsured workers with medical problems told 
their hardluck stories thursday to a house panel weighing a 
sweeping plan to require that employers offer minimum health 
benefits 
the employees including a a grocery store clerk from 
philadelphia and a doctors office receptionist from denver said 
they have had to cope with inadequate medical care unaffordable 
bills or both 
annette lopez the receptionist said the federal medicaid 
program paid for her daughter colleens twomonth stay in the 
hospital after she was born prematurely but she said five 
subsequent hospital stays have cost 22000 and theres no one to 
pay it but herself and her husband on their wages of 6 an hour 
each 
even if i paid 100 every month shed be in college if not 
out of college by the time we ended up paying this bill said 
mrs lopez 
daniel casey the clerk said his parents were uninsured had 
diabetes and died in their 30s for lack of proper medical care he 
said he has diabetes and no insurance and must depend on clinics 
with spotty care and no evening hours 
if i get sick i must choose between working and supporting my 
family or going to the doctor and losing a days pay said casey 
if my employer had a mandatory insurance program i could go to a 
regular pharmacy and see a doctor in the evening 
the testimony came at a hearing before the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on health and the environment 
there are an estimated 372 million americans without health 
insurance about twothirds of them are workers or dependents who 
would be covered by the plan under consideration by congress 
the bill introduced by sen edward kennedy dmass and rep 
henry waxman dcalif would require employers to provide a 
minimum package of health insurance to people working 175 hours a 
week or more benefits would have to include hospital and doctor 
care prenatal and wellbaby care diagnostic testing and 
catastrophic protection 
employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium pool 
arrangements and a phasein period would make plans more affordable 
to small or new firms the senate version of the bill already 
approved by kennedys labor and human resources committee also 
says very small or new employers would only have to provide 
catastrophic protection 
the business community is divided on the plan many firms say 
they are philosophically opposed to mandated benefits but 
corporations with health plans complain they are indirectly footing 
the bill for firms without them 
the washington business group on health representing hundreds 
of fortune 500 companies and other employers said in a statement 
thursday that with each month we hear from more members who 
think that a federal mandate is far from the worst alternative 
and many of the changes we wanted have been accepted 
willis goldbeck president of the group said the kennedywaxman 
bill clearly does not have the support of the business 
community but said there is considerable strength to the 
growing trend of acceptance among many major companies 
john lester owner of a small carpentry and construction 
business in warren nh said the bill would help small companies 
like his he said he offers health insurance as an ethical 
obligation but its high cost keeps him from expanding 
furthermore lester said in my attempts to be responsible now 
and in the future i am put at a competitive disadvantage against 
those employers who do not insure 
the us chamber of commerce is a prime opponent of the 
kennedywaxman bill and said thursday it would cause many workers 
to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs 
the group is proposing alternatives it says would encourage 
rather than require employers to offer coverage among them 
eliminating state minimum benefit requirements and allowing 
unincorporated businesses the same tax deductions enjoyed by 
incorporated firms 
the state of hawaii has a law similar to the kennedywaxman 
bill the massachusetts legislature on wednesday passed an even 
more sweeping measure that guarantees health coverage to everyone 
not just people with jobs

albert gore jr widened his nuclearpolicy dispute with rival 
michael dukakis today saying the massachusetts governor and his 
staff misstated us and nato positions on the subject meanwhile 
a new poll showed dukakis leading jesse jackson in new york with 
gore far behind both men 
with less than a week to go before the big new york primary 
with 255 delegates at stake gore in an attempt to get back in the 
race has vigorously attacked dukakis on the nuclear issue dukakis 
and his campaign aides have said gores charges are simply wrong 
the efforts of a desperate candidate 
the latest controversy began wednesday when gore said dukakis 
erred in an interview in the new york daily news by saying he would 
consider first use of strategic nuclear weapons in case of a soviet 
conventional attack in europe 
gore denounced that wednesday as a major blunder but dukakis 
strongly denied that it was dukakis said he had merely reflected 
existing american and nato policy in holding open the option of a 
nuclear response to a successful soviet invasion of western europe 
with conventional forces 
in a speech today to the american society of newspaper editors 
gore said dukakis staff compounded the first mistake by misstating 
nato policy about using nuclear weapons 
to say nato policy is no early first use is another error 
we have not adopted that policy nato has not adopted that 
policy gore told the newspaper editors 
governor dukakis and his campaign spokesman apparently dont 
know that gore said at a news conference following the speech 
the new poll released today indicated jackson was gaining 
support in new york but that dukakis was maintaining his own 
strength gore apparently had not picked up ground despite his 
vigorous campaigning 
dukakis had the support of 46 percent of 359 registered 
democrats surveyed monday and tuesday by the marist college 
institute for public opinion followed by jackson with 34 percent 
gore with 7 percent and uncommitted with 5 percent eight 
percent of those polled were undecided 
a previous marist poll conducted april 56 showed dukakis with 
47 percent jackson 31 percent and gore with 6 percent eight 
percent were uncommitted and 6 percent undecided the polls margin 
of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points 
on wednesday jackson appeared in albany ny with gov mario 
cuomo cuomo called jackson a singularly important democrat 
and jackson thanked cuomo for holding off on any endorsements until 
after the primary season june 7 
gov cuomo just keep a freeze on all endorsements and keep 
extending your support jackson said 
jackson continued to be plagued however by hostility from the 
jewish community and from president reagan who said politicians 
have withheld their criticism of jackson for fear of being called 
racist 
reagan has rarely singled out any of the democratic candidates 
for criticism but he told the american society of newspaper 
editors in washington i have to believe that a great many of us 
would find ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that 
he is proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it 
wasnt for concern that thatd be misinterpreted into some kind of 
a racial attack 
republican george bush called during the final day of a 
threeday swing in new york for mandatory death penalties for 
certain drugrelated crimes reflecting the prominence of the drug 
issue in this years campaign 
and frankly id like to find a way to make this penalty 
swift he said in a breakfast speech to the association for a 
better new york 
gore stirred the new foreign policy controversy after dukakis 
told the daily news we reserve the right to use nuclear force 
in the event of a soviet invasion of europe when there appears to 
be no other alternative he added i dont think thats going 
to happen 
gore battling for survival quickly jumped on the massachusetts 
governor and said he had made a significant mistake in saying 
that he would launch a nuclear strike against the soviet union 
under specific circumstances 
at a news conference in boston dukakis said gore ought to get 
his facts straight 
the policy i advocated has been the policy of the government 
of the united states for many many years he said its the 
policy of the nato alliance 
at an appearance wednesday night before westchester county 
ny democrats gore said the transcript of the interview showed 
dukakis had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use 
of strategic weapons 
nato has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical 
gore said the president of the united states has traditionally 
refused to respond to that hypothetical 
james steinberg defense and foreign policy adviser to dukakis 
said dukakis started answering the question thinking he was being 
asked about tactical nuclear weapons and that after dukakis started 
speaking the questioner made reference to strategic 
the transcript shows a comma before the phrase as a strategic 
weapon 
steinberg said he assumed dukakis would have given a different 
answer had he understood the question to be about strategic nuclear 
weapons

two lawmakers are asking secretary of george 
shultz to intervene with negotiators trying to free a hijacked 
kuwaiti jumbo jet because one of men holding the plane may also be 
responsible for the kidnapping of american hostages in beirut 
sen daniel moynihan and rep louise slaughter both new york 
democrats wrote shultz on wednesday to point out published reports 
that one of the kuwaiti jet hijackers may be imad mughniyeh who 
they said may have been the chief kidnapper of american hostage 
terry anderson 
we know the united states is not a primary party to the 
algiers negotiations but if terry andersons chief kidnapper is 
one the kuwaiti jet the united states government must insure that 
the negotiators are aware of this fact moynihan and slaughter 
told shultz 
it would be a travesty for imad mughniyeh to go free while 
terry anderson remains a captive they said 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped more than three years ago 
the independent kuwaiti newspaper alqabas quoted unidentified 
sources wednesday as saying mughniyeh was believed to have boarded 
the plane when it stopped in iran after being hijacked on a flight 
from bangkok thailand to kuwait 
moynihan and slaughter did not ask shultz to directly involve 
the united states in the negotiations to free the hostages being 
held aboard the jumbo jet in algiers 
but they said we must not let any possibility for his 
release remain unexplored or any effort left undone 
we ask you to give this matter your immediate attention 
they wrote shultz please keep us informed about any information 
the state department or other government agencies learn about this 
linkage between the hijacking and terrys kidnapping as well as any 
steps you take to secure terrys release

a woman underwent an abortion in defiance of 
a court order obtained by the wouldbe father but attorneys for 
both sides still want the state supreme court to settle the dispute 
at issue is whether a woman has the sole authority to decide to 
have an abortion or if a father has rights that give him a say in 
the decision 
attorneys for the 18yearold terre haute woman told the high 
court wednesday that she had terminated her firsttrimester 
pregnancy but said the decision was hers alone 
their notice came a day after they asked the high court for an 
immediate review of the lower court injunction that prohibited an 
abortion 
a spokesman for the supreme court said today that the case will 
go through the normal appeals process because speed is no longer 
essential 
the case will go through the indiana court of appeals since it 
is not an emergency any more said the spokeswoman it probably 
will get back to us eventually but there is no emergency now and 
it has to go through the channels 
a 61page brief by the mans attorney james bopp jr said the 
womans reasons for wanting an abortion are an immature reasoning 
process are insubstantial and border on the frivolous and do not 
outweigh the strong interests of the father in seeing the child 
born and in his custody 
bopp described the woman as an unemployed high school dropout 
who began a relationship with the man a delivery truck driver in 
terre haute following a date on new years eve 
the lower court ruling cited testimony that the woman wanted an 
abortion to preserve her figure so she would look good in a bathing 
suit and to avoid being pregnant during the summer bopp said 
the womans attorneys refused to say where or when the abortion 
was performed 
faced with the decision of continuing with an unwanted 
pregnancy and with violating a court order she made the decision 
she felt was right said the notice signed by her attorney 
richard a waples legal director of the indiana civil liberties 
union 
she did what she had to do to protect both her physical and 
emotional health it said 
bopp general counsel for the national right to life 
organization said wednesday he thinks somebody was exploiting 
and victimizing her to get her to get an abortion 
an extremely serious and distressing thing has happened he 
said adding that his client is absolutely devastated that his 
child has been taken from him 
bopp said he and his client havent considered seeking a 
contempt citation against the woman for violating vigo county 
circuit judge robert h browns order issued last week on monday 
brown issued a permanent injunction 
he loves this girl bopp said of his 24yearold client 
hes not interested in punishing her 
if allowed to stand browns ruling invites other indiana courts 
to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiry into 
and overruling of a competent adult womans decision to terminate 
her first trimester pregnancy waples told the court 
the womans attorneys said her first trimester would have ended 
sometime during the next two weeks 
waples argued browns injunction violated the 1973 us supreme 
court ruling in roe vs wade which upheld a womans right to an 
abortion during the first trimester of a pregnancy 
waples also said the us supreme court ruled in 1976 that a 
spouse cannot veto a womans decision to end a pregnancy during the 
first three months 
bopp said he wants a ruling detailing what rights a father has 
in such cases fathers have rights in particular cases all we 
said in this case is we want those rights to be balanced with 
those of the mother bopp said 
since the case involves a paternity action neither the woman 
nor the man has been identified in court records

given lightly the wga refused a special request for one at 
mondays academy awards show

the soviet union has followed up on informal 
pledges and officially notified the united states that it has 
stopped commercial whaling us commerce secretary c william 
verity said thursday 
this is a significant international achievement which removes 
a major obstacle to ussoviet cooperation in fisheries verity 
told a news conference 
the soviets announced in 1985 that they would stop commercial 
whaling and an offical of the ministry of the fishing industry 
confirmed it to reporters in may but it was unclear whether the 
soviet union would continue limited whaling for scientific purposes 
the international whaling commission to which the soviet union 
belongs agreed in 1982 to a moratorium on commercial whaling 
beginning in 1986 to give whale stocks a chance to recover from 
severe cuts the soviet union japan and norway objected 
william evans undersecretary of commerce for oceans and 
atmosphere told the associated press after the news conference 
that soviet ambassador yuri dubinin had formally notified verity of 
the cessation of commercial whaling in a meeting in washington 
earlier this month 
verity plans to certify to president reagan that the soviet 
union is complying with the whaling moratorium evans said 
under a 1967 law the president may order an embargo of the 
fishery products of any country conducting a fishing operation that 
diminishes the effectiveness of an international fishery 
conservation program 
verity said he hopes the soviet cessation of commercial whaling 
will allow for an expansion of fishing cooperation provided for in 
a new agreement signed feb 21

rebounding sales helped dampen growth of 
business inventories in february to a slight 01 percent after four 
big monthly increases the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said inventories increased by only 825 
million pushing the total of unsold items on store shelves and 
backlots to a seasonally adjusted 7159 billion 
the small gain followed a string of much steeper increases that 
came in the months after the stock market crash inventories rose 
07 percent in january 09 percent in december 08 percent in 
november and 12 percent in october 
economists had feared the inventory buildup would force 
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988 but 
thursdays inventory numbers along with a separate report on trade 
showing a 23 bilion increase in imports in february provide 
evidence that domestic demand has not weakened 
the february increase in goods held on shelves and backlots was 
occurring while business sales were climbing 06 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 4683 billion reversing a 05 percent drop in 
january 
its really two sides of the same puzzle said michael k 
evans who heads evans economics inc in washington if 
inventories continued to rise at the same time that sales were 
falling that would clearly be bad news but thats not 
happening so its ok 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group a forecasting 
service headquartered near philadelphia said imports were at least 
partially responsible for the inventory growth 
a lot of the inventories that had built up were imported 
goods thats one of the reasons im less concerned about the 
trade numbers than i might have been he said another commerce 
department report thursday showed the us merchandise trade 
deficit widened to 138 billion in february from 124 billion in 
january 
the february rise in inventories was held back by a 11 percent 
fall in inventories held by retailers this decrease reflected 
primarily a 52 percent drop in the backlog of unsold cars 
excluding autos retail inventories were up 04 percent 
inventories held at the wholesale level were up 09 percent 
while manufacturers inventories grew by 05 percent 
the 06 percent overall sales rise was led by a 12 percent 
increase in wholesale sales in february a 06 percent rise in 
sales by retailers and a 01 percent rise in sales by manufacturers 
in an advance report on wednesday the government said retail 
sales increased 08 percent in march 
the combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories 
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 154 in january to 
153 in february that means it would take 153 months to exhaust 
inventories at the february sales pace that ratio is not 
considered abnormally high

of his plane wasnt even aware that a small aircraft had landed on 
top of him 
then he said he realized his plane was handling strangely 
jacob was taxiing his singleengine cessna 172 on a runway at 
ben epps airport on wednesday evening when a cessna 170 landed on 
top of his plane straddling it 
if it had landed 6 feet farther to the left the prop would have 
punctured his plane and struck him in the head he said 
i had this thought today that i really shouldnt go out 
jacob said after the accident 
both jacob and the other pilot walter klussman escaped injury 
although damage to the aircraft appeared to be extensive 
they should both be dead said frank dively manager of the 
small airport in a situation like that usually theres fire and 
major casualties but both walked away from it 
dively said klussman who was unaware the airport tower was 
closed was attempting to talk to someone in the tower when the 
accident occurred the two pilots were using different radio 
frequencies so they were unaware of each others presence he said 
klussman was flying from naples fla to pennsylvania and was 
stopping to refuel when the accident occurred dively said

if you wanted to spend as much time 
in the air as frances miller and sylvia roth youd have to lift 
off right now and not set your plane down until late 1992 
the two pilots flight instructors and business partners with 
a combined total of more than 40000 hours of flying time retire 
their wings this year 
ms miller who was one of the first women in the state to 
receive the pilot examiners rating back in the 1950s retires 
friday while ms roth plans to retire in june she was the first 
woman in the nation to be designated an airline transport pilot 
examiner by the federal aviation administration in 1968 
the women both 62 will be honored friday by the south carolina 
aeronautics commission they ran a flight school in columbia for 16 
years 
over their combined 90year careers theyve taught thousands of 
pilots to fly and many of their former charges now are with major 
airlines around the world 
but flying was a mans pursuit when they started flying 
i started when i was 17 ms miller said i just wanted to 
fly 
airplanes were something different and amelia earhart was 
doing her thing at that time said ms roth they were doing 
all sorts of different things and setting records 
flying is easier today than it once was what with better 
planes and more sophisticated cockpit equipment they said but 
its not quite as much fun ms miller said 
when i was learning to fly there were so few restrictions 
she said you could take an airplane a j3 cub that didnt have 
anything in it but an air speed indicator and altimeter and just 
go anywhere in the country 
during their careers of teaching students the two have had 
close calls but no disasters ms miller said student pilots 
tend to react in predictable ways and instructors can usually 
anticipate problems 
you know what to expect she said most people have the 
same apprehensions and the same fears

toxic pcbs passed from mother to child through 
breast milk will still be measurable in the parents 
greatgreatgreat grandchildren a michigan researcher told a house 
subcommittee thursday 
the problem is these compounds refuse to go away for any 
reasonable amount of time said wayland r swain vice president 
of eco logic inc of ann arbor mich in testimony before the 
house public works and transportation subcommittee on 
investigations and oversight 
swain drew on earlier research into the transmission of 
polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs for short to calculate the level 
of the substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained 
in the infants body 
an infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed lake 
michigan fish would be exposed to 62 milligrams of pcb by the end 
of 12 months swain said of that amount 53 milligrams would be 
retained in the infants body 
it is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed 
lake michigan fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines for 
adults for their entire breastfeeding experience swain said 
the level of pcbs retained by such infants was more than seven 
times the maximum consumption level recommended by the food and 
drug administration swain said 
pcbs are passed to a child not only through beast feeding but 
from the mothers body through the placenta before birth swain 
said 
a 20yearold woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient 
pcbs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped 
i would still measure pcb in the body fat six generations in 
the future swain said 
production of pcbs believed to cause cancer has been banned 
for years but the substance continues to enter the environment 
through such sources as older electric transformers 
recent research suggests that the decline in pcb levels in the 
great lakes has slowed and that the substance continues to 
circulate from the sediment into the water and back into the 
sediment again in a perpetual cycle that produces continuing 
contamination of the food chain 
children exposed the pcbs as infants tend to be shorter have 
smaller heads be more likely to catch infectious diseases and 
exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings swain said

i immediately jumped on top of him and kept yelling no 
no durkovitz said i was trying to separate little roxanne 
from the lion 
i looked up at a security guard and said shoot him shoot 
him durkovitz said about the same time he shot him he bit 
down on roxanne

videocassettes of rambo and james bond movies and 
western news clippings of the chernobyl nuclear accident were among 
ideological contraband seized from foreigners by soviet 
customs tass reported thursday 
the official news agency did not say exactly when or over what 
time period the seizures of pamphlets books and videocassettes 
took place only that separate incidents were involved the 
dispatch was based on an article in whistle a newspaper of the 
railroad ministry 
among the confiscated material were 500 antisoviet 
publications taken from two british students identified only as d 
warrowsmith and d dows tass said the two were at the brest 
checkpoint in byelorussia on the polish border when the material 
was discovered 
the subversive literature had been supplied to them by a 
charity organization concerned about the alleged suppression of 
religious believers tass said 
tass said the two had planned to distribute the material in 
minsk and moscow where they were headed on tourist visas 
under mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness many formally banned authors have been published in the 
soviet union and staterun media have tackled previously taboo 
subjects but the tass announcement of the seizures made it clear 
glasnost does not extend to material considered ideological 
contraband 
another case described in the tass report involved a woman 
identified as n bashkatoff of belgium she allegedly was carrying 
several leaflets and clippings from the bourgeois press with 
fabrications about the chernobyl accident concealed in her 
luggage 
she also attempted absentmindedly to leave behind in her 
train compartment a maliciously slanderous book called moscow 
quadrille tass said 
another tourist who was not identified was caught carrying 
dozens of copies of people on the march a pamphlet which 
authorities say urges soviets of ethnic german origin to emigrate 
to west germany 
some of the latest items of ideological contraband include 
video recordings of various sermons karate lessons with a 
sadistic bent pornography and antisoviet films like rambo or 
the james bond afghan series the dispatch said 
the latter was apparently a reference to the james bond movie 
the living daylights in which the fictional british agent 007 
played by timothy dalton outwits the soviet army in afghanistan 
soviet officials have bitterly complained that sylvester 
stallones muscled vietnam war veteran rambo presents a negative 
stereotype of soviets 
the report from tass said people carrying material judged to be 
ideological contraband will be deported from the soviet union

the average american will have to work 126 
days this year two more than in 1987 just to pay federal state 
and local taxes the tax foundation said thursday tax freedom 
day will fall on may 5 the latest ever 
the best taxpayers have fared in the past decade was in 1984 
when most of the big 1981 federal incometax reduction had taken 
effect when tax freedom day fell on april 28 economists for the 
foundation said 
but federal tax increases enacted in 1982 1984 and 1987 have 
lopped off big chunks of the 81 cuts and social security hikes 
have made further inroads until like the cheshire cat in alice in 
wonderland nothing remains but the smile the foundation said 
last year the big day was may 4 this years may 5 date is two 
days later because 1988 is a leap year which meant there was a 
feb 29 this year 
with the approach of the friday midnight deadline for filing 
federal tax returns the first under the heavily revised tax law 
there were these other tax developments 
the internal revenue service whose telephone assistors 
have been giving the wrong answer to about 28 of every 100 tax 
questions this year disclosed some factors it will consider in 
determining whether to waive certain penalties for taxpayers who 
follow such bad advice 
the agency said penalties for late filing negligence and 
failure to pay can be waived if the taxpayers proves he or she 
acted reasonably 
it will consider pertinent factors such as whether the taxpayer 
also sought the correct answer in an irs publication as well as 
what specific question was asked of the assistor and what was the 
actual answer 
it also would help the taxpayer to know the name of the irs 
employee and the time and date of the telephone call 
house republicans and several business organizations began a 
campaign to block future incometax increases amend the 
constitution to require a balanced budget and pass a bill of 
rights to help taxpayers in disputes with the irs 
seventyeight republican representatives have signed a promise 
to oppose raising income taxes while 190 mostly republicans 
lawmakers have signed a petition requiring the house judiciary 
committee to allow a vote on the balancedbudget amendment such a 
vote requires the assent of 218 representatives 
the federal budget can be balanced in less than four years 
without raising taxes if congress controls the growth of spending 
to less than the inflation rate david keating vice president of 
the national taxpayers union told a news conference sponsored by 
gop lawmakers 
the national federation of independent business released a 
survey indicating that 75 percent of business owners polled think 
the tax laws are more complex since the 1986 revision about 55 
percent say their companies are spending more time on tax forms 
but twothirds would not be willing to pay more in order to get 
simpler taxes 
the tax foundation a washingtonbased research organization 
assumes that individuals pay all taxes including those collected 
from corporations when it calculates tax freedom day the 
economists simply divide all federal state and local tax 
collections among taxpayers and assume that every penny earned each 
year goes to government until tax obligations are satisfied 
viewed from another perspective the foundation estimates the 
average taxpayer will work 1 hour and 50 minutes each eighthour 
day to pay federal taxes and another 55 minutes for state and 
local taxes thats two minutes longer for federal taxes than in 
1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes 
by the same measure housing will require 1 hour and 24 minutes 
unchanged food and tobacco 56 minutes two minutes less 
transportation 40 minutes unchanged medical care 39 minutes 
unchanged clothing 22 minutes one minute less recreation 21 
minutes unchanged and everything else will take 53 minutes of 
work one minute less than last year

harry helmsley bought his first property a 
dilapidated office building for 1000 in 1936 a decade later he 
sold it for 165000 now his real estate equity is estimated at 
14 billion 
leona mindy rosenthal the daughter of a brooklyn hatmaker had 
been the chesterfield cigarette girl before she settled on a career 
in real estate and ultimately married harry helmsley 
now this king of manhattan real estate and the queen of the 
helmsley hotel chain are in a court devoid of royalty they 
surrendered thursday and pleaded innocent to federal and state 
charges of tax evasion falsifying business records and in leonas 
case extortion conspiracy 
the charges are so shocking because they involve people whose 
wealth is nearly unbounded helmsley was listed 21st on the forbes 
list of the 400 richest americans last year he owns the empire 
state building 
their estate in greenwich conn central to the charges 
consists of a 28room tudor mansion on 29 acres but that is not 
the only helmsley residence harry and leona also spend time at a 
duplex atop the park lane hotel and at a lakefront condominium in 
palm beach fla 
harry and leona shower each other with gifts sometimes paid for 
with company money according to the indictment and their 
generosity sometimes extends to others in 1986 they made the 
single largest philanthropic gesture in the country giving 33 
million to new york hospital 
neither of the helmsleys was born of wealth helmsleys father 
was a notions buyer for a wholesale dry goods firm the son 
graduated from high school but never attended college his first 
job as office boy at the realestate firm he eventually came to 
own paid 12 a week 
his credo all you have to do is buy and if you make a 
mistake the market comes along and takes care of it he once 
said 
helmsley 79 owns 50000 apartments and 7 million feet of 
commercial space he bought the empire state building then the 
worlds tallest building in the 1950s every morning you would 
look out of the window and the building is staring you in the face 
so youd say well i gotta buy it 
on july 4 1976 helmsley lit the empire state building in red 
white and blue a tribute not to the bicentennial but to his 
wifes birthday it cost 100000 it was less than a necklace 
he said 
leona helmsley 67 is harrys second wife his previous 
marriage ended in divorce in 1972 after 33 years with no children 
leona too was married before to a lawyer whom she divorced in 
1959 her only son died in 1982 
the former showroom model and advertising mannequin was a 
successful real estate broker when helmsley met her in 1971 he 
hired her as a 500000ayear senior vice president and married 
her a year later by all accounts she is just wild about harry 
people magazine records that she calls him gorgeous one 
pussycat snooky wooky dooky 
shortly after their marriage in 1973 a man wearing a gas mask 
broke into their palm beach bedroom wake up darling we have 
company leona told her husband nudging him awake 
the naked helmsleys chased the intruder but before he fled he 
stabbed leona in the chest with a bread knife puncturing her lung 
when harry put leona in charge of the helmsley hotels in 1980 
he was not providing her with a sinecure she took complete charge 
and became the star of ads for the hotel chain which trumpeted her 
demanding nature as a guarantee of quality 
its the only palace in the world where the queen stands 
guard said one ad for the helmsley palace in manhattan 
the royal appellation is matched by a volatile queensize 
temper according to many employees 
she comes on as extremely forthright but that sometimes turns 
into brutality said one former employee advertising executive 
jane maas shes icy without compassion she is remorseless and 
pitiless 
according to the federal indictment leona did more than harass 
her employees she shook them down demanding kickbacks in 
exchange for their continued employment sources said some two 
dozen helmsley employees testified before the grand jury under 
grant of immunity 
harry by contrast is known as a courtly gentleman he does not 
envy leonas celebrity the ads the interviews the profiles on 
60 minutes 
i think one person should take the limelight it dilutes if 
there are two helmsley said in 1986 
i have a different aspect of the business i like to plan 
buildings organize them and finance them once i build it i 
couldnt care less and thats where she comes in she is fantastic 
at entertaining and daytoday operations details i hate the 
only thing i like is adding up a column of figures and getting the 
bottom line 
even prior to their latest legal problems leona helmsley 
received some unwelcome publicity when it was reported she failed 
to pay more than 38000 in sales tax for jewelry at van cleef amp 
arpels she was never charged but sources said she was given 
immunity for her cooperation with authorities 
then last year a series of reports in the new york post 
detailed allegations that the helmsleys had charged millions of 
dollars in renovations of their connecticut mansion to their 
business those revelations the basis of the indictments were 
fueled by tips from the queens disgruntled subjects 
most of the calls seem to have been prompted by peoples 
dislike of mrs helmsley said post reporter ransdell pierson

debtplagued east st louis which 
hasnt had regular garbage pickup for six months faces fines of 
10000 or more if the city does not clean up well enough by may 3 
officials say 
although state laws against illegal dumping and failure to 
dispose of garbage apply to all property owners the states action 
is aimed primarily at the city st clair county assistant states 
attorney jeff hoffman said wednesday 
the main thrust of this is getting rid of a public health 
problem hoffman said 
officials in this povertystricken riverfront city of 55000 
told state regulators that garbage pickup should resume friday and 
they have budgeted 210800 of federal community development funds 
to have the backlog of garbage that has piled up taken care of 
ken mensing regional manager of the illinois environmental 
protection agency said that if the cleanup doesnt go fast enough 
the city could face a state injunction fines as high as 10000 
and penalties up to 1000 per additional day of noncompliance for 
each violation he said 
just where we would draw the line i dont know mensing 
said we havent discussed it 
mensing said he could not estimate the amount of garbage that 
has accumulated in east st louis since regular garbage pickup 
ceased in october because the city owed 262000 to the private 
company that it had hired to do the collecting the company has 
since sued the city 
the only garbage hauling that has been done since then has been 
in the form of volunteer drives or work done privately by 
companies hired by individual businesses and homeowners 
joseph kurre director of the east side health district said 
the onset of warm weather raises the specter of disease and 
increased rat infestations caused by rotting garbage 
over the objections of mayor carl officer other city officials 
recently contracted with another private company g corp to do 
trash pickup until december for 350000 
officer continues to contend that the city cannot afford to pay 
for the service and that property owners should pay private 
companies to haul away their trash

arthur schlesinger jr says he will urge 
president reagans successor to appoint a special commission to set 
national arts policy goals for the 1990s which he predicted will 
be a decade of innovation experiment and idealism 
the time for revaluation is upon us and it should take place 
at the highest level said schlesinger a pulitzer prizewinning 
historian and former white house adviser to presidents kennedy and 
johnson 
schlesinger delivered the first nancy hanks lecture on arts and 
public policy here wednesday night in honor of the late chairwoman 
of the national endowment for the arts during the nixon 
administration 
the lecture and a blacktie dinner were cosponsored by the 
american council for the arts a nonprofit arts advocacy 
organization with support from the gannett foundation 
schlesinger a humanities professor at city university of new 
york said that after the last rather static years of the 
reagan administration the nation is ready to renew its commitment 
to government support of the arts and find ways to ease artists 
growing financial burdens 
we must pay more attention to the unintended consequences of 
legislation indirectly affecting the arts he said 
schlesinger complained that congress was notably harsh in its 
treatment of writers and artists when it abolished charitable 
deductions for nonitemizers in 1986 and prohibited artists from 
deducting expenses until they begin receiving income from their 
works 
government instead of carelessly discriminating against 
writers and artists should at least give them a fair shake in the 
tax code and elsewhere especially when most writers and artists 
and their families live from hand to mouth anyway he said

parliament voted thursday to end the 
32year state monopoly on television broadcasting by passing a law 
authorizing the creation of three private tv networks 
the law takes effect following publication in the official state 
bulletin 
the law stipulates that no individual nor group may own more 
than 25 percent of any of the three networks a provision seen by 
major publishing groups as an attempt to limit the influence of the 
established media 
participation of foreign investors is limited to a second 25 
percent share in any of the three networks 
there are two statecontrolled national television networks in 
spain and three more local networks controlled by the regional 
governments of galicia the basque country and catalonia 
spanish national television was founded in 1956 during the 
authoritarian regime of gen francisco franco spaniards watch more 
tv than citizens of the other 11 european economic community member 
nations except great britain 
channel 10 a londonbased company with spanish and foreign 
participation began broadcasting in spanish to spain via satellite 
in january 
since entering office in 1982 the government of socialist prime 
minister felipe gonzalez had pledged to enact legislation creating 
three nationwide private tv networks 
minister of transport communications and tourism abel caballero 
has estimated that none of the three networks will be ready to go 
on the air for 18 months to three years following enactment of the 
law 
the ministry has estimated the cost of upgrading the existing 
transmission network and land lines at between 45 million to 180 
million 
once the new law goes into effect the government is expected to 
request public bids for the private network licenses based on 
criteria to be set by the transport and communications ministry 
in the last three years several publishing groups in spain have 
formed groups in preparation for the bidding

democratic party leaders and politicians whose 
support as super delegates could prove crucial in winning the 
presidential nomination are giving michael dukakis nearly half of 
the 101delegate lead he holds over rival jesse jackson 
were it not for the support of these delegates who are going to 
the democratic national convention because of offices they 
currently or formerly held dukakis would be ahead of jackson by 
fewer than 44 delegate votes according to a survey by the 
associated press 
until todays gain of 52 previously uncommitted delegates in 
puerto rico dukakis held but a narrow lead over jackson without 
the support of the party leaders and politicians 
dukakis has 81615 delegates overall including 725 votes from 
super delegates he has gained 24 of those super delegates over the 
last month including nine members of the senate nominated this 
week to attend the partys convention 
by comparison jackson is supported by none of the 32 senators 
nominated this week he has 7151 delegates overall including 301 
super delegates a gain of 11 over the last month 
sens albert gore of tennessee and paul simon of illinois whose 
own presidential campaigns are lagging far behind those of dukakis 
and jackson were nominated by their senate colleagues to be 
convention delegates gore picked up an additional four senate 
delegates while simon gained two 
the nominations were made in a closeddoor meeting of senate 
democrats on tuesday a list of the nominees was obtained by the ap 
still 26825 super delegates most of those chosen so far 
remain uncommitted some saying they believe they have an 
obligation to defer making a choice and others saying they just 
cant make up their minds sixteen of the senators named so far are 
uncommitted 
it looks wide open said larryann willis a delegate from 
oregon im not convinced that any of the three candidates still 
in the field are who we should go with 
others are waiting for local party leaders to make a decision so 
they can follow suit leo obrien a delegate from new york who is 
party chairman in albany county said he put off picking a 
candidate until gov mario cuomo endorsed a hopeful 
then cuomo said last week he would not endorse anyone until the 
primaries and caucuses are over in june 
i waited for mario and now im left holding the bag 
obrien said 
in all 4164 votes are to be cast at the national convention 
july 1821 in atlanta and 2083 are needed to win the nomination 
the super delegates from the house and senate will be among as 
many as 646 party leaders governors and others who will be 
national convention delegates 
former atlanta mayor maynard jackson warned that the super 
delegates should not be used to thwart jesse jacksons candidacy 
i think the democratic party must avoid at all costs even the 
perception that it is acting in any way to deny that which jesse 
jackson has won fair and square he said 
gore who is running a distant third in the overall delegate 
count with 40455 has the support of 3355 super delegates 10 of 
whom have become supporters in the last month 
simon who suspended active campaigning after his singledigit 
fourthplace finish in wisconsin has picked up three super 
delegates over the past month raising his overall total to 1715 
including 185 super delegates 
the simon campaign has been urging super delegates to stay 
uncommitted according to george miller a delegate from texas who 
said campaign officials told him worse things could happen than a 
brokered convention 
while the campaigns have been trying to win over super 
delegates at least one says hes been overlooked james jones a 
former state senator from virginia 
i dont get no respect even if i am a super delegate he 
said its amazing that no one has called but i think it shows 
the extent to which the national campaigns are stretched thin

agreed to renew technical talks on implementing a ceasefire and to 
start highlevel negotiations to end the sixyear civil war 
the stalled ceasefire technical talks were to start immediately 
in the southern border post of sapoa site of earlier meetings the 
highlevel talks were to start in managua on friday 
a government delegation traveled to sapoa almost immediately 
after the agreement was announced at noon by the contras and manuel 
espinoza information minister for the leftist sandinista 
government 
the sandinistas backed off from their demand that the technical 
talks be held in managua and agreed to a contra request that they 
be in sapoa in exchange the contras stopped insisting that 
fridays political talks begin only if the sapoa talks were 
successful 
the contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today 
theyll conclude in managua espinoza told the associated press 
in a telephone interview 
earlier today contra representatives roberto ferrey and david 
stadthagen flew into the capitals sandino airport in a private 
aircraft and were met by tourism minister herty lewites it was the 
first time the government had allowed contras into managua 
on wednesday a sandinista negotiator accused the contras of not 
being serious about ending the civil war 
we have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive 
ceasefire deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told 
reporter 
theres a problem of confidence he said adding that the 
nicaraguan government did not want to see the talks unravel if 
they contras dont come on the 15th friday well have to see 
the alternatives 
the ceasefire pact was signed march 23 in sapoa the talks are 
to work out details of how to get contra forces into several zones 
inside nicaragua as a prelude to ending the war 
the military talks stalled april 8 after six rounds in which the 
two sides agreed only to establish seven zones to which contra 
fighters would be confined during a 60day truce that went into 
effect on april 1 
still to be worked out are security for the rebels in those 
zones methods of resupplying them and other details concerning the 
guerrillas during the two months allowed for negotiating a 
permanent ceasefire 
rebel fighters are scheduled to be in the zones by friday but 
they have not even begun gathering the sandinistas have agreed 
that once they verify the rebels are in the zones half of the 
1400 jailed contras will be freed 
nicaragua is estimated to have more than 3000 political 
prisoners the sandinistas released 100 soon after the provisional 
truce was signed

a us navy frigate on patrol in the persian 
gulf apparently struck an underwater mine today injuring six 
sailors the pentagon said today 
the ship the uss samuel b roberts was in no danger of 
sinking said pentagon spokesman dan howard no one was killed and 
the six sailors did not sustain lifethreatening injuries he added 
the pentagon said that four of the sailors had seconddegree 
burns the other two had slight back injuries none of the injuries 
was considered lifethreatening 
all were flown from by helicopter from the ship for medical 
treatment 
the ship is based in newport ri and left there for persian 
gulf duty on jan 11 
at approximately 1010 this morning edt the uss sam roberts 
experienced an underwater explosion in the persian gulf at a 
point approximately 70 miles due east of bahrain bell a 
navigational aid howard said 
the explosion caused flooding in the engine room and some hull 
damage the flooding is under control and the ship is in the 
process of pumping out the water its operating under auxiliary 
power 
howard said that the uss wainwright a cruiser is en route to 
the site to offer assistance and should be there soon 
the incident occurred in the central persian gulf well to the 
south of the spot near the iraniancontrolled farsi island where a 
reflagged kuwaiti tanker the bridgeton hit a mine during the 
first of the navys convoy operation last july howard said there 
had been no recent reports by minesweepers in the area that mines 
had been sighted 
the spokesman refused to say that the underwater explosion had 
been caused by a mine citing the paucity of information from 
initial reports 
it really is too early to tell howard said underwater 
explosion is the way to describe it we dont know what caused the 
explosion all weve got is an underwater explosion at this point 
howard said the roberts was steaming in the area after 
completing an escort operation wednesday night the spokesman said 
he assumed there were no other us vessels in close proximity 
but couldnt say for sure 
they say the flooding is under control and theyre pumping the 
thing out and doing that under auxiliary power howard said 
within hours of the explosion the pentagon said the ship had 
begun steaming toward port in bahrain 
the roberts is the same type of guidedmissile frigate as the 
uss stark the frigate that was hit last may in an iraqi air 
attack thirtyseven americans died in that attack 
ships of the oliver hazard perry class normally carry a crew of 
about 190 sailors and 13 officers the pentagon said the roberts 
was carrying about 225 men however because it had a helicopter 
detachment aboard from mayport fla 
one pentagon official who asked not to be named said the 
explosion does not appear to have been caused by any failure of 
systems on board the ship 
another source added the roberts hit something we are 
assuming it was a mine 
the pentagon said the roberts was under the command of cmdr 
paul x rinn it fixed the location of the explosion at 2625 
degrees north and 5215 degrees east 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan had been told of the incident fitzwater said that he did 
not know how reagan was told but that the president was 
routinely informed about such matters by national security 
adviser colin powell or a member of the national security council 
staff 
fitzwater said the incident only emphasizes our concern for 
stopping the iraniraq war which has led to the mining of the 
gulf 
he said the administration intended to step up pressure in the 
un security council for a resolution that would not only put an 
end to the war but put the group on record in favor of sanctions 
against belligerents in the war

the accord for a soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan was 
hailed thursday by countries in both the east and west as a vital 
first step toward peace and some offered to help afghan refugees 
in southern asia however skepticism remained over some aspects 
of the plan particularly the continued aid to combatants 
the agreements signed in geneva by representatives of the 
united states the soviet union afghanistan and pakistan will 
take effect may 15 and will commit pakistan and afghanistan not to 
support directly or indirectly rebellious or secessionist 
activities against each other after nine years of civil war and 
soviet entanglement 
in brussels the north atlantic treaty organization welcomed the 
agreements and said it hoped they would yield further improvements 
in superpower relations 
the soviet occupation of afghanistan has been a serious 
impediment in east west relations nato said the 
implementation of the geneva agreements will we hope lead to 
further improvements in the atmosphere between east and west 
austrian vice chancellor and foreign minister alois mock called 
the agreements a step to the strengthening of eastwest 
relaxation 
the accords open the possibility that other regional conflicts 
be settled peacefully mock said 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi expressed concern however 
about a continued flow of weapons to afghan rebels and said some of 
them were reaching indias sikh extremists through neighboring 
pakistan 
the sikh extremists fighting for a separate nation in punjab 
used rocketpropelled grenades for the first time last month 
officials in the northwest indian state say the rebels also have 
increased their stock of ak47 assault rifles 
indian officials recently charged that pakistan was helping 
sikhs acquire weapons pakistan denied the charge 
the times of india an independent englishlanguage daily said 
in an editorial titled meaningless agreement 
moscow will be able to withdraw its troops without having to 
acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify afghanistan 
in the face of resistance by usbacked mujahedeen but on the 
face of it the agreement will be pretty meaningless otherwise 
for it will stipulate that the americans and the russians will 
continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective 
clients and while pakistan will formally agree not to interfere in 
afghanistans internal affairs it will in reality continue to do 
so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for us arms 
supplies to the mujahedeen 
the accord was praised in communist nations 
nonaligned communist yugoslavia which has repeatedly condemned 
soviet intervention in afghanistan said the agreements represent 
an important first step which could lead to a final peace 
settlement in that country 
in a commentary the state tanjug news agency said the final 
solution of the conflict is still far away because the region has 
been burdened by different international interests 
all sides involved must now show maximum goodwill 
statesmanlike wisdom and responsibility the czechoslovak ctk 
news agency said 
both denmark and japan said they would join a united nations 
military force observing the accord in afghanistan 
finland and sweden both neutral scandinavian countries also 
have agreed in principle to send observers to afghanistan 
danish newspapers said poland and canada also have been asked to 
join the force reportedly to be led by a finnish general 
japan planned to assist in the relocation of 5 million civilian 
refugees said a foreign ministry spokesman in tokyo 
acting foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi said also 
it is our intention to extend financial assistance to facilitate 
the safe and honorable return of the refugees to afghanistan 
britain also announced plans to aid refugees with an 187 
million grant for resettlement 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said the grant was 
conditional on the setting up of properly coordinated 
international arrangements for the return of millions of afghan 
refugees from neighboring pakistan

health workers are counting used condoms that 
float to the surface of the citys sewage treatment plant pools in 
an effort to find out how many people are heeding advice about safe 
sex to avoid aids 
hundreds of condoms float in the water at openair pools at 
waste water treatment plants for the last eight months city 
workers have been using longhandled fish nets to scoop the 
multicolored condoms from the sewage and count them each day 
the study which should be completed in a year may help 
determine whether people are heeding warnings to use condoms as a 
way to prevent the spread of the acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome virus officials said 
we talk a lot about using condoms but the question is whether 
were really doing it said dr diane dwyer who heads a 
federally funded aids study in baltimore were serious about it 
we really want to find out whether more condoms are being used or 
whether people are just buying them and storing them by the bedside 
for potential future use 
the study includes counting the number of condoms sold at 
drugstores and those given away free by the health department ms 
dwyer said 
though officials dont know how many condoms are flushed down 
toilets or simply thrown away they said they had no intention of 
going through garbage 
its certainly not a very pleasant job but it is important 
said courtland storck the aids surveillance supervisor for the 
health department if it does work and we hope it does then 
hopefully other cities would adapt a similar program 
the health department said it has so far retrieved between 200 
and 400 condoms each day floating in the sewage pools 
a johns hopkins hospital doctor first suggested the study method 
in baltimore but officials say the first such count was made in 
the late 1970s in ireland

about 1500 jewish youths many carrying 
israeli flags took part in a march of the living thursday at 
the site of the auschwitz and birkenau death camps as poland 
honored its victims of nazi germany 
in warsaw hundreds of academics and historians gathered at the 
state jewish theater for a twoday conference on the struggle and 
martyrdom of jews and poles during the 193945 nazi occupation 
the march and the conference began a week of observances of the 
45th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising in which several 
hundred jews fought a threeweek battle against hitlers army the 
uprising began april 19 1943 
the observance is the largest ever organized in poland to honor 
the memory of the millions of victims of the nazi holocaust who 
died on polish soil 
among those attending the conference were several polish 
government ministers senior communist party officials and roman 
catholic bishops 
despite the somber commemorations the chief foreign ministry 
spokesman denounced israel for violating the basic human rights of 
young palestinians demonstrating against the israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
stefan staniszewski told a warsaw news conference that poland 
wanted to pay homage to the jewish ghetto fighters who were 
polish citizens and fought together with us against the nazis 
but he said this emotional attitude does not influence our 
policies towards israel 
the brutality of the repressions used by israeli authorities 
toward the palestinian population evokes popular outrage and 
condemnation around the world said staniszewski we 
categorically protest against the israeli policies 
as light snow fell the march began near the auschwitz camps 
main gates where the legend in german reads work makes you 
free 
the bluejacketed youths marching behind a banner reading 
march of the living trekked two miles to the site of the 
birkenau death camp 
there as a cold wind whistled through the vast open field still 
surrounded by double rows of barbed wire fences and wooden watch 
towers the young jews lit a memorial flame and scattered soil from 
israel by the monument they followed a cantor in saying kaddish 
the hebrew prayer for the dead 
auschwitz is the german name for the polish city of oswiecim 
where the camp was located the monument also commemorates the camp 
at birkenau where the germans built huge gas chambers and 
crematoria 
in an emotional ceremony by the stark gray international 
monument honoring those who died at the two camps israeli 
officials declared that only a strong jewish state could prevent 
another holocaust the marchers carried blueandwhite israeli 
flags 
it is the obligation of every jew to feel solidarity with 
every other jew said israeli deputy prime minister itzhak navon 
the highestranking israeli official ever to visit poland 
only by strengthening the state of israel multiplying and 
increasing our numbers can we prevail navon said speaking in 
hebrew and english 
more than 4500 foreign visitors have come to poland to take 
part in the observances that end april 20 including some 2000 
israelis and hundreds of jews from the united states canada latin 
america western europe and australia 
the observances climax tuesday the anniversary of the outbreak 
of the uprising in which several hundred jewish insurgents staged 
a desperate threeweek struggle against the final nazi 
extermination drive to liquidate the ghettos last 75000 
inhabitants 
one visitor to the camps museum ayelet kuper 15 of montreal 
canada said it was emotionally wrenching to look at a room full of 
childrens shoes taken from victims before they were murdered 
and there was a small crutch like for an 8year old she 
said that got to me a lot 
more than 4 million people died at auschwitz and birkenau about 
70 percent of whom were jews

if the united states and the soviet union team 
up for an interplanetary mission a trip to the moon would be 
preferable to shooting for mars nasa administrator james c 
fletcher said thursday 
a mars mission would probably span four or five presidential 
administrations requiring a degree of stable relations that has 
not been demonstrated between the two countries fletcher said 
the soviet union has favored a joint mission to mars but such a 
proposal has not gone beyond the talking stage 
fletcher said a program of cooperative unmanned activities 
should take place before astronauts and cosmonauts climb into a 
space ship for the twoyear round trip to mars 
flying out to mars together before building such a foundation 
could for several reasons be less practical he said 
fletcher spoke to the national space symposium in colorado 
springs colo on the same day that the national aeronautics and 
space administration formally advised congress that cutbacks in 
money will delay completion of a us space station for a year 
until late 1996 
the first of 16 shuttle flights needed to put men and materials 
into orbit is expected to be early in 1995 instead of 1994 
that puts the completion target date four years behind the 
schedule set originally the united states had planned to have the 
space station up and working in 1992 as a celebration of the 500th 
anniversary of columbus discovery of america 
in a letter to the chairmen of the house and senate committees 
that oversee nasa fletcher said that by revising the schedule a 
robot laboratory should operating in 1995 the laboratory had been 
slated for the sixth shuttle supply mission it now is on the 
fourth 
the realities of the federal budget environment are clear 
fletcher told rep edward p boland dmass and sen william 
proxmire dwis 
nasa had asked for 767 million for the space station in the 
current fiscal year but received 425 million the agency wanted 
18 billion in the year that begins oct 1 but president reagans 
budget proposes 1 billion 
fletcher said that left nasa three options cutting down on the 
station changing the way the program is managed or stretching out 
the time to build the station 
the third approach is the only sensible way fletcher said 
more than four years and 600 million already have gone into 
planning the station configuration 
the scope of the station cant be cut further without 
jeopardizing the safety and usefulness of the station fletcher 
said the facility which will be home to crews of six and eight 
for months at a time originally was to cost 8 billion but that 
figure will have quadrupled when all costs including those of 
stretch out and delays are taken into account 
the european space agency and japan plan to attach their own 
modules to the station structure and canada will contribute the 
shuttle docking facilities 
fletcher called the space station a major investment in the 
nations future by providing a research and technology laboratory 
an earth and celestial observatory and a point of departure for 
the expansion of human presence and activity into the solar 
system 
in colorado springs fletcher said both the united states and 
the soviets realize that many technical unknowns are involved in a 
manned mars mission such as the effects of prolonged 
weightlessness on humans 
the united states has experience with moon walkers while the 
soviets have amassed data through lengthy stays on their space 
stations

you you you the familiar chant of 
fans of ultraconservative morton downey jr rang out in a 
municipal courtroom as the talk show host was cleared of charges 
that he assaulted a gay rights activist during a program 
judge emil delbaglivo found downey innocent of assaulting andrew 
humm a 34yearold spokesman for the coalition for lesbian and gay 
rights 
delbaglivo watched a videotape of the show and listened to 
testimony during a 4hour trial wednesday before issuing his 
decision 
the 55yearold downey flashed his familiar toothy grin to the 
crowd after the verdict and said i am very pleased downey 
faced up to six months in jail and a 1000 fine had he been 
convicted 
downey was charged with assaulting humm dec 9 during the taping 
of a show that involved a discussion of the role of the catholic 
church in the modern world the taping at wwortv in secaucus was 
interrupted by a bomb threat and the show was never broadcast 
the judge said there were conflicting eyewitness accounts so the 
key evidence was the 25minute videotape 
the tape shows downey in a facetoface argument with humm 
downey said keep your bodily fluids to yourself as he wiped a 
small amount of spittle from his face 
humm said the comment about bodily fluids implied that because 
he was a gay person he also had aids and that his fluids were to 
be feared 
on the tape humm replied with an epithet fumbled with the 
microphone and raised his right arm downey abruptly struck humms 
arm away and in doing so he grazed humms face downey then 
admonished humm watch your language 
downeys attorney thomas roth of newark argued that the blow 
did not cause pain to humm and presented a neurologist who 
testified that it would have been impossible for humm to be injured 
humm testified i felt humiliated and it stung there was no 
sustained injury but it hurt

since the commander did not stick to the flight parameters set 
by the air traffic controller the plane found itself in a 
position as to the landing strip which made safe landing 
impossible the report said 
the plane therefore made a rough landing away from the landing 
strip it was wrecked by overloads and burst into flames tass 
said 
the report said copilot v shuneiko was flying the plane while 
commander a shavrovich was talking with the air traffic controller 
about switching runways 
flight director v maltsev met the crews request but in 
doing so in violation of the rules he failed to switch on ground 
radio facilities for a landing approach and organize observation of 
weather in the direction of the landing course tass said 
the plane was on a 1600mile flight across the western soviet 
union when it crashed at its final stop 
rescue operations were impaired by poorly trained personnel and 
insufficient technical facilities at surgut the report said 
by the results of the investigation the ministry of civil 
aviation is taking necessary steps to rule out a recurrence of such 
aircraft accidents the report said but did not give details

a state senate committee reversing the stand it 
took last year voted 54 thursday to approve a martin luther king 
holiday for arizona 
the issue has been a source of national controversy since 
thengov evan mecham rescinded a holiday that his predecessor had 
proclaimed without legislative approval 
the sponsor of the measure democrat carolyn walker of phoenix 
said she was confident the full senate and house will approve the 
bill if it gets through the senates republican majority caucus 
the house passed a similar measure 3525 last year 
government committee chairman john mawhinney of tucson and 
republican member carol macdonald of safford switched their votes 
mrs macdonald did not explain her reasons but mawhinney said he 
felt it was time to provide spiritual as well as physical help to 
those in need 
the bill is virtually identical to last years and would conform 
arizonas practice to the federal governments instead of being 
called a king holiday the new day off would be known as martin 
luther king jrcivil rights day however and instead of being 
known as presidents day the combined lincoln and washington 
holidays would be known as george washingtonabraham lincoln day 
mecham was removed by a senate court of impeachment earlier this 
month and his successor gov rose mofford sent her chief of 
staff to the committee thursday to join religious union and 
tourism industry officials in urging passage of the bill 
the measure would combine the holidays for george washington and 
abraham lincoln into a single february holiday and create a january 
holiday for king 
although mecham said that he rescinded the proclaimed holiday on 
the advice of attorney general bob corbin and that his democratic 
predecessor gov bruce babbitt usurped a legislative prerogative 
in ordering state money spent on a holiday the action generated an 
international controversy 
starting with a march of more than 10000 people on the state 
capitol the unrest dogged mecham for the remainder of his term he 
was removed from office april 4 the 20th anniversary of kings 
assassination through a senate impeachment conviction

mayor bernie simon who died thursday after 
battling cancer for a year was eulogized by friends and colleagues 
as a common man and a hero who enjoyed a love affair with his city 
simon 60 was taken to methodist hospital from his home at 450 
am after his wife betty realized he wasnt breathing city 
officials said simon was dead on arrival 
an autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death 
council member walt calinger said the mayor learned not to 
give up and fought hard until the end at a time when we worry 
about not having heroes and not having role models bernie was a 
hero 
simon who replaced mayor mike boyle when boyle was recalled 
last year was stricken with cancer two months after taking office 
he was hospitalized off and on for treatment but kept up a full 
schedule at city hall until last month 
when he was released from a hospital stay earlier this month 
his doctor denied he was dying and said he expected the mayor to 
return to work within two weeks 
fellow politicians described simon on thursday as someone who 
gave others the courage to live 
if you were to ask me about bernie only two words would come 
to mind courage and leadership said acting mayor fred conley 
who took over for simon temporarily last month 
as recently as 10 days ago conley said simon showed him 
pictures of his grandchildren and said he was planning a party to 
celebrate his return to office 
he had been very positive and upbeat about his cancer he 
thought he had a good chance of beating it conley said 
gov kay orr called him a man of peace and concord he loved 
being mayor he loved serving the people and in public service he 
gave the very essence of his nature a spirit of unity which 
brought the people of omaha together 
he was really just a common guy that sincerely wanted not for 
himself but for the city of omaha to be successful during his 
term council member steve tomasak said 
simon a democrat was first elected to the city council in 
1981 he was named mayor feb 3 1987 after boyle was recalled to 
serve the remaining 2 years of boyles term 
simon had said becoming mayor was a lifelong dream but after 
taking office he was diagnosed as having an inoperable tumor in 
his lung that tumor was destroyed during treatment but two more 
tumors were later found in his brain 
dont look so gloomy he told reporters at the time ive 
whipped cancer before and im going to whip this one 
radiation treatments and chemotherapy reduced the tumors but 
weakened by treatment simon was stricken with shingles on his eyes 
and became mentally disoriented 
conley said at a city hall news conference that he would 
continue as acting mayor until the council meets after simons 
funeral to choose a new mayor 
a native of omaha simon graduated from creighton preparatory 
high school in 1945 and then served briefly in the us navy before 
the end of world war ii 
he worked as a telephone lineman later moving up to marketing 
manager before retiring from the telephone company in 1981 
im not ready to sit down in a rocking chair simon said 
when he took over as mayor its a zest for life 
survivors include his wife three sons a daughter and six 
grandchildren

evangelist jerry falwell said thursday he 
welcomed tough measures taken against fallen tv minister jimmy 
swaggart and said that america is not ready for a pat robertson or 
jesse jackson in the white house 
i have no problem with reverend jackson running as long as he 
loses falwell said 
i dont think the american people want a reverend it has 
nothing to do with democrat republican black white liberal 
conservative i dont think the american people are ready for a 
reverend to be in the white house and i think its a pretty good 
idea one never is 
falwells comments came as part of a panel discussion on 
televangelists on the second day of a threeday convention of the 
american society of newspaper editors 
an estimated 685 editors attending the convention also heard 
from jackson and his fellow democratic presidential hopeful albert 
gore as well as from house speaker jim wright dtexas and costa 
rican president oscar arias winner of the nobel peace prize for 
his efforts to end fighting in central america 
falwell said he was pleased that television representatives in 
the national religious broadcasters had agreed to recommend that 
all christian stations drop swaggarts religious program if he 
returns to preaching before his oneyear suspension expires 
that doesnt mean all the stations have to comply with that 
requirement falwell said but my guess is that most of them 
will 
falwell along with panelists jeffrey k hadden sociology 
professor at the university of virginia and tulsa okla tribune 
reporter mary hargrove told the editors that the sex scandals that 
brought down swaggart and jim and tammy faye bakker marked the end 
of an era for televangelists 
were witnessing a serious readjustment of the work of 
religious politics hadden said 
the questions about financial accountability already had been 
raised the sex scandals were the final icing on the cake 
hargrove said 
falwell said he believes it was inevitable that these 
catastrophies occurred and said it was not the press that brought 
down the bakkers and swaggart they brought themselves down 
frankly he said an inevitable housecleaning was overdue 
yes its hurt everybody but the major hurt is the terrible 
damage done to the value systems and the principle systems of young 
people in this country 
falwell who took over the debtridden ptl ministry after the 
bakkers departure and resigned from it late last year said one 
good thing had come out of the bakkerswaggart sex scandals the 
end of televangelists celebrity status 
there will never again and i thank god its true be a person 
that people look to as god celebrity status is history 
earlier in the day the editors heard a plea from wright to 
cover all the details of a comprehensive trade bill now before 
congress he called the measure one of the most important now on 
capitol hill 
you hold the keys to developing thoughtful commentary on 
events wright said

the chairman of a house appropriations panel 
on thursday called for suspension of us aid to its three poorest 
nato allies and stormed out of a hearing to protest the 
administrations failure to produce details of previous assistance 
to the countries 
rep david obey dwis chairman of the subcommittee on foreign 
operations told state and defense department witnesses he was 
fed up with getting this mush from you you must really think 
were saps up here 
he then suspended the hearing after only 50 minutes and strode 
out of the room 
there was no sense in my sitting listening for the information 
only to be told they they didnt have it obey told the ap later 
that was the same thing they said before 
at the root of the dispute are demands by congress that other 
nato members spend more money on the defense of the alliance in 
what is known as burden sharing 
obeys outburst was prompted by the administrations failure to 
provide the committee with detailed lists of the surplus military 
equipment being transferred to greece turkey and portugal this 
year 
obey said he had asked for the lists several months ago to help 
the committee decide how to allocate funds for the administrations 
1989 spending request of 14 billion for the three countries 
where the united states maintains military bases and some 15000 
personnel 
the three are the poorest members of nato and the 
administration contends the united states must fund them in order 
to ensure continued basing rights 
obey a vocal foe of us spending on nato allies said the 
united states should not be engaged in unilateral welfare 
efforts for these countries rather he said the aid should be a 
joint nato effort 
my view is that there should be zero funding this year for 
base rights countries he said 
obey claimed that taxpayers in athens wis are paying more for 
the defense of greece than those in athens greece my taxpayers 
are fed up with this and so am i 
the us taxpayer spends more than 1000 a year on the defense 
of the free world while british taxpayers spend per capita 488 
the french 511 the west germans 433 and the japanese 163 obey 
said were being taken for a ride 
obey railed against such nato members as west germany who 
constantly lecture us on our deficit and on managing our economy 
but fail to share the burden of maintaining the us presence in 
europe 
deputy assistant secretary of state charles thomas defending 
the administrations spending request which is 41 percent higher 
than the base rights funding of 1981 said us interests clearly 
lie in a continued us presence in europe our border begins 
there he said 
deputy assistant secretary of defense john a woodworth said in 
his testimony that while us defense spending grew much more than 
that of other nato members in the years between 1981 and 1986 
that pattern is now reversed 
he said several nato countries among them italy greece 
norway spain and turkey increased their defense spending by about 
3 percent in 1987 while the us increase was only 01 percent and 
in 1988 it will decline more than 3 percent

a federal judge who was the justice 
departments antitrust chief testified thursday before a grand jury 
investigating conflictofinterest allegations against attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
circuit judge douglas h ginsburg apparently was questioned 
about meeses role in formulating justice department policy on the 
breakup of american telephone amp telgraph co stock at a time when 
the attorney general owned telephone stock 
ginsburg who headed the antitrust division in 1985 and 1986 
presumably was asked about his knowledge of meetings meese had with 
executives of four of the seven regional telephone companies formed 
by the 1984 breakup of atampt 
meese meetings with executives of the socalled baby bell 
companies when he and his wife owned 91 shares of baby bell stock 
is being investigated by independent counsel james c mckay for 
possible conflictofinterest violations 
as of april 1 mckay said there was insufficient evidence to 
bring criminal charges against the attorney general in connection 
with the baby bell stock or other matters still under investigation 
but the investigation is expected to continue until months end 
when mckay is prepared to issue a report if he does not bring 
charges 
at the time of their meetings with meese officials of the baby 
bells were seeking a modification of the 1984 decree that would 
allow them to manufacture telephone equipment and offer 
longdistance and computer services 
in an aboutface last year the justice department urged us 
district judge harold greene to allow the baby bells to expand 
their operations to include equipment manufacturing longdistance 
and computer services 
the meeses sold their shares in the baby bell stock for 14000 
last summer 
greene denied most of the request by the government and the baby 
bells except that he allowed the regional companies to perform 
some types of information services 
before joining the us circuit court of appeals here in late 
1986 ginsburg had been assistant attorney general in charge of the 
antitrust division previously he had been the no 2 official in 
the division 
there was no immediate comment from the judges chambers about 
ginsburgs testimony 
last year he was nominated to a vacancy on the supreme court 
but withdrew his name from consideration following reports that he 
had once used marijuana and allegations of possible 
conflictofinterest arising from his ownership of stock in a 
company that is one of the largest operators of cable television 
systems 
a preliminary inquiry conducted by the justice department 
examined 16 instances in which ginsburg dealt with cable industry 
issues while holding the stock but determined that either his 
participation or chance of gain was too minimal to violate 
conflictofinterest laws

philippine president corazon aquino visited the 
home of her chinese ancestors on thursday while her nation 
remained her nation was on full military alert amid concerns of a 
coup attempt during her absence 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno played down the threat of 
a coup attempt at home despite the escape from prison of former 
lt col gregorio honasan who tried to overthrow the president in 
august 
mr honasan has lost all capability of mounting any serious 
threat on the government benigno said if there was any 
question about that then the president would have wavered in her 
decision to come to china but not for one minute did she waver in 
her plans 
the president accompanied by seven cabinet ministers was 
greeted by vice foreign minister liu shuqing and taken to the 
diaoyutai state guest house where she will stay during her 
threeday visit to china 
on friday she will be officially welcomed by president yang 
shangkun outside the great hall of the people and will hold talks 
with premier li peng she is also to sign a trade protocol and a 
science and technology agreement 
mrs aquino is also to meet senior leader deng xiaoping on 
saturday before leaving for an overnight stay in hong kong 
in fujian province mrs aquino visited her ancestral village of 
hongjian mrs aquinos greatgrandfather xu yuhuan lived there 
until leaving for the philippines 120 years ago 
village residents waved yellow banners and chinese and 
philippine flags and set off firecrackers while a school band 
played crowds lined the roads passing through fertile terraced 
farmland 
at the xu family ancestral temple which had been restored and 
painted for the visit mrs aquino burned incense and bowed three 
times before memorial tablets 
i came to china for reasons of state and for reasons personal 
to me for i am both head of state of my country and in a way a 
daughter of this village she told 49 relatives she was meeting 
for the first time 
the end of traveling we are told is to return i have 
returned for my family and for other filipinos of chinese descent 
to retrace their steps and attain some understanding of the 
industry and creativity that led them forth to new beginnings in 
other lands she said 
she ended the speech by saying in chinese i and my daughters 
and my colleagues again thank you for your welcome which we will 
never forget 
mrs aquino visited a kindergarten where she gave yellow cory 
aquino tshirts to the children and looked at family photos in 
the home of an uncle xu yuanxiang her visit to hongjian lasted a 
little more than an hour 
fujian gov wang zhaoguo hosted mrs aquino at a lavish banquet 
and thanked the president for her gift to hongjian of a playground 
to be built with 15000 in donations by philippine businessmen 
the philippine military was put on full alert nationwide and 
opposition leaders suggested she should scrub the trip to china 
because of political unrest at home mrs aquinos last trip abroad 
was in november 1986 to japan 
she said that canceling the trip would be the greatest folly 
because she wanted to show china that we have at least achieved 
the internal political stability and peace to play a responsible 
and important role that is expected of us in asian affairs

junior high school drama and three shows on the constitutions 
anniversary were among 23 programs honored by a childrens 
television advocacy group thursday 
action for childrens television presented its annual 
achievement awards to radio and video programs from boston to 
portland ore at its 20th anniversary celebration 
these are programs that have something special to pat them on 
their back said peggy charren who founded the 15000member 
organization that monitors childrens programming this is what 
children need and deserve from tv 
among the winners in the commercial television category was the 
updated mighty mouse the new adventures by animator ralph 
bakshi who created the 1971 featurelength adult cartoon 
fritz the cat 
mighty mouse is tv animation the way it used to be 
charren said its not trying to sell something and it has 
something to say to children even while its showing mighty mouse 
come to save the day 
the cartoon originally appeared on television from 1955 to about 
1966 
it doesnt talk down to children said bakshi 48 who also 
made the lord of the rings and heavy traffic in the 1970s 
i wanted to make sure the level of writing was not below an adult 
level 
act had a separate award category for programs about the 200th 
anniversary of the constitution among the winners was cbs the 
day they came to arrest the book based on a story by journalist 
nat hentoff about attempts to ban mark twains novel huckleberry 
finn 
in public television act gave an award to degrassi junior 
high from wgbh in boston which it called a stimulating tv 
series on adolescents in action

programming for children citing the demise of cbss in the 
news and other news shows in the last year act last fall began 
campaigning for an increase in news for children 
its so important because this is the information that kids 
need so that when they to be 18 they can vote charren said

unclear each state felony count carries with it up to four years 
in prison and a 500000 fine the federal counts carry sentences 
of up to five years in prison and fines of up to 250000 
the extortion conspiracy count however can bring up to 20 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
mrs helmsley who is prominent in ads for a string of hotels 
recently turned down a deal from prosecutors who said they would 
not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if she pleaded guilty 
to fraud a source has said 
giuliani at the news conference also congratulated the new 
york post for its investigative reporting involving the helmsleys 
finances the post over the last 15 months ran a series of 
articles about the couple 
as many as 30 past and current employees of the helmsley 
organization reportedly were given immunity from prosecution in 
return for testimony before state and federal grand juries 
giuliani refused to comment on that

an egyptianamerican released after eight days as 
a hostage said the islamic radicals who seized a kuwait airways 
jumbo jet overlooked his us drivers license 
one of them searched my wallet and there was my drivers 
license ramadan ali said during an interview at the home of a 
relative in kuwait i was so lucky he didnt realize what it 
was 
ali was one of 12 passengers freed tuesday night shortly before 
the hijackers of the boeing 747 flew from cyprus to algeria with 
more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard 
fearful the hijackers would harm him if they knew of his us 
citizenship ali said he hid his us passport in his briefcase and 
used his egyptian documents 
when the jet stopped in iran immediately after the hijacking 
they collected al our briefcases and put them in a closet and 
closed it he said 
for the rest of his captivity he said he worried that one might 
search his case and discover the document but they had no time 
to do it 
ali who displayed bruises on his wrists said the hijackers 
used plastic handcuffs on the passengers after two days in iran and 
left them on constantly after that 
clamping your hands 24 hours you have to eat your hand is 
tied go the the bathroom your hand is tied he said 
the eightday ordeal left him nervous emotionally stunned and 
wary of flying ali said 
it became to me like a phobia he said it could happen 
again 
he withheld his american address because these guys they have 
long hands 
ali a consulting engineer who travels widely said security at 
bangkok airport was loose like a farmers market 
he said he saw passengers who set off alarms on metal detectors 
pass unsearched as he was boarding the flight for kuwait 
he agreed with other passengers reports that the hijackers 
appeared to take on weapons and two new colleagues during four days 
at mashhad airport in iran their first stop 
but he said he did not actually see any weapons or new men come 
aboard he said screens were drawn across the firstclass cabin 
where the hijackers stayed and all the aircrafts window shades 
were pulled down 
after we left mashhad i saw three machine guns which he 
said were small weapons resembling the israelimade uzi 
he said he also saw 10 hand grenades thick ropes explosives 
and plastic hand grenades only after the plane had been in mashhad 
he said two new hijackers appeared to join the six younger ones 
when the plane was in iran he described the newcomers as older 
men 30 to 40 who were giving orders to the others 
one by one he said they called passengers to the front 
compartments to question them about their jobs nationalities 
families and religion 
he said the people called forward most often were the two 
kuwaitis who were shot to death in cyprus although passengers did 
not know of the killings until their release 
ali said the hijackers also asked the branch of islam he 
belonged to sunni or shiite 
all of the kuwaiti men released so far have been shiites 
members of the branch that predominates in iran and southern 
lebanon but is a minority in most of the islamic world 
i was reading the koran all the time they noticed im a 
religious person he said speculating that might have helped in 
his release 
he said he tried to pray and that others tried to join in but 
he said the attempt to practice standard islamic prayers which 
require standing then kneeling toward mecca made the hijackers 
nervous 
they said hey guys if you want to pray pray in your 
seats

the violent realistic gang drama colors 
opens friday at 425 theaters across the country amid a debate 
between its critics and its makers over whether the film will 
inspire more youth violence 
a spokesman for one group of law enforcement officers says the 
movie will leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the 
other but the filmmakers say the film is a statement of 
conscience and will save lives 
this is not the right time to release a movie like this 
said los angeles city councilman nate holden since april 4 there 
have been 89 gangrelated deaths in los angeles city and county 
last year there were 387 gangrelated deaths in the area 
if there is anything this picture does not do it does not 
glorify gangs or gang violence said charles o glenn executive 
vice president for the distributor new yorkbased orion pictures 
in new york on thursday six members of the guardian angels a 
community anticrime group were arrested during a protest outside 
orion headquarters the group planned a protest later thursday in 
los angeles 
the movie starring sean penn and rubert duvall as gangfighting 
los angeles policemen was directed by dennis hopper and used 
active area gang members as extras and advisers the film portrays 
the world of the crips and the bloods rival gangs who use the 
colors blue and red respectively to distinguish themselves 
it was made with the technical advice assistance and 
cooperation of the lapd its antigang crash unit the sheriffs 
department of los angeles and the los angeles county probation 
department glenn said 
but it has drawn strong criticism from some police city 
officials the naacp community leaders and the guardian angels 
wes mcbride president of the california gang investigators 
association believes colors will leave dead bodies from one 
end of this town to the other 
a release of this film may tip the scale in such a way that 
will only result in more loss of young lives said willis 
edwards president of the beverly hillshollywood naacp chapter 
i think the people who are making those predictions are 
whipping up the probability and the possibility of violence 
hopper said the people who are saying blood is going to flow in 
the streets are asking for blood to flow in the streets i think 
its very irresponsible behavior 
about 70 theaters in the los angeles area alone plan to show 
colors many critics called on theaters to cancel the movie 
the downtown laemmle grand did just that the staff at the 
theater were in a panic because the home turf of one of the gangs 
in the movie is just a couple of miles from downtown said bob 
laemmle theater chain coowner 
but joel maliniak spokesman for the american civil liberties 
union of southern california said officials should be finding 
solutions to the gang problem rather than prohibiting something 
from being shown 
district attorney ira reiner said he believes the movie will 
galvanize support for the countys war on gangs 
at a celebrity showing wednesday night which drew cher marlee 
matlin richard dean anderson bono hewson and emilio estevez 10 
members of the guardian angels marched and chanted dont show 
colors 
there is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a 
gang said hopper who also attended the vip showing 
five guardian angels were arrested tuesday when they tried to 
force their way into orions los angeles offices the angels 
including group founder curtis sliwa who has called the movie 
racist and irresponsible were arrested for investigation of 
battery after allegedly pushing and tackling security guards 
we feel that colors is an honest and socially responsible 
portrayal of a problem that obviously exists in los angeles and in 
the streets of every other american city glenn said 
he called colors a significant work by filmmakers of 
substance and integrity and likened it to statement movies made 
in the past including gentlemans agreement about 
antisemitism i am a fugitive from a chain gang about legal 
injustice platoon about the futility of combat and on the 
waterfront about waterfront gangs

rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade 
deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average dropped about 
101 points while in the currency markets the value of the dollar 
fell 2 percent against major currencies interest rates on a key 
longterm us treasury bond jumped to a threemonth high

commerce department reported this morning that the nations trade 
deficit had risen to 138 billion in february that was the 
biggest shortfall since the record of 176 billion in october and 
the second monthly increase in a row many economists had been 
expecting the deficit to narrow 
the dow jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of 
the opening bell on the new york stock exchange then stabilized for

skidded to a 10146point loss at 200563 a 48 percent drop 
according to a prelimary calculation 
it was the worst decline since the dow plunged 14058 points on 
jan 8 
the dows decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of 
computerized program trading on the new york stock exchange the 
first time the collar has been triggered by a decline of 50 
points or more in the dow 
the dollar was down about 19 percent against the british pound 
about 19 percent against the west german mark and about 22 
percent against the japanese yen at midafternoon 
the impact also was felt in the bond market an important

about 1250 for every 1000 in face amount and its yield which 
moves inversely to price surged to 8855 percent the highest in 
three months

conservatives opened a drive against the new 
ussoviet arms treaty on thursday and former defense secretary 
caspar w weinberger said he had no reason to believe the pact bans 
futuristic weapons such as lasers 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva vowed once more 
not to call up the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty for 
debate on the senate floor until the futuristic weapons issue is 
cleared up 
the senate armed services committee convened a secret session to 
discuss the issue which byrd has said may represent a hole in 
the treaty 
although there has been pressure on the senate to complete work 
on the pact before president reagan leaves for his moscow summit 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in late may byrd 
told reporters im not driven by a calendar deadline i want 
first last and always to have a good treaty 
the treaty makes no specific mention of futuristic weapons such 
as lasers or particle beam generators that may be used in a us 
star wars defense but reagan administration negotiators have said 
the soviet union understands the treaty does bar the possession or 
flight testing of all mediumrange weapons no matter how they are 
armed or operate 
weinberger in a letter told sen daniel quayle rind i 
can simply state that there was no understanding of any kind that i 
knew about that the treaty covered anything related to these 
socalled futuristic weapons 
a similar letter was received from kenneth adelman former head 
of the arms control and disarmament agency 
weinberger said certainly there was no discussion or 
evaluation of the military sufficiency questions involved in 
banning futuristic weaponry that i ever participated in and i 
never heard any others having such a discussion 
he said it was his clear understanding us negotiators were 
talking only about existing types of mediumrange ballistic or 
cruise missiles 
indeed had their been any suggestions that futuristic 
weapons were banned i would have opposed it in the strongest 
possible terms because it would have had an obvious adverse effect 
on the strategic defense initiative for us to agree to any 
limitation on any systems not yet designed or futuristic 
systems weinberger said 
he said such a ban also would heve enabled the soviets to 
argue that they have finally succeeded in making our sdi efforts 
ineffective 
adelman also said he was never aware of a ban on futuristic 
weapons ever being discussed in any national security council 
meeting he attended or in any meeting with soviet officials with 
which i am familiar 
meanwhile howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus 
announced the opening of a nationwide campaign to defeat the treaty 
or to delay senate consent to its ratification 
treaty supporters have said they can count only a handful of 
senators firmly committed to vote against the pact ratification 
requires a twothirds vote 67 senators if all 100 are present 
phillips told reporters that black umbrellas emblazoned with 
antitreaty slogans would be delivered to the offices of all 100 
senators to symbolize the beginning of a campaign in which he said 
organizers would attempt to rally public opinion against the pact 
in a letter accompanying the umbrellas phillips gave this 
explanation 
open the unbrella symbolizes the protective shield which for 
more than four decades has prevented soviet domination and 
intimidation of europe 
closed the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of 
appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized british 
prime minister neville chamberlains dealings with adolph hitler 
at munich precisely 50 years ago 
phillips said conservative groups would purchase television time 
to present a 30minute film attacking the treaty and were sending 
letters to 250000 conservative activists to begin a grassroots 
campaign 
the inf treaty requires the destruction of all us and soviet 
missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3400 miles 
the us force of pershing 2 ballistic missiles and 
groundlaunched cruise missiles was deployed several years ago to 
counter the soviet deployment of mediumrange ss20 missiles

lior a 13yearold israeli and salam a 
12yearold palestinian didnt agree on much but an editor who 
published their letter exchange in his newspaper said it was the 
start of a fresh dialogue 
if our generation failed to communicate maybe this young 
generation can do a better job said othman hallak editor of the 
an nahar newspaper hallak is known for his moderate projordanian 
views 
an nahar on wednesday published a twopage missive by lior kay 
from tel aviv who called for an end to rioting criticized arab 
extremism and asked palestnian children to write to him 
in response the newspaper received several letters from arab 
children and phone calls from interested israelis hallak said 
one arab youth 12yearold salam ismail obeidat from jerusalem 
appealed for an end to violence by israels army his letter is to 
be published friday 
in his letter wednesday the first by an israeli to be published 
in an nahar kay wrote 
i like the palestinian people and i understand the reason of 
your anger which is your refusal of the occupation and which is 
your right to refuse live under it 
through your newspaper im asking the representatives of the 
palestinian people and the palestinian children to stop violence 
and start negotiations 
i want to point out that extremists among your people were a 
reason for rightwing extremists among our people your rejection 
of the occupation does not have to harm the israeli children and 
pregnant women 
you have the historical right and we also a historical 
right kay wrote 
responded obeidat 
i reject the occupation because it stole my land my freedom 
and my school 
i dont think when i ask for my freedom and my state that i am 
commiting a violent act or being an extremist if you lior were a 
palestinian boy i think you probably would have fought the 
occupation as the palestinian kids are fighting 
we are not the reason for your suffering lior this is not 
our fault but you are the reason of our suffering this is your 
fault 
obeidat said israelis who returned to their ancient homeland had 
not been considerate of the palestinians living on the same land 
when you came back to live beside us what is the gift which 
you brought for me an airplane a tank a gun and tear gas bombs 
is that a peaceful offering from a peaceful child lior 
i am asking the jews to quit using physical force weapons 
and tear gas which kills love and peace and innocents like me and 
like you 
this is the only way to build the bridges for peace and love 
between our nations and to build a peaceful state

vice president george bush declined thursday 
to criticize jesse jackson saying it would be a little 
arrogant for him to assail a potential democratic presidential 
rival at this point in the campaign 
bush apparently on his way to the republican nomination would 
not bite at reporters questions about whether he agreed with 
president reagans assertion on wednesday that some people are 
reluctant to criticize jackson because he is black 
i havent started punching any of the democrats bush 
replied when questioned during a picturetaking session with costa 
rican president oscar arias sanchez at the white house 
a day before reagan who has remained officially neutral in the 
republican party presidential race took a swipe at jackson a 
major contender for the democratic nomination 
answering a question during his appearance before the american 
society of newspaper editors reagan said he hoped that race will 
not be a part of this campaign in any way 
i have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves 
in great disagreement with the policies that he jackson is 
proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasnt 
for concern that that be misinterpreted into some kind of racial 
attack the president said 
bush said that his preference was to wait until there is one 
slowmoving target out there 
and i have decided that it would be a little arrogant 
somewhat presumptuous to involve myself in the democratic side of 
this thing the vice president said 
theyre working hard i give them credit for that bush 
said im trying to do the same thing myself on our side and we 
would have been quite resentful if any one of them had started 
singling out a republican for criticism thats what the general 
election is about 
bush said there will be plenty of time for that so ive not 
been involved in going after jesse jackson or mike dukakis or al 
gore or the others 
youll see a hardhitting tough in my view close election in 
the fall bush said but the american people are going to have 
a clear choice the issues that they are running on or the 
philosophy that they are running on are quite different than what 
ill be running on 
later bush met with former former delaware gov pete du pont 
who dropped out of the presidential race in february in response 
to questions bush said he would make no decisions about a running 
mate until after the democratic convention 
du pont said he would consider accepting the spot if bush 
offered it but added it is very difficult to directly change 
things as vice president of the united states

with 234000 already in hand a flabbergasted 
radio station staff on thursday continued counting loot that poured 
in after a disc jockey asked listeners to send 20 checks without 
saying what he would do with the money 
we never promised anybody anything said ron chapman a 
kvilfm disc jockey thats the joy of this we just said send 
the money weve got a back room full of people counting money 
were absolutely stunned were flabbergasted 
chapman said he asked his audience to send him money on march 31 
as an experiment 
after his first request 4000 checks for 20 each arrived in 
the mail the next day on the following monday an additional 5000 
checks arrived a flood so heavy that chapman went on the air to 
say ok folks thats it dont send any more checks after 
today 
the station hasnt decided yet what to do chapman said it 
initially planned to return the checks possibly with 2 interest 
and a tshirt but now is thinking about using it for a special 
event 
the station is keeping contributors names in a computer file 
chapman said 
youve got to be careful youve got to be real up front with 
them especially with their money he said people have been 
angry that we wont let them send in more 
ralph blumberg supervisor of investigations in the mass media 
division of the federal communications commission in washington 
said there is nothing illegal about such a solicitation 
as long as they dont make any promises or say theyll spend 
the money one way and then spend it on something else there 
doesnt sound to be anything fraudulent about that he said 
theres nothing wrong with saying send us your money 
some contributors confirmed chapmans belief that listeners 
trusted kvil to handle their money 
they seem to be legit said linda steel 40 of suburban 
burleson i wouldnt do that for just anything i dont have the 
money 
ms steel also said she was used to participating in contests 
sponsored by the station with cash rewards last month kvil 
broadcast serial numbers of dollar bills and awarded 10000 to a 
person holding a matching bill 
chapman who has offered to return listeners checks on demand 
said the station has received a steady stream of suggestions from 
listeners about what to do with the money 
ms steel said she planned to request 80000 to send her 
daughters high school drill team to australia 
jon mayer 39 a contributor from plano had another suggestion 
multiply it times a million and send it back to me

floridas attorney general asked a 
court thursday to bar a former lawyer for roswell gilbert 
convicted of murdering his ailing wife in a socalled mercy 
killing from spending book and movie profits that form part of his 
legal fees 
attorney general robert butterworth cited floridas socalled 
son of sam law in a petition to the broward county circuit 
court 
butterworth is seeking a lien against 45000 allegedly received 
by joseph a varon for an nbc television movie mercy or 
murder about the killing and any other profits from films or 
books butterworth also wants an injunction barring expenditure of 
such monies pending further investigation 
the law says in the state of florida that a convicted felon 
cannot profit from his crime butterworth said when someone 
owes a debt to an attorney or signs over the book rights to their 
crime in exchange for a legal fee that is a benefit going right to 
the defendant who was convicted therefore we are doing what we 
can to get the money back 
varon has been on an aroundtheworld cruise since january and 
isnt due back until monday said the secretary in his hollywood 
law office 
gilbert 78 a retired engineer was convicted of firstdegree 
murder in 1985 and is serving a life prison term for shooting his 
wife emily in their condominium near fort lauderdale he claimed 
he killed her to end her suffering from alzheimers disease and 
osteoporosis a bone degeneration 
the son of sam law gets its title from the nickname of new york 
serial murderer david berkowitz whose case inspired a similar law 
in that state 
the legislature did not intend to block felons from profiting 
only to have defense lawyers pocket that money butterworth 
said 
the law calls for 25 percent of the proceeds from any such works 
to go to dependents of the felon if he has any and 25 percent to 
the victims of the crime or their dependents the state can recover 
prosecution incarceration and other costs from the remaining 50 
percent 
state investigators have found varon received 50000 for the 
nbctv film which was broadcast last year starring robert young as 
gilbert and that varon now is attempting to sell a book 
butterworth contends 
he said the investigation showed gilbert received only 5000 of 
that amount and donated it to a nonprofit institution for 
alzheimers research

police officers to the west rich street apartment where kennedy 
lived with his wife 
we basically knocked on the door and asked if we could search

republican senate candidate george v 
voinovich who has criticized the extent of sen howard 
metzenbaums outofstate fundraising is planning his own series 
of events outside ohio to raise money a campaign spokesman said 
thursday 
metzenbaum is seeking reelection to a third full term in 
november he is expected to easily win the democratic primary 
against a littleknown opponent but face a stiff challenge from 
voinovich the mayor of cleveland 
the mayor is going to make a prudent number of trips outside 
the state for fundraising but in no way will he be able to match 
the pace of sen metzenbaum said joe wagner voinovich campaign 
spokesman 
we never once said we would reserve ourselves to instate 
fundraising wagner added so i dont see any major change in 
strategy we have made it plain and clear it will take about 7 
million for us to run a strong campaign against sen metzenbaum 
in a march 31 letter mailed nationally to contributors to the 
republican senatorial trust a gop campaign fundraising 
organization voinovich wrote that he will not let metzenbaum 
dominate him in outofohio fundraising 
voinovich events were set for thursday night in pittsburgh and 
friday in st louis and houston other cities where voinovich 
events are planned or being planned include atlanta baltimore new 
york los angeles chicago san francisco and seattle wagner 
confirmed 
in a campaign stop wednesday in cincinnati voinovich said he 
will come nowhere near matching metzenbaum in percentage of 
funds from outside ohio 
if he criticizes me for raising money outside ohio it will be 
a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black voinovich 
said 
voinovich had previously asked metzenbaum to agree to a campaign 
spending cap of 5 million each 
they didnt do it voinovich said 
metzenbaum is expected to raise at least 10 million for his 
reelection campaign 
we have called upon the mayor repeatedly to support the 
campaign finance reform act presently in the senate and he has 
refused to do so said dale butland metzenbaums campaign press 
secretary that bill would also control spending by outside 
groups on behalf of candidates and i dont expect the mayor would 
like that 
according to federal election commission reports filed earlier 
this year about 70 percent of metzenbaums campaign funds had come 
from outside ohio 
butland said that when the next round of fec reports are filed 
the percentage of metzenbaum funds coming from outofstate will 
have reduced substantially over 10000 individual ohioans have 
contributed to the metzenbaum campaign so far butland said

elliott abrams the assistant secretary of 
state who has been persona non grata in the senate foreign 
relations committee since it was revealed he lied about secret us 
efforts to resupply nicaraguas contra rebels has made peace with 
the panels chairman 
in a letter to sen claiborne pell dri abrams apologized 
for misleading testimony he gave the committee on oct 10 1986 
abrams noted in a march 31 letter to pell that he previously had 
apologized to the house intelligence committee for similar 
inaccurate responses to questions about us involvement in a 
private contra aid network and about enlisting foreign governments 
to aid the rebels 
recalling the foreign relations hearing abrams said my 
testimony that day covered much of this same territory and 
accordingly i want to offer you and through you the members of the 
committee the same apology 
on wednesday pell sent a twosentence letter to abrams saying 
your apology is accepted and concluding i look forward to 
your working again with the committee on important latin american 
issues 
during last years irancontra hearings it was disclosed that 
abrams testimony had been wrong at one point abrams told 
investigators he didnt level with congress because he was not 
authorized to tell the truth 
from then on abrams the administrations chief spokesman on 
western hemisphere matters as assistant secretary for 
interamerican affairs ran into credibility problems on capitol 
hill some committees forced him to take an oath of truthfulness 
before permitting him to testify and the foreign relations panel 
placed a flat ban on any appearances 
members of congress complained bitterly that abrams performance 
illustrated an aidatanyprice attitude on the part of the 
administration and said they no longer could trust the 
administration on anything having to do with nicaragua policy 
in an incident march 17 abrams sought to attend an 
administration briefing for senators on a nicaraguanhonduran 
border incident and was turned away at the door of the capitol

arizona political news has been dominated 
recently by the ouster of republican gov evan mecham but 
democrats will reclaim the spotlight at least temporarily with 
presidential caucuses on saturday 
the outcome is viewed as a tossup between michael dukakis who 
has lined up endorsements from key democrats and jesse jackson 
whose firmly committed supporters may be more likely to turn out at 
the caucuses 
i think we can win arizona jackson coordinator john norris 
said thursday because people committed to jesse jackson tend to 
be more apt to go out and vote 
dukakis meanwhile has been gaining endorsements from the likes 
of phoenix mayor terry goddard tucson mayor tom volgy and a 
number of state lawmakers and local government officials 
dukakis campaign spokesman jose villarreal said the endorsements 
were significant because these are all very wellknown and 
respected individuals 
arizonas caucuses begin the process of alloting 36 national 
convention delegates a mere blip compared to the 255 at stake in 
new yorks primary on tuesday the caucuses resemble a primary in 
that voters merely cast their ballots and leave but there are only 
99 polling places statewide far fewer than the 1932 regular 
voting precincts which means democrats must find out where to 
vote and travel farther voters will make two choices a 
presidential preference and a delegate ballot 
jackson is at a distinct advantage under this kind of a 
system villarreal said adding that jackson won in michigan 
which has a similar voting process 
the only objective indicator of support is a survey several 
weeks old that showed dukakis as the choice of 36 percent compared 
to 17 percent for jackson and 4 percent for tennessee sen albert 
gore jr but the poll had a small sample and did not screen for 
likely voters 
i think its anybodys race at this point said one dukakis 
supporter state senate minority leader alan stephens i think 
arizonans are just now focusing on this primary theyve been 
consumed with the mecham trial 
mecham a republican was removed from office on april 4 by the 
senate impeachment court 
jackson supporter sen carolyn walker predicted her candidate 
will win adding i think the diehard jackson supporters are 
going to find their way out to the polls i kind of feel a little 
bit in that dukakis takes arizona for granted 
the new governor rose mofford is a democrat but has not 
endorsed any of the candidates former gov bruce babbitt who 
dropped out of the 1988 race in february appeared with jackson at 
a rally last week but did not endorse him 
jacksons campaign has done no advertising while villarreal 
said dukakis has spent only about 1500 on radio ads statewide 
blacks make up less than 10 percent of arizonas population the 
state keeps no statistics on what percentage of arizonas 158 
million registered voters are minorities 
state party executive director glenn davis said he expected only 
25000 to 30000 of the states registered 683000 democrats to 
vote saturday 
thats why i think jackson can win here because hes well 
organized and his people will go vote davis said 
only registered democrats can vote but the party says it will 
have registrars on hand to register new voters

members of the senate foreign relations 
committee said thursday the reagan administration is running out of 
plans for ousting panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega and 
is doing little to enlist neighboring countries to turn up the 
pressure 
some of us on the committee feel strongly that we must get 
more support from other latin american countries so it does not 
seem as if its a direct confrontation between noriega and the 
united states said sen claiborne pell dri the committee 
chairman 
pell and others attended a briefing by pentagon and state 
department officials on the situation in panama during which 
possible further economic sanctions against the country were 
outlined as well as several topsecret noneconomic options 
mr noriega is getting stronger every day that we do 
nothing said sen jesse helms of north carolina the ranking gop 
member of the committee 
hes getting more arms from cuba while were sitting here 
talking about what weve done for the banks helms said in 
reference to economic sanctions already in place 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said there was a consensus among 
those at the briefing that it is terribly important although 
difficult to get our latin american allies to step forward and 
play a role as much as they dont want noriega in power its 
difficult for them to stand up and be counted in a visible way 
kassebaum said that as the weeks wear on and noriega remains in 
place the more the united states risks a backlash from the 
economic sanctions because of the suffering the sanctions cause for 
panamanian citizens 
it will begin to turn on us and well be blamed she said 
sen john kerry dmass said the reagan administration has 
been sending divided signals that prolong noriegas tenure 
there is no evidence of a major diplomatic effort reaching 
out to other central american leaders or to the internal opposition 
inside panama kerry said the way to avoid the use of troops is 
to pursue these other measures 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva sent a letter to 
president reagan asking that us policy give greater emphasis to 
the common hemispheric interest in combatting drugs noriega has 
been indicted in the united states on drug charges and has been 
accused of turning his country into a haven for drug traffickers 
i believe it is time for the united states to stop going it 
alone and to place this serious problem of general noriega and drug 
dealing before the organization of american states byrd told 
reagan 
that theme was taken up by costa rican president oscar arias 
during an appearance thursday before the american society of 
newspaper editors 
if you act unilaterally in panama youll be isolated arias 
said of us policy 
you need to get support from the rest of central america he 
said adding if you want to punish noriega economic sanctions 
is not the best answer you are then punishing the panamanian 
people but not general noriega 
he said the conflict in panama can only be resolved through 
negotiations

a mailorder minister who claimed his 
religious position made his stopsmoking clinics exempt from 
licensing requirements has been arrested and accused of fabricating 
a plot against city officials police said 
joel witmer 45 of clearwater was charged wednesday with 
threatening a public official a felony bond was set at 50000 
and witmer remained in the pinellas county jail on thursday 
he had told police that members of his religious cult 
planned to kill three city officials because of his dispute over 
the license 
police who put the three officials in protective custody 
eventually concluded there was no such cult and no such plot said 
capt barry glover 
according to investigators witmer claimed that he unwittingly 
released 6000 to his followers with which they planned to buy 
weapons 
in reality police said witmer hatched the plot and the phone 
call tipoff to police in order to frighten licensing officials 
who refused to honor his bid for religious exemption 
witmer told police he has a doctorate degree from the universal 
life church of modesto calif a mailorder outfit that once 
ordained a dog investigators said in a statement 
several years ago witmer was convicted of extortion and 
sentenced to two years in prison after another dispute involving 
the smoking clinics but that conviction was reversed on appeal 
i just hope this arrest will put a stop to mr witmers 
method of attempting to intimidate people and use threats to get 
his own way glover said wednesday we are going to ask for 
restitution at one point or another everybody in this division has 
worked on this case this past week 
witmer has been at odds with clearwater officials since 1985 
when an occupational license for his ufs stopsmoking clinic first 
became an issue according to a police affidavit he conducts the 
clinics at various hotels 
witmer obtained the license in previous years but he refused to 
renew it this year claiming he was exempt because of his religious 
status the city would not recognize a religious exemption 
on april 4 witmer called police and said three members of what 
he described as his own religious cult planned to kill or 
seriously injure city officials because they believed that the city 
was harassing witmer he said he unwittingly helped the plot by 
releasing 6000 to the conspirators witmer promised to try to 
stop his followers from harming city officials but he refused to 
identify them until he was held in contempt of court april 6 
on the way to jail witmer named the conspirators but the 
names he gave were of two florida state university police officers 
who had contact with witmer during one of his prior arrests 
in 1976 he told the editors of a florida state university 
campus newspaper that he would check into hiring a professional 
to rearrange your faces because he thought the newspaper libeled 
him according to an arrest warrant 
the warrant also said during 1976 he threatened the wife of a 
professor who told him the university would not renew his 
stopsmoking clinic contract in 1979 his bid to conduct similar 
clinics at fsu was again turned down 
he threatened to kill everyone involved with the rejection and 
was convicted of extortion witmer was sentenced to two years in 
prison but an appeal court threw out the case ruling that 
authorities erred in their investigation

some palestinians have begun complaining about the economic pinch 
caused by repeated strikes 
at least 146 palestinians have been killed since riots began 
dec 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza strip according to un 
figures and hundreds have been wounded an israeli soldier and a 
15yearold jewish settler also have been slain 
un officials in vienna accused israeli soldiers of using tear

that a peaceful offering for a peaceful child 
quit using force which kills love peace and innocents 
like me and you salem wrote 
israeli officials claimed thursday that the number and size of 
arab protests was declining 
it is clear the level of violence is less but this doesnt 
mean the uprising is over said avi pazner an aide to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
lt gen dan shomron army chief of staff said protests now 
involve only palestinian activists so when soldiers are forced 
to fire they usually hit the inciters themselves 
israeli military commanders in the west bank held riotcontrol 
maneuvers in a deserted neighborhood of nablus and demonstrated a 
helicopter that dumps rocks onto arab protesters palestinians say 
it has been used for at least two weeks 
the most serious clash thursday occurred in the narrow streets

people the leaflet said according to israeli officials nearly 
5000 arabs have been rounded up since violence began in the 
territories israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
farah alaraj mayor of beit jallah said his city observed the 
strike but some palestinians were feeling the seriousness of the 
economic strike 
if no help is given to the people from outside i think within 
one or two months they will get fed up he told israel radio

15yearold daughter of jewish settlers who was killed april 6 in a 
clash with arabs in beita a west bank town

an underwater explosion tore open the hull of 
an american guidedmissile frigate in the central persian gulf and 
injured 10 crewmen thursday pentagon sources said it appeared the 
warship hit a mine 
the injured sailors six with slight burns one with 
seconddegree burns one with a hernia and two with back injuries 
were evacuated from the uss samuel b roberts the defense 
department said 
the roberts then began steaming slowly under its own power 
toward port in bahrain 
the sailor with the seconddegree burns was flown to bahrain 
the pentagon said late thursday the other nine were transferred to 
the uss san jose a combat stores ship operating in the central 
gulf 
defense sources said the crew of the roberts had spotted some 
minelike objects in the water immediately before the 1010 am 
edt explosion the pentagon declined official comment on the report 
the sources who insisted on anonymity said the frigate was 
making only about two knots on its own power thursday afternoon 
and would probably be taken under tow by the cruiser wainwright 
the roberts and wainwright are two of 14 navy ships assigned to 
the persian gulf force to provide protection to commercial ships 
flying the american flag the san jose was in the area only because 
it was on a resupply mission 
the reagan administration increased the us force in the region 
last summer in response to a request from kuwait whose oil tankers 
come under attack in the course of the iraniraq war 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said the 
roberts had been in no danger of sinking and that the crew had 
managed to staunch flooding in the engine compartments on its own 
howard refused to attribute the explosion to a mine saying it 
was premature to form a judgment underwater explosion is the way 
to describe it we dont know what caused the explosion he told 
reporters 
however other pentagon officials were less reticent the 
assumption is definitely that it was a mine said one source 
according to howard the roberts was steaming southbound on a 
routine patrol thursday morning after completing a convoy operation 
the night before the frigate which had escorted the kuwaiti 
tanker gas king northward to kuwait without incident was almost 
dead center in the persian gulf when it was suffered the explosion 
about 70 miles to the east of a navigational bell located off the 
coast of bahrain 
the explosion caused flooding in the engine room and some hull 
damage howard said the flooding is under control and the 
ship is in the process of pumping out the water its operating 
under auxiliary power 
the roberts whose home port is newport ri had left for 
persian gulf duty on jan 11 and was scheduled to leave the gulf 
for home around june 4 the pentagon said 
according to howard the explosion occurred well to the south of 
the spot near the iraniancontrolled farsi island where a reflagged 
kuwaiti tanker the bridgeton hit a mine during the first of the 
navys convoy operation last july 
howard said there had been no recent reports by mine sweepers in 
the area that mines had been sighted 
the last mine to be discovered in the gulfs waters was located 
on april 9 near farsi the pentagon said to date 44 underwater 
mines have been destroyed by us forces in the gulf 
the roberts is the same type of guidedmissile frigate as the 
uss stark the frigate that was hit last may in an iraqi air 
attack thirtyseven crewmen died in that attack 
ships of that class normally carry a crew of about 13 officers 
and 190 enlisted men the pentagon said the roberts was carrying 
about 225 men however because it had a helicopter detachment 
aboard from mayport fla 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan had been told of the incident which he said only 
emphasizes our concern for stopping the iraniraq war 
fitzwater said the administration intended to step up pressure 
in the un security council for a resolution that would not only 
put an end to the war but put the group on record in favor of 
sanctions against belligerents in the war

growth of business inventories slowed in february increasing by 
only 825 million or 01 percent the small gain followed a string 
of steep increases after the stock market crash 
the february inventory increase occurred while business sales 
climbed 06 percent reversing a 05 percent drop in january 
</TEXT>

retail sales rose 08 percent in march the government reported 
wednesday increasing by a seasonally adjusted 11 billion to 
1307 billion 
it was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest 
since december when sales shot up 11 percent 
the combination of rising sales and slightly rising inventories 
pushed the inventory to sales ratio down from 154 in january to 
153 in february that means it would take 153 months to exhaust 
inventories at the february sales pace that ratio is not 
considered abnormally high

even though they are doomed say two medical ethicists who argue 
that doctors must wait for true brain death to occur 
such infants called anencephalics have a brain stem which 
enables them to breathe but they have no cerebral cortex the part 
of the brain that allows thought and voluntary movement 
most die within 24 hours and all within weeks of birth and they 
are increasingly viewed by some within the medical community as a 
potential pool of donor organs for children needing transplants 
at issue is both the appropriateness of using anencephalics as 
donors and how soon 
organ donation is very laudable and people say these kids will 
inevitably die said dr shlomo shinnar coauthor with john 
arras of a commentary in fridays journal of the american medical 
association 
but then what makes that different from a number of newborns 
with congential fatal diseases or other kids and adults in 
vegetative states shinnar said 
and what if there are not enough anencephalics and the 
transplant needs are greater two years from now who do we look at 
next 
these are steps we can take only after very very careful 
review said shinnar a pediatric neurologist at montefiore 
medical centeralbert einstein college of medicine in a telephone 
interview from new york city 
there are between 2000 and 3000 anencephalic infants among the 
3 million children born in the united states each year the federal 
centers for disease control estimates 
the problem can be detected before birth with ultrasound and 
abortion is considered appropriate by some doctors as late as the 
final three months of pregnancy the commentary said 
should we be encouraging pregnant women in essence to carry 
these children to term to provide spare parts shinnar said 
questions about their use as organ donors were raised after 
newspaper reports last october that organs had been taken from 
anencephalic infants and transplanted into other children in west 
germany and california 
in the west german case they took a baby from delivery put a 
tube of oxygen in its mouth took it to the operating room 
harvested the organs and buried it said shinnar 
and in the united states although it did not pass there was 
a bill in the legislature in california to have these children 
declared braindead at birth he added 
shinnar said legal definitions of brain death used in making 
medical determinations require an end of all brain functions 
including those of the brain stem 
the debate took a new turn in december when the loma linda 
calif university medical center developed guidelines under which 
anencephalic babies are to be sustained on respirators and used for 
transplants only if brain death occurs within a week otherwise 
they are removed from the respirators and allowed to die naturally 
six anencephalic infants have been kept alive by respirator for 
a week under those guidelines though none ultimately became an 
organ donor said loma linda spokeswoman anita rockwell 
we wrote our article before the protocol guideline was 
developed said shinnar and this certainly lessens the 
magnitude of the ethical debate 
we are no longer talking about actively taking a life though 
this protocol is not without its problems as well what about 
extending the tragedy for the parents of an anencephalic child 
he said 
the issue is not that the practice is common because its 
not he said but the argument over whether this is a good 
sound idea or something that should be opposed as we feel has 
to take place before it becomes so

the head of the west german central bank said 
thursday that his country has done all it can to stimulate its own 
economy as part of the effort to lower the us trade deficit 
we have the lowest interest rates in the world and it 
would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary 
policies karl otto poehl told a national press club luncheon 
his remarks came amid turmoil on world financial markets the 
dollar fell and stocks tumbled in reaction to news that the us 
trade deficit for february widened by more than 11 percent to 138 
billion 
a heated dispute over interest rates last year between treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and the west germans has been cited as 
one of the contributing factors to oct 19 stock market plunge 
since that time world financial leaders have gone out of their 
way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts 
with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan looking on poehl 
sidestepped questions at the luncheon about whether the fed should 
tighten the us money supply which would drive up interest rates 
and make the dollar more attractive 
however he said west germany by keeping its interest rates 
low couldnt have done more 
poehl said the bundesbanks dollar reserves have increased by 
15 billion in the past year to 50 billion and indicated it was 
among the central banks intervening thursday to buy dollars on 
world exchange markets 
today was a day where i think we have demonstrated to the 
markets our readiness and our willingness in the future he 
said 
poehl cautioned against overreacting to thursdays trade deficit 
figures 
one should not be confused by a monthly trade figure thats a 
very temporary statistic the true conditions for more stable 
exchange rates are much better than some years ago he said 
he also said the united states should not expect to be in 
equilibrium with every trading partner all the time he said west 
germany as an aging nation with a stable population needs to be a 
net exporter 
germanys trade surplus with the united states which was 22 
billion in the first two months of this year is far smaller than 
japans at 85 billion and less than taiwans at 27 billion 
he said

farmland prices are up for the first time in 
six years but still are far from returning to the peak levels of 
1982 the agriculture department said thursday 
as of feb 1 the average value of us farmland including 
buildings was 564 per acre up 3 percent from a 19year low of 
548 per acre recorded last year the department said in its annual 
report 
but the feb 1 reading was still down 32 percent from the record 
high of 823 per acre in 1982 
in real terms allowing for an inflation of nearly 4 percent 
last year farmland nationally dropped again to an average of 288 
per acre down 1 percent from 290 a year earlier that would be 
the lowest since the early 1960s 
farmland values vary greatly across the country and not all 
regions or states share in the increase more than a dozen states 
showed a further decline or no gain from a year ago 
roger hexem a farmland analyst in the departments economic 
research service said there are too many variables interest 
rates and farm income estimates for example to make a prediction 
of a future trend 
it dont think it necessarily follows that theyre going to be 
higher next year hexem said in an interview i think there are 
just too many uncertainties 
hexem added we just cant put ourselves into the minds of 
those who are looking at the markets ones expectation of whats 
going to happen in terms of returns to the land are kind of 
peculiar to that individual and if that individual is more 
optimistic than others then he or she is probably more inclined to 
get into the market and bid prices up 
the report which hexem supervised noted that us farm income 
was a record high in 1987 but was enhanced by government 
payments equivalent to nearly 30 percent of net cash income 
higher farm income and lower debt improved the equity position 
of farmers in 1987 and interest rates averaged lower than in 1986 
however those rates edged up slightly late last year the report 
said 
regionally the northeast showed a 9 percent increase in 
farmland prices as of feb 1 continuing an upward trend that began 
in the mid1940s the report said the corn belt also rose 9 
percent and the northern plains averaged 7 percent higher the 
first advances since the early 1980s 
in both regions values rose in all states particularly iowa 
up 19 percent the report said minnesotas 14 percent gain 
led the lake states 7 percent growth while values were up 6 
percent in the southeast and 2 percent in appalachia 
a 4 percent drop in louisiana farmland values was offset by 
higher prices in other states which left the delta states 
essentially unchanged for the year 
the upturns in farmland values did not extend to the western 
regions where most state values continued downward into 1988 
the report said regional values were down 3 percent in the 
southern plains 2 percent in the mountain states and 2 percent in 
the pacific region but the rates of decline were lower than in the 
past two years

federal drug agents starting in florida are 
getting a big boost in firepower with the issue of semiautomatic 
guns to even the odds against drug dealers often armed with uzis 
and mac10 machine guns 
each of south floridas 341 dea agents is being issued a 9mm 
colt submachine gun as well as a 15shot 9mm sidearm as their 
primary personal weapons said jack hook a spokesman for the drug 
enforcement administrations miami office 
until now dea agents have gone into battle carrying sixshot 
38caliber handguns and shotguns 
all 3000 dea agents nationwide will get the increased firepower 
as soon as possible hook said 
the managers of dea are sick and tired of burying dead dea 
agents who have been killed in gunfights by traffickers who have 
outgunned those agents hook said noting that five agents have 
been killed nationally in the last 14 months 
the dea is the first federal agency to issue submachine guns 
routinely customs and fbi agents still carry 38 and 357caliber 
weapons hook said 
he said agents in cities such as miami los angeles and new york 
with big drug problems are slated to get the guns first 
he said the miami division is the first to receive the weapons 
although agents protecting witnesses in jacksonville for the trial 
of reputed drug lord carlo said 
luis caraballo of the governors task force on immigration those 
workers picked twothirds of the crop 
the fear growers have in strawberries is that you need to 
replace those 17000 with about 35000 people to get the same 
production you had before he said

the counselor to attorney general edwin meese 
iii on thursday said sen arlen specter and two other republican 
opponents of former supreme court nominee robert h bork had 
adopted a personal litmus test in rejecting borks nomination 
what clearly emerged during the spectacle of the judges 
confirmation hearings was nothing less than an arrogant disdain for 
government by the people assistant attorney general william 
bradford reynolds said in remarks prepared for delivery to a 
lawyers group thursday night in philadelphia 
reynolds who as counselor to the attorney general is meeses 
top aide said specter rpa and other bork opponents had decided 
last year that the only relevant consideration in borks 
confirmation proceedings was a purely resultoriented one 
that consideration reynolds said was whether borks views on 
privacy free speech and equal protection coincide with the policy 
positions crafted and fed to the senators by largely hostile 
staffers in collaboration with various interest groups 
such an inquisition makes a mockery of the senates 
constitutional responsibility reynolds said there can be 
little doubt that the framers of the constitution never intended 
for that legislative check to permit judicial nominees to be held 
hostage to each senators personal litmus test 
he said republican sens robert packwood of oregon and john 
warner of virginia as well as specter had adopted the 
resultoriented approach in the bork fight he said the three 
republicans were part of a camp that included democratic 
members of the senate judiciary committee joseph biden of 
delaware edward kennedy of massachusetts howard metzenbaum of 
ohio patrick leahy of vermont howell heflin of alabama and paul 
simon of illinois 
reynolds said bork who had been an appeals court judge in 
washington had arrived at his views out of an abiding commitment 
to interpret the language of the constitution and the laws not 
recast it that was in the final analysis his downfall 
the senate rejected borks nomination 5842 last oct 23 
any fair reading of the record shows that i had an open mind 
and decided the issue on the merits specter said in responding 
to reynolds remarks 
warner responded by saying the nation has now turned its 
focus on how supreme court justice anthony kennedy will 
discharge his responsibilities in light of the senates unanimous 
confidence in him 
packwoods press secretary dan witeck said the vote has been 
taken on the bork nomination and that the senator would have no 
comment on reynolds remarks

a federal grand jury on thursday questioned 
two members of the bender family which arranged to pay the wife of 
attorney general edwin meese iii while leasing office space to the 
justice department for 50 million 
the panel under the direction of independent counsel james 
mckay is investigating whether meese has violated federal law 
through any conflict between his personal financial interests and 
his government duties 
accompanied by his attorney seymour glanzer howard m bender 
arrived at the grand jury thursday morning his wife sondra 
arrived at midafternoon he spent more than three hours behind 
closed doors later mrs bender was questioned separately for 
about an hour 
meanwhile trustees of the multiple sclerosis society said 
thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire ursula meese at 
40000 a year with money donated by the bender family foundation 
the associated press reported wednesday that a partnership 
headed by howard bender won a 50million lease on justice 
department offices after the bender foundation put up money to pay 
mrs meeses salary at the ms society 
meese in atlanta to attend a drug conference was asked by a 
reporter about the matter but declined to comment during a stop 
later at an immigration and nationalization service center in 
decatur ga he turned aside several questions about the lease 
arrangement saying thats not on the subject of immigration 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that he 
knew nothing about the lease but that president reagan still has 
full confidence in ed meese 
ms officials have said that the bender foundation of which 
sondra is president donated the money in october 1985 to pay mrs 
meese for three years mrs bender and mrs meese are ms trustees 
several ms trustees said they first learned about that 
arrangement from newspaper accounts in the last two weeks others 
however said the board had been advised earlier 
some trustees complained about not hearing earlier but others 
saw no reason for concern some acknowledged it was an unusual 
arrangement and all agreed it was not put up for a board vote 
ms trustee susan sikorski wife of rep gerry sikorski dminn 
said she first learned about mrs meeses salary when her husband 
read it in a newspaper march 30 and told her she said the issue 
was never discussed in any board meeting that she attended 
another trustee remmel dudley gave a different version 
i guess you might say it was reported to the board said 
dudley i cannot say that a proposal was put before the board 
discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken but we were 
informed that this had been proposed 
i was pleased i was told the benders had this foundation and 
they could make a contribution to ms or pay for someones salary or 
designate for a specific purpose we were delighted to know she 
mrs meese would be a fulltime employee because shes a worker 
the board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each 
meeting 
attorney bryan barkley also a trustee said i dont recall a 
discussion at a board meeting about the plan to hire mrs meese 
he said it is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of 
a specific person thats a little unusual but he added its 
not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or 
ratify 
another longtime trustee who spoke on condition she not be 
identified said she never missed a meeting butwhen i read the 
article in the paper i was shocked i was aghast when i saw 
it 
she said she had no idea mrs meese was paid as ms development 
director and thought the attorney generals wife served solely on 
the board as a volunteer 
ms society attorney james bierbower said the arrangement was 
brought up in october 1985 at a special meeting to discuss 
expansion of operation job match a program to help ms victims find 
work mrs bender was at the session he said 
mckay has subpoenaed records of mrs meeses job at the society 
he also is known to be interested in a 50million lease renewal 
won by a partnership headed by bender after mrs meese got her job 
most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the justice 
departments immigration and naturalization service which had 
complained about the buildings maintenance size location and 
security 
renewal of the lease in may 1987 was crucial to the sale of the 
building 13 days later for 226 million more than it cost the 
bender partnership just two years earlier according to the new 
owner and public records 
the bender partnership had bought the building in march 1985 for 
nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government 
wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere 
three months after the bender partnership purchased the 
building the reagan administration disclosed publicly that it had 
decided to remain in there 
an attorney for the meeses denies any wrongdoing on their part 
in the transactions but acknowledges that the benders and meeses 
know each other the benders refuse to discuss the matter a key 
government official said meese played no role in the real estate 
decision 
other bender buildings have done business with the justice 
department government documents show that howard bender and his 
two brothers morton and stanley as a partnership signed a lease 
in june 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office 
building one mcpherson square where it has leased several floors 
since 1971 
the justice department occupies part of one floor there

shiite moslem hijackers freed another 
hostage from a kuwaiti jumbo jet thursday after negotiators resumed 
their efforts to end the 10dayold crisis 
a man dressed in a white robe descended from the kuwait airways 
boeing 747 at 945 pm 545 edt got into a car and was driven 
across the tarmac to the vip lounge at houari boumedienne airport 
algerian officials said the released hostage was a kuwaiti named 
djuma abdelhak chatti the elderly grizzled man was greeted by 
kuwaiti officials and hustled inside the building 
praise to god i am fine but they had me tied all the time 
and i am tired said chatti who gave his age as 70 
they are not good people he told reporters in the airport 
lounge they beat me 
after the release the hijackers broadcast a message to the 
control tower in arabic and english repeating their demand for the 
release of 17 proiranian terrorists jailed in kuwait 
the statement said chatti had been released for strictly 
humanitarian reasons 
kuwait has refused the demand of the gunmen who seized the 
plane april 5 on a bangkokkuwait flight and are holding at least 
30 hostages 
on thursday evening kuwaits deputy foreign minister mohammed 
alosaimi reiterated that the 17 would not be freed alosaimi is 
head of a highlevel kuwaiti delegation on the scene 
another kuwaiti official speaking to reporters on condition he 
not be identified said the algerian authorities continued to put 
pressure on kuwait to be more flexible in its position 
you can see this from the fact that they are telling us that 
the ball is in our court the official said 
negotiations between the hijackers and algerian mediators 
resumed thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day 
caused by the lack of progress according to the official algerian 
news agency 
in washington lawmakers urged secretary of state george p 
shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers 
might be responsible for kidnapping american journalist terry 
anderson in lebanon 
kuwaits independent alqabas newspaper reported wednesday that 
the alleged kidnapper imad mughniyeh was believed to have boarded 
the plane when it landed in mashhad iran 
mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs in 
beirut for hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be the 
umbrella organization for proiranian groups holding foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
from mashhad the plane flew to larnaca cyprus where palestine 
liberation organization officials negotiated with the hijackers 
the gunmen have killed two passengers and freed 70 among the 
remaining hostages are three members of kuwaits royal family 
plo chairman yasser arafat accused iran of being behind the 
hijacking and said some of the gunmen belong to the iranian 
government egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid echoed 
arafats comments thursday in cairo 
in a radio call to the airport tower thursday a passenger who 
identified himself as ahmed zayed said i ask my government to 
release the 17 islamic jihad prisoners if not they will kill us 
all 
islamic jihad or holy war is the group that holds anderson 
and it also is demanding the release of the 17 kuwaiti prisoners 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
was kidnapped march 16 1985 he has been held longer than any of 
the 22 foreign hostages in lebanon 
the hijackers said to be armed with grenades and guns have 
threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages 
if their demands are not met 
a ranking algerian official said wednesday that kuwaits 
intransigence had created the standstill 
algerias negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by 
interior minister hedi khediri one team is responsible for 
contacts with the kuwaitis and the other with the hijackers 
a doctor was allowed on board the plane thursday to examine the 
hostages 
i saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or 
major medicine said dr youssef mahdi he later told the 
official algerian news agency that he prescribed some routine 
medicines that would be sent to the plane 
the passengers i saw did not have their hands tied and 
displayed no signs of physical violence mahdi said 
an airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food 
the algerian official said 
in a letter wednesday to shultz sen daniel moynihan and rep 
louise slaughter both new york democrats wrote we know the 
united states is not a primary party to the algiers negotiations 
but if terry andersons chief kidnapper is on the kuwaiti jet the 
united states government must insure that the negotiators are aware 
of this fact 
it would be a travesty for imad mughniyeh to go free while 
terry anderson remains a captive they said 
in nicosia cyprus government spokesman akis fantis said that 
the jetliner was refueled and allowed to leave for algiers only 
after algeria gave assurances that the remaining passengers would 
be freed on arrival there 
the plane landed in algeria on tuesday night 
it was moved early thursday to the end of the runway so another 
jet could land it was later returned to its original position 
about 400 yards from the terminal

the federal parole commission thursday said 
anticastro militant orlando bosch would be either released into 
the custody of immigration officials on may 16 or paroled into the 
community on june 16 
meanwhile the us immigration and naturalization service says 
it still plans to institute proceedings to deport bosch from the 
united states 
bosch a cuban native came to the united states in the 1960s 
and lived in the miami area he never became a us citizen 
bosch entered the united states illegally in february after his 
release from a venezuelan prison and he has been detained at the 
metropolitan correctional center in south dade fla for violating 
the terms of his parole 
four members of the parole commission said bosch will be 
released into the custody of the ins on may 16 if the immigration 
service exercises its option to detain him if the ins doesnt 
exercise that option he would be paroled into the community on 
june 16 and would be on probation through 1992 
regardless of when or under what conditions he is released the 
ins plans to seek to have bosch deported said duke austin an 
immigration service spokesman 
during any exclusionary proceedings bosch could be detained by 
immigration officials released on bond released on his own 
recognizance or released into the custody of family or someone else 
in the community austin said 
austin said the ins had made no decision on where bosch would be 
deported if such action were approved 
deputy ins commissioner mark everson had said earlier this year 
that the agency would go forward with proceedings to deport bosch 
because the united states opposes terrorism no matter who the 
target is 
bosch 61 was convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign 
freighters and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a polish 
freighter docked in miami he served four years of a 10year 
federal prison sentence in the united states and has acknowledged 
violating his parole when he traveled to south america in 1974 he 
served 11 years in venezuelan jails until his acquittal on charges 
of bombing a cuban jetliner in which 73 died in 1976

president mohammed zia ulhaq said 
thursday saboteurs caused the ammunition dump explosion that killed 
at least 96 people and denied the weapons were destined for 
guerrillas in neighboring afghanistan 
my personal assessment is that it couldnt be anything but a 
very effective way of sabotage zia told reporters during an 
informal briefing at the presidential palace in previous comments 
zia had not ruled out an accidental explosion 
he said somebody who is not in line with us was responsible 
for a series of blasts at the dump between islamabad and rawalpindi 
last sunday that caused rockets and grenades to rain on both cities 
for more than half an hour 
zia would not elaborate explaining i dont want to hurt the 
inquiries being conducted into the explosion 
although the official death toll stands at 96 scores of people 
still are listed as missing more than 1000 were reported injured 
in rejecting reports that the weapons were meant for afghan 
guerrillas he said the dump was used only by pakistans army 
after the explosion witnesses said they saw burning trucks with 
afghan license plates near the site 
pakistan has been a conduit for foreign military aid to afghan 
guerrillas who have headquarters in pakistan the united states is 
one of the countries that has supplied the rebels

democratic hopeful jesse jackson denounced 
president reagan new york mayor ed koch and others for making race 
and religion issues in the presidential campaign saying they are 
making hysteria while im making history 
the preacherturnedpolitician read a lengthy speech thursday to 
the annual meeting of the american society of newspaper editors in 
which he expounded his jackson doctrine of foreign affairs 
the next president must know the world and have a realistic 
understanding of our possibilities jackson said our policy 
must be changed we must change our course or lose our way 
he called for a new realism in us policies and a halt to 
the race to modernize the superpowers nuclear arsenals 
jackson then moved back to the rhetoric he uses so well in 
answering questions from the editors and later from reporters 
asked about those who say the nation is not ready for a black 
president jackson said such conclusions are the result of 
journalistic incest among those who have not gotten out among 
americans to learn how much the nation has grown 
we went across the south on super tuesday without a single 
catcall or boo without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting 
jackson said 
then he launched his criticism of those who have raised race in 
advance of tuesdays new york primary 
it was not until we got north to new york that the litmus 
tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public 
officials without a significant media challenge jackson said 
then joined in yesterday by the president and then joined in 
today by ms geraldine ferraro 
i simply say some people are making hysteria while im making 
history jackson added later at a news conference 
koch who endorsed jackson rival sen albert gore jr on 
thursday said recently that jews would have to be crazy to 
vote for jackson because of his positions on israel 
reagan told the editors on wednesday that jackson has been 
spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be 
interpreted as some kind of racial attack 
thats a statement of trauma jackson told reporters after 
the editors speech president reagan no doubt feels the pressure 
of our campaign 
in a speech on wednesday night ms ferraro lauded jackson but 
added that if he were not black he wouldnt be in the race 
the former democratic candidate for vice president said jackson 
could win neither the nomination nor the general election 
in his foreign policy speech jackson said that as president he 
would impose a nuclear warhead testing and missile testing 
moratorium to start the process toward major reduction in both 
nuclear and convention forces 
he denounced the reagans strategic defense initiative as an 
expansion of the arms race saying if star wars takes it to the 
heavens it may soon become literally lunatic 
jackson said his jackson doctrine has four basic principles 
support for international institutions and respect for 
international law 
recognition for the right of selfdetermination for the 
struggling peoples of the third world 
support for human rights 
gross and repeated violators of human rights should not be 
recipients of us aid or of trade preferences he said 
the united state must be a force for economic growth and 
justice 
we will not succeed as an island of affluence in a sea of 
misery and we will pay a heavy price for trying he said

albert gore renewing his attack on michael dukakis involving 
nuclear policy in europe to say nato policy is no early first

nearly 6000 taxpayers cut their payments by 
88 million by claiming huge writeoffs for energysaving devices 
that may not have even worked authorities said thursday as they 
announced the indictment of 12 people 
the 86count indictment handed up thursday represents one of the 
largest tax shelter frauds ever prosecuted in the united states 
said us attorney edward sg dennis jr 
the indictment charges that taxpayers in 47 states and the 
district of columbia paid at least 44 million to two corporations 
for a stake in energysaving devices that purportedly would give 
the investors tax credits 
the scheme cost the government 88 million for the 1982 and 1983 
tax years according to the indictment but authorities said they 
expected to recover much of the money from the taxpayers 
this prosecution involves a very sophisticated attempt to lure 
taxpayers into making investments that would according to their 
promoters result in many times the investment in tax savings 
dennis said 
all 12 defendants stand charged with conspiracy to defraud the 
united states aiding the filing of false tax returns and mail 
fraud 
three defendants frank j giuffrida 51 of belle terre ny 
salvatore giuffrida 47 of dix hills ny and william b medina 
41 of port jeffeson ny are also charged with racketeering 
through mail fraud and interstate transportation of money and 
securities taken by fraud 
the taxpayers did not necessarily know they were involved in an 
illegal scheme because the marketing was thoroughly professional 
with videotapes glossy brochures and seminar presentations said 
assistant us attorney tina williams gabbrielli who will 
prosecute the case 
according to the indictment two leasing companies both based 
in new york state offered taxpayers the chance to lease an energy 
device for an initial 5000 to 25000 depending on the model 
the companies told the taxpayers they could claim investment and 
energy tax credits for the purported fair market value of the 
device ranging from 65000 to 280000 
the heart of the fraud case stems from the purported fair market 
value which authorities said was actually 304 to 1855 
the figures were completedly inflated dennis said of 
course there were questions about whether there were really these 
energy savings 
the devices which prosecutors did not describe in detail were 
to be installed at a commercial site which would then share any 
energy savings with the taxpayer the taxpayer in turn would pay a 
portion of the electricity savings back to the leasing companies 
and an array of bogus manufacturers 
gary h matthews philadelphia district director of the internal 
revenue service said the indictment was the culmination of a 
threeyear investigation 
we think it is time and money well spent he said 
the two leasing companies marketing the devices were oec leasing 
corp of garden city ny and first energy leasing corp of 
melville ny 
if convicted the giuffridas and medina face up to 345 years 
each in prison and fines ranging from 66 million to 10 million 
plus forfeiture of assets the other nine if convicted face 
prison sentences of up to 275 years and fines of up to 65 million 
also charged in the indictment were zayle a bernstein 48 fort 
lauderdale fla william l eckard jr 46 fort lauderdale fla 
robert j cleary 43 levittown ny john a deraffele 46 new 
rochelle ny leo i tobin 48 cherry hill nj irwin berman

an engine on a piedmont jetliner 
exploded into jagged pieces thursday slicing through both sides of 
the plane and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing as 
some passengers screamed and fainted 
two flight attendants suffered bumps and bruises when the plane 
carrying 56 passengers plunged after the explosion piedmont 
spokesman don mcguire said 
turbine blades ripped through the right rear bathroom and a work 
area for attendants as the plane cruised at 31000 feet 
if somebody had been in the bathroom or the stewardesses 
quarters they would have been killed said passenger doug bruce 
of columbus ohio my first thought was this is it 
it blew a big hole in the plane said passenger fred hinton 
of raleigh nc im 240 pounds and it was big enough that i 
could crawl through it 
all the kids were screaming hinton said 
piedmont flight 486 was flying from charlotte nc to 
columbus ohio when its right jet turbine disintegrated about 945 
am piedmont officials said the plane a fokker f28 has two 
engines one mounted on each side of the cabin 
the plane 40 miles south of charleston immediately lost air 
pressure in the cabin several passengers later complained of 
headaches earaches and elevated blood pressure 
it began with a wearing noise and loud vibrations about five 
or 10 times straight and then there was an explosion in the back 
of us said passenger rafael gonzalez of charlotte nc 
turbine blades and engine parts ripped through the fuselage 
punching holes in both sides of the plane a hole on the right 
side adjacent to the engine that disintegrated was 2 feet wide by 
6 feet tall on the opposite side the hole was 2 feet by 1 foot 
the pilot noticed a fire indicator signal for his no 2 engine 
manufactured by rolls royce and decided to land at charleston 
where he landed without incident at yeager airport about 10 
am mcguire said 
assistant airport manager dan huffman said the f28 was 40 miles 
south of charleston and traveling north when the explosion occurred 
the plane made a deep descent after the explosion but they got 
it under control they all did a good job hinton said 
a national transportation safety board investigator was 
dispatched to charleston to investigate airport officials said 
piedmont owns 25 of the germanbuilt f28 4000s said another 
piedmont spokesman bill kress piedmont uses the jets slightly 
smaller than boeing 737s or mcdonnelldouglass dc9s because many 
airports in its mountainous region have short runways 
charlestons airport named for test pilot gen chuck yeager is 
located atop a mountain 2 miles north of the downtown area 
immediately after the explosion oxygen masks dropped from the 
ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers went through the 
aisles and assisted children passengers said 
but some masks didnt work and passengers had to be moved to 
other seats 
gonzalez who was sitting three rows from the rear of the plane 
said a woman in the seat behind him who was traveling with two 
children passed out 
she fainted i turned around and she was blue the baby was 
blue and her 3yearold was blue gonzales said i grabbed her 
and put a mask on her gave the baby to a woman who was sitting 
next to her and i took the 3yearold up with me 
about 90 minutes after the emergency landing most passengers 
were placed on flight 249 a charlestontochicago nonstop flight 
that was diverted to columbus however a few passengers flocked to 
rental car companies they planned to continue their trip by car 
before flight 249 took off for columbus and chicago paramedics 
checked the blood pressure of several passengers 
its a little high hinton said of his own blood pressure 
but if i dont get on that plane today ill have trouble flying 
again 
the ntsb has on file only two injuryrelated accidents involving 
fokker f28s said spokesman ted lopatkiewicz in washington dc 
one jet was involved in a minor taxiway collision in 1985 and in 
1986 an unassisted handicapped passenger fell off the boarding 
stairs when a guardrail gave way he said 
during the past 4 years only seven piedmont flights resulted 
in injuries to passengers the records show the worst was on oct 
25 1986 when a jet overshot a charlotte runway causing three 
serious injuries and 31 minor ones 
on aug 10 1968 a piedmont plane crashed on approach to the 
charleston airport killing 35 people

early results from blind aids tests among 
hospital patients show three in 1000 infected with the virus that 
causes the deadly disease according to a report released thursday 
by federal health officials 
the national centers for disease control in one attempt to 
gauge the prevalence of infection with the virus that causes aids 
has launched a program to test anonymously blood samples taken from 
hospital patients at 40 hospitals in 30 cities 
so far just four hospitals have been enrolled in the program 
all in the midwest all patients are being tested except those who 
already have aids or related conditions 
in results from the four midwestern hospitals 03 percent of 
the 12000 patients tested showed signs of infection by the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus the cdc said in a report 
thursday 
federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1 
million and 15 million americans from 04 percent to 06 percent 
are infected with aids virus no new data have become available 
to prompt a change of this estimate the cdc said 
the atlantabased cdc stressed that it is in the earliest stages 
of the hospital study accurate estimates of the prevalence 
of aids virus infection in the entire us population are not 
possible at this time the agency said 
these data are from just one region they are not 
necessarily representative of the nation said dr tim dondero 
a cdc aids specialist you cant do a national estimate based on 
four spots 
the cdc expects to enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing 
program by september 
at the four hospitals reporting first antibodies indicating 
infection by aids virus were more common among adults age 25 to 44 
rates also were higher for black and hispanic persons than for 
whites and higher for men than for women the cdc said 
the cdc report also reviewed tests among prisoners and among 
childbearing women 
out of 29193 federal inmates tested by the us bureau of 
prisons since last june 843 or 29 percent have tested positive 
for aids virus infection that is little changed from a justice 
department announcement last fall when 3 percent of the first 
inmates tested were positive 
the cdc said it hopes to contract with the national institute of 
justice and with a major university for aids testing of 10000 
inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this june 
in 52326 tests of childbearing women in the state of new york 
researchers found an aids virus infection rate of 08 percent the 
cdc said in new york city one woman in 61 showed antibodies 
against the aids virus and 40 percent of those women passed the 
infections on to their newborn children the cdc added 
as of this week 59287 cases of aids itself have been reported 
in the united states according to the cdc the disease has so far 
killed 33060 or 56 percent of those patients

soviet media on thursday called the afghanistan 
accord in geneva the news weve been waiting so long for but 
there was only sketchy mention of the kremlins commitment to bring 
its soldiers home 
radio moscow used only one sentence to sum up the consequences 
of the pact for the estimated 115000 soviet troops deployed in 
afghanistan 
it was agreed that the withdrawal of soviet troops is to start 
on may 15 and to be completed within nine months it said 
other media reports including staterun televisions top 
evening news broadcast made no reference to the pullout at all 
instead most reports emphasized that the goal of the pact is 
the peaceful settlement of afghanistans 10yearold civil war and 
reiterated soviet backing for the embattled marxist government of 
president najib 
most soviets however would be aware of the implications of the 
accords communist party chief mikhail s gorbachev who has called 
the afghan involvement his nations bleeding wound said last 
week that the pullout would begin in midmay if the unbrokered 
geneva negotiations were successful 
soviet leader leonid i brezhnev sent troops into afghanistan on 
dec 27 1979 to preside over the replacement of one marxist 
leader by another 
they stayed on to help combat a nationwide insurgency in a 
military operation that has cost thousands of soviet lives and 
billions of rubles sparked domestic dissent and poisoned the 
kremlins relations with other moslem and third world nations 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov who was sent into 
internal exile for almost seven years after criticizing the 
intervention called the agreement signed in geneva an enormous 
event 
it was a horrible war a horrible mistake by the soviet 
leadership that had awful consequences for the afghan people 
said sakharov the 1975 nobel peace laureate who was reached by 
telephone at his moscow apartment 
i am waiting with great impatience for may 15 to see the troop 
withdrawal begin he added 
from the us withdrawal of the salt ii arms control treaty and 
the boycott of the 1980 moscow olympics by the united states and 61 
other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreements 
involving foreign suppliers the soviets paid the price for sending 
tanks and troops across the afghan border 
a moscow newspaper editor recently told a western reporter of 
receiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed in 
afghanistan now the others are coming home the writer of the 
letter said but what did my boy die for 
the us state department has estimated soviet casualties since 
1979 at 3300038000 more than onethird of whom were killed 
those figures do not include heavy losses to disease the 
department said in a report issued in december 
the agreement signed by foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
and us secretary of state george p shultz commits the kremlin to 
ending its military intervention 
staterun medias initial reporting on the geneva agreements 
seemed designed to assure soviets that their governments stated 
goal of achieving peace in afghanistans civil war had been met at 
least in part 
shevardnadze in a statement to reporters after the ceremony 
spoke not of the withdrawal of soviet troops but of the end to all 
outside interference in afghanistan mandated by the agreements 
the entire spectrum of possible activities and actions to 
meddle in the affairs of afghanistan has finally been blocked he 
said in remarks reported by the official tass news agency and 
shown on soviet tv 
outside interference has been the term used by soviets to 
describe the aid by the united states and other countries to 
afghanistans antimarxist mujahedeen insurgents 
shevardnadze said he wanted to do justice to the us role 
in bringing about an afghan settlement but depicted the soviet 
union as the major peacemaker 
the afghan pact he said has been predetermined by my 
countrys policy of solving acute international problems 
exceptionally by political means which has been proclaimed by 
mikhail gorbachev 
vremya the evening news program made no mention at all 
thursday night of the troop withdrawal 
the newcast with an estimated audience of 150 million began 
with reports on the regular thursday meeting of the ruling 
politburo the construction of an atomic icebreaker and private 
farming plots in a region of the russian federation 
about 20 minutes into the broadcast vremya showed an 
eightminute report on what a correspondent in geneva called a 
historic event of exceptional international importance 
another newscaster on staterun tv also waxed eloquent in 
reporting the agreements which were also signed by top diplomats 
from afghanistan and pakistan 
today in the world an evening program led off with a 
highly unusual editorial comment from anchorman igor kudrin who 
told viewers we begin today with news that weve been waiting so 
long for 
on feb 8 gorbachev said the future political system of 
afghanistan was none of our business and stressed that the 
soviet union had dropped a previous condition that a coalition 
government be formed before the beginning of a military withdrawal 
shevardnadze on thursday reiterated kremlin backing for najib 
saying what is crucial in afghanistan is every kind of support 
for the success of the national reconcilation policy proclaimed 
last year by the afghan leader

sen albert gore jr picked up the presidential 
primary endorsement thursday for better or for worse of mayor 
edward koch who told a news conference im available have shoes 
and mouth and will travel 
i believe in what al gore stands for koch said singling 
out the tennessee senators positions on urban affairs defense and 
israel 
at a city hall news conference gore often appeared stiff as he 
was relegated to a bit part standing next to the irrepressible 
mayor who bantered with reporters and mugged for cameras 
the other dominant figure in new york democratic politics gov 
mario cuomo has refused to endorse anyone saying he would withold 
his backing until after the last primaries on june 7 
new yorkers vote tuesday and koch was asked what impact his 
endorsement might have with an exaggerated shrug of his shoulders 
and a glance around a room that was filled to capacity he said 
oh probably nothing thats why youre here 
the first question after koch read a statement endorsing gore 
was whether he feared that a vote for gore would help jesse jackson 
by siphoning away votes from massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
thats exactly what im against replied koch voting for 
someone to stop someone else 
koch stirred a controversy last week when he said that jews and 
other supporters of israel would have to be crazy to vote for 
jackson 
later on thursday dukakis and jackson had temperate responses 
to kochs endorsement 
we had a very good discussion last night dukakis said in 
boston he said that if i won the nomination he would campaign 
for me and with me and i appreciate that 
koch had said the choice was between gore and dukakis who 
added he likes us both 
in washington jackson said endorsements are positive 
what he has done by choosing someone is positive and fair and 
proper jackson told reporters after a speech to the american 
society of newspaper editors 
but jackson did condemn what he called kochs racebased 
statements 
it was not until we got north to new york that the litmus 
tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of public 
officials without a significant media challenge jackson said 
singling out koch president reagan and former democratic vice 
presidential nominee geraldine ferraro 
at the endorsement news conference he said he was prepared to 
support the candidate nominated by the democrats at their 
convention in atlanta in july 
koch said his reason for supporting jackson would not be 
because i believe in his positions but i believe hed be less 
destructive than the presidency of george bush 
then he added if he jackson wants me to go out and make 
that statement id be happy to go anywhere 
as for dukakis regarded as the frontrunner in the race for 
the 255 delegates at stake in new yorks on democratic primary 
koch said he called the massachusetts governor to inform him he had 
decided to support gore 
he was very charming about it said the mayor very nice 
about it he made it easier 
did he call jackson 
no he was never in the running said the mayor 
koch and dukakis met for nearly an hour wednesday night at 
gracie mansion the mayors residence neither man commented after 
the meeting koch had a similar session with gore tuesday night 
asked about gores chances of overcoming the big lead polls give 
dukakis in the race koch recalled that when he ran for the 
democratic nomination for governor in 1982 against mario cuomo i 
started out 40plus points ahead of any other candidate and i upset 
the odds cuomo won that primary and went on to be elected 
governor 
koch brushed off suggestions that his support might hurt gore 
among some new york voters particularly hispanics the mayor said 
that hispanics are among his strongest supporters despite criticism 
from community leaders who objected to kochs refusal to accede to 
their demand that his appoint a hispanic to the board of education

im in the middle of things in arizona and i dont plan to go 
away the former governor said 
state sen bill de long said wednesday that the two lawyers met 
with state attorney general bob corbin in an attempt to get the 
criminal charges against mecham dropped 
de long said he understood the meeting occurred last week but 
corbin would not say whether the meeting took place mecham de 
long and corbin are republicans 
maybe somebody had some conversations mecham said but he 
added that the lawyers reportedly involved were not those handling 
his criminal case i cant say it didnt happen i didnt know of 
it he said 
mecham has repeatedly said he expects to be acquitted in his may 
19 criminal trial on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
in a related development his criminalcase attorney michael 
scott filed a special action in the arizona supreme court seeking 
dismissal of the charges on grounds that corbin manipulated the 
grand jury process in seeking the indictment a lower court judge 
had previously refused to dismiss the charges 
de long said mechams impeachment trial lawyers fred craft and 
jerris leonard approached him a week ago and asked him to set up a 
meeting with corbin to discuss the possibility of having the 
criminal charges dropped 
it was a dismissal in return for certain concessions on the 
part of the respondent and while i did not hear all of the 
details i did act as an intermediary for a meeting to be set up 
de long said 
craft and leonard did not return calls placed to their 
washington dc office 
corbin said he would treat mecham just like i treat anybody 
else 
scott said he previously had asked chief assistant attorney 
general steve twist to dismiss some of the counts but that he had 
never approached the attorney general with a suggestion similar to 
the one made to de long 
craft and leonard did come to me after the senate trial and 
asked what i thought about them talking to someone he said i 
told them it was ok with me but if they were going to the attorney 
generals office i thought it would be a waste of time for that 
reason i didnt bother going with them 
the concessions that leonard and craft suggested to him would 
include mecham leaving the state for a twoyear mormon mission 
calling off political backers who are targeting some legislators 
for defeat next fall and promising never to run for office again 
de long said 
mecham and his brother willard face charges of fraud perjury 
and filing false documents for failing to report a 350000 
campaign loan from a tempe developer to mechams 1986 campaign 
in other developments state treasurer ray rottas said he might 
refuse to release state funds for mechams impeachment trial 
defense corbin said he would issue an opinion on whether the 
senate had the authority to agree to pay 202000 to mechams 
lawyers 
the state senate government committee reversing a stand it took 
last year voted thursday for a state holiday to honor martin 
luther king jr the sponsor democratic sen carolyn walker said 
that if the bill gets through the republican caucus to the senate 
floor she believes both houses would approve it 
mecham caused a storm of controversy shortly after taking office 
in january 1986 by rescinding a limited king holiday for 
executivebranch employees arguing his predecessor had no legal 
right to create it although mecham said he did so on the advice of 
corbin the action generated an international controversy

gov rafael hernandez colon said 
thursday that he and at least 53 other members of puerto ricos 
delegation will vote for michael dukakis at the democratic national 
convention because of commitments dukakis has made to help this 
us commonwealth 
but jesse jackson who won the nonbinding beauty contest 
primary here said his campaign would look into the situation and 
perhaps challenge the decision 
we do not know all the details behind that suffice to say it 
is radically inconsistent in a democracy for the people to go in 
one direction and the delegates to go in another direction 
jackson told a washington news conference 
its premature to respond we will seek clarity he added 
there should be a reaonsable correlation between popular votes 
and delegates votes in a democracy 
dukakis as president would end discrimination and provide just 
treatment in welfare medicaid and other federal programs for 
puerto ricans on this caribbean island as well as on the us 
mainland hernandez colon said at a news conference 
and if puerto ricans vote in a referendum on political status to 
reject statehood and keep the current commonwealth form of 
government dukakis would submit to congress the necessary 
measures to strengthen commonwealth hernandez colon said 
puerto rico will send 56 voting delegates to the national 
convention the majority decided at a meeting of hernandez colons 
popular democratic party last thursday to endorse dukakis senate 
president miguel hernandez agosto said 
no one spoke in favor of jesse jackson or albert gore said 
cirolo tirado jr the pdps youth coordinator and a delegateelect 
whose selection will be confirmed at a party caucus on april 24 
it was unanimous in favor of dukakis said connie 
carasquillo a delegate who also attended 
 
hernandez colon and hernandez agosto endorsed dukakis at a news 
conference wednesday in new york initially it was unclear how 
many delegates they represented because most either were elected 
march 20 on a noncommitted slate or have yet to be formally 
appointed 
hernandez agosto said thursday that most of the 33 delegates 
elected last month attended last weeks meeting as did the 18 
delegateselect who formally will be appointed later this month 
the main issues in the march 20 primary were local the pdp and 
the outofpower new progressive party which favors statehood 
each submitted their own slates the pdp which favors 
commonwealth won in every district members of the other party 
will have two delegates to the convention 
a nonbinding straw poll was held the same day jackson finished 
first with about 32 percent of the vote but hernandez colon and 
hernandez agosto stressed even then that the delegates were not 
bound by the results of the poll 
hernandez colon whose son works in the dukakis campaign and 
hernandez agosto met with dukakis wednesday in boston both said 
they will campaign this weekend for dukakis in new york which has 
large puerto rican communities the new york primary is set for 
next tuesday 
puerto rico located 1000 miles southeast of florida is a us 
territory whose residents are us citizens with most every right 
and obligation except they cannot vote for president and they pay 
no federal taxes

a court spokesman on thursday 
confirmed reports from washington that a juvenile court could 
sentence mohammed hamadi to life in prison if he is convicted in 
the 1985 twa hijacking 
state department spokesman charles redman said wednesday that 
west german authorities had informed american officials a juvenile 
court could sentence hamadi as an adult and give him life the 
maximum sentence if he is found guilty of murder and air piracy 
thomas kehren spokesman for the hesse state court said the 
juvenile court could decide to deal with hamadi as adult 
the juvenile court in fact has more leeway in handling this 
case and sentencing him if hes found guilty he told the 
associated press in a telephone interview 
if it determines hamadi was more juvenile than adolescent the 
maximum sentence is 10 years if found more adolescent than an 
adult 10 to 15 years and if the court decided he was an adult up 
to life imprisonment 
hamadi awaits trial on charges that he led the june 1985 
hijacking to beirut of twa flight 847 during which us navy diver 
robert stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 
days 
on tuesday the hesse state court said it had turned hamadis 
case over to a juvenile court because there was doubt about his 
exact age at the time he allegedly began planning the hijacking 
west german law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of 
age an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or 
over personality development and family environment also play a 
role in determining what category is applicable the newspaper 
frankfurt allgemeine said thursday 
files in the hesse prosecutors office give hamadis birth date 
as june 13 1964 which would have made him 21 the day the 
hijacking began on june 14 1985 
asked how long the juvenile court would study the case before 
setting a trial date kehren said my guess would be in a month 
maybe a little longer but to say six months as some have been 
asking about is in my opinion way off the mark 
the united states asked west germany to extradite hamadi on 
murder and hijacking charges but the west germans turned down the 
request and said he would be tried here 
mohammed hamadis brother abbas is on trial in west germany on 
charges of kidnapping two west germans in lebanon to use as ransom 
for the release of his brother one of the hostages has been freed 
both hamadis were living in west germany when they were arrested 
two weeks apart at the frankfurt airport in january 1987 on charges 
of possessing explosives

democratic leaders dropped compromise efforts 
thursday and vowed to push forward with a sweeping trade bill 
containing a controversial plantclosing provision in defiance of 
white house veto threats 
the decision reversed a drive one day earlier in which the 
leaders had sought to persuade union representatives to accept 
dropping the plantclosing provision to avoid a threatened veto by 
president reagan 
as a result of the decision the fate of the sweeping 
1000page trade bill that congress has been fashioning for three 
years was placed in jeopardy 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said an expanding trade 
gap demonstrated that now is not the time to let the trade bill 
go down the tubes but that is exactly what will happen if the 
plantclosing and the foreign investmentdisclosure provisions 
remain in the package 
another target of administration veto warnings has been a 
provision that would require public disclosure of sizeable foreign 
investment in the united states lawmakers have not decided yet 
whether to include that measure in the trade bill 
democrats said the reversal came amid intense pressure thursday 
morning on house speaker jim wright dtexas from within the 
democratic caucus not to abandon unions in their quest for the 
plantclosings provisions they said the united auto workers and 
other labor groups lobbied furiously wednesday night and thursday 
morning to build support among caucus members 
unfortunately a single issue has emerged that threatens to 
defeat the entire bill said house ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill i hope in the coming days that the 
president members of congress business and labor groups will 
carefully consider the price the nation will pay if we fail to 
enact this essential legislation 
white house spokesman bj cooper issued a reminder that six 
cabinet officers wrote to lawmakers two weeks ago telling the 
hill that they would recommend a veto if plant closings was in the 
bill 
but a statement from wright and senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva indicated that they would press forward with the 
bill including the plantclosings provision 
we have consulted extensively with our colleagues a 
statement from democratic leaders said given todays trade 
figures and the resulting plunge in the stock market we now 
believe strongly that we should move as quickly as possible with a 
strong trade and competitiveness bill including protections for 
workers who are about to be laid off or whose plants are about to 
close 
the statement said that they had gone more than halfway to 
meet administration concerns 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas who 
had long campaigned for such a measure said that he expected the 
senate to take up the bill within the next several weeks and 
predicted overwhelming support for it 
concern for the trade numbers hardens support for the bill as 
it stands and when the market fell that tilted it to the final 
decision to go ahead bentsen said in a statement 
earlier thursday the commerce department reported that the us 
trade deficit widened dramatically in february to 138 billion 
its biggest shortfall since october and the second straight 
increase wall street reacted with a 10146 drop in the dow jones 
industrial average 
the plantclosing provision would require companies with at 
least 100 employees to provide 60day notice of plant closings and 
layoffs involving at least onethird of their work force layoffs 
of 500 or more even if less than onethird of the work force 
would have to be preceded by notice 
democrats said that another key factor that prompted wrights 
decision to press forward with the provision was intense pressure 
within the democratic caucus many of whose members were lobbied 
heavily by labor unions 
labor which was counting on the provision already was rankled 
after lawmakers jettisoned a provision of the bill sponsored by 
rep richard a gephardt dmo calling for 10 percent rollbacks 
in japanese and several other nations trade surpluses with the 
united states 
thursdays decision came as a surprise after the leaders met 
behind closed doors wednesday with union leaders and urged them to 
accept dropping the plantclosings provision which critics have 
said would be too burdensome for business 
top reagan administration officials met briefly with 
congressional leaders thursday to discuss trade legislation and 
then slipped away without commenting on results of the meeting 
were still exploring it wright told reporters after the 
30minute closeddoor session with treasury secretary james a 
baker iii and white house chief of staff howard h baker jr 
wright was asked about reports that lawmakers were unwilling to 
drop the sweeping 1000page trade bills controversial 
plantclosings provision without a guarantee that it would assure 
that the president would sign the rest of the measure 
i think they understand that wright said 
the plantclosings plan is among scores of provisions of the 
trade bill the central provisions would transfer authority to the 
us trade representative to retaliate against violations of 
international agreements and other unjustifiable acts the 
president now has that power 
other central provisions would streamline the machinery under 
which the government imposes import curbs to aid american 
businesses threatened by surges in imported goods 
meanwhile gephardt told reporters that the plantclosings 
provision should stay in the trade bill and that a number of 
democrats would abandon their support of the legislation if the 
laborbacked provision were dropped 
he said it was by no means clear that reagan would veto the bill 
if the measure contained plantclosings when it reached his desk

top soviet health officials said thursday that 
an anthrax outbreak that killed 64 people in sverdlovsk eight years 
ago was caused by contaminated meat not an accident at a 
germwarfare laboratory 
the officials including dr petr n burgasov the soviets 
deputy minister of health at the time made the comments during a 
conference on the disease at the johns hopkins school of public 
health 
there is no reason for any suspicion said burgasov who 
along with two companions had treated victims in sverdlovsk if 
there had been an explosion not 96 people would have been 
affected but literally hundreds of thousands of people 
the officials offered a detailed explanation of the april 1979 
accident discounting sketchy reports at the time by us officials 
that it was caused by exposure to a lethal biological agent 
the soviet explanation presented first in washington earlier 
this week has been hailed by us academicians as the most 
detailed public account of the outbreak 
the three soviet doctors said they are spending a week in the 
united states attempting to convince western physicians scholars 
and politicians of their explanation 
burgasov acknowledged that the soviets failure to disclose the 
incident led to suspicion in the west the fact that there was no 
data given at the time always leads to suspicion he said 
the disease which is caused by a bacteria killed 64 of the 96 
people it afflicted burgasov said speaking through an interpreter 
at a lecture attended by about 100 people 
anthrax which also kills cattle is transmitted most commonly 
by contact with infected animals according to the oxford textbook 
of medicine 
burgasov and dr vladimir sergiyev said the disease was traced 
back to a bonemeal animal feed that had been improperly processed 
at a soviet manufacturing plant 
the meal was fed to animals who subsequently died the meat was 
sold privately and illegally to people in sverdlovsk the doctors 
said 
in 1979 there was very little meat in the region burgasov 
said meat was a luxury it was used only on special occasions 
he said children did not become sick because they were fed daily 
at child care centers with food that came from a central 
distribution center 
vegetarians and people who did not eat the underground meat did 
not get sick burgasov said this is why we became suspicious of 
the meat 
all of the tragedy of this illness passed right before my 
eyes said dr vladimir nikiforov an expert in infectious 
diseases who treated many of the victims 
using graphic slides nikiforov showed symptoms of the two types 
of anthrax contaneous and gastrointestinal that afflicted 
victims in sverdlovsk 
those who had contaneous anthrax characterized by lesions on 
the skin eventually recovered victims of gastrointestinal 
anthrax in which the disease infects the stomach and intestines 
died within a two days of toxic shock nikiforov said 
dr alexander langmuir a former chief epidemiologist at the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta said he finds the 
soviet account credible 
langmuir who moderated the discussion at johns hopkins said he 
expects to learn more during the remainder of the soviets stay 
anthrax expert dr philip brachman of emory univeristy called 
the soviets presentation in washington a landmark report in an 
interview tuesday with the washington post 
brachman said the soviet doctors provided a pretty good 
indication that this incident was an outbreak of gastrointestinal 
anthrax caused by contaminated meat

defense lawyers looked to gov gerald l 
baliles for a lastminute reprieve thursday night for earl clanton 
jr scheduled to die in the electric chair for strangling a 
neighbor during a 1980 robbery 
the us supreme court in a 72 vote thursday night denied the 
33yearold clanton a stay justices william brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
marie deans of the virginia coalition on jails and prisons an 
organization that finds attorneys for death sentence appeals said 
a request for clemency would be presented to the governor 
earlier clanton was taken to a room adjacent to the state 
penitentiarys death chamber for a scheduled 11 pm execution 
it would be the seventh death sentence carried out in virginia 
and the 98th in the nation since the 1976 us supreme court ruling 
allowing states to resume use of the death penalty 
the appeal to the us supreme court had centered on abuse 
clanton contended he suffered as a child but did not disclose until 
after being sentenced to death in 1981 
clanton was one of six death row inmates who escaped from the 
mecklenburg correctional center in 1984 he was recaptured a day 
later while eating cheese and drinking wine with another escapee at 
a coin laundry in warrenton nc 
earlier thursday a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals unanimously overturned a stay that us district 
judge robert r merhige jr had granted tuesday 
merhige said he wanted to conduct a hearing on arguments that 
clanton was incompetent and unable to assist in his defense when a 
petersburg jury convicted him of the murder of wilhemina smith a 
school librarian who lived in his apartment building 
the appeal cited a psychiatric report saying clanton suppressed 
memories of his violent childhood thus hampering defense efforts 
to present mitigating evidence that could have resulted in a life 
sentence 
the appeals panel said clantons case had been given least 10 
reviews in state and federal courts and his sentencing had been 
found constitutional 
in addition the appeals court said clantons attorney had 
failed during a previous federal appeal to raise the issue of abuse 
after clanton had disclosed it 
at his 1981 trial clanton refused his lawyers request to 
submit to a psychiatric examination and the only mitigating 
evidence presented to the jury at his sentencing hearing was that 
he attended bible classes while in jail awaiting trial 
after the trial clanton said he was beaten as a child by his 
father and was sexually abused by his stepmother after leaving his 
father he moved to new jersey to live with his mother but got into 
trouble there and was convicted of a murder he was later paroled

died in the blast witnesses said one of the bodies at the entrance 
of the club was draped in a us flag 
italian hospital officials said at least four americans were 
among the injured

club for the commander of the uss paul a torpedo boat destroyer 
docked in naples a us consulate official could not confirm the 
report

leaders of the ussupported contra 
rebels and the leftist sandinista government said thursday they had 
reached a compromise that would allow ceasefire talks to go ahead 
the agreement to start highlevel negotiations in the nicaraguan 
capital friday came during the first official visit of contra 
representatives to the capital since the war started more than six 
years ago 
the two sides also resumed stalled talks on technical details of 
a temporary ceasefire such as how to provide the rebels with 
humanitarian aid and security 
maj gen joaquin cuadra lacaso chief of staff of the 
sandinista army and head of the governments delegation to the 
technical talks said before the meeting he was confident the two 
sides would finish discussing the plan for implementing the 
temporary ceasefire 
contra political representatives at the meeting included 
aristides sanchez roberto ferrey bosco matamoros and alejandro 
montiel arguello the rebels military delegation included jose 
benito bravo centeno and juan rivas 
in a compromise the sandinistas backed off demands that the 
technical talks be held in managua 
in exchange the contras retreated from their earlier insistence 
that fridays highlevel negotiations be conditioned on the 
successful outcome of the sapoa talks 
the contras agreed that if the talks are not finished today 
thursday theyll conclude in managua government information 
minister manuel espinoza said in a telephone interview 
two contra delegates ferrey and david stadthagen arrived from 
costa rica in a private plane in the morning to negotiate the 
compromise they were met at managuas sandino airport by tourism 
minister herty lewites 
it was the first time since the war began that the sandinistas 
allowed contra representatives to set foot in the capital 
in a brief talk with reporters later ferrey confirmed 
espinozas announcement that a compromise was reached 
in the technical talks military representatives from both sides 
are seeking agreement on how to implement a provisional ceasefire

the 60day ceasefire began april 1 even though many issues were 
still to be resolved 
so far both sides have agreed to seven ceasefire zones where 
the rebels will gather 
two points in the contra proposal were termed non negotiable 
by the sandinistas the contra proposal would allow the combatants 
to receive arms and amunition while in the zones and bar the 
government from accepting military aid which comes from the soviet 
bloc

a suspected member of japans terrorist 
red army charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turned 
over thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what he 
planned to do with the explosives 
the 35yearold suspect who was identified by officials in his 
native japan through fingerprints as yu kikumura is listed by the 
japanese foreign ministry as a suspected member of the leftwing 
red army 
us officials said they had not yet established ties between 
kikumura and any group 
we have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to 
answer said john c mcginley agent in charge of the fbi office 
in newark 
kikumura was arrested tuesday at a new jersey turnpike service 
area in ridgefield after a state trooper found three bombs in his 
car officials said 
superior court judge charles degisi released kikimura to federal 
agents without setting bail thursday kikimura was taken to a new 
york city jail to be held for a hearing friday before a us 
magistrate in newark 
in a complaint filed in us district court by the fbi 
authorities charged kikumura with possessing a fraudulent visa and 
unregistered firearms if convicted he faces up to 260000 in 
fines and up to 15 years in prison 
state and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said 
thursday they have little information about kikumura and what he 
planned to do with the bombs 
mcginley said kikimura had not spoken to federal officials since 
being taken into custody 
according to japanese authorities kikumura was acquitted in a 
japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his 
luggage at an airport in the netherlands which deported him 
the japanese news agency kyodo reported that kikumuras arrest 
tuesday had raised suspicions the red army might be planning 
attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations 
june 19 in toronto canada 
the red army which advocates simultaneous world revolution 
and is believed to have members allied with propalestinian groups 
in lebanon has been linked to a bloody attack on tel avivs lod 
airport in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a japan 
air lines plane in 1977 
the group has been largely inactive in the 1980s but south 
korean officials have expressed concern it might revive its 
terrorist activities at the olympics in september 
state police superintendent col clinton pagano said the 
terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the 
sophisticated nature of the bombs 
these are the first devices of this type that we have come 
across pagano said neither federal or state officials would 
elaborate 
according to the federal complaint police said the bombs 
consisted of three 18inch steel cylinders there was a total of 15 
pounds of black powder in the car officials said 
us attorney samuel alito said authorities have learned 
kikumura acquired an international drivers license in the name of 
masatoshi kishizona on jan 20 
kishizono is a 36yearold employee of a hospital in kyoto 
japan who had reported his passport missing police said 
on feb 29 kikumura using a fraudulent passport bearing 
kishizonas name applied for a visa to the united states at the 
us embassy in paris alito said he said kikumura entered the 
united states on march 8

the secretarygeneral considers the 
positions of iran and iraq too far apart for a ceasefire to work 
and has proposed a new peace plan under which he would control the 
timing of a truce and other factors 
javier perez de cuellar expressed his views in a written report 
submitted to the security council on wednesday after meeting with 
envoys of both nations a copy of the confidential 15page report 
was made available to the associated press on thursday by sources 
close to the proceedings 
the secretarygeneral has held four rounds of meetings in new 
york with the combatants at the councils request in an effort to 
get their clear support for a resolution adopted last july it 
demands an immediate ceasefire in the 7yearold war and 
withdrawal of troops 
perez de cuellar concluded the talks this week and said in his 
report i considered the positions of the two governments to 
be insufficient for purposes of implementing resolution 598 then 
asked them to reply to a new proposal he said he was awaiting 
their responses 
his latest plan a modification of others gives the 
secretarygeneral authority to control the timing and intervals for 
implementing the resolution 
it says the secretarygeneral would set a date for implementing 
the plan and on that day a ceasefire would commence and an 
impartial body would begin investigating which side started the war 
after an interval of several days to be determined by the 
secretarygeneral iran and iraq would begin withdrawing their 
forces after another interval also set by perez de cuellar other 
elements of the resolution would be carried out and both sides 
would announce their intention to repatriate all prisoners of war 
perez de cuellar has not commented publicly on the talks but 
diplomats say un peace efforts are stalled because of 
intransigence by iran and to a lesser degree iraq 
iraq has said it accepts the resolution if iran does so 
explicitly the iranians have said only that they endorse an 
outline given by the secretarygeneral for implementation not the 
resolution itself 
iran insists iraq be declared the aggressor before a ceasefire 
takes effect iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several 
border skirmishes 
the united states is urging the council to impose an arms 
embargo on iran to force its compliance with the resolution an 
embargo resolution is being drafted but the soviet union wants to 
allow more time for diplomacy 
in his report perez de cuellar said he emphasized to both sides 
that a ceasefire must be an irreversible step towards the 
overall solution not a recess used to rearm 
iraq has expressed concern that without a permanent ceasefire 
and immediate troop withdrawal iran would use a lull to rearm 
repair its damaged oil refineries and prepare for renewed warfare

shiite moslem hijackers freed another 
hostage from a kuwaiti jumbo jet thursday but said they will not 
retract their demands even if the price we have to pay is very 
high 
the release of the elderly grizzled man came after the 
hijackers resumed talks with algerian mediators on ending the 
10dayold crisis 
the man dressed in a white robe descended from the kuwait 
airways boeing 747 at 945 pm 345 edt got into a car and was 
driven across the tarmac to the vip lounge at houari boumedienne 
airport 
algerian officials said he was a kuwaiti named djuma abdallah 
chatti 
praise to god i am fine but they had me tied all the time 
and i am tired said chatti who gave his age as 70 
they are not good people he told reporters in the airport 
lounge they beat me 
at least 30 hostages remained on board the plane seized april 5 
on a bangkokkuwait flight 
the hijackers first diverted the plane to northern iran it flew 
three days later to larnaca cyprus where palestine liberation 
organization officials negotiated with the hijackers the gunmen 
have killed two passengers and freed 71 among the remaining 
hostages are three members of kuwaits royal family 
after the latest release the hijackers broadcast a message to 
the control tower in arabic and english repeating their demand for 
the release of 17 proiranian terrorists jailed in kuwait 
the statement said chatti had been released for strictly 
humanitarian reasons 
we repeat forcefully our demands for the liberation of our 17 
brothers in kuwait and we will not go back on them even if the 
price we have to pay is very high the statement said 
kuwaits deputy foreign minister mohammed alosaimi reiterated 
that the 17 would not be freed he is head of a highlevel kuwaiti 
delegation on the scene 
another kuwaiti official speaking to reporters on condition he 
not be identified said the algerian authorities continued to put 
pressure on kuwait to be more flexible in its position 
you can see this from the fact that they are telling us that 
the ball is in our court the official said 
negotiations between the hijackers and algerian mediators 
resumed thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the day 
caused by the lack of progress according to the official algerian 
news agency 
in washington lawmakers urged secretary of state george p 
shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackers 
might be responsible for kidnapping american journalist terry 
anderson in lebanon 
kuwaits independent alqabas newspaper reported wednesday that 
the alleged kidnapper imad mughniyeh was believed to have boarded 
the plane when it landed in mashhad iran 
mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs in 
beirut for hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be the 
umbrella organization for proiranian groups holding foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
plo chairman yasser arafat accused iran of being behind the 
hijacking and said some of the gunmen belong to the iranian 
government egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid echoed 
arafats comments thursday in cairo 
in a radio call to the airport tower thursday a passenger who 
identified himself as ahmed zayed said i ask my government to 
release the 17 islamic jihad prisoners if not they will kill us 
all 
islamic jihad or holy war is the group that holds anderson 
and it also is demanding the release of the 17 kuwaiti prisoners 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
was kidnapped march 16 1985 he has been held longer than any of 
the 22 foreign hostages in lebanon 
the hijackers said to be armed with grenades and guns have 
threatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostages 
if their demands are not met 
a ranking algerian official said wednesday that kuwaits 
intransigence had created the standstill 
algerias negotiating committee is divided into two teams led by 
interior minister hedi khediri one team is responsible for 
contacts with the kuwaitis and the other with the hijackers 
a doctor was allowed on board the plane thursday to examine the 
hostages 
i saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization or 
major medicine said dr youssef mahdi he later told the 
official algerian news agency that he prescribed some routine 
medicines that would be sent to the plane 
the passengers i saw did not have their hands tied and 
displayed no signs of physical violence mahdi said 
an airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food 
the algerian official said 
in a letter wednesday to shultz sen daniel moynihan and rep 
louise slaughter both new york democrats wrote we know the 
united states is not a primary party to the algiers negotiations 
but if terry andersons chief kidnapper is on the kuwaiti jet the 
united states government must ensure that the negotiators are aware 
of this fact 
it would be a travesty for imad mughniyeh to go free while 
terry anderson remains a captive they said 
the plane landed in algeria on tuesday night 
it was moved early thursday to the end of the runway so another 
jet could land it was later returned to its original position 
about 400 yards from the terminal

indianas supreme court decided thursday 
that the case of a young woman who underwent an abortion in 
defiance of a court order will be heard by a lower court first 
because theres no longer any urgency 
the 18yearold woman meanwhile refused to discuss the matter 
she would just like to disappear said samuel e beecher 
jr attorney for the unmarried terre haute woman identified in 
court documents only as vjh shes a very private person she 
never imagined that she would have had this publicity 
the womans attorneys announced wednesday that she had undergone 
an abortion despite a vigo circuit court order prohibiting her from 
terminating her pregnancy the order was issued monday at the 
request of a 24yearold terre haute truck driver who claimed to be 
the father 
after the court order was issued attorneys for both sides had 
asked for an expedited appeal to the state supreme court on 
thursday the justices rejected that request 
you have to have two things a question of great public 
importance and an emergency situation said court administrator 
karl mulvaney the courts feeling is that clearly there is no 
emergency any more 
the case will be heard first by a threejudge panel of the state 
court of appeals the case has not been assigned yet mulvaney said 
because the case involves a paternity action the names of the 
man and the woman are not revealed in court documents the womans 
attorneys dispute the mans claim to be the father 
richard a waples legal director of the indiana civil liberties 
union argued that previous us supreme court decisions give the 
mother sole authority to terminate a pregnancy during the first 
three months 
but waples said he wanted the injunction issued by vigo circuit 
judge robert h brown overturned because if this order is allowed 
to go uncorrected other judges might be tempted to do the same 
james bopp jr attorney for the national right to life 
organization and for the terre haute man said he wants a higher 
court ruling on whether a fathers rights should be weighed against 
the mothers in such cases 
bobb said in court papers that his client was upset about the 
abortion and thought the mother terminated the pregnancy for 
frivolous reasons 
waples said that he has found at least three cases where the 
mothers right to go ahead and have an abortion despite a court 
order was ultimately upheld 
bopp said he isnt interested in punishing the woman and 
beecher said brown has indicated he wouldnt seek a contempt 
citation which could carry penalties of a 500 fine and 90 days in 
jail

leaders of two actors unions voted 
resoundingly to end a strike that virtually halted production of 
new radio and tv commercials for more than three weeks officials 
announced thursday 
the screen actors guild and the american federation of 
television and radio artists boards voted 123 to 29 to approve a 
tentative threeyear contract said sag spokesman mark locher 
the vote tuesday and wednesday must be ratified by the 100000 
members of the two unions but the strike is being suspended as of 
friday morning locher said 
the unions will mail contract terms and ballots to members next 
week recommending approval of the contract he said the final 
votes are due back may 20 
we feel that we achieved the most important principal behind 
the strike and that was establishing payment for the cable use of 
commercials which used to be free locher said 
other terms of the contract locher said include a 10 percent 
increase in minimum session fees raising payments from 333 to 
366 for an eighthour workday a 135 percent increase in radio 
commercial rates for aftra members and an increase in 
contributions by producers to performers health and pension plans 
bob stephens vice president of the western office of the 
american association of advertising agencies said thursday 
afternoon that he had not yet been notified of the settlement 
im sure the advertising agency community will be 
thrilled stephens said 
a call seeking comment from the associations new york 
headquarters went unanswered thursday evening 
the strike which began march 21 virtually halted production of 
new commercials but ads continued to be broadcast because typical 
contracts between advertisers and actors allow use of the product 
for up to 21 months 
commercial work accounted for payments of 417 million to actors 
in 1987 about half the total paid for acting of all kinds

sen albert gore jr on thursday renewed his attack on 
democratic presidential rival michael dukakis for his statement 
about use of nuclear weapons in the event of a soviet invasion of 
europe dukakis told gore give me a buzz and ill tell you 
exactly what i said 
gore dukakis and jesse jackson met in a onehour debate in new 
york city that served more to highlight their similarities than 
their differences 
except for the exchanges between gore and dukakis on nuclear 
weapons the forum sponsored by wcbs and newsday was a lowkey 
gentlemanly encounter in which the candidates appeared determined 
to avoid the sharp clashes that have marked the new york primary 
campaign 
earlier in the day jackson denounced litmus tests of race and 
religion spouted from the mouths of public officials as one 
official new york mayor edward koch endorsed gore 
meanwhile polls put dukakis on top with jackson trailing and 
gore at the bottom in the battle for survival in tuesdays new york 
primary 
during the debate gore was asked if there were any 
circumstances under which he would consider using nuclear weapons 
the tennessee senator used the occasion to renew his criticism of 
dukakis for saying in a newspaper interview that he would reserve 
his option to use nuclear weapons in the event of a soviet invasion 
of europe 
this is a serious mistake said gore referring to the 
dukakis statement it has never been done by presidents or 
presidential candidates 
was that an answer to your question dukakis asked the 
moderator 
jackson said there was a real danger in those of us who may 
very well lead our country to get trapped into a hypothetical 
situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy the whole 
world to prove that you got macho 
when gore raised the issue again later in the debate dukakis 
said dont pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press 
conference give me a buzz and ill tell you exactly what i said 
and therell be much less confusion 
even on middle east policy which has produced sharp differences 
during the new york campaign the candidates concentrated on their 
areas of agreement 
meanwhile republican nomineetobe george bush keeping to a 
lowkey campaign schedule ran into a wave of enthusiasm for 
jackson among washington toddlers 
jesse jackson jesse jackson jesse jackson the children 
chanted after a reporter shouted a question to bush about jackson 
during the vice presidents visit to a labor department day care 
center 
with the focus on the new york primary koch stepped into the 
spotlight thursday afternoon to announce his endorsement of gore as 
a man of intellect courage and integrity he said gore is 
head and shoulders above his rivals on israeli issues 
dukakis reacted mildly to the endorsment saying in boston he 
likes us both and jackson said what he has done by choosing 
someone is positve and fair and proper 
but jacksons tone was quite different when he lashed out at 
koch president reagan and former democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro for what he called racebased 
questions 
we went across the south on super tuesday without a single 
catcall or boo without a single ugly sign at a mass meeting 
jackson told the american society of newspaper editors in 
washington it was not until we got north to new york that the 
litmus tests of race and religion became spouted from the mouths of 
public officials without a significant media challenge 
there are those who are making racebased statments 
unfortunately whether mr reagan or mr koch or ms ferraro 
jackson said to reporters i simply say some people are making 
hysteria while im making history 
koch said recently that jews would be crazy to vote for 
jackson because of his positions on israel 
reagan told the editors on wednesday that jackson has been 
spared criticism because of the fear that comments would be 
interpreted as some kind of racial attack 
in a wednesday night speech ms ferraro lauded jackson but 
added that if he were not black he wouldnt be in the race 
she said he cant win the nomination nor the general election 
the news from the new york polls was good for dukakis and 
improving for jackson but bad for gore 
dukakis led jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a cbs news 
poll 46 percent to 34 percent in a marist college poll and 49 
percent to 34 percent in an abc newswashington post poll gore had 
only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third 
among likely democratic primary voters surveyed monday and 
tuesday by the marist college institute for public opinion dukakis 
had the support of 46 percent jackson 34 percent gore 7 percent 
and uncommitted 5 percent eight percent of those polled were 
undecided the poll of 359 people had a potential sampling error of 
5 percentage points either way 
meanwhile dukakis picked up the support of at least 54 of 
puerto ricos delegates to the democratic national convention in 
july that gave dukakis a gain of 74 delegates in the past seven 
days as he continued to pick up strength among the partys 
unpledged super delegates 
the latest ap delegate count gave dukakis 81615 to 7151 for 
jackson gore trailed with 40455 while uncommitted delegates 
totaled 47475 sen paul simon of illinois whose campaign is on 
hold had 1735

an engine on a piedmont jetliner 
exploded into jagged pieces thursday slicing through both sides of 
the plane and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing as 
some passengers screamed and fainted 
no injuries were reported among the 56 passengers and four crew 
members but passengers said some on board fainted after the 
turbine blades ripped through the right rear bathroom and a work 
area for attendants as the plane cruised at 31000 feet

the violent realistic gang drama colors 
opens friday at 425 theaters across the country amid a debate 
between its critics and its makers over whether the film will 
inspire more youth violence 
a spokesman for one group of law enforcement officers says the 
movie will leave dead bodies from one end of this town to the 
other but the filmmakers say the film is a statement of 
conscience and will save lives 
this is not the right time to release a movie like this 
said los angeles city councilman nate holden since april 4 there 
have been 89 gangrelated deaths in los angeles city and county 
last year there were 387 gangrelated deaths in the area

the late afternoon sun casts long 
shadows over the clapboard houses that line main street in walpack 
center its dead still but thats not unusual 
walpack township is dying 
and walpack center the oncethriving hub of the community is 
nearly a ghost town having faded year by year since the federal 
government bought up the surrounding countryside to build a dam 
and then changed its mind 
there seems to be no trace of what was here like it never 
happened township clerk virginia e fuller said as she and her 
husband mayor raymond fuller settled into chairs on the 
glassenclosed front porch of their home outside walpack center 
it was an active community she recalled we had a fire 
department and a ladies auxilliary we used to take the bus to the 
city every now and then 
its like it was all erased she added 
suits me fine her husband said trying to appear 
cantankerous but breaking into booming laughter 
only the municipal building an old oneroom schoolhouse and 
the rescue squad garage are still owned by the township 
the federal government owns the former methodist church which 
is now locked along with six houses and a post office that make up 
the rest of walpack center 
the houses all are painted the same beige with green trim 
lending an eerie quality to the silence the post office is open 
only two hours six days a week 
spreading from the township center are acres of what once was 
pasture but the farmhouses the fences and barns are long gone 
the death knell for walpack sounded in 1962 when congress 
authorized a plan to build a dam at tocks island a few miles north 
up the delaware river the idea was to create a 12000acre lake 
along 37 miles of the delaware river from port jervis ny to the 
delaware water gap 
the federal government spent 9 million on engineering for the 
proposed dam between pennsylvania and new jersey an additional 
752 million bought land for the lake and a surrounding park the 
lake was to be used for recreation and water supply while the dam 
would provide hydroelectric power and flood control 
but congress never appropriated money to build the dam because 
of environmental and economic objections 
in 1978 it turned the project over from the army corps of 
engineers to the national park service which is turning the land 
and river into the 69000acre delaware water gap national 
recreation area 
the federal government now owns all but about 5000 acres of the 
land it intends to incorporate into the park that land in new 
jersey and pennsylvania is still privately owned 
the fullers whose home is on a halfacre plot are among about 
90 residents left in walpack township a 45squaremile community 
that falls entirely within the recreation area 
the fullers both 62 say they intend to stay in walpack and 
serve as mayor and clerk as long as they are able they wont sell 
out to the government as their neighbors did 
people think were crazy for staying but its great mrs 
fuller said gazing across a deep ravine to the pines on a far 
ridge 
the governments objective for the area is to provide 
opportunities for outdoor recreation said richard ring the park 
services assistant superintendent of the area 
probably got just as much use before mrs fuller said 
more said her husband 
but ring says 25 million people visit the recreation area 
annually to hunt fish swim ride bikes hike and go boating and 
canoeing on the river officials expect the number to double in the 
next decade he said 
to accommodate the visitors the park service plans to set up 
restrooms picnic areas refreshment stands boat landings and 
trails for hiking and biking 
there also are a number of historic facilities that folks can 
come and tour ring said 
among those historic facilities are homes once owned by people 
like the fullers the buildings in walpack center may eventually 
house country inns craft shops art galleries museums 
restaurants or other facilities consistent with the 
governments objectives for the area ring said 
thousands of other houses that were deemed to have no historic 
or cultural value were torn down 
we fought it like the devil fuller said of opposition to 
the federal plans 
walpack established in the 1750s had a yearround population 
of about 375 in the early 1960s with numbers swelling to about 
3000 in the summer the fullers said most residents were dairy 
farmers and most summer people came for the fishing and hunting or 
the solitude 
sometimes its hard to remember what it was like mrs 
fuller said

these are the best of times and the 
worst of times for willie l brown jr the flamboyant speaker of 
the california assembly and national chairman of jesse jacksons 
presidential campaign 
they are heady times for brown as the jackson campaign continues 
to exceed expectations and jackson emerges as a serious contender 
for the democratic nomination for president 
they are also tough times for brown as he is under siege as 
never before on his home turf in the halls of the state capitol 
where his 7year rule of the assembly is in danger 
brown voices quiet confidence in both arenas in the jackson 
campaign he modestly understates his current role or potential 
influence at the democratic national convention in california 
political circles his public calm conceals a desperate battle to 
hold his powerful office 
browns appointment as jacksons national chairman last november 
was widely reported as a major boost to jacksons campaign 
as the black leader of a predominately white legislative body 
and as a preeminent fundraiser for california democrats brown 
was seen as someone possessing the political skills prestige 
experience and contacts jackson needed most to broaden his 
constituency among white political leaders and voters 
thats exactly what has happened to the jackson campaign and 
while brown publicly gives all of the credit to jackson his 
influence in the campaign appears strong and brown is increasingly 
being viewed as a key player in picking the next democratic nominee 
if the convention becomes deadlocked 
brown who originally backed new york gov mario cuomo for the 
1988 nomination acknowledges that he was initially attracted to 
the jackson campaign as a vehicle to get in the room of major 
players who would pick the democratic nominee if the convention 
deadlocked 
i need to get a horse with 1000 chits delegates to get in 
the room jesse looks like my best agent the washington post 
quoted brown as saying a year ago 
brown confirmed that quote earlier this month but said im 
beyond that now and that his goal is trying to secure the 
nomination for mr jackson 
ive been there once in the inner circle picking a 
presidential nominee and im going to be back brown said 
referring to 1972 when he cochaired the california delegation 
which was key to winning the nomination for george mcgovern 
brown claims to have raised 1 million for jackson a good chunk 
of the candidates overall treasury and he talks regularly by 
telephone to jackson a compulsive caller 
but while browns potential influence on national politics is 
greater than ever before his political base is sacramento is 
crumbling 
the 54yearold brown who was raised in a oneroom house in 
racially segregated mineola tex hitchhiked to san francisco 
after high school and worked as a janitor while living with an 
uncle and attending college and law school 
he started a storefront law practice in 1959 which by his own 
description was primarily pimps and prostitutes and became 
active in civil rights demonstrations within five years brown 
then 30 had won a seat in the state assembly 
by 1971 brown was chairman of the ways and means committee a 
powerful fiscal post which paradoxically made brown nominally the 
legislative author of thengov ronald reagans state budgets 
then in a 1980 coalition with the republican minority brown 
defeated two other democrats to become assembly speaker an office 
which the late jesse unruh had transformed a decade earlier from a 
ceremonial presiding officers job into a fundraising and 
policymaking post second in influence only to the governor 
the speakers office replete with both the subtle and overt 
trappings of power fit brown like a glove 
his wit and flamboyant style made him an instant success as a 
fundraiser helping him raise up to 5 million annually for other 
democrats thereby cementing his hold on the office and freeing him 
from dependence on a coalition with republicans 
being speaker brown said was like being the ayatollah of 
california with power to set the legislative agenda and assign 
or remove colleagues from legislative committees 
it also gave him an office in the capitol he describes as 
bigger than my home town which matched nicely the taste for 
lavish parties 1000 suits and 100000 sports cars which brown 
acquired as his private law practice has evolved from criminal to 
corporate 
but as the democratic majority in the 80seat assembly has 
slipped under brown from 47 to the current 44 seats complaints 
grew that his flamboyance and sometimes embarrassing remarks were 
hurting democrats more than his fundraising was helping them 
this came to a head earlier this year when five conservative 
assembly democrats motivated by a variety of relatively obscure 
personal disagreements with brown bolted his leadership without 
their support brown retains the title and outward trappings of the 
speakership but without a working majority 
the five have aligned themselves with republicans to push 
antiabortion death penalty and wiretap bills which brown 
previously bottled up in committee and they have even defeated 
routine legislative housekeeping rules backed by brown 
brown at first punished the five stripping them of most 
legislative duties and banishing them to smaller capitol offices 
more recently he has ignored or downplayed the defeats contending 
it never was his intent to dictate policy 
the five dissident democrats who hold the balance of power in 
the assembly say they have no intention now of trying to oust 
brown 
why should we we are controlling the policy agenda says 
one of the five democrat rusty areias 
that means brown can probably continue to occupy the speakers 
office until the current assembly session adjourns aug 31 
brown says he will reelected speaker next year but unless he 
wins back the five dissident democrats his hopes for another term 
as speaker depend on either winning at least two more democratic 
seats this year to create a majority not dependent on the five 
rebels or forging another coalition with republicans 
as sacramentobased political columnist dan walters puts it 
there is a growing sense in the capitol that browns days as 
speaker are numbered but no one has figured out the number yet

confidence among top business executives in the 
us economy following octobers stock market crash has rebounded 
according to the conference board 
during the first quarter the business research groups measure 
of business confidence ticked up to 51 after falling to a fiveyear 
low of 47 in the final quarter of 1987 the group said wednesday 
the measure reflects a scale of 0 to 100 
more than a third of the 1000 executives polled said they 
expect to have greater problems finding qualified employees this 
year than in the previous year the conference board said nearly 20 
percent of the executives polled expect employment in their 
industries to rise this year but 29 percent expect job losses 
business services and the instruments and primary metals 
industries hold the brightest employment prospects while banking 
gas and electric utilities and the insurance industry are likely to 
be hit with job losses the board reported 
the moderate rise in business executives confidence parallels 
an upturn in consumer confidence during the first quarter said 
conference board economist steven malin 
a strong irony in the latest survey is that all of the 
increased optimism revolves around likely business conditions later 
this year not now he added

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange reached 
new highs again on thursday morning while the us dollar rose 
marginally against the japanese yen in early foreign exchange 
activity 
the bellwether nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
climbed for the fourth consecutive day adding another 6752 points 
to wednesdays record close to finish the morning session at 
2705307 
it was the first time the nikkei average ever topped 27000 
surpassing its previous intraday high of 2698836 points hit in 
early trading on monday the nikkei index has come within five 
points of the 27000 mark in intraday trading three times this 
week but slipped back each time amid the continuing market rally 
in currency trading the dollar opened at 12620 yen down 025 
yen from wednesdays finish but later edged higher and was 
changing hands at 12635 yen by late morning 
fumihiko morimoto of the investment firm first boston said the 
market was supported by continued strength on wall street and 
somewhat by the agreement among the seven top industrialized 
nations to continue cooperating to keep the dollar from falling 
further 
in a twopage joint communique after a meeting wednesday in 
washington the finance ministers and central bank governors of the 
seven nations announced the extension of a dec 22 agreement in 
which they pledged to stabilize the us currency 
the socalled group of seven nations are the united states 
japan france britain canada italy and germany 
a dealer at a major us investment firm speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the foreign exchange market likely would be 
affected more by the release thursday of us trade figures for 
february 
the us trade deficit has affected the dollars direction in 
recent months because the us administration has supported a lower 
dollar as a way of narrowing the gap

the flying public already wary of 
financiallytroubled texas air corp could be driven further away 
by the governments unprecedented special investigation of the 
nations biggest airline company observers say 
the department of transportation announced wednesday it would 
investigate whether texas air and its management were fit 
willing and able to carry commercial air traffic 
the government has investigated small airlines and has revoked 
the operating licenses of some minor carriers but analysts say the 
dots new inquiry is the first involving major us airlines 
houstonbased texas air an industry giant with a commanding 20 
percent of all us air traffic is the parent company of eastern 
airlines and continental airlines 
the federal probe added to the companys financial and labor 
headaches could drive still more passengers away as texas airs 
tarnished image deteriorates further 
its quite serious said james v cammisa publisher of 
travel industry indicators an industry newsletter both eastern 
and continental are suffering from image problems now anyway 
texas air stock dropped more than 1 a share to 1075 on the 
american stock exchange when news of the dot investigation hit the 
market the stock closed at 1087 down 87 cents from tuesday 
in a separate action on wednesday the federal aviation 
administration announced a civil penalty of 823000 against 
miamibased eastern because of recurring trends of violations 
of safety regulations the fine was imposed just over a year after 
eastern agreed to pay a 95 million penalty in connection with 
other safety violations 
the latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in 
september and october but eastern now has an opportunity to 
challenge it if the airline can produce evidence the faa considers 
valid the fine could be reduced 
no airline likes to raise the specter of safety at all said 
anthony hatch an industry analyst for argus research corp he said 
its difficult to estimate how many people would not fly the 
airline as a result of the negative publicity surrounding the 
federal probe 
texas air and its aggressive chairman frank lorenzo have been 
locking horns with unions at eastern over proposed pay cuts and 
other labor issues lorenzo put houstonbased continental into 
bankruptcy in 1983 and emerged with a nonunion airline 
the texas air carriers have a debt of around 54 billion but 
lorenzo has set up a corporate structure that insulates the parent 
company from most of the burden the company sustained record 
losses of 466 million last year 
his hardnosed tactics including stringent costcutting and 
periodically triggering fare wars have caused bitter conflicts 
with the companys unions and in other quarters more than 150 
congressmen recently supported a resolution in favor of a probe of 
texas air 
if the dot determines texas air is unfit to carry traffic the 
agency could revoke its operating license suggested dr alfred 
kahn the architect of deregulation of the us airline industry in 
1978 
but kahn and others noted the dot doesnt have legal authority 
to force out lorenzo and other managers approved by the companys 
shareholders 
we ought to be damned careful that this is an honest inquiry 
not a political one said kahn now a professor of political 
economy at cornell university in ithaca ny

transportation secretary jim burnley said 
today the federal investigation of texas air corp and its 
subsidiary eastern airlines should be considered a shot across 
the bow of any airline that might compromise safety due to 
financial pressures 
meanwhile an eastern official blamed the investigation 
announced wednesday on pressure from unions 
burnley also said that air travelers should be greatly reassured 
by a planned monthlong safety probe of easterns fleet saying it 
could bring the safest 30 days in the history of that airline or 
almost any airline in us history 
burnley interviewed on nbctvs today show said he would 
not hesitate to fly eastern despite the investigation and a 
proposed 823000 fine he announced 
burnley said federal aviation administration officials have not 
been satisfied with easterns performance since it was taken over 
by texas air 14 months ago theyve made a lot of progress on the 
safety side on the maintenance side but we dont know that 
theyre quite where we want them to be he said 
weve got to be absolutely certain that no airline is building 
up financial pressures that cause anybody in the company to think 
that theres any reason to cut on the safety side burnley said 
if theres any other airline in this country which is even 
contemplating that strategy i certainly hope that they take this 
as a shot across the bow 
eastern president phil bakes blamed the faa action on pressure 
from unions which have raised public safety issues during 
negotiations with the airlines bakes said on cbs this morning 
that eastern has invested 150 million more in maintenance since 
the texas air takeover 
the faa has been under enormous political pressure because of 
the union negotiations he said 
eastern ran fullpage ads in newspapers today including the 
washington post and the new york times saying it welcomed the 
probe because it will show the airline is operating safely and has 
been unfairly treated by federal authorities 
were confident the outcome will be a very good one bakes 
said 
texas air called both investigations unwarranted and blamed them 
on pressure from union leaders who have mounted a continuing 
campaign of distortion and lies about safety at both eastern and 
another subsidiary continental airlines 
continental is the countrys fourth largest airline while 
eastern is the sixth largest together they carry nearly 20 percent 
of the nations air traffic 
eastern has for months been embroiled in a bitter confrontation 
with its labor unions which are resisting managements call for 
significant contract concessions and which accused texas air of 
syphoning off the most profitable parts of the airline 
in announcing the twopronged action against texas air and its 
airline subsidiaries burnley cited evidence in recent company 
filings to the securities and exchange commission that both eastern 
and continental are under substantial increasing financial 
pressure 
the department wants to determine if texas air and its 
management are fit willing and able to carry commercial air 
traffic burnley said at a news conference also attended by faa 
administrator allan mcartor 
mcartor said the new faa safety review of eastern was being 
conducted because of concern about the continuing pattern of 
fines safety violations and apparent insensitivity of some of 
easterns officials to faa safety regulations 
the faa inspection would include examination of each of 
easterns 267 aircraft over the next 30 days 
the 823000 civil penalty against eastern comes 14 months after 
eastern agreed to pay 95 million in penalties because of earlier 
safety infractions faa officials said the latest fine stems from 
record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found 
in the earlier action 
the latest fine is based on findings from an investigation last 
september and october but eastern now has an opportunity to 
challenge it if the airline can produce evidence the faa considers 
valid the fine could be reduced 
bakes called the latest faa action unfair and expressed concern 
that it may prompt some travelers not to fly eastern last month 
passenger revenue at eastern dropped 20 percent compared to march 
1987 he said 
texas air corp had record losses of 466 million last year and 
has an overall debt of about 54 billion nevertheless the 
houstonbased company said in a statement wednesday that it 
remains financially strong with over 850 million in cash at the 
end of the first quarter 
but news of the federal investigation caused texas air stock to 
drop more than 1 a share to 1075 on the american stock 
exchange during trading wednesday the stock finally closed at 
1087 down 87 cents from tuesday 
there has been increasing sentiment in congress in recent months 
for a closer examination of texas air a resolution urging such a 
probe has gained the support of more than 150 congressmen 
transportation department officials said concern about eastern 
and continentals health was heightened by recent financial filings 
by texas air 
the recent activities of the texas air corp and its carriers 
particularly continental and eastern raise questions concerning 
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety 
and economic rules applicable to air carriers the department 
said in its order for an investigation 
it said a number of financial transactions between texas air and 
the two subsidiary airlines raise questions concerning whether 
substantial funds and other resources are being diverted from the 
air carrier subsidiaries 
the department questioned for example 
texas air shifting easterns profitable computer reservation 
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note which 
may be less than the systems fair market value 
eastern paying substantial fees for management services 
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company 
eastern accepting a nointerest note instead of cash for 16 
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its 
acquisition by texas air 
texas air borrowing 25 million from eastern in march 1987 in 
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when eastern was having 
cash flow problems

in april 1989 deliveries of the new 400 series orders will 
continue into 1994 
boeing chairman frank shrontz announced the sale in seoul with 
kal president ck cho

three major customers 
japan air lines all nippon airways and british airways have 
complained recently of poor workmanship in boeing 747 and 767 
jetliners shrontz met earlier this week in tokyo with the 
president of jal who wrote him last month about defects but 
details of the discussion were not released 
boeing executive vice president phil condit responded to the 
criticism on tuesday saying the company builds safe airplanes and 
that letters about quality concerns are not unusual 
the new 747400 features improved range fuel economy 
aerodynamics and avionics 
cho said the planes were ordered because of the airlines 
expected growth and need for airplanes with a high standard of 
reliability and comfort 
the boeing contracts were in line with kals longterm program 
to organize worldwide service networks and improve its 
competitiveness in the world airline market kal officials in seoul 
said 
the contracts also were part of kals efforts to prepare for an 
expected sharp increase in air travelers following a recent seoul 
government decision to ease restrictions on foreign trips by south 
koreans the officials said 
test flights of the first 747400 which rolled out of boeings 
everett factory in a ceremony in late january have been delayed 
because of electrical problems on tuesday company officials said 
they expected the plane to begin flight testing by the end of this 
month and be certified by the federal aviation administration 
before the years end 
boeing said deliveries of the first four 400s two each to 
northwest airlines and singapore airlines still are expected in 
december 
the jumbo jets ordered by kal will carry up to 398 passengers in 
a threeclass arrangement the airline said the new planes will be 
able to carry a full passenger and cargo payload nonstop between 
seoul and new york

of nearly 15 billion

week the market started going down tuesday it went down yesterday

the worlds top financial leaders today tried 
to put the best face on a surprisingly large us trade deficit in 
an effort to calm currency markets thrown into disarray by the 
unexpected dose of bad news 
the dollar plunged immediately after the commerce department 
reported that the imbalance between us imports and exports surged 
to 138 billion in february the highest monthly imbalance since 
the record october figure 
the trade deficit report came one day after the worlds seven 
major industrial countries held highlevel talks in washington and 
pledged renewed cooperation to support the value of the dollar at 
current levels 
before todays trade report the seven countries had been 
successful for four months in their efforts to stabilize the 
greenback 
basking in that success the seven nations had issued a glowing 
communique on wednesday in which they renewed their commitment to 
use intervention as a way to keep the dollar from falling further 
intervention is the process by which governments buy currencies on 
the open market in order to prop up their value 
the bad trade number immediately tested the economic powers 
resolve as the dollar plunged precipitously dropping below a level 
of 125 yen that benchmark is considered to be the target the 
industrial powers are aiming at in their dollarstabilization drive 
currency traders reported that the central banks of germany the 
united states england switzerland and italy were intervening 
today in an effort to break the dollars fall 
treasury secretary james a baker iii the prime architect of a 
threeyear effort to manage currency exchange rates was grimfaced 
and said nothing as he arrived for todays session of finance 
ministers being held as part of the spring meeting of the 
151nation international monetary fund 
while baker did not talk to reporters before the closeddoor 
sessions began a text of his remarks to the finance ministers was 
released later in those comments baker played down the 
significance of the february surge in the us trade deficit 
the trade figures released this morning should be seen in 
context as we have said before too much emphasis should not be 
placed on any one months figures baker said monthly trade 
figures are by their nature erratic 
baker said the important thing to realize was that the overall 
trend pointed to an improving us trade performance this year he 
said one of the reasons for this optimistic view was the success 
that the major industrial countries have had in coordinating an 
economic policy 
he said the united states has made great strides in cutting the 
federal budget deficit while japan britain and germany have all 
taken significant actions to boost domestic growth efforts that 
the united states has long urged as a way of increasing the demand 
for american products 
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg also tried to 
play down the significance of the onemonth surge in the us trade 
deficit 
it is a monthly figure we do not expect that it will change 
the basic trend stoltenberg said during a break in the 
closeddoor talks 
asked if the countries would now be forced to set a new base 
level for the dollar considering the fact that it had dropped 
below the 125yen level stoltenberg said that is a very good 
question a thousanddollar question 
neither stoltenberg nor karl otto poehl the head of the west 
german central bank would confirm that central banks were 
intervening today to support the dollar 
but stoltenberg said the central banks will cooperate there 
is no doubt we announced it yesterday 
the socalled group of seven including the united states 
japan west germany britain france canada and italy issued a 
twopage communique wednesday reaffirming their dec 22 pact to 
keep the international value of the dollar stable 
but todays new assault on the dollar served to emphasize just 
how difficult it may be to uphold that commitment 
the united states and its six allies decided in september 1985 
to push the dollar lower to correct americas huge trade deficit 
but the countries have been trying since february 1987 to halt the 
currencys decline 
the effort did not meet with much success last year and the 
steadily deteriorating dollar was cited as one of the reasons the 
worlds financial markets were thrown into turmoil last october 
but since dec 22 the major industrial countries have crafted a 
new strategy to stabilize the dollar and that agreement has held 
for the past four months backed up by periodic intervention in 
currency markets the process of buying the dollar to prop up its 
value 
baker first unveiled his commodity price indicator at the last 
meeting of the seven countries finance leaders in september some 
nations expressed skepticism then wondering whether the idea was a 
veiled effort to reintroduce a gold standard 
but baker picked up enough converts to get the proposal 
endorsed although other finance ministers stressed that many 
details of the plan including just what commodities to include 
still remain to be worked out 
baker has insisted that his approach is not an effort to return 
to the goldbased monetary system that existed between the end of 
world war ii and 1973 for most of that time the price of gold was 
fixed at 35 an ounce and the currencies of other governments were 
set at fixed rates based on the dollar 
president nixon broke the link with gold in 1973 as the 
socalled bretton woods system crumbled under the weight of rising 
inflation and large trade imbalances 
in another victory for baker the joint statement wednesday 
singled out the newly industrialized countries in asia for 
criticism for their continued high trade surpluses it urged those 
nations to do more to lower their own barriers to other countries 
exports and to allow their currencies to rise in value in relation 
to the dollar 
these developments are seen as critical by the administration if 
the united states is to make progess this year in reducing its 
trade deficit which hit a record 171 billion in 1987 almost 
onefourth of that total came in trade with south korea taiwan 
hong kong and singapore

the irs which has been giving wrong answers 
to about 28 of every 100 telephoned tax questions today offered 
taxpayers some tips on how to avoid penalties for following such 
bad advice 
penalties imposed for late filing of a return negligence or 
failure to pay taxes due may be waived if taxpayers can show 
reasonable cause for their actions that led to the penalties the 
internal revenue service said 
the irs said that in weighing whether a taxpayer who got 
erroneous advice acted reasonably it will consider 
whether the taxpayer tried to get the correct answer to a tax 
question from tax forms instructions or official publications 
the actual question asked of and specific facts given to an irs 
telephone assister 
the specific answer given the taxpayer 
the agency indicated the taxpayers case would be helped if he 
or she took down the name of the employee who gave the bad advice 
and the date and time of the call 
the irs said it is unlikely to waive penalties for paying taxes 
with a bad check or for understating tax liability by more than 
5000

committed this particular grand jury was under my supervision and 
i am quite upset that this information was leaked to the press 
she said 
helmsley 80 and his 68yearold wife are one of the worlds 
wealthiest couples their holdings including the empire state 
building and the helmsley palace hotel are worth an estimated 14 
billion 
the couple arrived at the attorney generals office to surrender 
in a gray limousine followed by a second limousine carrying their 
own security people 
they said good morning to reporters when one reporter asked 
helmsley what his greatest achievement had been he answered 
marrying her 
from the attorney generals office the helmsleys were taken to 
police headquarters for booking and then to manhattan criminal 
court 
in the courtroom the helmsleys sat quietly in the front row as 
drug dealers and thieves were arraigned and exchanged words from 
time to time 
the state indictment against each defendant included 139 counts 
of falsifying business records 44 counts of offering a false 
instrument for filing three counts of scheme to defraud one count 
of conspiracy and one misdemanor count of scheme to defraud 
the indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and 
1986 
the charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy income 
tax evasion filing false and fraudulent income tax returns mail 
fraud and for mrs helmsley and turco conspiracy to commit 
extortion 
the helmsleys are accused of disguising millions of dollars in 
renovation costs on their greenwich conn mansion as business 
expenses and writing the bills off as tax deductions 
approximately 4 million was used to refurbish the mansion that 
money bought an enclosure for one of the estates two pools a 
breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that 
enclosure installation of an elaborate indooroutdoor stereo 
system more than 200000 in landscaping and an assortment of

estimates the value of the landscaping work at 370000 
on wednesday the helmsleys attorney stephen kaufman 
denounced the taxcheating accusations unfounded unfair and 
unjust 
the helmsleys have paid more taxes to the government over the 
years than practically any other individual in this city or 
country kaufman said in the last five years alone they have 
paid more than 250 million in taxes 
us attorney rudolph giuliani and state attorney general robert 
abrams mounted a joint investigation into the helmsleys taxes 18 
months ago 
there were indications of legal action against the helmsleys on 
monday when they obtained a show cause order and filed a writ of 
prohibition against abrams in state supreme court 
the papers were sealed by the judge so it was not known what 
the helmsleys sought a writ of prohibition can bar public 
officials from actions ordinarily in their power such as an 
indictment or grand jury appearance 
mrs helmsley who is featured in ads as the queen of a 
string of hotels owned by her and her husband turned down a deal 
from prosecutors who said they would not seek the indictment of 
her husband if she pleaded guilty to fraud a law enforcement 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press

pearson plc a british conglomerate that publishes 
the financial times said wednesday it has modified the terms of 
its offer for the paris financial daily newspaper les echos 
pearson which also has interests in banking fine china and 
oil modified the 88 million pound or 165 million offer in an 
effort to overcome apparent french government objections to the 
takeover 
under the new offer les echoso will continue to have a 
substantial frenchcontrolled minority shareholding for another 
year 
in addition the new offer includes pledges that certain 
minority stakes in pearson will remain under french control 
the french government said in february the les echos takeover 
would require its approval potentially a lengthy process despite 
pearsons status as a european community company 
london analysts said the purchase of a newspaper by a nonfrench 
company was a sensitive issue before the french presidential 
elections 
pearson now hopes the french government will approve the 
purchase before the april 24 elections said a pearson spokesman 
who was not identified in accordance with british practice 
the french government never spelled out its precise reasons for 
opposing the deal but pearson said it was apparently concerned 
about publisher rupert murdochs 204 percent stake in pearson if 
murdoch were to succeed in a takeover bid for pearson control of 
les echos would pass outside the ec 
the new proposals call for pearson to acquire twothirds of the 
equity of les echos sa immediately and the remaining onethird a 
year later provided that pearson is still an ec company 
the original accord with les echos called for an outright 
purchase of all the companys stock in exchange for the pearson 
shares and cash the final purchase price remains the same but 
will now be made in two installents 
the original purchase accord also involved the transfer of 74 
million pearson shares or 36 percent to jacqueline beytout who 
owns les echos plus 355 million french francs the equivalent of 
63 million in cash 
under the new proposals ms beytout has guaranteed to give the 
french bank lazard freres and cie the right of first refusal if 
she decides to sell her pearson shares 
lazard freres which has a separate 94 percent stake in pearson 
via its subsidiary financiere and industrielle gaz and eaux sa has 
pledged it also will remain a longterm holder of its pearson 
shares 
the pledges are designed as a conciliatory move to reassure the 
french government that the beytout and lazard stake in pearson will 
not be sold to murdoch the pearson spokesman said

three utility districts have reached a 20 
million settlement with bondholders who were left holding 225 
billion in debt after the washington public power supply system 
defaulted on bonds for two abandoned nuclear power plants 
the settlement was announced thursday by junius hoffman a 
courtappointed special master overseeing negotiations to settle a 
huge lawsuit in the case the securitiesfraud suit is tentatively 
set to go to trial in september in tucson ariz 
the settlement still subject to final drafting as well as 
formal approval by the court and utility district officials 
involves the douglas chelan and grant counties public utility 
districts hoffman said 
it comes two days after the city of seattle announced it had 
settled its part in the lawsuit for 50 million city attorneys 
said that was much less expensive than fighting the case and taking 
the risk of being held responsible for all or part of the potential 
225 billion judgment 
the latest settlement worked out by attorneys for the utility 
districts and for chemical bank which represents the bondholders 
interests brings the total of all settlements to 176 million the 
litigation continues against remaining defendants who include the 
supply system utilities that sponsored the plants and others 
hoffman noted 
the bond default was the largest in the history of the municipal 
bond market the power system abandoned the two plants six years 
ago following cost overruns and studies indicating the power from 
the plants wasnt needed 
the two abandoned plants at the hanford nuclear reservation in 
southcentral washington and at satsop west of olympia were among 
five nuclear power plants wppss attempted to build during the 
1970s one is currently operating at hanford 
the remaining two also at hanford and satsop were mothballed 
when partially complete because of financing problems and doubts 
about the need for the power they would produce

us commerce secretary c william verity on 
thursday voiced opposition to suggestions that the soviet union 
should be allowed to join an international trade organization 
but verity said the us governments opposition to soviet 
participation in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
could change as the soviet union moves toward a marketoriented 
economy some american businessmen supported admitting the soviets 
to the group 
verity spoke at a news conference after signing a protocol 
endorsing joint sovietamerican business ventures 
in september 1986 the united states led the opposition to a 
soviet effort to join gatt a 95nation group that sets 
international trading rules 
it would be inappropriate perhaps impossible to make any 
progress if the soviet union was a member of gatt verity said 
but he added that in time as the soviet union moves towards a 
market economy that would be different 
verity said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring program is designed to move 
the soviet economy toward a market economy and that is important 
to the soviet side and to all other nations of the world who would 
like to see movement in that direction 
veritys trip to moscow comes in advance of president reagans 
fiveday visit to the soviet capital scheduled to begin may 29 
trade frequently comes up during summit talks with gorbachev who 
wants access to american technology and services to help improve 
his countrys ailing economy 
verity and alexander i kachanov soviet first deputy minister 
of foreign economic relations signed a protocol adding joint 
ventures to the types of cooperation encouraged by a 1974 trade 
agreement 
veritys three days of talks with kachanov coincided with a 
moscow meeting of the usussr trade and economic council 
which attracted more than 400 american businessmen seven major 
us companies said wednesday they formed a consortium to work out 
business deals with the soviets 
another company honeywell inc announced a joint venture on 
monday to supply automated production controls for soviet 
fertilizer factories 
verity said he stressed to soviet officials that improvements in 
trade depended on soviet easing of emigration restrictions 
he said the soviets had agreed to marketing glasnost using 
the russian word for openness that characterizes gorbachevs drive 
for freer expression

koppers co thursday accused british investor 
brian beazer of defying a federal judge by placing a newspaper ad 
promoting his 17 billion hostile takeover attempt 
you our fellow shareholders ought to ask how long must we 
wait for koppers management to accept the 60pershare 
tender offer the ad said 
in papers filed with us district court in pittsburgh koppers 
said the ad violates us district judge maurice cohills april 6 
temporary restraining order the order bars the beazer group from 
taking any actions to advance the takeover 
koppers said the ad also misrepresented beazers financial 
backing and misrepresented court testimony by company chairman 
charles r pullin and board member charles barber 
beazer spokeswoman lissa perlman in new york said that while the 
beazer group had not seen the complaint to the extent that it 
criticizes our ad we believe it is entirely frivolous and without 
merit 
koppers resistance to the hostile offer launched march 3 at 
45 per share and raised twice since has deteriorated into one 
of historys sorriest examples of management selfentrenchment 
said the fullpage ad in wednesdays wall street journal 
the tender offer comes from bns inc a takeover company formed 
by the british industrialists company beazer plc along with 
shearson lehman hutton inc of new york and national westminster

usg corp appears to be taking desert partners 
takeover attempt more seriously since the texasbased partnership 
increased its cash offer this week from 903 million to 163 
billion an analyst said thursday 
usg says it is now considering a number of options for remaining 
independent possibly indicating a change in its attitude toward 
desert partners said paul kleinaitis an analyst for the 
chicagobased investment research firm duff amp phelps inc 
he said usg had been resisting desert partners with a 
nocomment noaction letsseewhattheycomeupwith sort of 
approach 
but maybe desert partners at this level is starting to look a 
little threatening to them kleinaitis said given desert 
partners persistence in this deal youd think usg would have to 
do something 
desert partners controlled by oilmen jack brown and cyril 
wagner jr of midland texas has maintained since it announced its 
initial offer in february that it is truly interested in acquiring 
the chicagobased buildingproducts producer 
but skeptical analysts have speculated that brown and wagners 
real intent was either to boost the value of usgs stock so they 
could sell their 98percent stake in the company at a good profit 
or to bully usgs management into paying them off to drop the 
takeover bid 
on monday desert partners said it would pay 42 cash per share 
for up to 39 million shares of usgs outstanding stock previously 
desert partners had been seeking to buy only 215 million shares at 
42 a share 
if desert partners were to obtain all the shares it is now 
seeking it would own 85 percent of usg usg has urged its 
stockholders not to tender their shares to desert partners which 
said about 126 million shares had been tendered as of last friday 
usgs board met monday to discuss desert partners latest move 
then filed a statement with the securities and exchange commission 
saying it was exploring options to remain independent 
the options mentioned in the filing included selling part of usg 
to a third party for cash or assets recapitalizing the company or 
repurchasing its own stock 
any of those actions would make it difficult for desert partners 
to obtain the shares it is seeking 
frederic spar a spokesman for desert partners said thusday 
that the offer for more shares should leave no doubt about the 
texas groups intentions 
there should be no doubt that desert partners has been 
interested in acquiring usg for quite some time he said that 
commitment is underscored by the fact that they have now put up a 
substantial amount of money in commmitment fees for the financing 
and expenses related to the tender offer

the senate today approved a 11 trillion 
federal budget for fiscal 1989 after earlier deciding not to shift 
50 million in spending from energy research to health care 
programs 
the spending plan was passed on a 6926 vote the senate and the 
house which passed its version of the budget earlier must now 
agree on a compromise measure 
senators earlier had voted 5738 against a proposal that would 
have transferred 50 million away from the superconducting super 
collider a physics research program planned by the government and 
expected to cost about 44 billion ultimately there still would 
have been 40 million in spending left next year for the massive 
project 
the amendment would have used the money instead for childhood 
immunizations community health centers and to train nurses and 
other health care workers to take care of the elderly 
it speaks to kids old folks poor people sen lowell 
weicker rconn the amendments author said of it their lives 
today are as important as our other knowledge in the future 
but opponents who spoke most from the seven states competing 
for the super collider argued that the projects scientific and 
economic benefits were too great to jeopardize 
we can protect the health of our citizens without jeopardizing 
the economic health of our nation said sen james sasser 
dtenn whose state is seeking the project 
senate passage put congress on track to completing its budget 
work unusually early in the year largely because the summit 
agreement between president reagan and congressional leaders solved 
most of the normally testy problems 
but one of the questions the summit allegedly tamed how much 
money the government will spend on domestic programs reared its 
head wednesday 
that occurred when the lawmakers voted 930 to add 14 billion 
for drug programs such as law enforcement and prison construction 
a measure legislators found difficult to oppose in an election year 
the budget originally allowed 1481 billion in domestic 
spending the cap set in the summit pact 
to get around that the amendments supporters said the drug 
spending would only occur if it could be paid for by better 
collection of taxes and debts owed the government and they noted 
that the summit accord provided for additional spending in cases of 
a dire emergency 
asked if he believed the white house would accept the extra 
spending sen alfonse damato rny who wrote the provision 
with sen dennis deconcini dariz said theyre damned fools 
if they dont recognize its a dire emergency 
the senate had earlier approved another antidrug measure by a 
7618 vote adding 125 million for federal prisons and agents the 
language sponsored by sen arlen specter rpa provided the 
money by reducing federal travel spending 
the lawmakers began considering amendments after untangling 
themselves from arguments that began monday when they began 
debating the budget over the spending plans 136 billion deficit 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the budget committee 
argued that the real size of the deficit was cloaked because the 
huge surpluses of the social security system are included in the 
fiscal calculations 
soon lawmakers began trying to remove other special funds 
covering money set aside for transportation banking and other 
programs from the deficit computations 
eventually an amendment sponsored by sen pete v domenici of 
new mexico ranking republican on the budget panel was approved 
that handed the problem to the national economic commission which 
will suggest answers to budget problems next year 
other than the new domestic spending the budget follows the 
summit pacts strictures it contains no new taxes since 14 
billion in new levies called for by the summit have already been 
enacted 
it also allows 294 billion for military spending and 161 
billion for international assistance 
the major differences between the senate budget and the spending 
plan reagan proposed in february are in domestic spending the 
senate would spend more on energy agriculture housing and 
community development than the president and less on natural 
resources law enforcement and income security 
like the president the senate would give vast boosts to 
spending for space and science education and aviation safety 
the proposals computed deficit of 136 billion meets precisely 
the deficit target set in the grammrudman balanced budget law for 
fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 the law is designed to eliminate 
the governments red ink by 1993 
the house approved its version of the budget last month the two 
chambers must approve identical spending blueprints but the 
presidents signature is not required 
the budget is not binding it is used as a guide by congress as 
it passes legislation that actually provides money for federal 
programs

continue to seek proxies in support of a nonbinding resolution 
asking that farmers group inc negotiate with batus over a takeover

increase in price in a friendly transaction supported by the 
farmers board 
the resolution recommends that the farmers board reconsider its 
decision not to negotiate with batus over the sale the statement 
ordered rephrased said a vote in favor of the resolution would 
indicate shareholder support for the sale of farmers to batus 
mckibben said the statement needed to be clarified in order to 
conform to the literal wording of the resolution 
batus the louisvillebased subisdiary of britains bat 
industries has said it was willing to raise its 63pershare bid 
but refused on wednesday to meet farmers ground rules for 
negotiations 
farmers the nations thirdlargest home and auto insurer and 
seventhlargest property and casualty insurer insisted it would 
not sit down unless batus agreed to keep certain information 
confidential farmers also asked batus to reveal how much it was 
willing to pay for the company 
batus whose us businesses include kool and viceroy cigarettes 
and retailers such as saks fifth avenue responded by proposing 
alternate confidentiality provisions 
farmers which is based in los angeles has about 11 billion in 
assets 
batus earned 886 million on revenue of 58 billion in 1987

rates shot higher today after an unexpected bulge in the trade 
deficit sent shock waves through the financial markets 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average dropped about 
101 points while in the currency markets the value of the dollar 
fell 2 percent against major currencies interest rates on a key 
longterm us treasury bond jumped to a threemonth high 
traders scrambled to sell dollars bonds and stocks after the 
commerce department reported this morning that the nations trade 
deficit had risen to 138 billion in february that was the 
biggest shortfall since the record of 176 billion in october and 
the second monthly increase in a row many economists had been 
expecting the deficit to narrow 
the dow jones industrials tumbled 35 points within 20 minutes of 
the opening bell on the new york stock exchange then stabilized for 
a few hours but the slide resumed in the afternoon and the average 
skidded to a 10146point loss at 200563 a 48 percent drop 
according to a prelimary calculation 
it was the worst decline since the dow plunged 14058 points on 
jan 8 
the dows decline triggered a ban on the use of a form of 
computerized program trading on the new york stock exchange the 
first time the collar has been triggered by a decline of 50 
points or more in the dow 
prices also fell on the london stock exchange where the 
financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 13 percent 
dropping 232 points to 17872 
currency brokers reported the federal reserve and other central 
banks concerned about a rout in the dollar swooped into foreign 
exchange markets to buy dollars with japanese yen british pounds 
and west german marks to try to stabilize the currencys value 
the dollar was down about 19 percent against the british pound 
about 19 percent against the west german mark and about 22 
percent against the japanese yen at midafternoon

about 1250 for every 1000 in face amount and its yield which 
moves inversely to price surged to 8855 percent the highest in 
three months 
the bulge in the trade deficit suggested americas trade 
problems remain more stubborn than earlier believed leading some 
traders to believe that the dollar needs to fall further to make

economics noted that the february deficit was smaller than the 
deficit of 144 billion in february 1987 indicating that trade 
flows are improving

ranged across the board from the bank of italy to the central bank 
of australia said marc chandler a currency analyst in chicago for 
dean witter reynolds inc

little effect on the currency market chandler said because it

the banks intervention

fell again before closing near its lows for the day

keep the dollar stable martin said that agreement contributed to 
the dollars slide 
the dollar rates on dec 22 were substantially lower than 
they are now martin said suggesting that the currency markets 
interpreted the ministers agreement as supporting the dollar at 
lower levels 
martin predicted traders would test the dollar at its lower 
levels to see if the central banks will again step in to support 
the us currency 
if the dollar does not resume its fall friday it will come 
back somewhat sapiro said however he did not expect any 
dramatic improvement

italian financier carlo de benedetti 
failed thursday to win shareholder support in his takeover battle 
for the massive holding company societe generale de belgique sa 
more than 12 hours after a special meeting began in a tent next 
to the companys headquarters a final count showed de benedetti 
and his allies were unable to gain three seats on the companys 
board of directors 
the longawaited tally further delayed by computer problems 
showed the de benedetti faction garnered only about 445 percent of 
the votes in a special election short of the 51 percent necessary 
to win seats 
but a slate of 12 candidates endorsed by societe generale did 
win a majority further bolstering the companys ability to remain 
a belgian enterprise 
more than 1150 shareholders who control 75 percent of belgiums 
largest holding company attended the meeting which began under 
tight security shortly after 10 am local time 
de benedetti who sparked the heated takeover battle for societe 
generale three months ago topped a list of 15 candidates seeking 
board seats he hoped to be elected along with two allies 
including andre leysen chairman of belgiums gevaert nv 
societe generale nominated the remaining candidates most of 
whom were allied with frances cie financiere de suez and groupe 
ag belgiums largest insurer the two companies have led the fight 
against de benedetti 
societe generales current 11 directors will remain and the 
board will be expanded to include the 12 new members endorsed at 
the meeting there is no maximum number of directors that can serve 
on the companys board 
among the new directors are six members of the suez group and 
groupe ag chairman maurice lippens 
the vote also was expected to serve as an indication of how many 
shares each faction controls under belgian law shareholders are 
not required to disclose the amount of their holdings leaving only 
speculation as to which group is in the majority 
de benedetti who spent some 17 billion to increase his 
societe generale holdings claims he and his allies control 48 
percent of the company 
but suez and groupe ag have said they hold 507 percent after 
spending about 850 million to beef up their stake 
yet even with a minority interest de benedetti can hamper the 
decisionmaking process 
without me no stable management of societe generale is 
possible he asserted at the meeting which he requested 
an eleventhhour attempt to reach an accord between the rival 
factions failed wednesday night 
lippens of groupe ag indicated de benedetti refused an offer to 
have a significant voice in a new management group we deeply 
regret an important shareholder has refused to take a place at the 
tablehe said 
rather than be a team player de benedetti wants to run societe 
generales daytoday operations and vowed to continue to seek 
control of the giant company 
todays votes will not be for the long term he said in 
one week one month six months or one year we will play a major 
role in societe generale 
some officials at thursdays special meeting concurred saying 
they expect de benedetti will win a board seat in the future 
de benedettiwho heads italys olivetti spa wants to turn 
societe generale into a paneuropean holding company before 1992 
when the european economic community is scheduled to remove 
regulatory curbs that hamper the free movement of goods and 
services he said he launched his bid to anticipate a 
borderless europe 
both de benedetti and his rivals seek to restructure societe 
generale which has interests in mining engineering 
manufacturing chemicals banking financial services and other 
areas 
de benedetti is fighting a legal battle over societe generales 
issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to dilute his 
stake the action was taken on jan 18 the same day de benedetti 
launched his hostile bid

one week before planned floor debate on 
sweeping trade legislation lawmakers remain deeply split over 
whether to require public disclosure of foreign investment in the 
united states 
i think americans should be allowed to know who is investing 
in this country house speaker jim wright dtexas told 
reporters wednesday i dont see any justification for secrecy 
but wright hinted that within the week leaders might yield to 
the reagan administration and other critics and bar the provision 
sponsored by rep john bryant dtexas from the 1000page trade 
bill 
actually the bryant amendment is not even part of the bill a 
panel attempting to draft a compromise between rival house and 
senate versions of the trade measure was unable to reach agreement 
on foreign investment disclosure and simply left the issue hanging 
the provisions in bryants amendment are complex 
they would require foreigners and overseasbased companies to 
register with the commerce department if they owned 5 percent or 
more of an american company or real estate in the united states if 
assets of the property were worth at least 5 million 
such an investor would be required to disclose his name 
address nationality principal business share in the us 
investment date that it was acquired the purchase price location 
of the property its name and the primary business in which it was 
involved 
some of this information already must be filed with the commerce 
department but is not publicly available it would be under 
bryants plan 
companies with a 25 percent share in a us business or property 
with assets or annual sales of more than 20 million would have to 
disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations 
by the securities and exchange commission on its 10k form the 
items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial 
balance sheet 
as soon as bryant introduced the measure it caused an uproar 
it flies in the face of business secrecy customs strictly observed 
for centuries throughout much of the world indeed business 
disclosure laws are carefully drawn and limited within the united 
states 
critics of the amendment say it would immediately cut off the 
flow of capital to the united states from overseas and cause 
economic disaster 
if we impede that flow we will be slitting our own economic 
throats declared rep norman lent rny who has fought the 
amendment repeatedly as a member of the house energy and commerce 
committee 
one of the first victims would be such financial markets as the 
new york stock exchange and the chicago board of trade where 
foreigners are regular investors lent said 
buying in london toyko and other markets will flourish at the 
expense of new york and chicago and our markets which are envied 
throughout the world will be impaired he argued he scoffed at 
the notion that foreign investment constitutes a danger and thus 
should be publicly spotlighted 
if you wake up in the morning and say that foreign investment 
is evil is dangerous that is a kind of naive xenophobic view 
lent said 
british ambassador antony acland said in a march 15 letter to 
lent that the bryant amendment would affect some british companies 
that invest in the united states and put them at a real 
commercial disadvantage 
it would discourage new investment from britain acland said 
in the letter which lent inserted in the march 29 congressional 
record 
bryant waves such objections aside citing figures suggesting 
that foreign investment in farmland factories banks businesses 
buildings government securities and elsewhere within the us 
economy has shot up over the last seven years 
foreign money has been financing a record borrowing binge 
while disguising the fact that we are living dangerously beyond our 
means bryant said 
floating on a feather bed of foreign financing the united 
states has fallen from its status as the worlds largest creditor 
nation in 1982 to become the largest debtor nation in history with 
a foreign debt exceeding those of mexico argentina and brazil 
combined he added 
the administration sent out strong signals over the last few 
months that president reagan would veto the trade bill if it 
contained bryants plan 
that threat supplied powerful ammunition to the measures 
critics on capitol hill 
the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee rep 
john dingell dmich sought to break the deadlock at one point 
with a modification under which the need for disclosure would be 
studied and existing commerce department information would be shown 
to lawmakers on a confidential basis 
administration officials however sent back word that this 
proposal also would be likely to provoke a veto and the idea was 
dropped 
not much information about foreign ownership of us property 
exists in the public domain however studies have shown that 
citizens of other countries held title to less than one percent of 
us farmland 
but the sheer volume of ownership is not the sole issue bryant 
contends he said it is important that americans know exactly who 
owns what 
because of the lack of adequate reporting requirements he 
said we cannot determine whether new foreign owners of us 
assets are legitimate businesses hostile nations like libya iran 
or the soviet union corrupt third world dictators like the 
philippines ferdinand marcos or organized drug traffickers 
laundering their illgotten gains

the monthly us trade deficit widened by more 
than 11 percent in february to 138 billion the government said 
thursday sending both stock prices and the dollar on a nosedive 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks plummeted 101 
points or by about 5 percent and the value of the dollar against 
the japanese yen and the german mark dropped about 2 percent on the 
foreign exchange markets 
only concerted intervention by the federal reserve bank and 
central banks in europe in buying up large volumes of dollars with 
yen marks and british pounds prevented the dollar from falling 
further 
triggering the turmoil was the commerce departments report that 
the gap between the nations imports and exports expanded by 14 
billion from januarys imbalance of 124 billion 
it was the second straight monthly jump in the trade imbalance 
that had declined in november and december from a record 176 
billion defict last october 
weve stumbled here a little bit said jay goldinger an 
analyst for capital insight an economic consulting firm based in 
los angeles it reminds us that we have a major major problem 
analysts had largely predicted beforehand that the february 
deficit would shrink slightly the normal seasonal pattern for this 
time of year 
for the second time in only seven years there was huge 
atypical increase in imports in february showing that americans 
have not lost their appetite for foreign goods said allen sinai 
an economist for the boston co of new york 
it means we have not solved the budget and trade deficit 
problems sinai said and if policymakers and consumers dont 
tighten their belts the markets will showing up in a tumbling 
dollar spikes in interest rates and ultimately in a recession 
although not likely this year 
imports of foreign manufactured goods oil and farm products 
increased by 26 billion in february to 374 billion leading the 
surge were imports of electrical equipment from abroad up 323 
million and auto and truck parts up 298 million 
american exports also rose but by a smaller 12 billion from 
january to 236 billion 
for the first two months of 1988 the deficit is running at an 
annual rate of 1576 billion below the record 1712 billion for 
all of last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of 
1562 billion in 1986 the commerce department said 
the nations trade problems are severe and far from over 
said rudy oswald the aflcios chief economist while exports 
are up by 10 billion from a year ago so are imports leaving 
america no further along the path towards reducing the 
jobsdestroying deficit 
reagan administration officials downplayed the february numbers 
instead focusing on longer trends that show a grudgingly slow 
improvement since last summer the trade deficit over the last 
three months has averaged 128 billion compared with a monthly 
average of 15 billion the previous three months 
monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic said 
treasury secretary james a baker the figures seen this morning 
should be seen in context 
with both exports and imports higher than they were in january 
vice president george bush said there is no reason for alarm 
so the market goes down a little bit he said the same 
thing happened last fall and theres a great frenzy for no reason 
i certainly dont see it as a reason to pass protectionist 
legislation which is the undercurrent of the oppositions 
program 
us oil imports jumped 12 million barrels a day in february to 
81 million the highest they have been since september 1986 as a 
result the trade deficit with members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries shot up by 270 million over january 
to 13 billion 
the deficit with japan the country with the largest trade 
surplus with the united states also increased dramatically by 
500 million to more than 45 billion 
but it narrowed slightly with the socalled newly industrialized 
countries singapore hong kong taiwan and south korea falling 
by about 20 million to 29 billion 
imports of manufactured goods from abroad increased by 23 
billion in february and were 18 billion higher than the monthly 
average of 271 billion in 1987 
the united states is not building its capital stock 
sufficiently to meet domestic demand said jerry jasinowski 
chief economist for the national association of manufacturers 
the foreign sourcing during the period of the high dollar 
continues to represent a source of troubling import dependency 
but us manufacturers also fared better in february raising 
their exports by 12 billion to 161 billion the third highest 
month on record after november and december of last year 
despite the increase in auto and truck parts shipped here from 
abroad exports of japanese autos themselves to the united states 
declined by more than 120 million to 15 billion in february 
auto imports from other countries however rose by nearly 390 
million 
agricultural exports chiefly big increases in animal feeds 
cotton and soybeans rose by 280 million over january to 32 
billion the highest they have been since 1984

gillette co filed suit thursday in us district 
court seeking to block a hostile takeover bid by a new yorkbased 
partnership on the grounds the company withheld or falsified 
reports about its financial backing 
the suit seeks a temporary injunction to prevent coniston group 
or its subsidiaries from acquiring additional gillette stock or 
taking action to oust four gillette directors at an april 21 annual 
meeting 
gillette claims coniston violated federal laws by issuing 
material to gillette shareholders which failed to properly cite all 
partners and investors affiliated with the takeover attempt 
a gillette statement reports the suit stems from conistons 
april 11 admendment to an sec filing which confirms for the first 
time that hidden partners and participants in the coniston effort 
against gillette include a complicated web or foreign and domestic 
corporations and partnerships 
the suit names coniston principals augustus k oliver paul e 
tierney jr and keith r gollust as defendants also named in the 
suit are swiss financier tito tettamanti oakley sutton management 
inc principals james sutton regan and edward oakley thorp and 
michael f price president of heine securities corp 
gillette alleges heine and two oakley subsidiaries purchased 
gillette stock as part of conistons takeover attempt neither firm 
was noted as part of conistons holdings in the april 11 filing 
gillette alleges 
new yorkbased heine had acquired 235 million gillette shares 
as of feb 25 according to the suit the oakley subsidiaries 
witherspoon associates of new jersey and princetonnewport partners 
lp of delaware own about 300000 gillette shares 
two coniston limited partnership subsidiaries rb associates of 
new jersey and bahamasbased rb partners seek to solicit a 
majority of gillettes 27000 shareholders to elect the three 
coniston principals and david strassler to the gillette board of 
directors at the annual meeting shareholders can vote in person or 
by proxy ballot 
strassler is also named as a defendant in the suit 
the two coniston partnerships have accumulated 676 million 
gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys shares 
outstanding 
gillette also seeks to have the shareholder proxy ballots not 
certified until the suit is settled 
oliver vowed coniston will fight the suit 
the lawsuit is totally without merit said oliver its 
clearly a lastditch effort to win in the courts what they 
apparently are not winning among stockholders we intend to contest 
it 
gillette said the suit should not postpone the annual meeting in 
andover 
in several letters sent to shareholders since march gillette 
chairman and chief executive officer colman mockler jr claims 
coniston plans to sell or dismember the bostonbased company 
gillette stock fell 337 to close at 41 thursday in new york

a restriction on computerized stock trading that 
went into effect when the dow jones industrial average tumbled more 
than 50 points thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually 
may have worsened it brokers said 
the widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped 
10146 to 200563 its largest loss since falling 14058 on jan 8 
it marked the second time the socalled collar on 
indexarbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction 
was announced in february as part of an effort to restore stability 
to a market still suffering aftereffects of the october market 
disaster 
it also was the first time the collar was triggered by a 
downward move in the dow average the collar was triggered for the 
first time ever on april 6 when the average rose 6416 points 
under the collar rule traders are banned from using the new 
york stock exchanges automated order system to execute 
indexarbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the dow 
average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close 
the big board said the collar went into effect at about 155 
pm thursday when the average tumbled below the 50point limit 
battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the us 
trade deficit fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar 
although computerized program trading was halted brokers who 
utilize the strategy began using an oldfashioned manual method for 
selling stocks and the dow average kept falling 
i guess theres really a lot of selling thats built up 
said peter dapuzzo manager of retail equities at shearson lehman 
hutton inc you cant ignore the fact that theres heavy selling 
and profittaking going on right now the selling is more chaotic 
because people want out at the same time 
others said the collar may have worsened the dow averages drop 
because after the 50point threshhold was reached only sellers 
remained in the market 
once this thing goes below 50 nobody shows up to do any 
buying said joseph barthel a technical strategist at butcher amp 
singer inc 
in index arbitrage program trading brokers use computers to buy 
massive amounts of stocks in new york and the equivalent 
stockindex futures in chicago or vice versa in order to profit 
from price disparities 
the technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock 
crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring 
volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of 
investors into selling

travelers didnt rush to cancel flights on 
eastern or continental airlines thursday in response to an 
unprecedented federal investigation but travel industry people 
predicted business at both lines will suffer 
in easterns home base of miami an employee of barry white 
travel agent inc said no one had made travel changes through the 
agency 
we havent had anybody cancel eastern is very strong in 
miami the majority of people take eastern said the agent who 
did not give her name 
no changes were made through dulaney travel agency in dallas 
either agent crystal lennon said 
eastern spokesman karen ceremsak said the airline had not seen 
any drop in bookings 
but isabel chalen owner of four corners travel agency in miami 
beach fla said she foresaw problems for the airline from the 
governments probe into the finances and safety of texas air corp 
parent of eastern and continental 
some of my customers already dont want to fly on eastern 
anymore she said i am pretty sure that it is not going to get 
any better 
indeed patti engle a traveler waiting to board an eastern 
flight in fort lauderdale fla said it concerns me a lot i 
wish i knew this before it was 20 minutes before my flight 
and in atlanta marissa barker of golden jet travel said she had 
several customers change future eastern flights to delta air lines 
because theyre just really concerned that eastern wont be 
around 
i even changed my flight from eastern to delta this morning 
she said im concerned that maybe they arent safe ive heard 
so many bad things about eastern 
the department of transportation announced wednesday it would 
investigate whether texas air and its management were fit 
willing and able to carry commercial air traffic 
the government has investigated small airlines and has revoked 
the operating licenses of some minor carriers but analysts said 
this was the first inquiry involving major us airlines 
texas airs airlines together account for 20 percent of all us 
air traffic continental is the countrys fourth largest airline 
while eastern is the sixth largest 
financial analysts predicted that the federal inquiry added to 
the companys financial and labor headaches could drive more 
passengers away 
that announcement alone is a potential problem to an airline 
or airline system that can ill afford the publicity given its 
already well publicized problems from labor issues to safety to 
continentals service record said anthony hatch of argus 
reserach corp 
theyre not getting enough people on the planes because they 
have such a bad reputation whether its deserved or not add this 
issue and its hard to quantify the effect on peoples decisions 
god knows what will happen if the government does indeed find they 
are unfit he said 
houstonbased texas air had record losses of 466 million last 
year and has an overall debt of around 54 billion 
louis marckesano of janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
said recent disputes between texas air chairman frank lorenzo and 
the unions had contributed to a loss of confidence in eastern and 
he predicted the investigation would do further damage 
in a separate action on wednesday the federal aviation 
administration announced a civil penalty of 823000 against 
miamibased eastern because of recurring trends in connection 
with violations of safety regulations 
the fine was imposed just over a year after eastern agreed to 
pay a 95 million penalty in connection with other safety 
violations 
the latest fine is based on findings from an investigation in 
september and october but eastern now has an opportunity to 
challenge it if the airline can produce evidence the faa considers 
valid the fine could be reduced 
eastern ran fullpage ads in newspapers thursday including the 
washington post and the new york times saying it welcomed the 
investigation because it will show the airline is operating safely 
and has been unfairly treated by federal authorities 
were confident the outcome will be a very good one eastern 
president phil bakes said 
in addition to eastern and continental texas air also owns 
rocky mountain airways britt airways bar harbour airlines and 
provincetownboston airlines

reported a 35 percent increase in net earnings for the first 
quarter citing continued savings from the summer 1986 merger of 
sperry and burroughs 
net income was 1493 million or 72 cents per fully diluted 
common share for the three months ended march 31 for the same 
period a year ago unisys net income was 1102 million or 57 
cents per fully diluted common share adjusted for a july 1987 
threeforone stock split 
revenue fell 21 percent to 237 billion from 242 billion a 
year ago when heavy endoftheyear selling related to the old 
sperry fiscal calendar raised revenues above typical firstquarter 
levels the company reported 
our conservative business plan for 1988 and the cost 
advantages that continue to accrue to us from the merger put us in 
a strong position to achieve our plan in a modest business 
environment said unisys president w michael blumenthal 
unisys created in 1986 from burroughs corps 48 billion 
purchase of sperry corp is the worlds thirdlargest computer 
company after international business machines corp and digital 
equipment corp 
we are pleased with results for the quarter as earnings 
exceeded expectations and our continued progress faster than 
planned augurs well for achieving our aggressive fiveyear growth 
goals blumenthal said 
business in the quarter was basically on target with order 
and revenue trends similar to what we experienced in 1987 when 
international business was generally stronger than in the us 
unisys operations continue to benefit from the fundamental 
structural changes made in 1986 and 1987 he said 
unisys reports its earnings per share on a fully diluted basis 
that is based on the number of shares that would exist if all 
stock options were exercised and all convertible preferred shares 
were converted into common stock earnings per primary common share 
were up to 77 cents from 57 cents a year earlier

two brothers and a son who control the carls 
jr hamburger chain were accused of using inside information to 
benefit their relatives in a 25 million civil lawsuit brought 
thursday by federal regulators 
sixteen people all but one of them members the family that 
lends its name to carl karcher enterprises were named in the 
insidertrading complaint filed thursday in us district court by 
the securities and exchange commission 
founder carl n karcher who appears in carls jr television 
commercials harking back to his youth on an oldtime family farm 
would be liable for 1 million in damages under the formula used in 
the complaint 
the complaint alleges that in october 1984 the insiders or 
their relatives sold stock and debentures to make profits or avoid 
losses when the price of shares in the publicly held company 
plummeted because of an adverse quarterly report 
we have to show people in these situations you dont tell your 
brother your family your relatives said irving einhorn sec 
regional administrator in announcing the filing 
karcher chairman of the anaheimbased company that has 450 
outlets in the west promised a vigorous defense 
these charges are totally false karcher responded my 
wife and i did not sell any of our stock nor did we tell anyone 
else to do so to suggest that any of us would intentionally 
violate the securities laws is highly offensive 
carl n karcher and his brother donald f karcher president 
and chief operating officer are accused of passing information to 
their wives and children but arent accused of trading in the 
stock 
the 12 other defendants including the founders son carl leo 
karcher a former vice president who now is a franchise holder and 
alvin deshano who still is accounting director are accused in the 
complaint of acting on the information the rest of the defendants 
none of them company employees are children of the elder karcher 
brothers and the childrenss spouses 
karcher stock closed at 1550 per share thursday in 
overthecounter trading down 87 cents from wednesdays close 
those named in the complaint made profits or avoided losses 
totaling 310000 einhorn said the complaint seeks an injunction 
ordering them to disgorge profits derived and losses avoided 
it also seeks triple damages from each of those accused of 
profiting against those accused of passing on information but not 
of making trades it seeks damages of triple the amount of any 
profit allegedly made by those they tipped 
that brings the total amount of penalties sought to 25 million 
einhorn attributed the losses to a downturn in profits after 
the olympics which brought hundreds of thousands of visitors to 
the city in the summer of 1984 
he said alleged offenses were uncovered in random computer 
checks conducted by the national association of securities dealers 
einhorn said 
shortly thereafter the company which operates or franchises 
450 outlets in california arizona nevada and oregon launched an 
ambitious effort to expand nationwide that effort was abandoned 
two years later because of losses and the company returned to 
profitability in 1987 
karcher enterprises earned 16 million on sales of 3695 
million in 1987 
the rest of the relatives accused of profiting from the inside 
information are carl n karchers son jerome daughters barbara 
karchergarett margaret j levecke catherine karchereverly and 
her husband daniel and carl n karchers soninlaw donald e 
fergus jr 
also donald f karchers daughter doneta ann thomason and her

the dow jones industrial average plunged more 
than 100 points the dollar sank and interest rates jumped thursday 
after the government announced a 138 billion trade deficit in 
february the biggest since last october 
the dow jones average of 30 stocks skidded 10146 points to 
200563 a 48 percent decline it was the years second worst 
drop after a 14058point slide on jan 8 
the value of us stocks fell 997 billion or 37 percent 
wilshire associates of santa monica calif said 
the white house and most economists said the trade deficit was 
still improving in spite of the setback but the markets took the 
news badly anyway 
most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between 
imports and exports would be less than 12 billion and they bailed 
out when the disappointing report hit at 830 am edt 
there was a lot of wishingmakesitso attitude people 
wanted to see a good number said carl b weinberg chief 
economist of high frequency economics he had predicted a 14 
billion gap 
the decline in the dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized 
program trading on the new york stock exchange it was the first 
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points 
last week it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points 
the dow had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 through 
tuesday largely on anticipation of favorable trade news the news 
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 
nearly 11 to 1 on the nyse 
the trade deficit report also battered london markets where the 
financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 13 percent 
the dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the 
japanese yen british pound and west german mark in spite of heavy 
intervention by virtually all the major central banks 
big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving 
trading partners an oversupply of the us currency 
the selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to 
support the currency that was reaffirmed wednesday in washington by 
finance officials of the united states japan britain france 
west germany canada and italy 
the group of seven nations failed to freeze the dollar but they 
did let the market know theyre there said marc chandler a 
currency analyst at dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market the 
trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong 
domestic economy was sucking in too many imports traders also 
feared a weak dollar could push up import prices causing inflation 
and hurting fixedincome securities 
the treasury departments benchmark 30year treasury bond 
recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking but 
still finished with a decline of roughly 11 for every 1000 in 
face value its yield which moves inversely to the price rose to 
roughly 887 percent a threemonth high 
the bond markets dismal performance was surprising because 
inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets said 
raymond worseck an economist at ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis 
the trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of 176 
billion in october it was up from januarys 124 billion gap but 
weinberg noted it was down from a deficit of 144 billion the 
previous february 
its just one of those glitches that keep the financial 
markets interesting the trend is still for improvement in the 
trade deficit said james solloway director of economic research 
at argus research corp in st louis 
solloway said traders had become the victims of expecting too 
much and then not getting it 
we just cant too far ahead of ourselves we all would like to 
see faster improvement but it may be expecting too much he said 
for the first two months of 1988 the deficit is running at an 
annual rate of 1576 billion below the record 1712 billion of 
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of 1562 
billion in 1986 the commerce department said 
exports rose to 236 billion up 55 percent from 223 billion 
in january and up 22 percent from 194 billion in february 1987 
imports rose to 374 billion up 75 percent from 348 billion 
in january and up 109 percent from 337 billion in february 1987 
the deficit with japan the country with the largest trade 
surplus with the united states also increased dramatically by 
500 million to more than 45 billion 
but it narrowed slightly with the socalled newly industrialized 
countries singapore hong kong taiwan and south korea falling 
by about 20 million to 29 billion 
commerce secretary c william verity who is in moscow said in 
a statement released by his office that the february figures were 
disappointing despite what he called an underlying favorable 
trend 
the figures show a substantial improvement from the average 
15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987 
verity said we look forward to continued exportled growth 
in another report thursday the commerce department said 
business inventories grew 01 percent in february a small rise 
after four big monthly increases a healthy rise in sales kept 
inventories from rising 
economists had feared the inventory buildup would force 
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988 but the 
inventory numbers along with the trade report showing a big 
increase in imports provide evidence that domestic demand has not 
weakened

a restriction on computerized stock trading that 
went into effect when the dow jones industrial average tumbled more 
than 50 points thursday stemmed the slide only briefly and actually 
may have worsened it brokers said 
the widely followed barometer of 30 blue chip stocks dropped 
10146 to 200564 its largest loss since falling 14058 on jan 8 
it marked the second time the socalled collar on 
indexarbitrage program trading was triggered since the restriction 
was announced in february as part of an effort to restore stability 
to a market still suffering aftereffects of the october market 
disaster 
it also was the first time the collar was triggered by a 
downward move in the dow average the collar was triggered for the 
first time ever on april 6 when the average rose 6416 points 
under the collar rule traders are banned from using the new 
york stock exchanges automated order system to execute 
indexarbitrage program trades for the rest of the day when the dow 
average moves up or down 50 points from the previous close 
the big board said the collar went into effect at about 155 
pm thursday when the average tumbled below the 50point limit 
battered by massive selling over disappointing news on the us 
trade deficit fears of higher interest rates and a weaker dollar 
although computerized program trading was halted brokers who 
utilize the strategy began using an oldfashioned manual method for 
selling stocks and the dow average kept falling 
i guess theres really a lot of selling thats built up 
said peter dapuzzo manager of retail equities at shearson lehman 
hutton inc you cant ignore the fact that theres heavy selling 
and profittaking going on right now the selling is more chaotic 
because people want out at the same time 
others said the collar may have worsened the dow averages drop 
because after the 50point threshhold was reached only sellers 
remained in the market 
once this thing goes below 50 nobody shows up to do any 
buying said joseph barthel a technical strategist at butcher amp 
singer inc 
in index arbitrage program trading brokers use computers to buy 
massive amounts of stocks in new york and the equivalent 
stockindex futures in chicago or vice versa in order to profit 
from price disparities 
the technique has been mentioned in some studies of the stock 
crash as a possible contributor to the volatility and soaring 
volumes that pummeled the market and frightened millions of 
investors into selling

bond prices finished broadly lower thursday 
dropping sharply on news of an unexpected widening in the nations 
trade deficit but recovering some lost ground later in the day as 
stock prices plunged 
longterm yields moved higher but some shortterm interest 
rates fell as investors worried by the steep stock market decline 
sought the relative safety of treasury issues 
the treasurys 30year bond ended the day down a full point or 
10 for every 1000 in face value the issue viewed as a 
bellwether for the credit markets careened 2 points lower shortly 
after the trade report was released 
the 30year bonds yield rose to 886 percent from 873 percent 
late wednesday 
but some shortterm rates fell yields on threemonth treasury 
bills for instance slid to 572 percent from 583 percent late 
wednesday 
bond prices skidded immediately after the commerce department 
reported the nations trade deficit widened to 138 billion in 
february its biggest shortfall since october most analysts 
expected the gap to narrow 
a wider deficit suggests that the dollar may have to fall 
further to reduce the trade gap a falling dollar makes 
dollardenominated securities less attractive to foreign investors 
who have been major buyers of treasury bonds 
the bond market was in a state of shock when the number 
printed said elliott platt research director for the investment 
firm donaldson lufkin jenrette securities inc 
but later in the day bond prices retraced some lost ground as 
stock prices fell platt said as the stock markets decline 
deepened some traders decided to buy bonds where yields were 
becoming more attractive compared with stocks 
the dow jones industrial average wound up down 10146 points 
platt said yields on threemonth treasury bills fell because 
demand surged for the governmentbacked instruments which are 
viewed as secure and can be easily converted into cash the 
phenomenon known as a flight to quality often occurs in times 
of financial uncertainty 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
issues fell point intermediates slipped by between point and 
point and 20year governments dropped 1 points according to the 
financial information service telerate inc 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 046 to 11130 the shearson lehman composite 
index which makes a similar measurement fell 621 to 116282 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer slid 252 to to 27988 
yields on sixmonth treasury bills fell 2 basis points to 602 
percent but oneyear bills rose 4 basis points to 646 percent a 
basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 61116 percent up from 6 percent late 
wednesday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyers municipal bond index 
that measures prices on 40 longterm bonds fell 2532 point to 87 
2932 while its yield rose to 817 percent from 809 percent

thursday leaving the dow jones industrial average with its second 
threedigit loss this year 
dow joness average of 30 blue chips plunged 10146 to 200564

exports 
the dollar dropped sharply in foreign exchange markets on the 
news and us credit markets also took the news badly 
prices of longterm treasury bonds fell more than 10 for each 
1000 in face value putting their yields in the 88589 percent 
range just a few weeks ago government bond yields got as low as 
about 83 percent 
stockmarket analysts said persistent strength in imports in 
particular raised fears that the federal reserve might soon feel 
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to 
support the dollar 
you got a nasty bit of news said larry wachtel at 
prudentialbache securities the market is saying that the 
economy is too strong 
the decline in the dow reached 50 points at midafternoon 
activating for the secondtime the collar set up by the new 
york stock exchange in early february at that point the exchange 
asked its member firms not to use its main computerized trading 
system for program trading 
but prices kept falling analysts noted that the dow had climbed 
nearly 130 points from april 5 through tuesday largely on 
anticipation of favorable trade news this mornings report they

public relations professionals are concerned 
that former white house spokesman larry speakes may have damaged 
the credibility of their business by admitting he concocted quotes 
for president reagan 
you never make up a quote for anybody said howard j 
rubenstein president of a large new yorkbased firm that bears his 
name if one of my account executives did something like this 
id really chew him or her out 
other public relations executives queried by telephone wednesday 
agreed with rubensteins assessment of speakes quote concoctions 
which were disclosed in a book speakes wrote about his tenure at 
the white house 
however none was willing to say speakes should quit his 
position as head of communications at the wall street investment 
giant merrill lynch amp co a few said they expected the entire 
episode to fade quickly from public interest 
some sources speaking on the condition they not be identified 
suggested it was possible speakes could face sanctions by the 
public relations society of america for violation of its code of 
ethics 
article 7 of the code states a member shall not intentionally 
communicate false or misleading information and is obligated to use 
care to avoid communication of false or misleading information 
but speakes did not become a society member until november well 
after his departure from the white house the societys national 
secretary isobel parke said the groups attorneys believed the 
code covers the actions of members only while they are members 
it is written in the present tense it does not refer to 
actions that members may or may not have done before they joined 
she said 
ethicscode violators face penalties ranging from warnings to 
expulsion from the 13000member society 
ms parke would not comment specifically on speakes disclosures 
or speculate on whether his credibility had been damaged but she 
said that if any individual deliberately fabricates quotations it 
will indeed damage his trustworthiness particularly with the 
press 
asked if his disclosures have damaged the public relations 
industry she said it doesnt help of course it doesnt help 
merrill lynch spokesman william clark said there was no change 
in speakes status at the company and clark rejected a suggestion 
that merrill lynchs own credibility may have been hurt 
the events portrayed in the book had nothing to do with 
merrill lynch clark said 
speakes said tuesday that he had told reagan about the quotes 
and the president never objected but reagan said wednesday he was 
not aware until recent days that speakes had attributed statements 
to him he didnt make 
in the 34 years ive represented controversial and prominent 
people ive never taken it upon myself to make up a quote 
rubenstein said i think that goes well beyond reason and creates 
a false impression that public relations people are manipulative 
and cant be trusted 
speakes was criticized by many other public relations 
executives from the biggest international firms to the oneoffice 
operations 
the bottom line is credibility said anthony r katz senior 
vice president of day ogilvy amp mather one of the worlds largest 
public relations concerns the role of the pr person is to 
communicate to advance a persons point of view responsibly 
the presidents cause was not advanced 
vivian manuel president of vm communications inc a small new 
yorkbased public relations agency said i think when you say 
somebody said something they should have said it 
nevertheless a few said they could understand how speakes may 
have likened the concocted quotes to the job of a speechwriter who 
is sensitive to a clients time pressure and intimately familiar 
with how a client thinks 
if he was making up quotes that in effect made up public 
policy id be a lot more concerned said ernest j dirico chief 
operating officer of fleishman and dirico public relations in 
atlanta 
but i think in a lot of cases whether its a business 
executive or public official they employ a pr person to act as 
official spokesperson he said they assume the pr person would 
have the good sense to know where the boundaries are if you step 
over the boundaries you get fired

the dow jones industrial average plunged more 
than 100 points the dollar sank and interest rates jumped thursday 
after the government announced a 138 billion trade deficit in 
february the biggest since last october 
the dow jones average of 30 stocks skidded 10146 points to 
200564 a 48 percent decline it was the years second worst 
drop after a 14058point slide on jan 8 
the value of us stocks fell 997 billion or 37 percent 
wilshire associates of santa monica calif said 
the white house and most economists said the trade deficit was 
still improving in spite of the setback but the markets took the 
news badly anyway 
most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between 
imports and exports would be less than 12 billion and they bailed 
out when the disappointing report hit at 830 am edt 
there was a lot of wishingmakesitso attitude people 
wanted to see a good number said carl b weinberg chief 
economist of high frequency economics he had predicted a 14 
billion gap 
the decline in the dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized 
program trading on the new york stock exchange it was the first 
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points 
last week it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points 
the dow had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 through 
tuesday largely on anticipation of favorable trade news the news 
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 
nearly 11 to 1 on the nyse 
the trade deficit report also battered london markets where the 
financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 13 percent 
the dollar lost roughly 2 percent of its value against the 
japanese yen british pound and west german mark in spite of heavy 
intervention by virtually all the major central banks 
big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving 
trading partners an oversupply of the us currency 
the selling pressure on the dollar challenged an agreement to 
support the currency that was reaffirmed wednesday in washington by 
finance officials of the united states japan britain france 
west germany canada and italy

roughly 887 percent a threemonth high 
the bond markets dismal performance was surprising because 
inflation signs did not crop up in the commodities markets said 
raymond worseck an economist at ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis 
the trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of 176 
billion in october it was up from januarys 124 billion gap but 
weinberg noted it was down from a deficit of 144 billion the 
previous february 
its just one of those glitches that keep the financial 
markets interesting the trend is still for improvement in the 
trade deficit said james solloway director of economic research 
at argus research corp in st louis 
solloway said traders had become the victims of expecting too 
much and then not getting it 
we just cant too far ahead of ourselves we all would like to 
see faster improvement but it may be expecting too much he said 
for the first two months of 1988 the deficit is running at an 
annual rate of 1576 billion below the record 1712 billion of 
last year but still worse than second highest imbalance of 1562 
billion in 1986 the commerce department said 
exports rose to 236 billion up 55 percent from 223 billion 
in january and up 22 percent from 194 billion in february 1987 
imports rose to 374 billion up 75 percent from 348 billion 
in january and up 109 percent from 337 billion in february 1987 
the deficit with japan the country with the largest trade 
surplus with the united states also increased dramatically by 
500 million to more than 45 billion 
but it narrowed slightly with the socalled newly industrialized 
countries singapore hong kong taiwan and south korea falling 
by about 20 million to 29 billion 
commerce secretary c william verity who is in moscow said in 
a statement released by his office that the february figures were 
disappointing despite what he called an underlying favorable 
trend 
the figures show a substantial improvement from the average 
15 billion deficit per month during the second half of 1987 
verity said we look forward to continued exportled growth 
in another report thursday the commerce department said 
business inventories grew 01 percent in february a small rise 
after four big monthly increases a healthy rise in sales kept 
inventories from rising 
economists had feared the inventory buildup would force 
production cutbacks and slow economic growth early in 1988 but the 
inventory numbers along with the trade report showing a big 
increase in imports provide evidence that domestic demand has not 
weakened

reeling from setbacks in congress the courts and 
at the cash register eastern airlines faces new problems with 
federal government investigations under way 
but the airlines president says he welcomes a major federal 
investigation into the management of its parent texas air corp as 
a way to highlight his companys performance 
the department of transportation launched an unprecedented 
inquiry wednesday into texas airs finances and management to 
determine whether the company is fit to carry commercial air 
traffic 
the federal aviation administration also on wednesday slapped 
eastern with 823000 in new fines for safety violations and said 
it was beginning an inspection of the carriers entire fleet 
eastern president phil bakes said the dot probe certainly 
isnt going to help easterns financial troubles which include 
the loss of 900 million over the past 10 years eastern also 
reported a nearly 20 percent drop in passenger revenue during march 
the very idea of an investigation into safety is scary to the 
flying public but we welcome it because we hope the whole story of 
eastern airlines dedication to safety and performance will finally 
be told bakes said 
bakes blamed the labor unions at eastern which was near 
bankruptcy when texas air acquired it in 1986 for political 
agitation that he said brought on the governments scrutiny of the 
company 
we hope this investigation means an end to the 
behindthescenes lobbying and media manipulation by the unions and 
the end of the scare tactics bakes said 
charles bryan the leader of easterns machinists union said 
washington was expressing its own concern over the management of 
eastern and would not have acted so decisively simply because of 
complaints from labor unions 
what we have right now at eastern airlines and the texas air 
empire is dealmakers and lobbyists running the airline said 
bryan president of the machinists district 100 which represents 
12000 of easterns 32000 employees 
eastern pilots flight attendants and mechanics contend texas 
air management has sacrificed safety and intimidated employees in 
order to cut costs at eastern where bakes wants to reduce labor 
costs by nearly 30 percent 
easterns unions bitterly have opposed texas air chairman frank 
lorenzos plans for trimming costs and restructuring the airline 
including the spinoff of its profitable northeast corridor shuttle 
on wednesday a new union lawsuit accused eastern of violating a 
labor contract by using company planes to train nonunion flight 
attendants to serve passengers in the event of a strike 
the transport workers union of america local 553 charged 
eastern planes are being used by orion lift services inc an 
independent cargo airline to train nonunion flight attendants 
eastern also faces troubles from congress and federal 
authorities 
in recent weeks more than 150 congressmen have expressed 
support for a closer examination of texas air management practices 
and held hearings over the issue 
federal judges last month blocked eastern from spinning off its 
bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle into a texas air subsidiary and 
also from using eastern planes to train orion air personnel 
eastern had lined up the north carolinabased cargo carrier to fly 
its routes in case of an employee strike 
the 823000 civil penalty imposed wednesday against eastern 
comes 14 months after eastern agreed to pay 95 million in 
penalties because of earlier safety infractions faa officials said 
the latest fine stems from record keeping and maintenance 
infractions similar to those found in the earlier action

the senate on thursday approved a 11 
trillion budget that calls for bypassing last falls 
deficitreduction pact with president reagan to expand the war on 
drugs 
the fiscal 1989 spending blueprint passed 6926 also includes 
increases for education the space program and aids research while 
freezing or cutting back transportation housing and development 
grants to local governments 
we made tough choices said sen lawton chiles dfla 
chairman of the budget committee he defended his plan while 
conceding that the deficit problem remains unsolved we cant 
keep consuming more than we earn and living on credit he said 
sen j james exon dneb called the budget a lost 
opportunity that resulted from a decision to coast rather than 
deal with the deficit in an election year 
the next president and the next congress will be left with 
enormous problems he said 
the house approved a different version of the spending plan last 
month the two chambers will begin negotiations next week toward a 
final budget resolution 
conforming with last falls deficitreduction agreement with the 
president the senate plan earmarks 294 billion for military 
spending and 161 billion for international assistance it 
includes no new taxes beyond the 14 billion enacted last december 
for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
the agreement also capped spending by domestic agencies the 
house plan like reagans proposed budget conformed with those 
limits 
but the senate voted 930 wednesday night to bypass the spending 
caps to provide an additional 26 billion for antidrug efforts 
beginning next year the money would go for treatment programs law 
enforcement and interdiction of smuggled drugs 
the amendment offered by sens dennis deconcini dariz and 
alfonse damato rny called for increasing government tax and 
debt collections to cover the 14 billion portion of this new 
money that would be spent during the 1989 fiscal year 
sponsors said they werent busting the deficit agreement 
because that pact includes a clause allowing exceptions for dire 
emergencies 
the senate budget claims to reduce the deficit to 136 billion 
as required by the grammrudman budgetbalancing law like the 
house the senate adopted the administrations optimistic economic 
scenarios in order to show less red ink 
the congressional budget office estimates the deficit would be 
35 billion higher the deficit was 150 billion in fiscal 1987 
and it is expected to dip to 1475 billion this year 
overall the senate budget would cut the deficit 72 billion 
below what would otherwise be expected under current law according 
to budget committee figures less than half of those savings would 
come from spending cuts with the bulk relying mostly on sales of 
government assets to show a deficit reduction

shifting more money to drugs were the only two substantive 
amendments adopted by the senate in four days of debate

senators also defeated 6629 an amendment by sen bill 
armstrong rcolo to cut development programs to pay for a 
reduction in the capital gains tax 
like reagans budget the senate plan greatly increases space

this is one of the most futuristic budgets in the history of 
the united states said sen pete v domenici of new mexico the 
senior republican on the budget committee 
the senate plan also boosts aviation safety programs by 19

automakers reported wednesday they sold 230486 domesticbuilt 
cars and light trucks in the eight selling days of april 110 down 
from 290826 domestic vehicles in the nine selling days of the same 
period a year earlier because of the difference in selling days

its just the usual market volatility nothing special 
theres no question sales will pick up said ronald glantz 
analyst with montgomery securities inc in san francisco

finish their tax returns to see how much they can afford

easter a time when many people take extra days off work but arent 
likely to wander into dealerships analysts said

the year early april marked the first real slowdown 
its the weakest period in a long time but i think its 
just a hiccup said david healy industry analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert in new york 
the pressure on dealers to move out excess inventory is 
lightening up inventories were on the low side of normal at the 
end of march he said 
dealerships had a 58day supply of domestic cars at the end of 
march according to the weekly trade publication wards automotive 
reports a 60day to 65day supply is considered normal

motor corp which began assembling cars in the united states late

a suggestion that texas may cut production and 
cooperate with opec to shore up oil prices raises serious antitrust 
questions and would not be in the countrys best interests oil 
analysts and reagan administration officials said thursday 
you can imagine what the reagan administration thinks about 
it said a state department official who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity its a cartel that does not operate in us 
interests 
doug elmets press aide to energy secretary john herrington 
said its the departments belief and the governments policy 
that assistance to opec in its effort to manipulate the price of 
oil is not the correct approach 
kent hance one of three members of the texas railroad 
commission met earlier this month with rilwanu lukman the 
president of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and 
discussed the possibility that his state and the cartel would 
cooperate 
apdow jones asked lukman last week whether the cooperation 
might be in the nature of an information exchange or production 
cuts he replied exchanging information isnt going to do the 
trick is it 
hance told hartehanks newspapers tuesday that he would attend 
the cartels april 23 meeting in vienna i think that cutting 
texas production is one of the things that has to be considered 
he said it would be one of the items we would discuss 
interviewed from austin on thursday hance said we have the 
right to set our production allowables we can do it to prevent 
waste 
we are not trying to seek an alliance or cartel we just want 
input our goal is one of stability he said 
hance said he wouldnt make any deals without the approval of 
his colleagues and gov bill clements who have told him to go 
ahead with the trip 
some industry analysts expressed doubts about the wisdom of such 
an action while others questioned its legality 
it is probably a violation of the antitrust laws said john 
lamont oil specialist in the washington law firm of lobel novins 
lamont amp flug 
however william baxter who headed the antitrust division of 
the justice department early in the reagan administration said 
it is fairly standard doctrine that the antitrust laws apply only 
to private activity not action by a state 
hances efforts pose a very interesting question the economic 
evil that results is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are 
aimed against baxter said in an interview from the stanford 
university law school in palo alto calif where he is a professor 
mark sheehan spokesman for the antitrust division declined 
immediate comment 
ed rothschild assistant director of the consumerlabor energy 
coalition an advocacy group in washington said it was a joke 
to think texas can help opec be any more effective in holding up 
prices than it has been in recent years 
but he said it would be tantamount to criminal activity if 
anyone in the private sector did it 
texas is the nations no 1 oil producer statistics for 1986 
the most recent that break down production by state show output of 
23 million barrels from 201000 wells a quarter of the nations 
production and a third of its wells 
since 1972 the texas railroad commission has set allowable 
production quotas at 100 percent of capacity it was these quotas 
that had permitted texas to serve the role of swing producer in 
world oil markets before the rise of opec in the 1960s and 1970s 
texas was hit hard by the oil price collapse of 1986 engineered 
by opecs leading producer saudi arabia the state lost 8000 
wells during that year the average price at the well plunged from 
2680 per barrel in 1985 to 1474 in 1986 cutting the aggregate 
wellhead value of the states crude production from 24 billion to 
12 billion 
prices have recovered from their lows of 1986 but never have 
approached the 1985 price 
opecs recent conversations with nonmember nations and the 
prospect of their cooperation kicked up typical prices this week 
by about 1 a barrel to a bit more than 18 a barrel which is 
opecs benchmark price 
we cant bury our heads in the sand anymore and hope things 
get better hance said adding that he would not take part in the 
formal opec sessions but would meet with some of the oepc 
ministers separately 
arnold safer president of energy futures group inc a 
washington consulting firm said a likely cutback would be about 
70000 barrels a day an amount he said could be made up quickly 
by other sources 
you could probably squeeze that much out of other us 
states he said 
the politics of the day may not be in texas interest the 
federal government might not like it in the consuming states 
obviously reaction wouldnt be favorable to getting in bed with 
opec safer added
