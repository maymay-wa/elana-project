israeli scientists have reported discovering 
two enzymes in leech saliva that help keep blood from clotting and 
may be used to fight blood disorders and facilitate surgery 
we found two enzymes never reported before collagenase which 
breaks down collagen and apyrase which breaks down adp adenosine 
diphosphate said meir rigbi a professor at the hebrew 
university 
he said collagen and adp induce blood cells called platelets to 
stick together the first step in blood clotting he and research 
partners miriam orevi and amiram eldor have been studying leech 
saliva for three years 
scientists have known of the fluids anticlotting qualities for 
a century three decades ago a german scientist isolated and 
identified hirudin a protein contained in leech saliva that now is 
considered the most powerful anticoagulent agent available 
progress in research was hampered because of the scarcity of 
leech saliva until a new technique was developed by by rachel 
galun a research scientist in the department of parasitology at 
hebrew university 
she prepared arginine a solution of amino acid and placed it 
over a membrane of dried calf intestine she found that leeches 
took to the solution as an alternative to blood 
after leeches drank their fill scientists squeezed them to force 
out the liquid which also contained saliva and the thirsty 
leeches went back for more 
the technique gave us two advantanges rigbi said we 
start with a much purer material and we can repeat the process 
several times 
he found several small molecules that also contribute to the 
antihemostatic process the researcher said 
it seems that the leech has a battery of components which 
inhibit platelet aggregation by a variety of agents he said 
this is the lesson we are getting it may also be a lesson for 
physicians that a certain balance of drugs is necessary in the 
treatment of patients suffering blood disorders 
rigbi said his team found another enzyme called eglin which he 
described as an inhibitor of elastase produced by white blood 
cells and is trying to identify its chemical components to 
isolate them from the saliva and reproduce them as drugs 
we have grounds to believe we will discover some unknown 
compounds he said 
the research has aroused commercial interest and eldor who is 
associated with hadassah hospital is working on practical 
applications rigbi said

each of the past four sundays the ghost of 
treachery joined britons at the breakfast table 
harold kim philby the gentleman traitor who spied for the 
soviet union granted his first interview to a western journalist 
since defecting to moscow in 1963 and it appeared in the sunday 
times 
critics say publication of the fourpart interview in the times 
which has a circulation of 14 million was a propaganda gift to 
the kgb the soviet secret police agency still employs philby now 
76 
for journalist phillip knightley the evening of jan 19 when he 
entered philbys apartment in moscow climaxed 20 years in which he 
secretly corresponded with philby but the master spy repeatedly 
refused to see him 
when he did agree to talk philby dropped no bombshells but the 
myriad details reveal an english gentleman who despised his 
privileged background espoused soviet communism as a cambridge 
university student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels 
of british intelligence in the kremlins service 
because of his high contacts in washington philby was able to 
betray the whole western alliance he sent many western agents to 
their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a 
soviet diplomat who threatened to expose him 
the most controversial point in the interview is philbys 
contention that british intelligence let him defect rather than 
face an embarrassing public trial 
he told knightley he suffered severe selfdoubt after fleeing to 
moscow and began drinking heavily 
doubt is a terrible thing he said had i done the right 
thing you see i never swallowed everything about soviet 
communism i never took it all in 
philby said he has found peace and a happy fourth marriage to a 
russian woman feels at home in the soviet union and believes 
todays england would be a foreign country to him 
no faith come come he said only a fool would deny me 
my faith 
he likes to keep in touch with british gossip listens to the 
bbc does the times of london crossword and misses english mustard 
ever the english gentleman he greeted knightley at his door 
with a cheerful come on through dear chap 
i dont like deceiving people especially friends and 
contrary to what some people believe i feel very badly about it 
he said in the interview but then decent soldiers feel badly 
about the necessity of killing in wartime 
the unmasking after philby had been under suspicion for 12 years 
climaxed a nightmare episode for british intelligence 
it began in 1951 with the defection of top spies guy burgess and 
donald mclean and reverberated into the 1980s with the revelation 
that anthony blunt another upperclass englishman had been 
unmasked as a traitor secretly and went unpunished 
when philby defected blunt was given immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for information he later became art adviser to queen 
elizabeth ii 
blunt died in 1983 but the scandal continues to shake the 
intelligence establishment there are allegations that the late sir 
roger hollis director of the mi5 intelligence service from 1956 to 
1965 also worked for the kbg 
some commentators feel things have gone too far 
these treacheries marked the end of a certain idea which the 
british upper classes once entertained of themselves but all that 
is over now its legacy unfortunately is increased cynicism and 
incipient paranoia anthony hartley wrote in the sunday telegraph 
others ridiculed philbys notion that he was allowed to defect 
michael mates a member of parliament from the governing 
conservative party told the sunday times the defection caused much 
greater scandal than philbys arrest would have 
knightley came in for some snide remarks hartley urged his 
colleagues to forget the traitors and not make journalistic 
pilgrimages to moscow the observer said his story was more 
appropriate for izvestia the soviet government daily than a 
british newspaper 
tony loynes of the media magazine uk press gazette however 
said knightley had done the kind of thing every journalist dreams 
of 
knightley wrote why give publicity to a selfconfessed 
traitor because unless we understand the motives and compulsions 
of philby and his ilk then we will have learned nothing from the 
affair

once the junior partner in uscanadian 
business relations canadian entrepreneurs are becoming more 
aggressive in investing in the united states in fact in the last 
10 years canadian investment in the united states has grown faster 
than us investment in canada here is a report on the situation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
retailing magnate robert campeaus 66 billion 
takeover of the federated department store empire topped a surge in 
canadian investment south of the border 
the campeau corp deal last month was the largest canadian 
takeover in the united states for campeau who left his native 
sudbury ontario with an eighth grade education and retains a 
slight frenchcanadian accent it surpassed his 36 billion 
acquisition of new yorkbased allied stores corp in 1986 
canadian investment in the united states has encompassed prime 
real estate from manhattan to minneapolis railways pulp and paper 
mills oil wells telecommunications and many other industries 
here are some examples 
the reichmann brothers of toronto paul albert and ralph 
control 8 percent of manhattans office space including the world 
financial center and battery park city through their olympic and 
york developments ltd 
northern telecom a subsidiary of bce inc which includes 
bell canada is the secondlargest telecommunications manufacturer 
in the united states with 14 nortel plants and about 23000 
american employees 
imasco ltd of montreal owns the hardees fastfood chain and 
830 peoples drug stores in the united states seagram recently 
bought tropicana orange juice from beatrice foods canadians ken 
thomson and conrad black publish dozens of us newspapers and the 
forestry and paper empires of noranda and macmillan bloedel extend 
across the border as does the industrial might of alcan aluminium 
canada and the united states form the worlds largest trading 
partnership and a majority of the fortune 500 companies long have 
operated above the 49th parallel 
but until recently canada had been relegated to junior partner 
as recently as 1975 direct canadian investment in the united 
states stood at just 54 billion 
by the end of 1986 however this had soared to 29 billion and 
the canadian stake is now closer to 40 billion according to 
canadian government statistics 
the 1986 figure compares with 55 billion worth of direct us 
investment in canada and the gap is closing 
over the past 10 years canadian investment in the us is 
growing faster than us investment in canada said business 
management professor alan rudman of the university of toronto a 
specialist in the topic 
he cited 20 percent annual growth in canadian investment in the 
united states compared with 7 percent growth in the other 
direction by the early 1990s the amounts will be equal he 
predicted 
whats happened is that in the past 20 years the canadian 
economy has matured and our business sector has become world 
class 
rudman said 70 percent of canadaus trade is conducted by 
multinationals 22 based in the united states and 21 in canada 
and 30 percent of the volume is from general motors ford 
chrysler and their canadian subsidiaries 
meanwhile canadas overall share of investment in the united 
states actually has declined from 20 percent to 8 percent in the 
past 12 years rudman said because europeans and japanese have 
been pouring dollar holdings back into us businesses 
many of those foreign acquisitions have alarmed americans but 
the canadian invasion has met little opposition canadian firms 
blend in so well they cause little hostility said rudman 
flushed with success at netting federated more than 650 stores 
in 15 chains including the tony bloomingdales campeau told a 
news conference in new york 
i consider myself a north american what i like about the 
united states is a more wideopen private enterprise system where 
there is less interference by government than there is in canada 
that will remain the case for canadians under a bilateral free 
trade agreement to take effect next january if ratified by congress 
and parliament canadian investors will enjoy unfettered access in 
the united states but any us investment over 150 million will 
come in for scrutiny by ottawa 
other attractions for canadian investors include a market 10 
times bigger and lower taxes 
campeau 63 the youngest of seven children runs his real 
estate and retailing empire from offices in manhattan and toronto 
father of six he lives in toronto with his second wife in a 
11000square foot mansion with an olympicsized swimming pool 
a personal friend of former premier pierre trudeau a fellow 
frenchcanadian campeau became the federal governments biggest 
landlord after building 40 percent of the governmentoccupied 
office space in ottawa 
he got too big for canada said analyst don tigert of

in deciding to pursue a new courtship 
with its oilproducing competitors opec is betting that such 
nations as mexico norway and china are ready for a historic shift 
in global oil relations 
at stake is the future direction of oil prices which have 
fallen steadily this year partly due to increases in supply from 
nonopec nations 
leaders of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
this week are inviting government representatives from at least 
seven independent oilproducing nations to meet with five opec oil 
ministers in vienna where opec keeps its headquarters on april 
23 all 13 opec members are to meet two days later 
the invitation announced by a committee of five opec oil 
ministers on saturday is a clear acknowledgement by the cartel 
that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil supplies 
to keep prices up 
opecs president rilwanu lukman of nigeria said the cartel 
simply wanted to discuss methods of cooperation with nonopec 
producers but the meeting probably will give rise to talks on oil 
production cuts intended to boost prices 
opec has an official target price for its oil of 18 a barrel 
but little if any of its exports is fetching more than 15 a 
barrel the loose association of oilproducing states has in past 
years been unable to prevent many of its own members from 
underselling 
for much of the past six years opec has responded to declining 
prices and a buildup of surplus by cutting its production although 
this sometimes has provided a temporary boost to the market opec 
over time has suffered an erosion both of prices and exports 
the lower opecs output has fallen the less influence it has 
carried in the market and the more its poorer members such as 
nigeria and indonesia have suffered 
now the cartel is hoping that the prospect of further decline in 
prices this year will move nonopec oil producers to cooperate by 
sharing the financial burden of restraining oil supplies 
oil production by nonopec nations has risen to 28 million 
barrels a day from 22 million a day in 1979 in that time opecs 
output has tumbled from about 31 million barrels daily to 175 
million 
mexico has indicated it wants to improve cooperation in 
restraining oil supplies but it is unclear how many other 
independent producers particularly the larger ones want to cut 
a deal with opec 
the united states the worlds secondlargest oil producer is 
virtually certain to avoid any sort of cooperation with opec as is 
britain whose north sea oil makes it a major factor in the market 
the worlds no 1 producer the soviet union has shown little 
inclination to act in concert with opec 
those that have expressed interest recently including egypt 
malaysia brunei oman and angola are mostly small producers with 
little room to reduce their production 
two years ago opec held meetings with representatives of 
mexico egypt and several other smaller producers in a vain attempt 
to agree on joint production cuts opec was told that it must 
reduce its output first before the independents would consider a 
response in kind 
other independent producers include norway and china 
the problem for opec then and now is that some of its members 
notably cartel leader saudi arabia simply do not want to continue 
the tactic of reducing production without firm pledges from 
producers outside opec the saudis backed by their allies on the 
arabian peninsula think its more important to preserve their 
current share of world oil exports than to defend a fixed oil price 
most opec members ignore anyway 
even so opec has signaled that it is ready to make a fresh 
attempt to change global oil relations by drawing independent 
producers into an agreement 
opec president lukman told reporters he saw an important 
difference between the current situation and that of two years ago 
the major difference is that nonopec have on their own 
realized the need to cooperate and they have made approaches 
voluntarily to get together with us he said 
in this industry of maverick nations however many obstacles 
remain for an internally divided opec trying to bridge differences 
with independents

nearly 600 poor families made poorer 
by panamas political and economic crisis have taken over a stretch 
of seaside landfill and covered it with precarious shacks 
the shanty town a half mile from the ruins of the colonial city 
sacked and burned by pirate henry morgan in 1671 has swollen 
rapidly since 60 families invaded the privatelyowned land 
before dawn on march 25 
their takeover is a headache for the regime of gen manuel 
antonio noriega and a dramatic example of the devastation the 
nations crisis has wrought on the poor most of whom lived 
handtomouth even in the best of times 
noriega as head of the 15000member defense forces is the 
power behind the civilian government after noriega was indicted on 
drug trafficking charges in the united states washington imposed 
economic sanctions on panama hoping its action and months of civil 
unrest would oust noriega although the sanctions have bankrupted 
the nations economy noriega remains in power 
we were obliged by necessity to act said marcelino de 
gracia one of five organizers of the takeover each of the 
squatter familes has staked out a 10by15 yard plot with rope 
wire ribbon or knotted strips of cloth 
de gracia a 29yearold unemployed tire salesman lives with 
his wife yadilia and their two infant children in a shanty made of 
mangrove poles cardboard a shower curtain palm fronds and a 
sheet of corrugated zinc it like hundreds of other shacks spread 
over the seized 30 acres is built on reclaimed land that until two 
years ago was a garbage dump 
the indigent community is bordered by a foulsmelling tidewater 
tributary on which float bloated fish poisoned by raw sewage 
part of the camp was carved out of an auto graveyard the rusted 
bodies and tattered interiors provide building materials 
furnishings and a tetanus trap for the approximately 3000 children 
living there 
the dump has fostered a local population of raccoons which have 
augmented the squatters diet skins were tacked on the walls of 
several shacks 
de gracia said camp dwellers dig clams on the edge of their 
settlement and catch lizards and armadillos as well as the 
ringtailed mammals 
nothing gets out of here alive he said whack and into 
the pot 
de gracia said a census shows about 570 families comprising 
almost 4000 people lived in the camp as of april 4 
they draw water from seven faucets along a dirt road bordering 
the camp which sits off avenida cincuentenario about five miles 
east of downtown 
elma sierra olivia ramos and anastasia vega stood around a 
smoky campfire in front of ms sierras shack rice boiled in a 
blackened pot 
arroz pelado bald rice she said disparagingly using 
the slang for the grain unaccompanied by beans or meat we dont 
know what beans look like any more this rice was donated by a 
nearby church 
the three women all on their own have 11 children among them 
they said many recent arrivals are single mothers 
ms ramos admitted to trying to steal a loaf of bread that 
morning from a nearby grocery many of which are owned by immigrant 
asians 
the chinaman almost took my head off she said exhibiting 
fingernail scratches streaking her neck i know its wrong but 
my kids have to eat 
almost six weeks into the gravest political and economic crisis 
in panamanian history the women like most others in the camp are 
desperate 
they have virtually no money have been kicked out of the rooms 
they previously rented and see no prospects that things will soon 
improve enough to allow them to return to their menial or domestic 
jobs 
they all cursed noriega told that a newspaper supportive of the 
regime had dubbed the settlement not one step backward 
noriegas slogan in his battle with the united states they all 
but spat their disgust 
the land is owned by the chanis family a clan of doctors and 
statesmen prominent for several generations they do not intend to 
sit by while it is requisitioned by the masses 
the seizure took us by surprise said dr rolando chanis 
we await adequate action by authorities to correct the 
situation 
de gracia whose family had been sharing his motherinlaws 
tworoom apartment with seven others said he organized the 
takeover along with four friends with whom he regularly played 
volleyball 
in the first days with just 60 families we feared a move to 
dislodge us he said but the news circulated fast and with 
the country the way it is people poured in it is another thing to 
disloge 570 families theyd have to think twice about trying 
that 
any move against the squatters on behalf of the landowners would 
contradict official propaganda noriegas regime portrays the 
crisis as a confrontation between good underpriveleged and 
nationalistic panamanians and bad wealthy sellouts conspiring 
with washington to subjugate the isthmus

when this old mining town was booming 
with coal men put aside their picks to construct a theater today 
the miners are few but the structure still stands now as a school 
of performing arts 
and as a proper salute to the people who worked underground in 
southern illinois organizers of the school have dedicated it to a 
famous coal miners daughter country singer loretta lynn 
we want to help promote local talent said artistic director 
ilene farrell we want to benefit the community thats what 
were here for to benefit everyone in the arts 
the threestory building named the miners live theater and 
completed in 1918 by members of united mine workers local 264 was 
used for labor meetings and vaudeville shows 
the theaters past is intertwined with the regions coalmining 
history according to literature about the building the first mine 
in this town of 20000 residents 15 miles east of st louis was 
established in 1857 
the industry led to the towns growth and by 1886 a man could 
walk underground through connecting tunnels between the mines from 
one edge of the city limits to the other literature says 
mining and collinsville were almost synonymous terms 
the coalmining industry slowly started to wane however and in 
1969 miners live was sold to a private company which turned it 
into a movie house 
two years ago bloomer amusement co closed the 700seat theater 
and it sat idle until february when jean spurlock reopened it and 
decided to bring in live acts and launch a performing arts school 
and production company 
the building still needs plenty of renovation the seats have 
red strands of tape covering cracked vinyl upholstery a walk up 
the stairs to the balcony shows walls with peeling paint 
elevated box seats flank each side of the stage and an orchestra 
pit is located in front 
by starting the school and hiring bigname entertainers to 
perform at the site ms farrell believes miners live will gain 
recognition 
my gut feeling is that its doing well already that the skys 
the limit she said 
ms farrell said the fine arts school will feature instruction 
in dance theater modeling singing music and playwriting she 
has assembled a 25member staff 
so far 50 students have signed up and classes could start this 
month at the loretta lynn artistic art center and school she said 
its going to be a launching pad for some professional careers 
hopefully ms farrell said 
the town is glad to see the doors reopen ms lynn was on hand 
april 1 for dedication ceremonies 
it was part of collinsville culture for so long ms 
spurlock said most people think they have to go to las vegas or 
los angeles or new york but like i said theres nothing in the 
midwest to compare with whats gonna be happening here

clothes may make the man but his tie can reveal 
his innermost secrets 
the color pattern and style of a mans necktie all provide 
clues to his personality and lifestyle says the guild of british 
tiemakers representing 30 manufacturers of the british tie 
that sartorial symbol of the old boy network 
as eyes are reputedly the mirrors of the soul so ties are the 
talisman of the image a statement by the wearer of their 
personality and individuality an indication of their temperament 
and mood a symbol of the social set in which he does or wants to 
belong a guide to how the wearer sees himself or would like others 
to see him according to the guilds survey 
to help tie wearers and watchers interpret some of the subtle 
messages the guild has issued a guide to tiespeak 
if you want to come across as a strong confident extrovert 
person with strong opinions choose a brilliantly colored tie or 
one with an exaggerated pattern or motif it says 
a man who wears a tie in a plain light color runs the danger 
of being a professional mr nice someone who likes to amuse and 
entertain an arranger of matters rather than a doer 
the more glowing the color of a tie the more 
moneymotivated the wearer is likely to be the guide says a plain 
dark tie on the other hand indicates a secretive man who keeps 
more than his tie close to his chest 
the guide says a tie with light and dark stripes of equal width 
is the mark of a fencesitter 
wide light stripes on a dark background suggest the wearer 
thinks the best of people and accepts them at face value while 
pessimists generally go for wide dark stripes on a light 
background 
multicolored multiwidth stripes indicate someone whod love to 
do something daring if only he dared 
a striped tie also can blurt out which side of the atlantic 
ocean a man hails from american tie stripes run from the right 
shoulder down toward the left the opposite of those on a european 
tie 
a tie with dark spots on a light background indicates a 
wheelerdealer while light spots on a dark background suggest 
a sheep in wolfs clothing the guide says 
small neat geometric patterns are taken to indicate a 
planner a man who likes to create order out of chaos probably a 
good administrator it says 
a small paisley pattern suggests an upholder of tradition while 
a large paisly print suggests a hedger of bets 
ties give away other secrets 
in britain a mans personal history can be traced through the 
ties in his closet revealing his school club and military 
background 
every british school has its own design usually striped with 
the school colors which every schoolboy wears as part of his 
uniform 
upon graduation he moves up to an old school tie 
identifying his alma mater he also may collect a regimental tie 
with symbolic colors and crests 
the colors of the royal military academys tie for example 
represent the ingredients of gunpowder yellow for sulphur blue 
for saltpeter and black for carbon the royal tank corps tie 
represents the brown mud red blood and green fields of flanders

folk singer raffi says he refuses to 
capitalize on the 12year success of his selfproduced album of 
childrens music by endorsing toys and other kiddie products 
i just believe that the music is important in and of itself i 
dont want its value to be diminished by doing commercial things 
that have nothing to do with music raffi said in an interview 
published sunday in the tennessean

good day care is expensive for working 
parents admits baby guru dr benjamin spock and he says 
government and industry are lagging in subsidizing childcare 
programs 
theres no reason that the richest country shouldnt spend 
money on day care when they spend trillions of dollars on nuclear 
arms spock said at a forum saturday at harvard universitys 
graduate school of design 
spock 84 who wrote his first book about child care in the 
1940s said i still emphasize the childs formative years but i 
cant stop the tidal wave of women going to work 
but there are things to mitigate it to make it work out less 
harmful he said suggesting flexible hours and shorter work days 
as possible ways for parents to spend more time with their children

jesse jackson and sen albert gore jr sounded 
conciliatory notes sunday as they campaigned for support in new 
yorks democratic presidential primary a contest in which the 
active candidates often had to compete for attention with 
noncandidate mario cuomo 
meanwhile the frontrunner in the contest gov michael dukakis 
of massachusetts took the day off to celebrate greek easter with 
his family 
also taking a day off was vice president george bush whose path 
to the republican presidential nomination is clear of serious 
opposition while gop rival pat robertson remains in the race the 
former television evangelist has conceded he has no chance to 
overcome bushs long lead in the race 
gore and jackson were interviewed on the cbs show face the 
nation and played down their differences which have appeared 
more heated as the new york campaign got under way 
jackson also said that if elected president he would not meet 
again with yasser arafat the leader of the palestine liberation 
organization 
he said a meeting he had with arafat several years ago was for 
the sole purpose of challenging him to change his posture and move 
toward a mutual recognition policy with israel 
that meeting with arafat has been a focus of criticism of 
jackson by jewish leaders in new york 
gore campaigned in heavily jewish neighborhoods in brooklyn 
sunday and received the endorsement of state assemblyman dov 
hikind who told the crowd many of them wearing the traditional 
black hats of the hasidim we want to understand when one of the 
candidates has embraced yasser arafat 
at that the crowd erupted into loud boos 
hikind described gore as the only one who has had the courage 
to criticize jackson he said that dukakis supporters were 
telling us we should reward dukakis for his silence 
in his brief remarks to the crowd gore steered clear of comment 
about jackson and told the crowd that in his years in congress i 
have stood fast in support of israel and a strong usisraeli 
relationship 
gore then took a walking tour for about 10 blocks down 13th 
avenue a street lined with kosher food shops and a variety of 
other small businesses 
mayor edward koch said earlier in the week that jewish voters 
and other supporters of israel would have to be crazy to vote 
for jackson in the primary 
gore had made one of the strongest direct attacks of the 
campaign on jackson when he said recently that the nation was 
looking for leadership not a preacher in the white house 
jackson supporters bristled at the comment and called it racist 
asked if he agreed jackson said thats not my basic 
position there are racebased questions his is not a racebased 
challenge and i accept it in that spirit in part because i 
respect al gore quite a bit as a person 
when asked if he thought gore was being unfair jackson also 
demurred 
no i think al gore has too much character to be categorically 
unfair he replied 
while gore said he had no intention of altering the aggressive 
tone of his campaign the tennessee senator said he thought all the 
candidates have grown during the long debate 
as for his approach to the campaign gore said i have no 
plans to change my basic campaign posture at all 
jackson spent sunday morning preaching in the abyssinian church 
in harlem where he delivered a sermon called a letter to dr 
martin luther king he recounted the nations progress since the 
civil rights leaders assassination 20 years ago and said much 
remains to be done 
he concluded quoting kings wish that all people would one day 
join hands and and sing free at lastthank god almighty we 
are free at last 
later jackson said he could not look up when he read the quote 
because there is still a lot of pain and passion in it all 
all we can do is vow we will continue he told reporters 
its not over 
jackson had lunch at a soul food restaurant in harlem and 
walked for several blocks through the neighborhood hand in hand 
with his wife jacqueline residents called out to him and rushed up 
to shake his hand people called down from their windows win 
jesse and god bless you as jackson gave a thumbsup sign 
security around jackson was intense with about 20 secret 
service agents and new york city police officers escorting him 
along the sidewalk along with a phalanx of cameras limousines 
from the motorcade drove alongside 
later in affluent new rochelle jackson called for racial unity 
even lions and lambs dont want the forest set on fire he 
told a crowd in affluent new rochelle if lions and lambs can 
find common ground then blacks and jews hispanics and italians 
can find common ground he said to cheers from the largely black 
audience 
a young white man waved a sign that said jews want peace with 
jesse jackson 
the common ground in new york as elsewhere in the nation 
jackson said lies in economnic issues and the desire to rid the 
streets of drugs 
meanwhile former president richard m nixon interviewed on the 
nbc show meet the press commented on the new york campaign 
saying jackson has not been on the side of jewish issues while 
all the other candidates cant wait but line up for those issues 
all the way down the line 
nixon also said jackson is appealing to those who are 
restless despite prosperity and that is what george bush must 
overcome and thats why i think its going to be a close election 
rather than a landslide 
the former president driven from office by the watergate 
scandal said that while he would describe cuomo and jackson as 
poets dukakis would better be compared to a word processor 
on the other hand nixon said of dukakis hes cool hes 
intelligent hes tough hes good in debates hes going to be a 
very formidable candidate 
cuomo the new york governor whom some democrats have urged to 
get into the presidential race took the spotlight from the active 
candidates on saturday by announcing he would not endorse anyone 
prior to the april 19 vote and calling efforts to draft him 
unproductive and unwise 
did that end the possibility of drafting the governor 
ive ruled it out he said in a telephone call to the 
associated press 
but spokesman gary fryer said the governor meant that a draft 
should not take place but was not ruling out acceptance of one if 
it did occur 
on sunday however cuomo said i think it is absolutely a 
reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says its wrong 
its counterproductive its unwise it shouldnt be then that 
means he rejects a draft 
when asked if his remarks mean that he would not accept a draft 
cuomo said i think so 
former new york rep richard ottinger said sunday he will 
suspend his organized effort to draft cuomo after receiving a 
letter from the governor requesting that he do so he said 
however that if it appears there will be no frontrunner at the 
democratic convention the effort would resume 
it doesnt change anything said dukakis responding to 
cuomos latest comment 
im going to win new york im going to win pennsylvania and 
im going to win the nomination said the massachusetts governor 
who had hoped to get cuomos backing before the primary

a new age of television promising 
sharper brighter images on a larger wider screen with sound as 
clean as compact disc recordings is making americas tv broadcast 
insdustry excited and nervous 
this new technology called high definition tv or hdtv is the 
biggest development in television since the introduction of color 
and many american tv station owners are eager to explore its 
potential they also want to make sure they dont get left behind 
they are watching nervously as competing american interests work 
toward developing an hdtv transmission standard for us markets 
while the japanese and europeans move independently with their own 
systems neither of which is compatible with each other or with 
existing us tv sets 
one of broadcasters greatest fears is the probability that the 
japanese who plan to offer hdtv in their own country in 1990 will 
begin exporting to the united states hdtv receivers and video 
cassette recorders such packages could cut overtheair 
broadcasters out of the video equation and threaten their survival 
we dont know how much time it will take to develop a system 
that can be used by overtheair broadcasters said michael j 
sherlock of nbc which is developing a system that improves the tv 
picture though not as significantly as hdtv we dont know how 
the audience will react and we dont know how much time we have to 
develop our own hdtv 
but one thing is certain he said we broadcasters will have 
competition by technically superior systems 
were fooling ourselves if we dont think the people in the 
video cassette cable and movie industries are going to take 
advantage of that he warned in a panel discussion at the 
national association of broadcasters convention which began 
saturday and ends tuesday 
broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if 
we take too long to meet the competition with an improved 
picture he said 
hdtv is the most talked about development at this years 
convention a room devoted to exhibits of the competing hdtv 
systems being developed as well as the japanese system has provided 
most of the tv broadcasters here their first opportunity to see 
high definition television 
the japanese have been working on hdtv for nearly 20 years and 
they are moving forward quickly they plan to give a sneak preview 
of their system with broadcasts of this summers seoul olympics to 
hdtv sets in about 50 bigcity department stores throughout the 
country 
the quality of the picture on 35 and 50inch hdtv screens is 
noticeably better than on conventional tv sets the colors are 
brighter and the detail much greater and because the 
widthtoheight ratio can be greater the picture has the panoramic 
appearance of a movie theater screen 
the picture on a standard television set in the united states is 
produced by a signal that scans more than 200000 dots on 525 
lines the japanese system has 1125 scanning lines 
the japanese system however requires more than the space 
allocated to tv channels on the electromagnetic spectrum in japan 
the hdtv system called hivision will be transmitted by satellite 
to small rooftop antennas avoiding the bandwidth problem that 
would be faced by overtheair broadcasting but special hdtv 
receivers will be needed to see the enhanced picture 
a large part of the debate in the united states is whether a 
system can be developed that can compress into the standard 6 
megahertz tv channel all the electronic information required to 
produce hdtv pictures or whether additional channel space on 
another band will be required 
some are advocating a transitional approach in which 
broadcasters would move first to a system that requires no extra 
bandwidth and is compatible with existing tv sets and produces an 
improved picture though not as good as hdtv 
whichever system is ultimately agreed upon by the us industry 
many technical questions must be answered and tradeoffs examined 
meantime many tv station executives are nervous 
if youre not scared by hdtv then you dont understand the 
problem said lebon g abercrombie vice president and general 
manager of kmphtv fresno calif 
within a few short years there are going to be high definition 
systems out there for home use in some fashion said thomas r 
craddock an engineer at kktvtv in colorado springs colo 
broadcasters are most concerned about how that is going to erode 
their audience

the worlds largest tick collection could 
be headed for a climatecontrolled pod in a museum because no one 
in the government wants to give the 1 million little bloodsuckers 
a home 
the smithsonian institution and the national institutes of 
health cant agree on which one should pay the 200000 necessary 
in fiscal 1989 to keep the governments acarology unit in business 
the unit is home to 1 million tick specimens deceased in case 
you were wondering or worrying that have been painstakingly 
collected by researchers over decades 
if no agreement is reached by sept 30 the ticks will go into 
the museum equivalent of cold storage and the lab will be no more 
its not your typical tale of government cutbacks but a 
potential tragedy nonetheless according to entomologists and 
health officials who note the ticks role in carrying disease and 
the importance of research on the tiny bloodsucking arachnids 
the unit and the collection are unique and are the backbone 
of tick research in the united states and abroad george 
eickwort president of the acarological society said in a letter 
seeking help from sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the funding dispute threatens a unique research program overseen 
by nih taxonomist jim keirans who presides over the unit at the 
smithsonians museum support center in the washington suburb of 
suitland 
public health officials veterinarians armed forces physicians 
and zookeepers the world over know when they find a tick they cant 
identify jim keirans is their man 
the units supporters describe it as the only place on the 
planet where researchers can send ticks for identification 
critical to scientists trying to track the more than 20 tickborne 
diseases that plague humans 
common diseases like lyme disease and rocky mountain spotted 
fever more exotic diseases like crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever 
and kyasanur forest disease other diseases that infect livestock 
and wild animals 
scientists and a group of congressmen have rallied to the units 
support urging nih to save the lab for the good of the public 
health 
the collection and dr keirans have been instrumental in the 
accurate identification of tick species which serve as vectors of 
disease including the identification of a new species ixodes 
dammini as the principal vector for transmitting lyme disease 
eickwort wrote in his letter to kennedy 
the suitland laboratory was created in 1983 when nih moved its 
tick collection from the rocky mountain laboratory in hamilton 
mont to the smithsonian 
from 1984 to 1987 keirans and his assistant richard robbins 
received 14113 tick specimens most from agricultural and 
veterinary researchers 
we have received them pinned we have received them 
scotchtaped we have received them just dropped in an envelope 
keirans said during a recent tour of the spacious and orderly lab 
the collection became the worlds largest with the addition of 
the specimens papers and books of harry hoogstraal head of the 
zoology department at a navy research unit in egypt for more than 
35 years hoogstraal was the worlds preeminent tick expert until 
his death in 1986 
keirans said the 1983 move came when nih decided to get out of 
medical entomology the study of insectborne disease and focus on 
aids research nih agreed to pay the salaries of keirans and a 
technician for two years when the agreement expired it was 
extended to september 1988 
but nih is no longer interested in having a medical entomologist 
housed at the smithsonian he said 
smithsonian spokesman william schulz said the museum tried to 
raise funds for the tick unit but never said it would pay for the 
facility and never felt there was some deadline where we would 
take over the staff salaries 
john lamontagne nihs director of microbiology and infectious 
disease program sees it differently he said institute officials 
felt that the ticks belonged at the smithsonian and the 
smithsonian originally said that they were interested in it 
its my understanding now that their assessment of it now is 
not quite in line with that i think they get uncomfortable with 
the public health and service kind of needs that the collection 
implies 
nih officials appointed 11 researchers familiar with the lab to 
consider the issue in march they concluded that the unit should 
be funded by nih with the smithsonian continuing to provide space 
and equipment 
lamontagne said nih is looking into several options financial 
support from the department of agriculture and walter reed army 
hospital both heavy users of the units taxonomy service or some 
fiscal legerdemain which would move the units funding to another 
part of the nih budget 
twentytwo federal legislators led by rep george 
hochbrueckner dny wrote last month to health and human 
services secretary otis r bowen urging nih to continue funding 
the lab 
hochbrueckner whose long island district has high incidences of 
lyme disease which causes temporary paralysis and tickborne 
babesiosis a malarialike fever has become one of the tick 
programs biggest boosters 
he says that if nih doesnt want the tick program someone else 
should give it a home 
i dont really care where they stay he said

federal housing officials today announced 
plans to find out how many black and hispanic couples are victims 
of racial steering or other discriminatory treatment in their 
search for places to live 
the first major study of housing discrimination in a decade 
would use hundreds of white black and hispanic couples as bogus 
househunters to test the nations metropolitan rental and real 
estate markets 
racial steering occurs when agents steer minorities away 
from allwhite residential areas 
despite advances in civil rights discrimination still exists 
in more subtle ways than before in many areas said housing and 
urban development secretary samuel r pierce in requesting bids to 
conduct the study the deadline for bidding is may 26 with the 
study expected to be completed in mid1990 
pierce said the aim is to increase enforcement against illegal 
discrimination other officials said the study also could determine 
the need for stronger fairhousing legislation 
the last such study completed in 1979 used 600 black and white 
couples who tried to buy or rent homes or apartments in 40 
metropolitan areas across the country 
it included couples with nearly identical backgrounds except 
for race who would respond to the same newspaper ads and then fill 
out detailed forms reporting their experiences 
c duncan macrae huds deputy assistant secretary for policy 
development and research said in an interview that the new study 
will use similar methods 
the 1979 study estimated that 27 percent of rental agents and 15 
percent of house sellers discriminated against blacks 
discrimination then was defined as failing to provide important 
necessary information to rent or purchase a home 
the study concluded that black home buyers who inquired about 
four different advertised homes had a 48 percent chance of finding 
discrimination in dealing with at least one of them in the rental 
market 85 percent found discrimination in at least one of four 
inquiries about apartments 
macrae said the new study will be expanded to include 
moresubtle discrimination differences between discrimination in 
cities and suburbs and discrimination against hispanics as well as 
blacks there is no plan to include asian native american or other 
minorities he said 
since the fair housing assistance program began in 1983 
discrimination claims have declined from about 5000 complaints a 
year to about 4500 annualy mcrae said the new study he said is 
needed to determine whether that decline is significant 
we hope this research will document the existence of housing 
discrimination in america or lack of discrimination whatever the 
case may be macrae said 
the only broadbased studies of discrimination in recent years 
have relied on census data rather than the actual experiences of 
people seeking to buy or rent living space he said 
a study by douglas massey a university of chicago sociology 
professor concluded last year that most blacks still live in 
segregated neighborhoods while asian and hispanic minorities have 
had more success moving into largely white neighborhoods massey 
analyzed census date from 1970 and 1980 
last june the national association of realtors signed an 
agreement with hud officials pledging that its 750000 members 
around the nation would provide equal access to housing regardless 
of race

jesse jackson who saw his longshot white 
house ambitions curdle over the course of 24 hours last week 
handled the disappointment with a statesmanlike equanimity that 
could ease the democrats path toward an autumn unity 
now win lose or draw al gore will set his 1988 legacy in 
the eight days before new yorks primary the senator from 
tennessee recently voiced some shrill criticism of jackson and 
michael dukakis and party leaders have asked him to stop before 
things get ugly 
gore began his negative campaign after suffering a string of 
miserable defeats suggesting to jackson and others that he was 
acting out of desperation desperation politics as we have seen 
previously this year is not generally a pretty sight to behold 
take bob dole for one marvelous week of february he boasted a 
positive message and a priestly visage and looked for all the world 
like a republican giantkiller the roof caved in in new hampshire 
and before the clock struck midnight dole struck out at george 
bush within days he was on the air with antibush attack ads 
pat robertson had no real chance to win the gop nomination but 
when his support dissipated robertson nonetheless took it out on 
bush in one of the more amazing accusations of the year he 
suggested without proof that the bush campaign had leaked word of 
jimmy swaggarts immorality so as to hurt robertson at the polls 
jackson has apparently chosen a more coolheaded course 
following his backtoback defeats last week in colorado and 
wisconsin jackson kept to the high road revealing no rancor and 
making unmistakable gestures to jewish voters whose suspicions were 
kindled by the hymietown and farrakhan episodes of 1984 he 
likes to mock dukakis as the man with money but no message but 
they agree on many issues and the barbs rarely have gotten more 
biting than that 
despite insistent baiting from new york mayor ed koch who said 
a jew would have to be crazy to vote for jesse jackson 
jackson has kept his serenity 
we are already in a tender situation he said of 
blackjewish relations responsible leadership must move to heal 
people and not to extend their fears 
on sunday gore allowed a surrogate brooklyn assemblyman dov 
hikind whose endorsement he had just received to attack jackson 
with the tennessee senator at his side hikind brought up jacksons 
meeting with plo chief yasser arafat and praised gore as the only 
candidate who has had the courage to criticize jackson 
later in the day gore praised jacksons statement that if 
elected president he would not meet again with the plo chief 
gore however couched his approval in terms that called attention 
to the earlier meeting calling that a change in position for 
jackson 
jacksons steady 1988 demeanor has won many admirers richard 
nixon calls him a poet and one of the very best candidates 
of the entire century for either party 
jackson has certainly has been a good force in our time 
says prominent democratic economist john kenneth galbraith he 
has given voice to people who previously did not have voice and is 
bringing a whole group of new people into the political process 
now democratic eyes are on gore 
it caught party leaders by surprise to see gore so quiet 
throughout the primary season turn up the heat on jackson and 
dukakis in the days before dukakis wisconsin landslide ranking 
democrats were content to let nature take its course now they are 
telling gore to pull back 
gores people counter that his campaign is doing just what 
campaigns were always intended to do point out the differences 
between his priorities policies and record and those of his 
opponents 
nothing personal gore spokesman arlie schardt said late 
last week 
schardt is basically correct gore taunts dukakis for lacking 
foreign policy experience and jackson for having no experience in 
office at all its pretty tame stuff but it defies the current 
catechism of the party establishment which is this 
jackson is too liberal too inexperienced and maybe too black 
to beat bush gore and dukakis among others both had a chance to 
beat him and thank heaven dukakis has done it now its time to 
quiet down deliver the nomination to dukakis and get on with party 
unity with gore and jackson both needed to build bridges across 
the south 
gore obviously wants one more chance to emerge as the 
alternative to jackson if the attacks and 1 million worth of tv 
time are working hell likely keep it up 
but if he doesnt see a quick improvement in the preelection 
polls gore will probably tone down the rhetoric this week and go 
softly unto the night gore just turned 40 is generally thought 
to be looking ahead at 1992 and beyond so common sense says he 
wont want to leave a bad taste in anybodys mouth

every two hours or so on a normal working day 
an aide to rep pat roberts goes to a wooden board on the wall of 
his office and posts the latest crop prices at the grain elevator 
back home in dodge city 
roberts rkan is a oneissue congressman the whole thing 
is agriculture says press secretary fred zillinger gesturing 
matteroffactly to an office festooned with pictures of 
wheatgrowing country and toy models of tractors 
only a few steps down the hall are the house agriculture 
committee hearing rooms handy since roberts haunts the committee 
more than most lawmakers 
the allegation that im a oneissue congressman or a 
fulltime aggie has at least some bearing in fact says roberts 
who represents the western twothirds of kansas a vast wheat 
factory sometimes called americas ukraine 
he has steadily gathered seniority and is now viewed as a force 
to be reckoned with especially in view of rising us dependence 
on farm exports 
in recent weeks roberts has pushed hard for a socalled 
triggered marketing loan for wheat feed grains and oilseeds which 
could boost exports but at a 500 million price tag 
the plan part of a sweeping 1000page trade bill figures to 
be in the spotlight again as the measure heads for final floor 
action perhaps as early as next week meanwhile the drive has 
furnished a showcase for the rhetorical flourish that roberts has 
brought to the panel 
at one point roberts told wary budget watchdogs that the 
subsidy would amount to nothing more than a bargaining chip in 
international trade talks never go into effect and thus cost 
taxpayers nothing 
were not asking you to take her home roberts told a 
housesenate conference committee were just asking you to dance 
with her then at closing time you can sneak out the back door 
the crack was typical of the roberts flair for daubing color on 
an otherwise gray farm debate 
one steamy washington night last summer agriculture committee 
chairman e kika de la garza dtexas tried to ease a farm credit 
bill through the panel without long debate some lawmakers 
suggested he was attempting to railroad the measure 
that put roberts in mind of a desperado band that once roamed 
the high plains of western kansas 
im from dodge city the home of the dalton gang he 
declared out there we stop trains to see whats in em before we 
let em through 
another roberts remark mirrored farm frustration in the early 
1980s when rural debt was skyrocketing and the reagan 
administration was taking a cautious approach to increases in 
federal payment programs 
air force one declared roberts had better not fly too low over 
kansas or it was liable to get a pitchfork in the belly 
a marine corps veteran with bald dome and granite features 
roberts launches his barbs in flat kansas accents bearing a marked 
resemblance to those of sen bob dole who once represented 
roberts 1st district 
theres a lot of bob dole in his style says rep edward r 
madigan rill top republican on the agriculture committee 
pats an old pro i dont think anyone around here knows farm 
programs any better than he does 
he has some of bob doles incessant desire to be cute and to 
make his point in a hardbiting kind of way says rep dan 
glickman dkan 
roberts long has been a thorn to environmentalists he sponsored 
a plan urged by food processors to bar states from setting 
pesticide regulations tougher than those of the federal government 
he also fought for exemptions to usdas sodbuster program designed 
to curb soil erosion 
those same environmentalists say however that it is hard to 
stay mad at him 
its nifty to find someone in washington like him who doesnt 
hold grudges because washington is full of grudges says maureen 
hinckle national audubon society lobbyist 
she says that once when an agriculture committee aide barred her 
from a hearing on grounds the room was full roberts put aside 
their numerous past skirmishes and ordered let her in 
otherwise ill have to lie and say shes on my staff he 
chortled

how many days a week do you practice 
basketball jesse jackson demanded of the young player prodded to 
his feet in the packed high school auditorium 
four to six was the reply 
when you come home at night do you study for four hours 
three hours two hours jackson asked 
the other kids were giggling now and eventually the boy 
admitted to maybe one hour of studying with radio on and 
occasional calls to his girlfriend 
that brought jackson to one of his favorite lectures on the 
opportunities that await those who study hard the importance of 
pushing for all that life holds of working to rise above 
lessthanprivileged beginnings 
included is a pointed antidrug and antialcohol message that 
jackson has been hammering home for years to youngsters at schools 
across the country 
what does it matter if opportunity is there if youre to 
drunk to stagger through the door jackson asked what does it 
matter if your classmate is black or white if you cant get along 
with anybody 
the motivational talk is not part of jacksons regular campaign 
pitch but talking to high school students is part of his campaign 
schedule as it has been a big part of his lecture tours in the 
past 
and fighting drugs is a big part of his campaign message in 
talking to the young people he always includes a dramatic series 
of questions 
how many people here know someone who has died because of drugs 
please stand a smattering always stand up 
how many know someone who is in jail because of drugs 
this sometimes brings about half the audience to its feet 
how many know someone who has tried drugs 
virtually the entire audience stands 
and then jackson asks how many know someone who has 
contemplated suicide as many as half will stand 
jacksons call for action against drug use and trafficking gets 
a more enthusiastic response than almost anything else he talks 
about on the campaign trail 
lately the candidate has needled his democratic opponents sen 
albert gore jr and massachusetts gov michael dukakis saying they 
are following his leadership by making drugs a bigger part of their 
own campaign messages 
weve never known a threat quite like drugs he told some 
4000 people at iona college in new rochelle ny on sunday in 
the old days black people were threatened by the ku klux klan who 
came at night wearing hoods and carrying lynching ropes he said 
but now weve lost more lives to dope than to the rope 
the audience cheered when jackson added his punch line those 
who push drugs dont wear hoods they are hoods 
his standard talk to the high school kids is about more than 
just drugs its about selfmotivation and the chance to excel in 
life 
at wyandanch high he told the youths that they are good 
athletes because you do well what you do much theres nothing 
wrong with your mind theres something wrong with your time i 
challenge you to use your mind i challenge you to study give your 
mind a chance 
as i travel around the country the rising use of drugs and 
babies making babies and suicide is undermining our opportunity 
he said 
he typically ends up leading a chant down with dope up with 
hope down with dope up with hope 
the kids chanting jesse jesse mobbed him sunday as he 
left the stage 
he touched my hand squealed regina ross 17 
what did she and her friend think of his talk 
it was very inspirational one of them said jackson had 
zeroed in on the problems of their world especially the down 
with dope up with hope and the part about babies making 
babies 
thats the problem right here in this school said regina

one of the effects of this years continued 
improvement in the farm economy may be a closer balance between the 
crop and livestock sectors says an agriculture department 
economist 
for some time usda economists have been forecasting that 1988 
net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 50 billion to 
55 billion last year with a bulge in livestock profits net cash 
income rose to a record 57 billion the difference between gross 
cash income and cash expenses 
gregory hanson of the departments economic research service 
says 1988 crop receipts may rise 8 percent to 14 percent from last 
years 59 billion to a range of 64 billion to 67 billion 
livestock receipts which were a record of 74 billion in 1987 
may decline to between 71 billion and 74 billion 
while cattle receipts will be the second or third highest on 
record hog and dairy receipts may each fall nearly 1 billion 
he said substantial increases in supplies could bring hog prices 
down by onesixth from last year and poultry prices onefourth 
below two years ago 
meanwhile farm expenses will end their downward trend of the 
last few years feed and fertilizer prices may rise 6 percent to 7 
percent in 1988 translating into 2 billion of added costs 
repairs energy and labor could add another 1 billion while 
interest and livestock purchase may decline by about 1 billion 
hanson writing in the april issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said 1988 will bring continued improvement in the farm 
sectors balance sheet a slight strengthening of land prices and 
a reduction in farm debt of 5 billion to 10 billion will boost 
farmers equity by 10 billion to 20 billion 
the combination of higher crop prices lower hog and poultry 
prices and higher feed costs is shifting profits from livestock to 
crop producers he said 
other impacts of higher crop prices according to hanson 
include 
the turnaround in declining land values coincided with a rise 
in corn and soybean prices during the first six months of 1987 
with higher crop prices and the related strengthening in land 
values crop farmers have seen larger cash flows and a 
stabilization of loan security or collateral provided by real 
estate assets 
all regions including the economically hardhit delta and 
southern plains are likely to have less farm financial stress in 
1988 he said roughly 60 percent of loan default problems of 
commercial farmers were on primarily cropproducing farms at the 
start of 1987 
capital expenditures are picking up as cash flows improve and 
there is confidence in longrun profit potential in 1988 capital 
spending may increase by as much as 1 billion with spending for 
tractors and combines leading the list 
government spending on crop supports are easing as commodity 
prices increase direct government payments may decline 16 percent 
to 20 percent this year to between 13 billion and 15 billion

new zealand consumers like us peanuts if 
the price is right says the agriculture department 
the main competition is from australia india and china which 
provide peanuts for the table nut sector the department said 
in its april issue of foreign agriculture magazine but us 
splits are preferred by processors of peanut butter 
us peanuts are liked because they are mechanically harvested 
and are bought on the basis of a wellunderstood grading system 
the report said some improvement has occurred as a result of the 
rise of the new zealand dollar against the us dollar but the 
australian dollar also has dropped sharply against the new zealand 
currency 
moreover the report said us peanuts also face a 10 percent 
tariff in new zealand while there is no duty on imports from 
australia india and china

when it comes to clothing it turns out that 
single men buy more than single women 
but theyre buying a lot of it for the women not themselves 
researchers have found 
men also spend more than women on eating out entertainment 
alcoholic beverages tobacco and cars 
single women on the other hand spend more of their income on 
housing food eaten at home health care and reading material 
those are among the findings reported in the april edition of 
american demographics magazine 
while the study of spending by single people reported that the 
males spend more on clothing on average the difference rests 
entirely with men aged 55 to 64 
men aged 55 to 64 spent 1128 a year on apparel and services 
in 198485 compared with the 682 a year spent by the women in 
that group reported stephanie shipp 
much of that difference can be accounted for by mens 
purchasing of apparel as gifts almost 25 percent of the apparel 
budget of men goes toward gifts compared with 14 percent of the 
apparel budget of women she wrote 
more than half of the mens apparel gift purchases are for 
jewelry and watches and women are the likely recipients of many 
of those gifts reported shipp 
women outspent men on apparel in all other age groups but the 
one deviation was enough to pull average clothing spending for all 
single men above that of single women 735 to 657 she found 
shipp heads the analysis branch of the bureau of labor 
statistics division of consumer expenditure surveys her report is 
based on a study of spending by singles in 1984 and 1985 american 
demographics published by dow jones amp company concentrates on 
population and marketing 
while women have made gains in recent years they continue to 
trail men in income at all age groups shipp noted 
thus while women may spend less than men on some items that 
money may still represent a larger share of their resources than 
for males 
single men are more likely to be younger under age 35 while 
single women were more often aged 55 and over she found 
single women were more likely to own their own home 41 percent 
compared to 29 percent of men likely reflecting their older age as 
a group 
single men were found to devote 20 percent of their money to 
cars car repairs and other transportation costs while women spent 
17 percent of their income on transport 
after age 55 however women tended to spend slightly more than 
men on new cars and trucks shipp discovered 
single women spent twice as much as men on health care and that 
was not just because they tended to be older younger women also 
spend more on health than men in their age group 
at every age group men outspent women on entertainment 
perhaps because it is still the custom that men pay for dates

for a change theres no aura of crisis 
hanging over this weeks meetings of finance officials from 151 
nations a welcome development given the doomsday scenarios which 
sprang up following the stock market collapse last october 
the delegates to the spring meeting of the international 
monetary fund and the world bank will be wrestling with the 
longstanding problems of third world debt and huge trade 
imbalances as preliminary discussions get underway today in 
washington 
but six months ago many economists were predicting that the 
finance leaders would be facing the far more troubling prospect of 
a global recession triggered by the stock market plunge 
instead the world economy is growing at a faster rate than 
expected inflation is remaining subdued and the stock markets in 
the united states and other countries have regained much of the 
ground lost last fall 
for this reason analysts arent expecting any major policy 
changes to come out of the meeting wednesday between treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and his counterparts from japan west 
germany britain france italy and canada 
baker the mastermind behind some of the reagan administrations 
most successful economic initiatives is likely to urge a 
dontrocktheboat approach that will keep things on an even keel 
through the november presidential election 
in a speech last week baker boasted that significant 
progress had been made by the united states and its allies in 
promoting economic cooperation 
the seven largest industrial nations in the free world now 
have a coordination process firmly in place he said 
this will be the first meeting of the socalled group of seven 
since last september at that time unity and international 
economic cooperation were also the watchwords 
but behindthescenes disagreements between the united states 
and west germany over interest rates became public soon after the 
meeting unnerving investors and many believe contributing to the 
oct 19 stock market collapse 
the market collapse served as a strong reminder to finance 
leaders of the dangers in disharmony and on dec 22 they pledged to 
support the dollar at its current levels they then backed that 
pledge up by intervening in currency markets the process by which 
governments buy and sell currencies to influence their value 
since early this year the dollar has stabilized and the top 
industrial countries are expected to pledge anew this week to 
support that stability 
baker is also likely to push again for the other countries to 
adopt his idea of using an index of commodity prices including 
gold as one of indicators the countries use to measure the impact 
of their policies 
but some have been skeptical wondering if the proposal might be 
the first step to moving the world back to a gold standard for 
currencies something that was abandoned in 1973 when the current 
floating exchange rates were implemented 
baker denies that saying the commodity index would merely serve 
as a useful measure of inflationary pressures 
on third world debt the finance ministers are expected to 
basically reaffirm existing strategies although they may adopt some 
new approaches aimed at cutting the trilliondollar debt burden 
barber conable president of the world bank has taken the 
position that the burden on heavily indebted countries is becoming 
unsustainable and such initiatives as the recent mexican 
debtforbonds swap are needed if the debt crisis is ever to be 
resolved in that case mexico offered to exchange debt held by 
commerical banks in return for a reduced amount of mexican bonds 
which were backed by us treasury securities 
for his part baker has also endorsed efforts to find new ways 
of reducing the debt burden but he has opposed any broad 
debtrelief plans involving the world bank or the imf contending 
they would be too costly and would represent a bailout for big 
commercial banks

the american focus radio show and the 
college students who produce it are hardly household names but the 
guests heard on the program usually are 
jimmy carter henry fonda jerry falwell joan rivers carl 
sagan david letterman bob hope walter mondale julia child 
david rockefeller abba eban dan rather and norman mailer are 
among the hundreds of luminaries who have agreed to sit behind the 
mike 
the show one of the countrys largest nationally syndicated 
public affairs radio programs is the work of 30 princeton 
university students who have virtually no formal radio training and 
put the show together in their spare time 
even radio professionals are surprised when they learn the show 
is just a student activity 
its very professionally done i didnt know they were 
students they sounded like they have been in the field for quite 
some time said sean cort public affairs coordinator for wrksfm 
in new york city which broadcasts the program 
the weekly halfhour show features one guest and three to four 
student interviewers it boasts a network of 270 stations 
including outlets in all of the nations 50 largest radio markets 
for the most part the show is broadcast either sunday morning or 
night the time slots to which most public affairs programs are 
relegated 
the show is geared to adults not college students the program 
is not even heard on college radio stations 
for the most part our audience is not our peers its 
primarily adults said richard fitzgerald a junior whos 
executive producer 
rock stars we just dont think thats what our audience 
will appreciate when we do entertainers we go for the more 
established entertainers 
because a show may not be broadcast until three weeks after 
taping american focus doesnt try to break news 
it focuses on the guests view of the news and a little bit 
about the person their lives and things that have led them into 
what they are doing said the shows current president junior 
sofia perez 
but the show has made some headlines several years ago actor 
richard dreyfuss admitted while on american focus that he had 
used drugs dreyfuss also said he stopped using them after he was 
charged with possessing narcotics following a traffic accident 
a blownup copy of a los angeles times story crediting 
american focus with the scoop hangs in the shows offices in a 
creeky old house on the princeton campus 
sometimes the guests if they know we are college students 
they wont put up as much as a front than if we were 
professionals fitzpatrick said 
the show was founded in 1974 by a local high school student who 
pieced the initial programs together with scotch tape and 
stuff fitzpatrick said 
the first show with a relatively anonymous new jersey official 
as the guest could only be heard on a trenton radio station when 
the student garth ancier now an executive at fox broadcasting 
was accepted to princeton he bought the show with him initially 
producing it out of his dormitory room 
today the show still doesnt receive direct financial support 
from the university but it now has commercial sponsors who help 
pay its annual budget of 40000 to 50000 money left over is put 
back into the program because the enterprise is nonprofit

alike expect tuesdays caucuses in which both parties begin their 
delegate selection process to be relatively quiet events that offer 
no surprises 
tuesday night party regulars are scheduled to attend democratic

a prosecutor says he refused to reduce a 
felony charge against john zaccaro jr because there was plenty 
of evidence that the son of former vice presidential candidate 
geraldine ferraro was selling cocaine 
ferraro said she and her candidacy were partly to blame for her 
sons conviction saturday but blasted addison county states 
attorney john quinn for failing to accept a plea bargain 
quinn said he was reluctant because of the problem of drugs in 
society 
i recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37 
marijuana plants perhaps in some counties they might have reduced 
that but as time goes on i feel more strongly about drug cases 
quinn said sunday i just think its becoming more of a problem 
in the country and we need to deter that 
zaccaro 24 was convicted of selling onequarter gram of 
cocaine to an undercover officer at his offcampus apartment on 
feb 20 1986 he was a senior at middlebury college at the time 
no sentencing date has been set the felony conviction carries a 
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a 10000 fine 
at a news conference after the verdict ferraro said the family 
would appeal to the vermont supreme court 
we still believe he was set up she said 
ferraro blamed her son for possession of cocaine as well as 
herself and my candidacy for making my son a target she was 
the democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 
but she said quinn prolonged the agony for two years by not 
allowing zaccaro to plead to a lesser count of cocaine possession 
we as his parents would not allow him to plead guilty to 
the felony charge of selling cocaine ferraro said 
to me it was clearly a selling case said quinn who said 
the family first approached him about a pea agreement at zaccaros 
arraignment there was plenty of evidence he was selling i never 
considered a possession case and they know that 
he added if she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the 
charge thats her prerogative i didnt feel there was any 
justification for reducing the charge 
zaccaros defense lawyer charles tetzlaff had argued that his 
client was entrapped by a young inexperienced attractive female 
undercover police officer 
this is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct 
he told jurors 
but quinn called zaccaro a wellorganized drug dealer and said 
he was known on campus as the pharmacist because of his 
reputation as a dealer 
after zaccaros arrest middlebury college officials formed a 
task force to look at the campus drug problem after more than a 
dozen meetings it made 20 recommendations most of which were 
implemented by college trustees 
they included the hiring of a health educator publication of a 
drug brochure additional security staff and improved relations 
with the middlebury police 
most middlebury students questioned about the case said the 
outcome did not concern them my sophomore year it was more 
interesting but now half the people on campus werent even 
here said bob woithe a senior from palm island fla

jewish settlers rejected an army report saying 
an israeli teenager was killed by a settlers gun and demanded 
harsh punishment for a west bank village where they claim the girl 
was slain by arabs 
in another development palestinian leaders on sunday called for 
a commercial strike today in the occupied lands and demanded the 
resignation of arabs holding appointed or elected positions in the 
territories 
the occupied territories were quiet on sunday arab reports said 
troops closed shops and food markets in gaza strip which opened 
during morning hours 
since palestinians began violent protests against israeli rule 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip in early december 141 
arabs one israeli soldier and one israeli civilian have been 
killed 
the jewish settlers and rightwing legislators including some 
from prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc on sunday 
condemned the army after its report on the death of the teenager 
and demanded its chief of staff resign 
they urged tough sanctions on palestinian rioters including the 
expulsion of arab stonethrowers and called for the destruction of 
every home in beita the west bank village where 15yearold tirza 
porat was killed on wednesday 
israel television quoted the army report as saying miss porat 
was accidentally killed by the m16 rifle of roman al dubi a 
settlerguard who panicked and opened fire in all directions 
during the clash with arab rioters besides miss porat two arabs 
died in the melee and 15 people including 13 jewish teenagers 
and two arabs were wounded 
outraged settlers insisted miss porat was shot with a rifle by a 
masked arab and charged the jewish teenagers involved were not 
properly questioned 
the army said it has destroyed 13 houses belonging to inciters 
of last weeks clash and killed a 14yearold arab who tried to 
avoid arrest israels supreme court has barred the army from 
destroying any more homes in beita pending an appeal from a civil 
rights group 
the daily maariv reported on sunday that 150 villagers have been 
detained of whom 30 remained in custody 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and the army chief of staff lt 
gen dan shomron presented the armys version of the clash to the 
cabinet on sunday 
rabin said an army autopsy showed miss porat apparently was shot 
by a bullet from al dubis rifle israel radio reported al dubi 
and another adult settler were guarding the jewish teenagers 
during a hike 
a senior army official speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the fatal bullet came from al dubis weapon but said the 
army had not yet determined who fired the shot the hikers said al 
dubi only fired a single shot in the air while the group was inside 
beita 
i looked up and saw an arab man with a masked face shooting a 
rifle from a rooftop said ariel avivi a hiker 
geulah cohen a legislator from the nationalistic tehiya party 
demanded that shomron resign i think he simply failed he jumped 
to conclusions and acting as a judge pointed an accusing finger 
at the settlers she said on israel television on sunday 
the tv quoted likuds trade and industry minister ariel sharon 
as telling the cabinet that arabs who attacked the youths should be 
expelled their homes destroyed and a new jewish settlement 
established nearby 
shamirs political rival foreign minister shimon peres of the 
labor party defended the army cabinet ministers are not 
investigators and the cabinet is not a judge this should be left 
to competent authorities peres said 
shamir called for unity between all parts of the people 
for the good of the people and first of all for the security of 
the people 
a palestinian leaflet distributed on sunday in the occupied 
lands praised beita residents for responding twice as strongly to 
wild settlers and called on palestinians to make donations to 
beita on wednesday 
the leaflets repeated earlier calls for the resignation of arab 
officials in occupied territories and demanded that palestinians 
stop working in jewish settlements another leaflet called for a 
general strike today

education officials are urging congress to 
give them more time to rid the nations public and private schools 
of cancercausing asbestos 
the officials say there is insufficient money and trained 
manpower to meet this octobers asbestosinspection deadline set 
in 1986 by a congress upset with the slow pace of the battle 
against the deadly substance 
but groups representing teachers parents and school employees 
are opposing a deadline extension arguing that such a step is 
unwarranted and would prolong longterm health threats faced by 
millions of schoolchildren 
many local public school districts are incapable of 
compliance a hearing by two senate environment subcommittees was 
told recently by robert anderson representing the national school 
boards association 
by extending the deadlines congress will be sending a message 
to school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore or 
delay action on this serious health issue says ann lynch first 
vice president of the national pta 
once a common building material asbestos is dangerous when it 
becomes friable or crumbly friable asbestos releases the fibers 
that can cause a variety of respiratory ailments including lung 
cancer the fibers pose more threat to a childs lungs than to an

the du pont cos call for an eventual end to 
production of ozonedestroying chemicals has other producers 
scrambling to decide what they should do a competitor says 
only one of six other companies in the field in the united 
states pennwalt corp is following du pont so far in its march 25 
announcement that it believes that chlorofluorocarbon compounds 
cfcs and related compounds should be phased out soon 
the conclusions of dupont and pennwalt were prompted by a march 
15 report from a scientific panel organized by the national 
aeronautics and space administration that cfcs appear to have 
caused an average 23 percent decline in the earths protective 
ozone layer at northern midlatitudes between 1969 and 1986 
at the other end of the spectrum is great lakes chemical corp 
which says spokesman gregory j griffiths believes there is no 
reason to go beyond the international agreement endorsed by 31 
nations in montreal last fall 
so far ratified only by the united states and mexico the treaty 
calls for a 50 percent cut in cfc production by 1998 and a freeze 
on halons in 1992 
cfcs are used in the united states for refrigeration fluids 
cleaning solvents in electronics manufacture and foam blowing 
agents overseas cfcs are also used as aerosol propellants

a proposal to turn former federal prison 
alcatraz island into a casino crapped out in a newspaper survey of 
san francisco residents 
i hate to sound so californian but its just not good 
karma said one of those surveyed kathleen kelly 30 it is 
just a dumb idea 
the proposal an advisory measure on the june 7 ballot was 
opposed by a margin of 57 percent to 35 percent of the 600 people 
participating in the poll by the san francisco chronicle the 
newspaper reported today 
supervisors who placed proposition n on the ballot say a casino 
could generate millions of dollars for the debtplagued city 
several hurdles would have to be cleared first the city would 
have to acquire the land from the state the state constitution 
would have to be changed to allow casino gambling and numerous 
capital improvements would have to be made 
alcatraz known as the rock now is a popular attraction for 
tourists who want to take a peek at the former home of gangster al 
capone and other incorrigibles 
putting a casino on alcatraz would be like violating mount 
rushmore or ellis island said saundra neal a legal secretary 
who moved here from new york 18 months ago i think it is very 
beautiful its peaceful 
the idea of putting some kind of casino blight in the middle 
of the bay is really repulsive said jerry weiss flashing neon 
just seems like a stupid idea for the bay

sheba isnt a typical 6yearold just 
because she likes candy playing with the telephone and coloring 
sheba is a chimpanzee who knows how to count 
the chimp who lives at ohio state universitys animal 
laboratory here is one of only two monkeys in the world able to 
count and the only one that understands the concept of zero said 
sally boysen director of the labs primate cognition project 
boysen said last week she believes that ability is a major step 
forward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates and 
their similarities to those of humans 
boysen who said the ability to count objects involves a 
different cognitive process than learning languages was one of the 
participants in early studies that showed higher primates can learn 
language 
more than a decade ago koko a female gorilla and washoe a 
female chimp learned to use sign language to communicate with 
humans 
but counting is a new research goal and a hobby sheba indulges 
in when she is not playing with her keepers with the four other 
apes at the lab or with boysens dog schuyler who is her best 
friend 
the chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one is 
watching 
sheba a labborn chimp owned by the columbus zoo will appear 
on abctvs good morning america this week and is the subject 
of a people magazine story due out this month 
the surrogate motherdaughter relationship between boysen and 
sheba and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore the 
attention and get to work 
in a recent demonstration sheba was placed on the floor in 
front of a small rectangular yellow plate above that was placed 
plastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven mixed 
randomly boysen then placed four apples on the plate 
ok sheba were going to count some apples how many 
boysen asked sheba fighting a desire to mug for a photographer 
touched each apple then pointed to the number five and looked to 
boysen for approval 
you know that is not five apples try to tell me how many 
boysen said sheba counted again and pointed to the number seven 
it took another try and a hallway conference between boysen and 
sheba before the ape finally ignored the photographer and picked 
the correct number sheba was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of 
mampms and gumdrops 
boysen has worked with sheba for almost five years and says the 
association has been rewarding from the start even though sheba 
would rather be playing 
they have such a short attention span boysen said at 
first she wouldnt try at all but then she began to show us she 
could learn fast

more than three years after 11 young 
women were killed in the fort worth area only one of the crimes 
has been solved leads are down to a trickle and residents remain 
fearful 
the women killed from september 1984 until may 1985 included 
waitresses schoolteachers receptionists a bartender a student 
and a homemaker they died of stab wounds gunshots and 
strangulation one is missing and presumed dead 
it was on all our minds it was the conversation everywhere 
everyone was wishing that some of these women would be found 
said bernice barker 68 who lives across the street from the 
garage apartment where one victim lived 
a multiagency group spent more than a year investigating the 
deaths and at one point grew to more than 40 officers by july 
1985 the task force was reduced to 15 members in mid1986 police 
chief thomas windham returned officers to their regular assignments 
detectives conducted more than 3000 interviews and compiled a 
list of 7000 suspects including friends acquaintances and 
relatives of victims the investigation cost more than 1 million 
windham said 
the different slaying methods convinced police that more than 
one killer was responsible said capt ben dumas 
police today say they have suspects in three of the slayings but 
lack the evidence needed to file charges investigators sometimes 
spend time after work on the case in hopes of finding leads 
detective curt brannan says he often is led back to the spot 
where sarah ann kashka 15 disappeared he said he occasionally 
returns on the same night of the week she vanished to piece 
together where she headed after leaving a friends apartment 
when you go to a crime scene and see the things we do and 
talk to the family you know the family is depending on you its 
difficult to spend an eighthour shift working on the case put it 
down and go home brannan said 
miss kashka disappeared dec 30 1984 after spending the 
evening with friends she was found stabbed to death two days later 
near mountain creek lake in southwest dallas county 
the slaying of lisa griffin was the only one solved in october 
1985 michael wayne goodin of fort worth was convicted of her 
murder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison 
the reams of neatly packed information investigators collected 
provides little comfort to families homicide sgt paul kratz said 
youre talking to them several times a day kratz said 
you finally get to the point theres nothing new to tell them

officers is a drama set amid the gang wars of los angeles hopper 
wrote and directed colors

murder scene

distribution of the film or use some of its profits to support 
community organizations that combat gang violence said sliwa 
it wasnt known if hopper was home during the protest sliwa 
said some people were seen entering the house 
neither hopper nor orion officials could be reached for comment 
sunday about the protest by telephone hopper has said previously

a man sought for killing five people in maryland 
and one here is the sixth person to be arrested as a result of a tv 
program about the countrys most wanted fugitives according to 
police and the producers 
carl dunstrom 28 was seized after about 30 officers armed with 
shotguns and carbines surrounded a threestory building in the 
brooklyn section 
he was arrested in the buildings basement after a brief 
struggle on warrants issued in prince georges county md 
he was carrying a loaded 45caliber handgun and ballistics 
tests will be done to determine whether it was the murder weapon in 
the drugrelated killings homicide capt robert kinkaid said 
sunday 
the only shot fired during saturday nights raid came from an 
officers carbine but no one was hit so many officers 
participated in the raid because dunstrom was considered dangerous 
authorities said 
the raid followed a threeweek manhunt that began on a tip from 
a viewer of the television program americas most wanted 
authorities said 
dunstrom was wanted in five killings in the washington dc 
suburb of landover in january and one in brooklyn in november 
said kinkaid 
police are still seeking steve mcmillian 24 kirk bruce 25 
and an unidentified suspect in the jan 22 slayings in maryland of 
four men and a woman police said the two are members of jamaican 
drug organizations 
the maryland victims who police said had been involved in drug 
trafficking organizations since the early 1980s were shot in the 
head and chest with semiautomatic weapons while in an apartment 
one woman shot in the neck survived the attack 
the brooklyn victim patrick ford 17 thought to be a cousin 
of the suspect was found shot once in the head on nov 26 
we dont know the reason for the shooting he dunstrom is 
claiming it was an accident said kinkaid 
dunstrom was featured in a march 13 episode of the halfhour 
weekly series in which actors recreate real crimes and viewers are 
shown photographs and given information on fugitives and asked to 
provide tips they are promised confidentiality and sometimes 
rewards 
the program has been on the air only 10 weeks and shown on 
seven stations of the fledgling fox television network but because 
of praise from authorities it was moved to a primetime slot and 
starting sunday will be broadcast on all of the networks 118 
affiliated stations 
thomas r herwitz foxs vice president in charge of corporate 
and legal affairs said that of the 30 fugitives featured so far 
dunstrom was the sixth to be arrested five were seized as a result 
of viewers tips and one surrendered he said 
detective howard e shook who is leading the prince georges 
investigation said last week the show generated nearly 100 tips in 
the case

an unprecedented show of force against gang violence but an 
official said drugdealing gangs still rule the streets in parts of 
the nations secondlargest city 
a 15yearold boy was killed in a gangrelated shooting saturday 
night as the twoday police operation dubbed fly the flag wound 
down two others were killed in driveby shootings but there were 
no known gang connections 
nine people were wounded sunday night in a gangrelated shooting 
in willowbrook south of downtown said sheriffs detective javier 
clift none were seriously injured 
from what we understand the kids were playing outside he 
said none of these people are gang members theyre just 
innocent bystanders 
three gang members approached the residents outside a house and 
one of the three sprayed the group with gunfire clift said 
the violence that continued during the sweep by 1000 officers 
proves that gangs still have the run of the streets city 
councilman nate holden said 
it just goes to show you gang members just dont care 
holden said 
police began the twonight sweep friday night and arrested more 
than 1300 people about half suspected gang members on a variety 
of felony and misdemeanor charges police chief daryl gates even 
made one collar police were unsure how many people remained in 
custody early today 
about half the special police force formed by putting officers 
on four hours of voluntary overtime after a full eighthour shift 
went to augment regular patrols in the southcentral area where 
gangs are most active the rest of the officers spread out citywide 
the sweep was the departments largest attack ever on gangs 
which specialize in the sale and distribution of rock cocaine 
gangs are blamed for 205 killings in los angeles last year gang 
killings in all of los angeles county reached 387 last year 
during the operation officers stopped anyone who appeared to be 
a gang member by the way they were dressed and their alleged use of 
gang hand signals 
in nine previous sweeps which were smaller than fly the 
flag police deployed 200 to 300 officers at a time only in 
southcentral los angeles there were 1413 arrests in earlier 
sweeps 1124 gangrelated 
the latest crackdown was lauded by patricia patrick founder of 
the fledgling mothers against gangs in communities 
but the key is getting them off and keeping them off she 
said parents will have to help the police keep them off the 
streets

the soviet union has exploded six ss12 missiles 
that were removed from eastern europe under a superpower treaty to 
eliminate all landbased intermediaterange nuclear weapons radio 
moscow said today 
the missiles were exploded at a test site in southern 
kazakhstan a republic of soviet asia where they had been brought 
by train from east germany and czechoslovakia on feb 25march 13 
nuclear material was removed before the missiles were exploded the 
official radio said 
president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev signed an agreement in 
washington on dec 8 to eliminate the medium and shorterrange 
missiles which have a range of 300 to 3100 miles the ss12s have 
a range of 560 miles 
the treaty is awaiting ratification by the us senate and the 
presidium of the supreme soviet the soviet unions nominal 
parliament passage by both sides is considered a virtual certainty 
the first six soviet shorterrange missiles liable for 
scrapping under the inf treaty with the united states have been 
exploded at a test site in southern kazakhstan radio moscow said 
in an englishlanguage broadcast 
the explosions took place near the city of saryozek 125 miles 
north of the kazakhstan capital of alma ata radio moscow did not 
say when the missiles were destroyed and gave no indication when 
more missiles might be exploded 
it said that under the terms of the treaty the missiles 
launchers and all auxiliary equipment are to be destroyed 
krasnaya zvezda the defense ministry newspaper said in an 
article published on sunday that local residents were worried about 
possible environmental damage but that there was none 
the paper said an area of two miles around the missiles was 
considered a danger zone and that local people were warned far 
ahead of the blast 
it quoted alimbek seytbekov who was at work at a factory on the 
other side of a mountain about three miles from the blast as 
saying he heard the noise but noticed no other effect 
it is necessary to note here that the process of eliminating 
the missiles practically had no effect on the surroundings 
krasnaya zvezda said an analysis of the air conducted by 
specialists showed no harmful substances 
it said crews were given special training to destroy the 
missiles and that dismantling of the guidance systems was an 
especially dangerous job because of of the presence of explosive 
rocket fuels 
fiftyfour ss12 missiles were stationed at four sites in east 
germany soviet officials said in february that there had been 39 
missiles and 24 mobile rocket launchers deployed in czechoslovakia

china expressing displeasure at the 
attendance of the dalai lama pulled out of an international 
meeting of religious leaders and lawmakers discussing global 
problems the organizers said 
we worked hard to get the chinese here because we are

growth said the rev james parks morton a cochairman of the

morton dean of the episcopal cathedral of st john the divine

had earlier shown a willingness to attend the fiveday conference 
which was to open today 
but although we had no formal complaint from the chinese

an investigation into a small plane crash 
that killed the states leading republican gubernatorial candidate 
and his pilot has found no malfunctioning instruments federal 
officials said

64 died friday night when their cessna 310 twinengine plane 
crashed while attempting to land on instruments in a snow squall 
waltermire was returning home to helena from a candidates forum 
in glasgow 
the cause of the crash has not been determined 
so far theres really nothing nick wantiez of the federal 
aviation administration said sunday its probably going to be 
several days 
verlin tranter an investigator with the national transportation 
safety board said initial checks uncovered no malfunctioning 
instruments either on the ground or aboard the plane 
morris was an experienced pilot with more than 17000 hours of 
flight experience and was a highly regarded commercial and 
instrument flight instructor officials said 
waltermire was an often controversial figure who in eight years 
parlayed the backwater post of secretary of state into a highly 
visible state office and a launching platform for the governors 
chair 
two of his principal rivals for the republican nomination 
praised him 
he was a worthy contender for governor said former state 
sen stan stephens of havre rep cal winslow of billings called 
his death a great loss to montana both had debated waltermire 
in glasgow before his fatal flight 
gov ted schwinden recalled the 1962 plane crash death of gov

all candidates to put their safety and the requirements of their 
personal family ahead of political commitments he said 
montanas a tough state to fly he saidweve all had too 
many accidents weve lost a governor and now weve lost a 
gubernatorial candidate and a secretary of state which i think 
ought to emphasize the risks associated with pushing your luck in 
montana politics 
chuck brooke waltermires campaign manager said a wake would 
be held for waltermire tuesday night at the cathedral of st helena

a tollfree spy hotline that urges 
soldiers to report suspicious activity and colleagues who receive 
phone calls from people with foreign accents has fielded more than 
20000 calls an official said 
but william dwyer a civilian army employee who for the past 
year has run the nationwide hotline from a windowless room at forte 
meade says it has not led to any celebrated arrests 
i know for a fact that there are investigations ongoing 
dwyer said adding that the calls have sparked several espionage 
probes by the military and the fbi i have heard we have provided 
significant leads 
although the hot line 1800callspy is designed for army 
personnel across the country most callers are civilians dwyer 
said 
about 1 percent of the inquiries have provided worthwhile 
espionage or securityrelated tips which are passed on to federal 
investigators ranging from us army intelligence to the fbi he 
said 
its been effective said lt col john ooley a spokesman 
for the us army intelligence and security command in arlington 
va 
the hot line like any hot line is an excellent resource for 
people to report this type of activity fbi spokesman william 
carter said 
fliers advertising the hot line urge soldiers to watch for 
colleagues who receive calls from someone with a foreign accent 
or brag about james bondtype activities other telltale 
spy signs are a lot of unexplained money or odd requests for 
a manual document or plan 
the warnings might seem a bit melodramatic dwyer admitted 
sound stupid yeah he said but these are actual cases 
the american civil liberties union says it has concerns about 
the possibility of abuse 
its inviting mischief said jerry berman chief legislative 
counsel with the aclu in washington dc the allegations can 
have very serious consequences for someone 
dwyer conceded that the program might appear troublesome 
some people look at this and say my god big brother he 
said that is the furthest thing from our minds 
any information received over the phone is checked by several 
supervisors before it is sent to federal investigators he said

the number of households tuned to the 
jimmy swaggart ministrys weekly show dropped by 200000 in 
february 1988 compared to the previous year but it held on to the 
top spot among religious broadcasts according to a television 
rating service 
viewership for swaggarts weekly program dropped from 2161 
million households in february 1987 to 1961 million this year 
figures released by arbitron on saturday indicate 
it was on feb 21 that swaggart admitted to sinning against his 
wife and family in a tearful confession from the pulpit at his 
baton rouge family worship center although swaggart did not 
specify his sin it reportedly involved a new orleans prostitute 
the pentecostal minister resigned from the assemblies of god 
church on friday the same day national church officials moved to 
defrock him 
he said he was leaving the denomination because his 140 million 
per year ministry could not survive if he accepted a oneyear 
preaching ban imposed by national assemblies officials 
swaggart also said friday he would stay out of the pulpit until 
may 22nd in accordance with a threemonth preaching ban proposed by 
the assemblies louisiana elders he led the choir in his baton 
rouge church on sunday but did not offer a sermon 
how swaggarts television ministry has been affected by the 
scandal will be more accurately measured when new arbitron figures 
for may are released this summer 
in februarys ratings his daily program a study in the word 
fell from 410000 households to 323000 households it is rated 
no10 in religious programming the results show 
swaggarts audience fell by 200000 households or 10 percent 
during the year for the weekly program and by 87000 households or 
22 percent on a daily basis according to arbitron 
most of the top ten television evangelists lost ground during 
the oneyear period no3 world tomorrow was the only top ten 
show that grew from 114 million households last year to 1286 
million this year 
the moral majority leader jerry falwells show dropped 40 
percent the ptl program once hosted by defrocked assemblies of 
god minister jim bakker and his wife tammy did not crack the top 
20 it was rated no 18 in november 1987 when the last ratings 
were taken 
television is the primary source of revenue for swaggarts 
ministry and the endeavor on which the most money is spent the 
ministrys own figures show it spends twice as much money on 
television time as on foreign missions 
ministry literature which claimed a worldwide viewership of 510 
million in 1986 now claims 300 million 
in midmarch swaggarts wife frances and son donnie hosted a 
weeklong telethon during which they begged viewers to send money 
or use their credit cards to make donations to keep the baton 
rougebased ministry alive

the 129 men who died 25 years ago in the 
nations worst submarine disaster did not die in vain the son of 
one of the victims said at a memorial service 
many many lives have been saved because those guys gave their 
lives said neil collier at sundays service his father died 
aboard the uss thresher which failed to surface from a deep dive 
off the new england coast on april 10 1963 
the 275yearold north church was decorated sunday with easter 
lilies and a model of the nuclear submarine the navy said could 
dive deeper and go faster than any other sub in the fleet 
cmdr lawrence shoberg a navy chaplain reminded more than 800 
relatives and friends of the dead how thresher left portsmouth 
naval shipyard for sea trials 220 miles off the new england coast 
no scar was visible on the surface of the restless ocean to 
show where she sank shoberg said but there would be scars 
scars on the hearts of parents without children wives without 
husbands children without fathers 
as the sub sank water pressure crushed the hull killing all the 
men on board threshers remains lie more than a mile down on the 
ocean bottom 
retired rear adm dean axene who commanded the thresher until 
three months before the tragedy shared the task of breaking news 
of the deaths to the families on april 10 1963 
axene said sunday that the thresher in his mind remains a 
mighty ship manned by a mighty crew still sailing the sea 
she was intended to reach a new peak of perfection and she 
did but the price was very high axene said 
a navy board concluded the subs problems probably started with 
a leak in saltwater piping the board said water had shorted out 
electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor leaving the 
submarine powerless 
the navy developed a program that included stricter construction 
methods design improvements testing for saltwater piping and more 
initial shallowwater sea trials 
collier read the names of the dead at sundays service which 
included a 40minute choral requiem accompanied by harp and violin 
when the twohour memorial ended the marines offered a 21gun 
salute outside the church while the shipyard sounded a 21cannon 
salute and churches tolled their bells 
while some cried as they left the church many people hugged and 
chatted with friends they hadnt seen in years 
joan lyman of san antonio texas lost her husband john in the 
tragedy 
she attended services with another widow edna dinola of rye 
nh 
the people from thresher are my extended family said lyman 
who has not remarried theyre your support group weve been 
through it all together

although president reagan has not been a 
handson leader in the irancontra affair he will be able to 
handle soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev if push comes to shove at 
the summit in moscow former president richard m nixon said today 
ronald reagan can certainly handle him as a heavyweight 
provided ronald reagan has the kind of advice he as a leader should 
have as president of the united states provided he is 
wellbriefed nixon said in the second of four consecutive days 
on nbc 
in an hourlong interview on the networks meet the press 
show sunday nixon said the president should pardon john m 
poindexter and oliver l north if he believes they engineered the 
irancontra deal to serve the presidency 
nixon said that he regrets not absolving his own advisers for 
their role in the watergate scandal 
appearing on nbctvs today program this morning nixon said 
there is no question there has been a tendency to underestimate 
reagan because he sometimes forgets something or doesnt handle 
press conferences well 
but nixon said reagan proved he could handle gorbachev at 
their summit in reykjavik iceland when he finally said no when 
it was a bad deal 
with what happened in the irancontra thing certainly he was 
not hands on said nixon he is hands on where it really 
matters 
the former president had stressed the necessity for such a 
leader in his new book 1999 which he is promoting with the 
television apperances and other interviews 
nixon said the most significant foreign policy achievement of 
the reagan administration will be the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan because it is the first time the soviet union 
has withdrawn forces from a country it invaded without soviet 
troop support he said he doubts afghanistans communist 
government can survive 
nixon who will be appear again on today tuesday and 
wednesday discussed possible pardons for poindexter and north 
sunday in the most extensive of the interviews 
the former president who was driven from office in 1974 by 
watergate said reagan should ask himself did these two men do 
what they did believing whether mistakenly or not that they had 
the approval of the president or were acting in order to serve his 
interests and would get that approval 
if the president after considering that believes that that 
was the case then he the president would have a good case for 
pardoning because then the socalled crime would lack in intent 
nixon said 
poindexter the former national security adviser and north who 
served as a national security council aide face charges of 
conspiring to divert proceeds of usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels at a time when congress banned military aid to 
the contras 
reagan has made several comments indicating he believes his 
former aides did nothing illegal and suggesting that he is 
favorably inclined toward pardons but his official position on the 
subject remains one of neutrality according to white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
nixon said that in the early 1970s he asked himself about 
pardoning former advisers hr haldeman and john d ehrlichman 
both were convicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of 
justice and served time in prison 
i probably should have pardoned them nixon said im not 
sure that the country would have taken it at that time it was a 
little stirred up as you might imagine but on the other hand 
they had not done it for personal gain 
the former president said personal gain also was not a 
consideration in the irancontra affair 
on meet the press the 75yearold nixon also was questioned 
about attorney general edwin meese iii usisrael relations and 
vietnam 
on meese who is under investigation nixon said there are 
three points for the president to consider 
one is he an honest man and two has he been a competent 
attorney general and three is he a political liability i 
think he is an honest man as far as the second matter is 
concerned president reagan believes hes a competent attorney 
general in carrying out his conservative agenda the third point 
however is the one youre really addressing and that is is he a 
political liability and thats something only he reagan can 
answer 
on usisrael relations the problems in the mideast are so 
complex that it cant be done by the secretary of state on a 
parttime basis there has to be the appointment of a fulltime 
heavyweight negotiator and that appointment should be made to 
henry kissinger now henry is devious henry is difficult some 
people think hes obnoxious but hes a terrific negotiator and i 
would suggest that the next president be it michael dukakis or 
george bush would be welladvised to give him the title of 
ambassador plenipotentiary give him a year and he will work out 
some settlement 
on vietnam i would say the major mistake i made as president 
was not doing early in 1969 what i did on may 3 of 1972 and on 
dec 15 of 1972 and that was to bomb and mine north vietnam 
if we had done that then i think we would have ended the war in 
vietnam in 1969 rather than in 1973

a twostate publichealth alert for 
pesticidecontaminated cucumbers is in effect in washington and 
oregon following illness in two seattlearea families 
the cucumbers contaminated with aldicarb were distributed by 
wholesalers to grocers in those two states and possibly northern 
california and idaho said roger lowell district director for the 
us food and drug administration in seattle 
symptoms of the infected cucumbers include nausea vomiting and 
diarrhea within one hour of eating usually within 30 minutes 
lowell said sunday other symptoms can include blurred vision 
excessive sweating and muscle twitching 
lowell said officials were unaware of any permanent health 
damage adding that the symptoms pass quickly like influenza in 
fact he said many people in the area who thought they had the flu 
in the last week may have actually been suffering from the 
pesticide 
both cucumberrelated illnesses were in the seattle area said 
frank mendizabal of the department of social and health services 
the health alerts in oregon and washington took effect saturday 
although no illnesses were reported in oregon 
the cucumbers are european style 12 to 18 inches long and about 
1 inches in diameter with pointed ends they are wrapped in clear 
unlabeled plastic lowell said 
any skinny cucumbers without labels are considered suspect said 
lowell but those with a brandname label showing they were grown 
elsewhere are considered safe 
the cucumbers were grown in hothouses in northern california by 
barnard hydroponic of redding and distributed by blue anchor inc 
of sacramento lowell said 
bruce barnard an owner of barnard hydroponic refused to 
comment in a sunday telephone interview from his home in redding 
calif saying he wanted to talk with fda officials first 
aldicarb is used to treat soil before crops are grown and is 
used mostly for nonfood crops including cotton use of the 
pesticide on growing food products is illegal lowell said

harassment by white college students and cold 
shoulders from white professors are among the problems reported by 
black students who attend predominantly white schools 
they just dont want us there michelle dye said of her 
white peers at abraham baldwin agricultural college she was among 
those attending a seminar on issues facing black students at white 
schools 
ive been fighting since my first quarter she said 
recalling how she was shot in the leg with a bb gun while walking 
by a mens dorm on the south georgia campus its pathetic to go 
through that kind of stuff while youre trying to get an 
education 
at louisiana state university of new orleans a white fraternity 
displayed a rebel flag last year during the martin luther king jr 
day parade on campus according to student frederick barrow 
in an era when many blacks attend predominantly white 
institutions such racial incidents are not unusual according to 
more than 300 students and faculty from 14 states who participated 
in the georgia state university seminar the seminar ended saturday 
statistics from the southern regional education board show that 
more than 66 percent of the nations 108 million black college 
students now attend predominantly white institutions 
more than a dozen traditionally black colleges have closed in 
the last two decades and still others are being merged with white 
institutions 
at the seminar some black students complained that white 
faculty members didnt devote enough time to them 
its sad when you see the professor has time to talk with 
white students after class but when a black approaches that same 
professor then all of a sudden he has to rush off to his office 
that really hurts said kevin brown a senior at georgia 
southwestern college in americus 
almost all students agreed that what they needed most was more 
black faculty members even at schools where there are black 
faculty students say there are too few 
at the university of north carolina at greensboro said student 
madeline shaw there are only 10 black faculty members out of 
500 and out of the 10 only two are tenured 
some black faculty at white institutions say black students need 
advice on how to cope with racial stress 
i try to get across to them that there is racism and its not 
going to go away not in their lifetime said black staff member 
dr cleon arrington associate vice president of research at gsu 
but what they can do to cope with it is to strive for excellence 
not mediocrity only by being better than their white counterparts 
will they have an equal share of the rewards 
some whites feel that advances in race relations are gradually 
coming about 
for the most part my generation is less bigoted than 
generations past said doug tudor student president at old 
dominion but its hard for some white students to overcome 
racist attitudes if they were raised in a bigoted manner 
ms shaw said negative racial attitudes can not be corrected by 
students alone one of the first steps to eliminating racism on 
campuses is for the administration to take an official stand 
against racist behavior of any kind 
although integration has been urged by the national association 
for the advancement of colored people some black students fear 
they are losing part of their heritage 
its just another way whites are trying to take away some of 
our black culture said todd dunn a senior at georgia 
southwestern 
dunn and some fellow black students at georgia southwestern 
recently organized the concerned students association after a white 
professor was accused by a black female student of calling her a 
black bitch 
in the days after the incident 100 members of the association 
occupied the campus administration building last wednesday the 
students protested at a weekly assembly meeting because towery was 
suspended with pay rather than fired

the united nations today accused 
the reagan administration of violating a un treaty by trying to 
close the plo mission in new york 
the united nations has asked the world court for an opinion on 
whether the us government must accept arbitration in the dispute 
which emanates from antiterrorist legislation signed by president 
reagan last december 
that law which classifies the palestine liberation organization 
as a terrorist group and bars it from operating on us territory 
led the united states to order the closing of the plo mission to 
the united nations a maneuver condemned by all un member nations 
except the united states and israel 
the un secretarygeneral has the strong desire to avoid 
any confrontation with the host country a un 
undersecretarygeneral carlaugust fleischhauer of west germany 
told the world court today 
but he stressed that the united nations urges the court to 
declare that indeed there is an obligation to the united states 
to submit the dispute to independent arbitration 
fleischhauers remarks came during a 90minute world court 
hearing neither the united states nor the plo was officially 
represented at the session 
in a recent letter to the world court john shad us 
ambassador to the netherlands said his government does not 
believe arbitration would be appropriate because the case is 
now before a us court 
the plo is unable to plead its case here because only nation 
states and un bodies are entitled to appear before the world 
court 
the world court officially known as the international court of 
justice is the uns 15member judicial branch it has no 
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
rulings 
in the case now under consideration the united nations claims 
the united states is required to accept arbitration in the matter 
under a 1947 accord between the world body and the truman 
administration 
under that pact known as the headquarters agreement disputes 
between the us government and the united nations arising from the 
un presence in the united states must be settled by arbitration 
the accord calls for a threemember arbitration panel made up 
of one member appointed by the un secretarygeneral one 
appointed by the us government and one chosen by mutual consent 
although the accord does not specifically mention missions the 
united nations maintains its rules concerning the unhindered 
functioning of diplomats accredited to its headquarters in new york 
also apply to the missions of member nations and organizations with 
observer status 
the plo was granted nonvoting observer status at the united 
nations in 1974 it has maintained an office in manhattan since 
then 
several weeks ago the us justice department filed suit in 
us district court in new york after the plo refused to close its 
office there the plo was expected to respond in the us case 
today and the united nations was expected to file a brief 
supporting the plo position 
the us boycott of the world court proceedings marks the second 
time in four years that the reagan administration has refused to 
take part in one of its cases 
the us government claimed the court had no authority to handle 
a complaint against it filed in 1984 by nicaragua and boycotted the 
last 17 months of the proceedings in that case the world court 
ultimately ruled in favor of nicaragua and ordered the united 
states to halt its support for the contra rebels fighting 
nicaraguas sandinista government

harvey joined the z channel in 1980 and was credited with 
attracting an influential entertainment industry audience to the

scott air force base officials 
are planning to knock down a recently renovated building and make a 
parking lot despite workers complaints that the air force is 
wasting money 
workers and the president of the union representing civilian 
employees at scott criticized the air force for sinking 161000 
into a building they planned to demolish 
but 1st lt jerry lobb a base spokesman said building 1522 was 
renovated earlier this year to improve working conditions because a 
specific date to tear down the building had not yet been set 
the building is near a 19 million air force communications 
command facility that is under construction and targeted for 
completion in june 1989 said staff sgt jerry anderson another 
base spokesman 
lobb said building 1522 now used as office space would be 
razed at some point to provide room for parking space for the new 
command center 
carl denton president of local r723 of the national 
association of government employees said union officials 
questioned the need for the renovation during meetings with base 
management to discuss moneysaving measures 
theres nothing you can do if theyve already spent money 
once its spent its gone so we concentrated on things that could 
be avoided but this kind of project is what we said was work 
that was not necessary denton said

people seem to be drinking less and they worry 
about alcohol more but health researchers disagree about what it 
means 
overall theres a clear trend in the direction of 
moderation said jay winsten director of the center for health 
communication at the harvard school of public health 
in terms of social mores the public message used to be that 
its cool to get smashed now its dumb to get drunk 
the cutback in consumption grows in part from recent court 
rulings in some states recognizing host liability for drunken 
guests he told the boston globe 
legal deterrence is a major factor in the moderation but i 
think it goes beyond that he said there is just much more 
informal social pressure not to drink as much 
but dr henry wechsler associate executive director of the 
medical foundation in boston said the move to curb excess involves 
a limited part of society 
i still think we have a sixpack syndrome out there in much of 
our society and the data is there to support it he said 
alcohol consumption has dropped but not markedly and young 
people are drinking as much as ever 
massachusetts legislator rep suzanne bump filed legislation 
last week to put warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers in 
the state 
the bottom line is that alcohol is still the nations drug of 
choice and a major health problem especially among young people 
she said 
a recent gallup poll showed that the number of adults who 
believe that alcohol is a problem in their homes has doubled since 
1974 to 24 percent 
in 1980 per person consumption was 25 gallons of liquor 26 
gallons of wine and 307 gallons of beer in 1985 liquor use 
dropped to 22 gallons beer eased off to 296 gallons but wine 
consumption rose to 29 gallons 
eddie burke coowner of doyles an irish pub in boston said 
the bar now sells five cases of nonalcoholic beer weekly while 
three years ago there were no takers 
people are just drinking less although theyre drinking more 
of the quality stuff burke said adding that his bartenders now 
shut off patrons more quickly

wood storks have come home to roost in southern 
florida but but naturalists are worried that the endangered birds 
wont have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season 
summer deluges at the storks two major ancestral breeding 
grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the fish the birds rely 
on for food they explained 
last week 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at corkscrew 
swamp sanctuary a national audubon society refuge about 20 miles 
north of naples that was once the primary storknesting area in 
north america another 75 pairs have taken up residence at 
everglades national parks cuthbert island 
the two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by 
north americas sole species of stork a giant white bird with an 
ironblack head 
we are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers said 
paul hinchcliff chief naturalist at corkscrew whether or not 
theres enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge 
enough young remains to be seen 
almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have 
ended disastrously said john ogden who heads a wood stork study 
team at everglades national park if they are unable to feed 
offspring parent birds will abandon the colony leaving hundreds 
of crying young birds to starve 
wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers 
at corkscrew since 198485 when 353 pairs of birds successfully 
raised 530 young fifty years ago it was common to see 6000 to 
8000 pairs of storks nesting in the grayboughed cypress trees 
since the early 1960s however storks have been spurning 
corkscrew in favor of central and northern florida and other 
southern states between 1960 and 1980 the wood stork nesting 
population at corkscrew dropped by 75 percent 
the renewed corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the 
total us stork population estimated at 4000 
historically storks came to corkscrew by the tens of thousands 
to nest in early winter leaving plenty of time to rear offspring 
before the onset of rain 
but human activity disrupted the annual cycle of highwater 
summers and lowwater winters in floridas wetlands much of the 
area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during 
the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions the 
birds have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the 
deeper waters of the interior everglades to drop low enough for 
them to efficiently feed 
as result nesting is delayed and this years young wont be 
ready to leave their nests until about midjuly ogden said

parents are sewing identification labels 
into their childrens clothing teenage girls are heading home 
early and volunteers are sifting through the desert sands looking 
for more bodies after finding six young women buried in shallow 
graves 
residents in northeastern el paso are dealing with the slayings 
of the six young women ages 14 to 24 in many ways while the 
citys police chief calls on residents to be careful not alarmed 
in response far fewer young women can be found loitering around 
bars convenience stores and motels even on warm spring nights 
the slayings brought it home to them that maybe theyre not 
invulnerable says rebecca wylie head counselor at parkland high 
who consoled friends of 14yearold dawn smith a parkland dropout 
whose remains were discovered oct 20 
theyre more careful about walking out by themselves theyre 
more conscious about coming home by their curfew ms wylie said 
the killings also inspired a community group to give elementary 
school children identification cards to be sewn into their clothing 
or laced into their shoes 
one thing weve noticed in seeing pictures of grave sites or 
even auto accidents is that there is always a shoe at the scene 
said stan roberts president of the northeast el paso civic 
association which ordered 10000 tags for students 
the police investigation centers around the deaths of angelica 
jeanette frausto 17 karen baker 20 maria rosa casio 24 
desiree wheatley 15 ivy susanna williams 23 and miss smith 
frausto was last seen behind a tavern in northeast el paso 
baker was last spotted getting into a car at a motel on the same 
street her body and casios were found sept 4 buried among 
creosote bushes in the desert 18 miles northeast of el paso 
since then the bodies of the four other young women were found 
in shallow graves in the same litterstrewn patch of desert police 
are almost certain the women were victims of the same killer but 
refuse to discuss most aspects of the case 
david leonard wood a convicted sex offender was described as a 
possible suspect in the case by a detective testifying at woods 
rape trial 
wood 30 who had been jailed since his oct 23 arrest on the 
rape charge was convicted last month and sentenced to 50 years for 
his fourth sex crime conviction 
his victim testified that he kidnapped her last summer took her 
to an area near where the bodies were later found and started 
digging a hole when he heard voices he took the woman across the 
street raped her and left her naked in the desert 
about a month after that attack the first body that of casio 
was discovered by a utility employee digging at the site police 
searched the area that day and found ms bakers remains about 50 
yards away 
police scoured a 10squaremile area with borrowed heatsensing 
equipment mounted on airplanes the department of corrections also 
provided dogs to sniff for more bodies on oct 20 the dogs found 
the remains of miss smith and miss wheatley within a halfmile of 
the first two 
on nov 2 police using dogs found the remains of miss frausto 
police gave up searching a few weeks later saying they were 
confident they had found all the bodies buried in the area 
but on march 14 the first day of woods rape trial a pair of 
aluminumcan collectors stumbled upon the bones of ms williams 
the last two victims were not among three young women from 
northeast el paso and neighboring chaparral nm who are listed 
by police as missing 
last weekend more than 300 searchers failed to unearth more 
bodiesvolunteers carrying shovels and pitchforks included 
soldiers jail guards police officers sheriffs deputies and 
reserves fire marshals and chaplains 
deputy police chief gus massey said although no bodies were 
found they may go back and do it over and over again next 
weekend

pakistan began three days of official 
mourning today after an ammunition depot blast that officials said 
killed 93 people and wounded 1100 newspapers today reported more 
than 100 dead 
hundreds of people who lived close to the army depot located 
between islamabad and rawalpindi remained unaccounted for after 
sundays blast 
pakistan radio broadcast appeals for missing people and prime 
minister mohammad khan junejo ordered the removal of dangerous 
ordnance from populated areas 
pakistanis repaired their cinderblock houses or sifted through 
the ruins in search of salvageable household goods rescuers 
continued their search for victims 
police and army troops patrolled the dusty streets as entire 
families roamed the worsthit areas to view the damage and search 
for loved ones 
officials said about 100 bomb disposal teams were clearing an 
estimated 6500 different kinds of projectiles that lay strewn 
among the two cities 
president mohammad zia ulhaq today refused to speculate on the 
cause of a fire which reportedly ignited the ammunition dump 
between the twin cities of islamabad and rawalpindi showering both 
with rockets grenades and artillery shells 
as to reports that the ordnance was earmarked for afghan moslem 
insurgents zia said its nothing but speculation a high 
measure of speculation 
eyewitnesses reported seeing burning trucks near the depot 
bearing afghan license plates 
pakistan backs the guerrillas in their struggle against kabuls 
marxist government and the estimated 115000 soviet troops who back 
it it also serves as a conduit for us military aid to the 
insurgents 
zia said the dead included seven army soldiers he said 60 
percent of the total number of wounded had been treated and 
released 
official sources said the blast was caused by a fire but western 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they had heard 
reports of a possible military coup attempt some embassies said 
they received anonymous telephone calls warning of a terrorist 
bombing shortly before the facility blew up 
the explosions which occurred during morning rush hour sunday 
sent missiles and grenades slamming into buildings buses and cars 
in the capital and the adjacent city of rawalpindi 
the initial blast flattened most buildings within 200 yards of 
the depot and sprayed shrapnel and unexploded projectiles for more 
than a sixmile radius 
there were no reports of casualties among the estimated 25000 
foreigners who live in the capital 
also sunday eight people were killed in a fire at an arms 
factory near lahore 140 miles south of islamabad and three people 
were injured by a bomb that exploded in karachi 650 miles 
southwest of islamabad authorities said those two incidents 
appeared unrelated to the disaster in islamabad 
in india riots broke out today when mobs of students tried to 
close shops in northern kashmir state to show sympathy for the 
victims of sundays explosion at the ammunition depot 
the united news of india reported that scores were injured when 
police clashed with the students 
the news agency said the mobs set fire to an army jeep burned 
down a liquor store and stoned passing vehicles 
india and pakistan have fought three wars two of them over 
kashmir some of the moslems who predominate in kashmir state 
want to unite with pakistan 
there have been numerous explosions and bomb attacks in pakistan 
during the past two years that have killed about 300 people and 
injured hundreds 
the government frequently has blamed attacks on agents of 
afghanistans communist government which has denounced pakistani 
support of afghan rebels 
many bombings have also occurred during violent demonstrations 
by opposition parties demanding the resignation of president zia 
the ammunition dump is located at faizabad crossing near the 
capitals border with rawalpindi army troops and riot police were 
deployed around islamabad to seal off dangerous roads and prevent 
panic 
one of the dead was identified as a lawmaker and former minister 
of production and public works khaqan abbasi whose car was hit by 
a rocket 
islamabad is a city of 500000 built during the 1960s to replace 
karachi as the capital in addition to government buildings it 
contains about 85 foreign embassies and several offices of un and 
other international relief agencies

panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
today was quoted as saying he would really rather be somewhere 
else but that he was fighting an american attempt to control 
panama 
ah yes noriega was quoted as telling the paris newspaper le 
monde in an interview published today i would like to be 
somewhere else he did not say where 
although noriega is ready to leave panama the newspaper said 
he is not ready to be pushed out 
foreigners have trouble understanding our mentality noriega 
was quoted as saying it is a struggle that we have been waging 
for a long time against the american presence here it is not a 
personal fight but that of a people and a nation it is the 
destiny of a country that is at stake 
le monde said noriega is convinced that president reagan who 
always opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the panama canal to 
panama wants to reclaim the canal 
the attitude of the united states is very suspect the 
general was quoted as saying we began to have problems with it 
from the moment we denounced violations of the treaties when we 
defended an independent third world nonaligned policy on the 
international scene and above all when we refused to participate 
in a military intervention in nicaragua to overthrow the sandinista 
regime 
he said washington wants to rewrite history cancel the 
treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing 
social achievements 
asked if his departure would not put an end to the crisis and 
ease the suffering of the panamanian people noriega said i 
refuse to answer that question he said if the people are 
suffering it is because of the united states not me 
he brushed aside questions about his role in the drug trade 
the problem is not here he said it is in the united 
states the united states is the consumer country it is there that 
the drugs are paid for there are drugproducing countries and 
there are consumer countries the other countries like panama are 
passage routes 
the general agreed that panamas liberal financial laws make it 
easy for drug transactions but he said the money was not 
invested here therefore you cannot say that the laundering of 
this drug money is done here we were only a step in the process 
controlled by the united states 
he said the united states was behind making panama a banking 
center and it is they who have decided to dismantle it

an opposition leader forced into 
exile by gen manuel antonio noriega left for venezuela after 
calling on panamanians to step up protests designed to oust the 
strongman 
in another development doctors and pharmacists on sunday said a 
lack of dollars brought on by us economic sanctions has caused a 
medicine shortage and broad cuts in hospital services in panama 
the opposition leader carlos ernesto gonzalez de la lastra in 
a letter released before he left sunday evening urged panamanians 
to organize your family your street your neighborhood and 
protest 
when you decide to protest in all the streets of all the 
cities of the panamanian isthmus and decide to do it every day we 
will reach victory 
the opposition leader was freed on thursday after being 
imprisoned for 10 days following his arrest during an antinoriega 
march he led in panama city 
gonzalez de la lastra 49 faced a long prison term on a 
sedition charge filed by the government last summer if he did not 
accept exile 
in the past week several announced antinoriega demonstrations 
either drew few participants or were stopped before they began by a 
heavy police presence 
gonzalez de la lastra is one of 35 leaders of the national civic 
crusade an opposition organization of 200 business labor 
professional and political groups seeking noriegas ouster 
sundays departure was the second time the opposition leader had 
been sent into exile he lived in venezuela for two years after 
gen omar torrijos noriegas predecessor ordered gonzalez de la 
lastra into exile in 1976 
in an interview published today noriega was quoted as saying 
that he would rather be somewhere else than panama but that he was 
fighting an american attempt to control panama 
ah yes the general was quoted as telling the paris 
newspaper le monde i would like to be somewhere else he did 
not specify where 
le monde said noriega is convinced that president reagan who 
opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the panama canal to panama 
wants to take back the canal 
he said washington wants to rewrite history cancel the 
treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing 
social achievements 
several other leaders of the antinoriega protests that began in 
june 1987 went into exile in september after warrants were issued 
for their arrests 
ricardo arias calderon president of panamas christian 
democratic party was barred from the country when he tried to 
return from a business trip on feb 25 he was allowed back in at 
the end of march 
on saturday arias calderon called for an international boycott 
that goes beyond existing us sanctions to press for an end to the 
noriega regime 
noriega as head of the 15000member defense forces is the 
power behind the civilian government last february a federal 
grand jury in florida indicted noriega on drug trafficking charges 
the united states imposed economic sanctions on panama after 
noriega rejected washingtons demands that he resign and leave the 
country 
panama uses the american dollar as its currency us sanctions 
include freezing panamas dollar deposits in us banks 
withholding payments to the panama canal commision and most 
recently prohibiting american companies and citizens from paying 
taxes to the panamanian government 
the taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed 
president eric arturo delvalle ousted by the national legislature 
on feb 26 after he tried to fire noriega the united states still 
recognizes delvalle as president 
with the most recent sanctions against panama some american 
businessmen have said they can be fined and jailed in the united 
states for paying taxes to the government and be closed down by 
panama if they dont 
i think were going to see a lot of closings of american 
companies in panama said one businessman speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the economic crisis caused by the sanctions has prompted the 
medicine shortage and hospital cutbacks doctors and pharmacists 
said on sunday 
elective surgery xrays and laboratory tests have been 
postponed the sources said at the bella vista clinic doctors 
said the staff has been cut from 92 to 30 one pharmacist said he 
was out of many medicines including some antibiotics and heart 
medicines the sources spoke on condition of anonymity

democratic presidential contender jesse jackson tackled a 
sensitive issue in new yorks key primary by saying he would not 
meet again with palestine liberation organization chief yasser 
arafat rival albert gore jr who is playing up his own strong 
support for israel said today he must finish strong in new york 
for his campaign to continue 
the new york primary with its prize of 255 delegates is eight 
days away and all three democrats were stumping in the state 
today the trio had three debates scheduled this week their first 
fullscale faceoffs since last months super tuesday campaign 
vice president george bush bidding to stay in the spotlight 
although he virtually has the republican nomination wrapped up was 
beginning three days of campaigning in new york today bushs only 
remaining rival pat robertson has all but abandoned his effort 
gore said he will remain in the race through the national 
convention in july but must turn in a convincing performance in 
the primary 
were running to win here but at a minimum we have to have a 
finish that convinces you that well gore did it he has the 
momentum he has the strength to go on the tennessee senator 
said on cbs this morning 
michael dukakis the democratic frontrunner spent sunday at 
home in boston celebrating the greek orthodox easter with his 
family jackson visited harlem while gore campaigned in a heavily 
jewish part of brooklyn 
jackson who has been criticized by jewish leaders for meeting 
with arafat was asked sunday whether he would do so again 
i would not and its not necessary to do that he said on 
cbs face the nation 
jackson said today in new york it would not be a good 
approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements 
thats a formula for catastrophe 
he added in this city some of your top palestinian leaders 
in the world live some of your top jewishamerican and proisraeli 
leaders live here we should begin to talk here to implore both 
sides to a higher level of security 
in the interview on sunday jackson went out of his way to be 
conciliatory toward gore 
in recent days gore has blasted jacksons lack of government 
experience and his foreign policy views and said the nation needs 
a president not a preacher 
jacksons mild rejoinder on sunday well both of us went to 
seminary 
asked if gores remarks had been unfair jackson said no i 
think that al gore has too much character to be categorically 
unfair 
gore for his part praised jackson for saying he wouldnt sit 
down with arafat 
the statement jesse jackson made this morning was very 
constructive thats a change in his position i believe the 
tennessee senator said as he campaigned in brooklyn 
gore appearing in heavily jewish neighborhoods picked up the 
endorsement of state assemblyman dov hikind at one stop hikind 
introduced gore by denouncing jackson as the candidate who 
embraced yasser arafat and saying that gore was the only one 
who had the courage to criticize jackson 
but when he spoke gore didnt discuss jackson 
gore also interviewed on the cbs program said he did not 
intend to change his campaign style despite criticism from 
democratic heavyweights like party chief paul kirk and new york 
gov mario cuomo over attacks on the other democrats 
i have no plans to change my basic campaign posture at all 
he said 
democratic noncandidate cuomo meanwhile offered a confusing 
succession of statements on whether he would accept a draft from a 
deadlocked convention 
on saturday during a telelphone interview with the associated 
press he declared ive ruled it out 
cuomos press secretary gary fryer immediately denied that the 
governor had intended to say he would refuse a draft and meant 
instead that a draft should not take place 
on sunday cuomo told the ap i think it is absolutely a 
reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says its wrong 
its counterproductive its unwise it shouldnt be then that 
means he rejects a draft 
but when asked flatly if the correct interpretation was that he 
would not accept a draft cuomo said i think so 
he was more direct when asked much the same question by the new 
york times on sunday 
yes youre absolutely correct thats accurate now i hope 
there are no questions left about my role the times quoted him 
as saying 
kirk the democratic national committee chairman said sunday 
that the fight for the nomination will help the democrats by 
keeping the partys candidates in the spotlight unlike the 
republican race where the suspense is gone 
bush himself acknowledged that 
ive got to look more frantic he joked to reporters 
traveling with him on air force two over the weekend as he returned 
from a round of fundraisers his last of the primary campaign 
i think weve just got to recognize were not going to get 
the intensive political coverage 
meanwhile richard nixon predicted bush will win the general 
election in november but that the democratic nominee will give him 
a run for his money 
the former president was asked on nbctvs meet the press 
whether dukakis was too dull to be an effective nominee 
ive often said that the best politics is poetry rather 
than prose nixon replied jesse jackson is a poet cuomo is a 
poet and dukakis is a word processor thats what it gets down 
to 
on the other hand nixon said of dukakis hes cool hes 
intelligent hes tough hes good in debates hes going to be a 
very formidable candidate

israel today deported eight more palestinians 
to lebanon saying they incited antiisraeli protests leaders of 
the fourmonth uprising in the occupied lands called for a day of 
firebombing later this month 
the army said five of those deported today were from the gaza 
strip and three from the west bank 
israel deported four west bank palestinians on jan 13 sparking 
protests of the action as a violation of the geneva conventions 
governing the treatment of citizens in occupied zones 
the army said deportation orders had been issued for 12 other 
palestinians from the territories occupied by israel in the 1967 
middle east war the palestinians ordered deported may appeal 
israel has deported more than 1000 palestinians since 1967 
six of the 12 ordered deported are from beita the site of a 
clash between israeli teenagers and palestinians two arabs and an 
israeli girl died in the melee 
also today arabs in the west bank and gaza strip shuttered 
their stores and stayed home from jobs in israel under plo orders 
the army meanwhile promised the supreme court it would give 48 
hours notice before destroying more homes in beita 
an army statement said the eight palestinians who were deported 
to lebanon today were leading organizers and instigators of the 
recent violent public disturbances in the occupied territories 
the statement said those from beita who were slated for 
expulsion had played an active part in the attack on the 
israeli teenagers who were on a hiking expedition 
the army says it has destroyed 13 houses of villagers accused of 
inciting the clash villagers claimed 23 houses hadbeen knocked 
down 
the latest underground leaflet circulated in the occupied lands 
praised beita for showing settlers a lesson during the incident 
and called on palestinians to raise money for the heroic 
village as before the leaflet was signed by the palestine 
liberation organization 
the leaflet also congratulated palestinians for refusing to meet 
with secretary of state george p shultz during his middle east 
tour your uprising stopped shultz from his fake plan and he 
went back to his country as a big failure without any of our 
people having met him the leaflet said 
business came to a virtual standstill in towns and cities in the 
west bank and gaza today as residents observed a commercial strike 
in bethlehem the central market was closed and tourist shops 
lining manger square were shuttered no arab taxis or buses were 
operating into or out of the town where christians believe jesus 
was born 
a complete strike was also observed in gaza city and the rest of 
the coastal strip palestinian reporters there said nablus 
residents reported all stores in the city were closed as were 
businesses in arab east jerusalem 
residents of bethlehem nablus and gaza city said more than half 
of the arab workers who normally travel to jobs in israel stayed 
home 
the latest leaflet called for further commercial strikes on 
thursday and saturday and for more days of protest honoring arabs 
killed in the last four months israeli troops or settlers have 
killed 141 palestinans since violence broke out dec 8 according 
to un figures one israeli soldier and one civilian have been 
killed during that time 
the leaflet called for a palestine molotov day referring to 
the molotov cocktails or firebombs often thrown by rioters at 
israeli targets 
the day is palestine molotov day as an answer to the 
authorities position to give settlers the right to shoot at any 
molotov throwers the leaflet designated april 21 as palestine 
molotov day and called for a general strike the same day 
defense minister yitzhak rabin was quoted last month as saying 
israeli civilians could shoot at firebomb throwers if they had no 
other way to extricate themselves from a lifethreatening situation 
the leaflet also told palestinians to boycott israeli products 
especially during the monthlong moslem holiday of ramadan which 
begins next weekend 
debate continued today over the clash in beita 
in a supreme court hearing on an appeal brought by the israeli 
civil rights association officials promised to give 48 hours 
notice before destroying any more homes in beita and to give 
villagers a reasonable amount of time to appeal 
nili arad a state prosecutor said the army had no immediate 
plans to destroy more homes in beita but she stressed that the 
army probe of the clash was not over and might turn up more 
suspected inciters 
ms arad said army policy was to provide a warning before 
demolitions unless an incident was considered particularly 
grave she said the beita clash fell into that category 
the army is expected within a few days to release its findings 
on the beita clash 
on sunday jewish settlers and rightwing legislators criticized 
the army for saying tirza porat 15 had been accidentally killed 
by a shot from a gun carried by a jewish settler who was guarding 
the teenage hikers they insisted she was shot by an arab that 
some saw pointing a rifle from a rooftop 
rabin told a weekly cabinet session sunday that an army autopsy 
showed miss porat was apparently struck by a bullet from the m16 
rifle of romem al dubi one of two settler guards who accompanied 
the teens on their hike near beita

mikhail s gorbachev said in a 
letter to president oscar arias of costa rica that the soviet 
government was prepared to stop sending arms to central america if 
the united states agreed to do the same 
in the letter the soviet communist party general secretary also 
said he had proposed to the united states to embargo all arms 
shipments to the region except for firearms for police forces 
the soviet union is a major arms supplier to nicaraguas 
sandinista government 
reports that the soviet union was sending arms to leftist 
salvadoran and guatemalan guerrillas were totally unfounded 
said the letter which was made public saturday by arias press 
office 
gorbachev said his government was conducting its relations with 
central americas governments in accordance with the regional peace 
plan authored by arias and signed by the five central american 
presidents on aug 7 
that plan calls for an end to outside assistance for 
insurgencies in the region ceasefires in nicaragua el salvador 
and guatemala and talks aimed at establishing democratic elections 
in the region 
the soviet union is ready to assume on a reciprocal basis 
with the united states the obligation to respect and rigorously 
comply with the accords relative to conditions of security the 
control and limitation of arms the letter said 
gorbachev was responding to a letter arias sent on march 7 
asking the soviet leader to suspend arms shipments to the region 
arias has urged gorbachev and president reagan to include 
central america as a topic in their next summit meeting scheduled 
for may 
gorbachev said the two superpowers had yet to agree to stop 
sending arms because the united states neither pursues nor wants 
to hear talk of any reduction in us arms shipments to honduras 
and el salvador 
the honduran and salvadoran governments are the reagan 
administrations principal allies in central america

fbi director william s sessions told senate 
hearings on organized crime today that law enforcement efforts have 
seriously damaged but not destroyed the nations organized crime 
families 
testifying at the most extensive senate hearings on organized 
crime in nearly 25 years sessions said the fbis extensive 
intelligence system indicates that many organized crime enterprises 
which have existed unfettered for years have been dismantled 
sessions told the senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations that the secrecy of the criminal underworld has 
been coopted by the cooperation of organized crime figures with 
the fbi 
most importantly their ability to influence and intimidate 
the business and political community is weakened sessions said 
the hearings were held amid stringent security measures with a 
metal detector set up outside the hearing room inside the room 
were charts listing organized crime families of today and the 
charts used in 1963 when convicted murderer joseph valachi 
appearing before the same panel introduced the phrase la cosa 
nostra into the national consciousness 
sen sam nunn dga opening the new hearing said the crime 
family soldiers listed in the charts from the valachi hearings 
appear today among the highestranking powers in the lcn la cosa 
nostra families 
sessions the leadoff witness told the subcommittee the 
question most often asked is whether we have eradicated the lcn as 
a national threat the simple answer is no they continue to engage 
in a wide variety of criminal activities 
valachi was the star witness in the widely publicized 1963 
senate investigation of organized crime unfolding a complex story 
of murder terror crime and vice he described the la cosa nostra 
organization and named alleged members 
tommaso buscetta described as a former member of the porto 
nuova sicilian mafia family in palermo sicily was scheduled to 
testify after sessions 
the subcommittee has set four days of hearings this month 
today friday april 21 and april 22 angelo lonardo described as 
the former boss of the cleveland la cosa nostra family leads off 
fridays hearings 
in the 1963 hearings the 58yearold valachi who was serving a 
life sentence in the atlanta federal penitentiary said la cosa 
nostra was a highly organized unit with a strict code guaranteed by 
blood ties and arranged marriages within the tight framework of the 
crime syndicate 
he testified that the organization had been responsible for many 
gangland deaths throughout the country including the slayings of 
mobsters albert anastasi and frank scalise 
fbi director j edgar hoover called the valachi case the 
biggest intelligence breakthrough yet in combating organized crime 
and racketeering in the united states 
attorney general robert p kennedy said federal authorities had 
full confidence in valachis testimony and called for 
comprehensive legislation to deal with organized crime including 
new federal wiretapping powers and immunity for witnesses in 
racketeering probes 
in announcing the new hearings the panels chairman sen sam 
nunn dga said in the wake of an impressive array of 
successful prosecutions it is important that we take stock and 
assess just how far we have come in the war against organized 
crime 
some have described the recent prosecutions of mob hierarchies 
as the final death knell of la cosa nostra he said others 
argue that these prosecutions merely remove one mob hierarchy and 
replace it with another as powerful and sometimes even more 
vicious than the old 
nunn said the subcommittee as it did 25 years ago will hear 
from witnesses who will describe how organized crime has survived 
despite periodically successful attacks by law enforcement agencies 
these hearings will not only try to determine if any 
additional law enforcement legislation is needed but also whether 
the federal government is effectively using these tools that have 
already been provided to them nunn said in particular we are 
interested in reviewing the recent successful civil and criminal 
prosecutions under the 1970 racketeering statutes 
not only will we be interested in the impact of those recent 
successes but also the ability to transfer such tactics to other 
areas of organized criminal activity particularly to the fields 
of labor racketeering narcotics trafficking and other emerging 
organized crime groups he said 
sen william v roth jr of delaware the ranking republican on 
the subcommittee said occasional successes in battling organized 
crime should not lead to complacency 
these secret criminal societies recognize only the law of the 
jungle and respect only the wealth of illgotten gain roth said 
we must recognize the new face of organized crime in this 
country it is important that we take this opportunity to examine 
whether the strategies weve successfully used in the past will be 
effective in the future

the owner of two indian elephants says 
hell agree to sell the 3ton animals if their former owner who 
apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years will 
return them 
richard drake owner of a nowclosed tehachapi calif animal 
farm said sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 
27yearold female elephants appraised at 70000 apiece 
drake said he has spent thousands and thousands of dollars 
crisscrossing the country searching for arlan seidon the man who 
fled with the elephants tory and duchess 
seidon who raised the elphants from infancy contacted the star 
ledger of newark several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and 
said he would return to face charges of thirddegree theft if the 
elephants were not given to drake 
seidon sold the elephants to the drakes for 80000 in 1981 but 
said he repossessed the animals for nonpayment the drakes 
successfully fought the action and in may 1984 superior court judge 
peter thomas awarded them 107000 in damages 
seidon also charged that drake 50 and his son edward 30 
abused the animals the drakes deny that charge 
seidon 58 fled with the elephants from a farm in colts neck 
township while the animals were with a circus in new jersey he has 
been on the lam ever since 
its been at a standstill for four years drake said from 
his sisters far hills home we have to do something 
drake said sunday he had contacted seidons attorney isabelle 
strauss of east orange and was awaiting an answer to his proposal 
ms strauss an animal activist was not in her office today for 
additional comment a secretary said 
she told the star ledger on saturday that seidon who phones her 
periodically would not allow the elephants to go to animal brokers 
who would sell them to other people 
ms strauss said a vermont businessman is interested in the 
animals and that she is trying to work out a deal 
ms strauss has said she does not know where or how seidon has 
been concealing the elephants 
seidon has said he left his farm at fordland mo and his 
career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to 
care for the elephants which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day 
he said he hasnt seen his four children or met his only grandson 
since he took off with the animals

jury selection began with tight security 
today at the trial of a southwest missouri dairy farmer accused of 
killing seven members of his family in a fall shooting spree 
james e schnick 36 of nearby elkland faces seven counts of 
firstdegree murder in the deaths of his wife and her brother and 
his family on sept 25 
immediately after the killings police had speculated that one 
of the victims a 14yearold boy was responsible 
highway patrol officers helped webster county deputies search 
the courtroom and inspect each spectator with a metal detector 
before proceedings began 
sheriff eugene fraker said the security measures were taken as a 
precaution and not because of any threats 
schnick sat quietly between his two attorneys his hands were 
clenched tightly but unshackled he began to cry quietly when the 
judge read the charges against him to the potential jurors 
more than 100 prospective jurors were scheduled to be 
interviewed today 
the courthouse is a short drive from the scene of the slayings 
at two family dairy farms in the tiny community of elkland 
proceedings are likely to center on what prosecutor donald 
cheever says is schnicks confession 
according to statements made in a pretrial hearing in february 
schnick implicated himself oct 5 at missouri state highway patrol 
troop headquarters in springfield where as the only witness in 
the slayings he had been taken to undergo a lie detector test 
schnicks attorneys county public defender james mcnabb and 
special state public defender susan chapman had attempted to have 
schnicks statements suppressed they said the statements were 
unfairly obtained by a webster county sheriffs deputy who 
exploited both his friendship with schnick and the suspects 
fragile mental and physical condition 
circuit judge john parrish ruled that the confession was 
admissable 
schnick is accused of shooting his wife julie 30 her brother 
steve buckner 35 buckners wife jeannette 36 and the buckners 
four children kirk 14 dennis 8 timmy 6 and michael 2 the 
schnicks two young children were not injured

he and his family had been attacked by an unknown intruder 
kirk was found with the gun used in the killings in his right 
hand but authorities later discovered he was lefthanded

black students boycotted classes today at 
denison university to protest what they call lenient treatment of 
white students involved in a racial incident and about 400 
students and faculty members attended a rally 
university spokesman stewart dyke said the rally was peaceful 
and included a speech by university trustee clifford tyree who 
said he would recommend the institution adopt a policy of immediate 
suspension from school for racial harassment 
theyre really using it as an educational opportunity to 
address the issues and incidents of racism that theyve seen on the 
increase dyke said of the rally theyre putting it into the 
context of the new racism on campuses these days 
the protest resulted from an incident last week two students 
accused of verbally harassing aaron laramore a black senior from 
toledo who is head resident at the private schools huffman hall 
dormitory were suspended for one semester friday by the university 
judicial board a third white student was found innocent 
about 80 of 2100 undergraduates at the school in a suburb of 
columbus are black dyke said 
the white students who lived in a room adjacent to laramores 
testified that they were having a private conversation early on the 
morning of april 1 but the black student union claimed the racial 
slurs were aimed at laramore 
dyke refused to identify the students citing denisons privacy 
policy 
the black student union said it was profoundly disappointed at 
the shortsighted insensitive and totally unsatisfactory decision 
by the board 
steve gaskill a sophomore and member of the black student 
union said the group met before the hearing and agreed not to 
accept any punshisment less than a yearlong suspension for the 
students found guilty 
i dont expect an end he said regarding the protest i do 
expect an impact on the students to end apathy about racism on 
campus

kuwaiti officials had said three people with military status 
were on the plane 
one of them a 24yearold kuwaiti border guard was killed 
saturday in the first death in the weeklong ordeal 
the hijackers had set two deadlines today for fuel a 1 pm 6 
am deadline passed without incident after malaz abdo deputy 
head of the palestine liberation organization office here and 
michael herodotou head of cyprus civil aviation department 
conducted brief negotiations with the hijackers 
the hijackers then set a 230 pm 730 am edt deadline and 
told the control tower refueling must start or you will receive 
the corpse 
fourtyseven minutes later the man identified by the hijackers 
as a kuwaiti officer was thrown out of the jet 
in announcing the first deadline today one of the gunmen told 
the control tower by radio we hereby appeal to the cyprus 
government that we are intending to take off to a neutral country 
therefore you are kindly requested within one hour to start 
refueling the craft otherwise we kill a personality related to 
the unjust kuwaiti regime 
the hijackers have been demanding the release of 17 terrorists 
held in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies there in 
1983 but sources close to the negotiations said the hijackers 
today demanded freedom for the three men among the 17 terrorists 
who are sentenced to death 
kuwait apparently rejected the modified demand 
on sunday a proiranian group in lebanon threatened to kill 
american and french hostages if any attempt was made to storm the 
plane a statement from the islamic jihad terrorist group was 
delivered to a news agency in west beirut along with photographs 
of journalists terry a anderson an american and jeanpaul 
kauffmann of france 
three members of kuwaits large alsabah royal family are among 
the 52 people believed to be aboard the boeing 747 including at 
least half a dozen hooded hijackers armed with grenades and guns 
the plane was hijacked tuesday on a flight from bangkok to 
kuwait carrying 112 people and forced down in northeastern iran 
where 57 people were freed after the plane left iran on friday 
beirut and damascus refused to let it land 
another captive an ailing 32yearold kuwaiti was freed in 
larnaca apparently after plo intervention 
one member of the royal family fadel khaled alsabah told the 
tower by radio sunday evening in a faint voice we depend on god 
for our fate the other two royal family members are his sisters 
ebtesam and anware 
today marked the first time the hijackers had referred over the 
radio to any plan to fly to a neutral country they did not 
name the country or say which of the royal family they planned to 
kill 
however the kuwaiti newspaper alqabas reported that algerian 
officials have become involved in the negotiations 
at one point the gunmen had threatened to take off and force 
the pilot to crash the jumbo jet into the emirs palace in kuwait 
city 
on sunday the hijackers threatened to start a slow and quiet 
massacre of the 47 or so remaining hostages unless kuwait 
released the proiranian prisoners in kuwait 
the plo is believed to be a key factor in the negotiations on 
sunday plo chief yasser arafat joined other moslem leaders meeting 
on other issues in kuwait in supporting kuwaits refusal to give in 
to the hijackers demands 
in kuwait progovernment newspapers reported today that 
additional gunmen boarded the hijacked jetliner at irans mashhad 
airport and arms and ammunition also were supplied 
government statements have blamed iran for the fate of the 
hostages because iran allowed the plane to leave mashhad 
iran has denied involvement in the hijacking

a police raid on suspected drug 
dealers was conducted weeks ahead of schedule because a network 
television crew planned to show the suspects in a nationally 
televised documentary officials said 
the weekend sting resulted in 29 arrests but one west virginia 
state trooper suffered a gunshot wound and two others were injured 
in a traffic accident 
the alleged dealings near a shopping center were covered in just 
25 seconds of sunday nights hourlong abctv documentary titled 
drugs a plague upon the land 
us attorney william kolibash who originally was concerned 
that if the suspects saw themselves on tv they would flee said 
after the show aired that the influence probably would have been 
minimal 
these people were so blatant that they probably would have 
been back out there within a week kolibash said 
saturdays raid focused on runners peddling crack cocaine 
shipped in from miami and washington dc by jamaican dealers 
kolibash said 
the suspects were using the rural county to cater to outoftown 
buyers who didnt want to have to worry about the dangers of 
city crime he said the county is less than an hours drive from 
suburban washington 
about 60 state and federal agents saturday afternoon began 
serving arrest warrants on 40 people accused of distributing crack 
a total of 29 arrests have been made authorities said today and 
more are pending 
a national magazine article several weeks ago detailed a 
jamaican drug connection to jefferson county and a television crew 
arrived shortly thereafter 
kolibash said he offered to let the reporters do their work from 
unmarked police vehicles but also asked that their pictures not be 
aired until the suspects were arrested 
we were kind of concerned that if some of those people saw 
themselves on television they would disappear kolibash said 
abc news officials didnt hold off however and scheduled the 
special show for sunday night kolibash said 
abc news spokeswoman joyce kravitz denied that the network was 
responsible for speeding up the drug arrests 
my understanding is that they offered to move the date she 
said they volunteered to do that it wasnt anything we asked 
for

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said monday 
that 150000 iranian pilgrims would travel to mecca this year and 
stage demonstrations against the united states and israel 
these intentions had been announced earlier this year by other 
iranian officials but it was the first time that irans 87yearold 
spiritual leader has referred to them 
saudi arabia has said it will cut the number of pilgrims 
traveling to the holy city this year but has not announced any 
figures 
last year 402 pilgrims including 275 iranians were killed in 
riots that began with a rally against pagans in the holy city 
in saudi arabia during the hajj or pilgrimage 
saudi officials said many pilgrims were trampled to death in a 
stampede or killed in subsequent street brawls that followed the 
demonstration iran claimed police mowed down the pilgrims with 
machine guns 
after the violence last summer iran called for the overthrow of 
the ruling family in saudi arabia saying it was unfit to have 
custody of mecca and medina holy places of islam 
this year 150000 pilgrims will participate in hajj rituals 
and the pilgrims will do their duty which is disowning the 
infidels america and israel khomeini was quoted as saying by 
tehran radio which was monitored in nicosia 
it is not possible for our pilgrims to take part in the hajj 
and not demonstrate against world arrogance khomeini said 
basically disowning the infidels is one of the political duties 
of pilgrims and without it the hajj would not be the hajj

president reagans spokesman acknowledged 
today that us steps inentded to force panamanian strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega from power have seriously damaged that 
nations financial system but expressed optimism panamas economy 
will recover 
we dont think it is irreparable harm but it is serious 
harm white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
he was queried about concerns expressed by leading panamanians 
that the past several weeks of financial turmoil triggered by us 
attempts to pressure noriega to step down have caused permanent 
damage to the countrys onceflourishing financial system 
fitzwater contended that the us steps which included freezing 
panamanian assets in the united states have been effective even 
though noriega has not yet stepped down the spokesman also 
contended that the us government has not intended to harm the 
general population 
they the sanctions were designed to strangle the financial 
system fitzwater said 
noriega is under indictment in florida for alleged drug 
trafficking and us officials have insisted that he relinquish 
power and leave the country 
in an effort to increase pressure on noriega reagan on friday 
invoked the international emergency economic powers act for the 
first time since invoking it against libya two years ago that 
action banned all trade with libya 
the law prohibits payments including taxes by americans and 
us corporations to the panamanian government one administration 
official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of 
us corporations would be affected 
fitzwater defended the steps as attempting to deny noriega 
money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power 
we have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking 
and financial system of the country and not the general economy 
and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general 
economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that 
constitute the base for noriega staying in there fitzwater said 
there is serious damage being done in terms of the financial 
system but we think the banking system will be able to recover 
he added 
earlier treasury secretary james baker said hes optimistic 
that the new economic sanctions will force noriega from power 
without permanently damaging the economy 
we worry about the panamanian economy because what weve tried 
to do is take action that would not hurt the panamanian people 
baker said in an interview on the nbctv today program 
weve tried to take action directed toward getting noriega to 
step down added baker 
asked if the administration is considering even sterner moves to 
force noriega from power baker said he believes the new sanctions 
will be effective 
i think for the time being this is what should be done and 
were optimistic about the results said the treasury secretary 
panamanian assets in us banks have been frozen since march 
when reagan requested the federal reserve take the action after 
deposed panamanian president eric arturo delvalle obtained an 
injunction from a federal court in miami 
reagans executive order on friday stopped short of a full 
economic embargo on panama but violators can be prosecuted for 
noncompliance with administration policy for the first time since 
uspanama relations began to sour violators can be sentenced to 
up to 10 years in prison and 50000 in fines

his son maurizio 
lawyers said gelli former head of italys outlawed p2 masonic 
lodge will be hospitalized after a few days of rest at home

officials of honeywell inc and a soviet 
government ministry announced monday they had agreed on a 
multimilliondollar venture to equip soviet fertilizer plants with 
hightechnology production control equipment 
the deal was announced as a group of 400 americans led by 
commerce secretary c william verity arrived for trade talks with 
soviet officials 
prospects for more such joint projects which the soviets are 
promoting to help stimulate their economy are a main topic for the 
talks of the ussoviet joint commercial commission 
honeywell and the soviet ministry of mineral fertilizer 
production are forming a company that will design automated control 
systems for factories under the ministrys jurisdiction and is 
expected to sell to third countries as well said james verrant a 
honeywell senior vice president 
the soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using 
the new technology thereby also improving harvests in the weak 
farm economy 
honeywell will own 49 percent of the company and the soviet 
ministry will own 51 percent verrant said the company has been 
named sterch after an endangered species of siberian crane that 
was saved by ussoviet cooperation in the 1970s 
a honeywell statement said the companys investment in the 
initial marketing and design phase will be about 1 million 
verrant told a news conference that once the joint venture begins 
installing the production control equipment purchases from 
honeywell could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 
million volume in the first year of operation 
because the soviet ruble cannot be exchanged for hard currency 
the method of receiving profits is a major problem for western 
firms trying to set up joint ventures with the soviet union 
but verrant said that under soviet legislation adopted in 
september the minister of the soviet fertilizer industry has 
access to some of the countrys hard currency earnings 
honeywells future income from the project will depend on 
increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be 
marketed to third countries and on installation in other countries 
of systems in plants that the soviets have helped manage verrant 
said 
most of the joint ventures employees will be soviets verrant 
said 
the agreement will be signed thursday and official registration 
of the company may take a month or more 
giorgi prityko a top official in the soviet ministry said 
bulgarias 10 years of experience with a similar honeywell system 
was an important reason the soviets chose the minneapolisbased 
company 
we just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in 
bulgaria he said 
members of the joint commercial commission are expected to hear 
from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
verity said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks 
although they could improve the climate for greater ussoviet 
trade 
he said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only 
if the soviets make improvements in other areas such as human 
rights and emigration

the needs of fish power generation 
irrigation and recreation hang in the balance as a major drought 
parches the columbia river basin 
if current conditions continue for another three years the 
northwest power planning council says the situation could be more 
severe than the drought preceding the dust bowl of the 1930s 
the columbia winds 1243 miles from its headwaters in british 
columbia to the pacific ocean on the oregonwashington border 
millions of residents in four states rely on the columbia and the 
regions other major river the 1038milelong snake for their 
livelihoods 
federal fish and power experts say that if the drought continues 
as expected into 1989 the river system could reach the breaking 
point 
few of the columbia basins 19 major reservoirs are expected to 
refill this summer said russell george chief of reservoir 
operations for the us army corps of engineers even last year 
one of the driest on record was wet enough to fill the manmade 
lakes 
when the rivers run below normal managers representing indian 
tribes three states and the federal government must decide how to 
balance competing interests 
controlled flows guarantee safe passage during the annual fall 
and spring migrations of the salmon and steelhead prized by 
commercial recreational and indian fishermen 
the water also spins turbines that light homes and power 
businesses throughout the region in good years the power flows as 
far as southern california cutting dependence on nonrenewable 
sources of energy 
starting friday a fish migration plan developed by the 
northwest power planning council calls for the us army corps of 
engineers to flush immense volumes of water down the columbia and 
snake rivers until june 15 for the benefit of spring and summer 
chinook salmon smolt 
enough water is stored along the columbia for its young fish 
but the snakes flow will not meet this years goals according to 
peter paquet of the columbia river intertribal fish commission 
to increase survival the army corps of engineers plans to use 
trucks and barges to transport some of the young fish a move that 
could avert problems faced in the years following the 1977 drought 
when 90 percent of the smolt perished damaging subsequent fish 
runs 
the receding columbia river system will reduce hydroelectric 
power generated at a series of dams throughout the basin 
reservoirs will be 70 percent to 80 percent full this year 
according to wally gibson manager of system analysis and rates for 
the northwest power planning council the council says the 
northwests power prospects for 1989 are uncertain 
the bonneville power administration already has eliminated power 
sales to california it has bought power from sources outside the 
region for the first time in 15 years said doug faulkner chief of 
bpas operations planning branch 
for irrigators the second year of drought has brought critical 
conditions to several localities particularly the yakima basin in 
central washington 
steve wade a spokesman for the us bureau of reclamation said 
severe shortages also could occur in southern idaho harming onion 
seed and fruit crops water is less scarce in the potatogrowing 
central areas of the state he said 
recreational boaters also face problems because of low water 
levels in the reservoirs

her board game against such worldclass competitors as andrei 
gromyko and javier perez de cuellar 
i always lost she admits cheerfully but then winning is 
not the point of the game which tries to educate players about 
global relations 
michelle invented give peace a chance three years ago as a 
project for her thirdgrade class 
its a simple board game similar to monopoly players use small 
markers that carry a nations flag and they are rewarded for 
cooperation with other countries 
winners create nuclear free zones share scientific secrets and 
invite childrens peace delegations to their countries losers 
invade smaller countries or refuse to negotiate treaties 
the game includes a version of the go directly to jail card 
but with an apocalyptic twist nuclear warfare between countries 
game is over for all countries 
but the fallout from give peace a chance has been all 
positive for michelle 
after her game won first place in the 1985 international 
childrens peace prize competition michelle was selected for a 
world tour sponsored by children as peace makers foundation 
last week michelle and her mother roberta left on her second 
peace mission to the soviet union where her game is being 
translated into russian the sovietsponsored foundation for social 
inventions is paying for the trip during which michelle hopes to 
play her game with soviet children 
after that michelle will receive the world childrens day 
foundation award at the united nations on april 24 then address 
children delegates at the un general assembly 
almost all children have a hobby and do something that they 
really want i really want world peace its a hobby of mine she 
said in an interview before she left for the soviet union 
michelle has played her game with gromyko the former soviet 
foreign minister un secretarygeneral perez de cuellar chinese 
vice president ulanhu and indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
older people can learn things from children thats what were 
trying to tell them we want to grow up and we want to live she 
said 
give peace and chance helps teach children and adults alike 
that there are consequences to our actions both good and bad 
said mrs alexander 
one part of the game asks players to create a peaceful activity 
with another country but mrs alexander said children have an 
easier time creating hostile or aggressive acts against their 
neighbors 
one of the most touching moments in her travels michelle 
recalled came when a girl from norway told gandhi that the 
childrens peace delegation had toured new delhi by bus and had 
seen other children in the streets with their arms outstretched 
pleading for food and money 
the girl asked how gandhi could allow his country to spend so 
much money building nuclear weapons while children begged for food 
in the streets 
he gandhi said were doing everything we can and then 
everybody was crying there wasnt a dry eye in the room she 
said

the state department on monday welcomed a call 
by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev that the palestine liberation 
organization recognize israels right to exist 
but the white house seemed to downplay gorbachevs move 
he has offered those friendly suggestions in the past so its 
not a new proposal presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
obviously we agree that the plo should recognize israels right 
to exist 
asked what gorbachevs motives might be in making his statement 
fitzwater said it would appear that the soviet union is taking a 
greater interest in the middle east 
however charles e redman the state department spokesman said 
gorbachev had made a positive statement especially in view of 
the fact it was made in the context of yasser arafats visit to 
moscow for our part we are continuing our dialogue with the 
soviets on the middle east 
the communist party newspaper pravda quoted gorbachev as 
telling arafat the palestinians are a people with a difficult 
fate but they receive broad international support and this is the 
guarantee for resolving the main question for palestinians 
selfdetermination 
in the same way gorbachev said recognition of the state 
of israel consideration of its security interests the solution of 
this question is a necessary element for the establishment of peace 
and goodneighborliness in the region based on the principles of 
international law

the state attorney generals office today said 
it would not file charges against san diego police officers accused 
of perjury or excessive force in connection with a case that raised 
allegations of racism and brutality 
a report issued today concludes an eightmonth investigation 
into the case involving sagon penn a black who was acquitted in 
the killing of one white police officer and the wounding of another 
penn claimed he was defending himself against a racially 
motivated attack when he grabbed one of the officers guns and 
opened fire in the march 31 1985 incident thomas riggs was 
killed and donovan jacobs and civilian observer sarah pinaruiz 
were wounded 
the state attorney generals investigation arose out allegations 
made by judge j morgan lester who presided over penns second 
trial the judges public remarks came shortly after penn was 
acquitted in the retrial that ended july 16 1987 
morgan said police officers lied on the witness stand and 
suggested that riggs and jacobs engaged in nightstick justice 
provoking the struggle that ensued after a traffic stop 
state attorney john van de kamp said there was insufficient 
evidence to support successful prosecution he also said penn had 
made it clear he didnt want any charges filed against jacobs 
penn was at first reluctant to be interviewed by state 
investigators who interviewed him march 12 only after an immunity 
agreement was worked out 
during the questioning penn was unresponsive to many questions 
and drifted off into other subjects such as religion and 
philosophy van de kamp said 
describing penn as a troubled man van de kamp said he didnt 
think penn would have made a credible witness and that his 
testimony would have been crucial to a successful prosecution 
the perjury allegations stemmed from testimony given by several 
san diego police officers regarding the police investigation and 
jacobs character which was described by the defense as bigoted 
van de kamp said that criminal perjury requires a very high 
standard of proof he said the prosecution has to prove that a 
witness knowingly gave false testimony in regard to a central issue 
of the case 
after careful investigation of eight incidents of possible 
perjury our lawyers concluded that there was either no evidence or 
insufficient evidence to meet that very high standard the 
attorney general said 
another key issue was the possible use of excessive force van 
de kamp said there was substantial evidence that officers used 
excessive force at the beginning and at the end of the 
confrontation 
but he said there was no evidence to sustain a charge of battery 
against riggs 
as to agent jacobs the decision was much more difficult the 
most consistent accounts from eyewitnesses suggest that jacobs did 
use excessive force both at the beginning of the incident and 
after penn was on the ground 
but because there were conflicting accounts among eyewitnesses 
without coherent testimony from penn the state couldnt sustain a 
battery charge against jacobs he said

the reagan administration expressed firm 
support monday for the refusal by cypriot officials to comply with 
a demand by the hijackers of a kuwait airways jet that the aircraft 
be refueled 
department spokesman charles redman also said the united states 
supports kuwaits decision not to abide by the hijackers demand 
for the release of 17 convicted terrorists in that country 
the hijackers are murderers trying to free other convicted 
murderers redman said they must be punished 
he added that the united states is appalled at the 
coldblooded murder of two innocent hostages aboard the aircraft 
the second victim killed on monday was identified as a 
kuwaiti officer he was thrown out of the plane onto the tarmac 
at the airport in larnaca 
redman also dismissed as cynical a threat by the islamic 
jihad in beirut to kill the hostages they are holding if any harm 
comes to the hijackers 
we continue to hold the kidnapers in lebanon fully responsible 
for the safety and well being of all the hostages there he said

border to a bit south of cape hatteras nc 
staff problems and work overloads was how marcia 
heimberger spokeswoman for the departments minerals management

volume of comments for a lease offering off northern california 
scheduled for next february she said 
the new schedule shows 34 remaining offerings under the 
fiveyear drilling plan adopted last july reflecting the dropping 
of the june 1992 offering off the eastern coast of florida under an

eight university of maryland students 
who were caught using illegal drugs must submit to random urine 
tests for three semesters in the first use of the schools 
drugtesting policy 
the policy implemented at the start of the spring semester in 
late january is believed to be the first at a major university to 
require random urine testing for students found using drugs 
according to the national organization for the reform of marijuana 
laws known as norml the alternative for students caught with 
drugs is suspension 
the testing program is opposed by some students who regard it 
as an invasion of privacy unduly harsh and potentially damaging to 
a students future they also say it is an unjustified backlash to 
the 1986 cocaine death of campus basketball star len bias 
students held a rally last month in protest and one student 
group has collected 800 signatures on petitions opposing the policy 
william thomas vice chancellor for student affairs 
acknowledged that the policy did evolve after bias death in june 
1986 
but the implication that the university is in a position to do 
this only in response to public outcry is incorrect he said 
we have had a very thorough discussion of our options to deal 
with this very difficult issue of drugs this solution evolved from 
that very careful and extended study 
campus officials say they are open to students suggestions on 
how to improve the policy but believe it is fair especially as it 
offers a way for offending students to stay in school provided they 
pass the tests 
under the policy students caught using or possessing illegal 
drugs on campus must appear before a hearing board and face either 
drug testing or suspension said gary pavela director of judicial 
programs at the university the student can appeal the decision to 
a campuswide committee of students and faculty members he said 
all the cases so far involve marijuana and all the 
individuals involved reported that their use is casual pavela 
said they have made commitments to us that they will discontinue 
the use of drugs and in return we have committed ourselves to 
minimizing the drug testing to a period of three semesters 
i feel they the administrators are overstepping their 
boundary lines said edward joski who helped form a student 
group called stand up for your rights we dont need a big 
brother over our head and this is what theyre doing with the 
drug testing theyre just way out of line 
instead the group has called for additional drug education and 
counseling on campus 
stand up for your rights is especially opposed to drug testing 
for first offenders joski said 
just think youre a freshman you get caught you dont have 
a chance to repent what you did you automatically have the cuffs 
slapped on you you have to go through drug testing he said 
a lot of fortune 500 companies wont take you if they see that on 
your record basically your whole career could be shot 
jon gettman the national director of norml argued it is unfair 
to determine a students continued enrollment on the basis of urine 
tests 
these students really have a disincentive to achieve because 
no matter what they achieve it is this test and this test alone 
that will pass judgment on their worthiness to be enrolled at the 
university gettman said no matter what they do no matter how 
well they excel in any field academic athletic campus 
activities nothing can offset the damage of getting a positive 
urinalysis reading 
pavela said however i dont think the fact that one might be 
a great cheerleader or great student government representative 
ought to offset the repeated violation of an important regulation 
enrollment this semester at the college park campus including 
undergraduates and graduate students both full and part time is 
35442 the school said

us and vietnamese officials will hold 
immigration talks this week and likely discuss washingtons plan to 
accept within two years all children remaining in vietnam that were 
fathered by american servicemen a us official said monday 
ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok said 
the negotiations also will cover additional vietnamese immigration 
to the united states since 1980 64000 vietnamese have gone to 
the united states 
in january hanoi agreed in principle to washingtons offer to 
resettle within two years the estimated 800012000 amerasians and 
up to 22000 close relatives remaining in vietnam the united 
states has said the children suffer prejudice in vietnam which 
american troops left in 1973 
bruce beardsley head of the embassys refugee office in 
bangkok will join the talks in hanoi on wednesday petzing said 
a prime focus of the talks with hanoi will be the amerasian 
program and consequently the twoyear program is likely to be 
discussed petzing said 
the proposal is based on recent legislation that reclassfied 
amerasians as immigrants rather than refugees a change likely to 
hasten resettlement 
since 1980 the united states has accepted more than 4000 
amerasians under a unsponsored program vietnam suspended its 
participation from january 1986 until september 1987 when the 
united states agreed to streamline procedures 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said thursday that 
the americans were lazy in taking the children and he would 
like them to go even quicker than two years 
we have told them they can take them all tomorrow he said 
the resettlement program was established in 1980 as an 
alternative to the flight of refugees in boats 
petzing said in the latest round of interviews us officials 
had screened about 1000 amerasians and relatives and 1000 other 
vietnamese

pilots and flight engineers of air inter the 
largest french domestic airline began a threeday strike monday 
but company officials said most flights went off as scheduled 
the strike is one in a series to protest air inters decision to 
fly the new airbus a320 aircraft with only two cockpit crew members 
instead of three the first a320 is scheduled to go into service 
with air inter in june on the parisgrenoble line 
the personnel have conducted a series of strikes since feb 16 
but until monday had limited the action to the morning hours from 
midnight until 8 am and exempting saturdays sundays and 
holidays 
according to air inter 80 percent of the flights went off 
because it used nonstriking crews and leased planes from other 
companies 
since the company made its decision in november 1985 to fly its 
a320s with only pilot and copilot the personnel have claimed that 
it would be unsafe under that system the flight engineers 
navigating equipment is installed in front of the pilot and 
copilot 
the a320 was conceived and certified for flight by a twomember 
crew the smaller crew also means lower operating costs

us attempts to topple panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega have caused serious damage to panamas 
economy but it will bounce back president reagans chief 
spokesman predicted monday 
marlin fitzwater said usimposed sanctions were designed to 
strangle the financial system of the central american nation but 
not harm the general population 
the spokesman was asked to respond to assertions by leading 
panamanians that the past weeks of financial turmoil have crippled 
the countrys onceflourishing economic system perhaps forever 
panama which uses the us dollar as its currency had become 
known as a stable and reliable banking center in both north and 
south america 
but the financial system has been nearly paralyzed since march 
when the united states froze 50 million in panamanian government 
funds in american banks the us step followed noriegas ouster of 
president eric arturo devalle who is still recognized by the 
administration as panamas president 
in an effort to increase pressure on noriega reagan last friday 
invoked the international emergency economic powers act the law 
prohibits payments including taxes by americans and us 
corporations to the panamanian government one administration 
official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of 
us corporations would be affected 
the taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed 
president delvalle 
fitzwater defended the steps as attempting to deny noriega 
money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power 
we have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking 
and financial system of the country and not the general economy 
and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general 
economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that 
constitute the base for noriega staying in there he said 
we dont think it is irreparable harm there is serious 
damage being done in terms of the financial system but we think 
the banking system will be able to recover he added 
fitzwater contended that the us steps have been effective 
even though noriega has not yet stepped down 
noriega heads panamas 15000member defense forces and is the 
power behind the civilian government 
in february two federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on drugtrafficking charges the united states imposed 
economic sanctions on panama after noriega rejected washingtons 
demands that he resign and leave the country 
reagans executive order on friday stopped short of a full 
economic embargo on panama but violators can be prosecuted for 
noncompliance with administration policy for the first time since 
uspanama relations began to sour violators can be sentenced to 
up to 10 years in prison and 50000 in fines

a plan to expand a twolane road to five 
lanes has sparked fears that it would destroy the residential 
heritage of the nations first incorporated black community 
residents of the 100yearold community are worried that the 
countys plan would threaten the citys history the association to 
preserve the eatonville community and two private citizens joined 
in a classaction suit in march against orange county 
the group opposes a 13mile highway which would replace a 
twolane road through the twosquaremile towns commercial and 
civic center the road also would cut through a neighborhood in 
nearby maitland 
i dont think theyre paying proper attention to what 
eatonville and maitland have done to preserve the residential 
nature of our cities said germaine marvel a member of the 
preservation group 
this is eatonvilles main street this is where the schools 
the grocery stores the churches in this little town are located 
he said 
john kingman keating an attorney for the group said the 
lawsuit is novel because it says the public need for roads is 
outweighed by the greater need to preserve a historically unique 
town and to balance transportation improvements with existing 
neighborhoods 
county commissioners say central florida is growing so rapidly 
that something must be done to prevent future traffic jams they 
also think the road could help eatonville 
it could move commercial interests and increase thair tax 
base aid tom dorman chairman of the board of commissioners 
but most residents dont want the road 
everyone knows this is a communitybusting road said ny 
nathiri who heads the association against the roadwidening 
youll have a nonexistent or nonfunctioning black community

if he had to handle offshore oil and gas sales 
all over again hed do it differently by starting with all 
possible areas up for leasing interior secretary donald p hodel 
told an industry audience monday 
i would recommend to my successor when he puts together the 
next fiveyear drilling plan that he ought not to exclude areas 
from the plan as i did hodel told a convention of the national 
ocean industries association 
the association represents oil companies operating offshore and 
their suppliers 
plans drawn up by former secretaries james watt in the reagan 
administration and cecil andrus under president carter did not rule 
out any offshore areas from the start relying on procedural steps 
at later stages to drop unsuitable areas 
hodel noted that in drawing up the current plan which took 
effect last july he excluded several environmentally sensitive 
areas off the california coast such as big sur in the hope of 
eliminating arguments over areas not seriously part of anyones 
future drilling objectives 
but instead what i accomplished was what a friend of mine 
calls preemptive capitulation hodel said 
my current view based upon this experience is that there 
must be some quid pro quo such as that provided by florida 
governor bob martinez in our recent negotiations on the florida 
outer continental shelf 
martinez and hodel agreed last month that areas off the florida 
keys would not be offered for leasing under the current plan 
something martinez and many florida environmentalists wanted and 
something that was easy for hodel to grant because there is 
believed to be little oil or gas there 
in exchange martinez agreed to drop out of a multistate legal 
challenge to the fiveyear drilling plan and not to oppose the 
offer of certain tracts off the florida panhandle 
the florida sale was omitted from a revised schedule of 34 
offerings that saw seven lease auctions delayed several months in 
1989 1990 and 1991 because of the pressure of work four in 
alaska one off the midatlantic states and two off california the 
departments minerals management service said monday

her throughout the trip 
she said ms wallace stayed overnight in the homes or campers of 
friends and that there were a few campout situations ms 
kuehner said her friend walked virtually the entire way taking 
rides only for a few miles on stretches of dangerous highway 
ms wallace said the most frightening part of the trip occurred 
in west virginia when she was forced to hug the side of a mountain 
to avoid being struck by a semitrailer carrying a wideload cargo 
i dug my toes literally into the side of the culvert against 
the stone and prayed ms wallace recalled i felt the whiz 
of it go across my back 
she said she was disappointed she was not able to meet with 
president reagan but that she hopes her walk will spawn legislation 
to better protect children

jeffrey mitchell will never forget the 
sight of a 19yearold bride killed in an auto crash and pinned in 
her car in her bloodied white wedding gown 
it was several years ago but the memory of that accident which 
occurred when the newlyweds car crashed into a pickup truck 
helped lead mitchell a former maryland paramedic to create a 
program to help other paramedics firefighters and police cope with 
the tragedies they encounter 
in a series of group discussions called crisis debriefings 
rescuers share their feelings and thoughts about serious accidents 
fires and other disasters and deaths 
it gets peoples feelings off their chests so they are not 
feeling it weeks or months later said dan hardester emergency 
medical services coordinator in maitland in central florida 
law enforcement officials view themselves and are viewed by 
the citizens as a different kind of people if you see a 
firefighter crying you would think hey whats wrong with him 
its part of the job if you cant take it get out but they are 
not robots we are all human beings we have feelings 
its important for emergency workers to vent their feelings or 
they later could suffer from serious stress reactions such as 
depression irritability confusion withdrawal and cardiac 
disease said mitchell who worked as a paramedicfirefighter for 
nine years and holds a doctorate in psychology 
a debriefing session usually is scheduled one day after a 
tragedy the rescue workers gather with a specially trained 
psychologist and with peers who act as unbiased supporters the 
workers discuss how the incident affected them and how to cope with 
the stress and if the session is successful they also learn that 
their feelings are not unique mitchell said 
mitchell who has spoken throughout the country about his 
program trains debriefing teams while also working as assistant 
professor of emergency health services at the university of 
maryland 
cities and counties across the country use his methods but only 
eight states including florida have coordinated statewide 
programs orange county was the first in the state to organize a 
debriefing team of emergency workers from most area police and fire 
departments 
the team now serves four other counties brevard volusia 
seminole and lake a 15member regional board composed of agency 
chiefs coordinates the program in the five counties 
they call debriefings for traumatic events such as deaths or 
serious injuries to children or coworkers since march 1987 the 
team has scheduled 13 debriefings including one after a gunman 
killed six people and injured 28 in palm bay last april 
maitland paramedic kim neisler wishes the program had been 
available for her a few years ago when she worked on a case in 
which a maitland man killed his young son then killed himself and 
set his apartment on fire 
the boy looked like neislers nephew 
she spent a night in a hospital wracked by nausea and finally 
became dehydrated as a result 
i tried to go back and deal with it myself but basically i 
didnt deal with it she said

after nearly 40 years on their own members of 
the international longshoremens and warehousemens union will vote 
this week on whether to join the aflcio 
about 350 delegates of the west coast dockworkers union will 
vote at the ilwu international convention in vancouver british 
columbia on the possible affiliation 
in the late 1940s the ilwu was tossed out of the committee for 
industrial organizations a forerunner of the cio for alleged 
communist domination the cio merged with the afl in 1955 
i think its going to pass without any problems said john 
bukoskey the internationals representative for washington oregon 
and alaska but i think there will also be quite a bit of debate 
after all we were asked to leave 
he said that rejoining the federation would improve the ilwus 
bargaining power and its ability to lobby for national legislation 
ilwu president jimmy herman and aflcio president lane kirkland 
have agreed in principle to the reaffiliation said danny beagle 
spokesman for the san franciscobased ilwu 
the 24000member union was formed in 1937 when it broke with 
the new yorkbased international longshoremens association harry 
bridges led the ilwu from 1934 until 1977

the senate showed support monday for a 11 
trillion fiscal 1989 budget built to comply with deficitreduction 
promises while increasing spending for the aids fight the space 
program and education 
the spending plan cleared an initial parliamentary hurdle 830 
and debate began at the earliest date in years although the law 
allows 50 hours of debate time a final vote was considered 
possible by tuesday 
the smoothness of the process didnt stop an undercurrent of 
concern and frustration that the electionyear plan wasnt doing 
enough about the deficit 
were running just a few steps in front of the avalanche of 
death said sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the senate 
budget committee but given current political constraints he said 
the best the congress could do was make sure that next years 
burden grows no larger 
the estimated deficit of 136 billion would meet the mandate of 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law but it represents only a 
modest reduction in red ink from the 1467 billion predicted for 
the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
congress will have to do much better in the years to come 
said chiles who is retiring after this year 
chiles and sen pete v domenici of new mexico the budget 
committees senior republican drafted the budget in compliance 
with last falls deficit agreement between congressional leaders 
and president reagan 
the pact set overall spending guidelines and took away what is 
usually the biggest point of contention the balance between 
domestic and military spending 
under the agreement the senate budget proposes for the pentagon 
to spend 2940 billion next year domestic agencies would spend 
1692 billion while foreign aid would total 161 billion 
the agreement also predetermined that no new taxes would be 
included in the budget plan beyond the 14 billion in new taxes 
enacted last december 
the senate as the house did in adopting its budget last month 
was using the administrations optimistic assumptions about the 
nations economy the nonpartisan congressional budget office 
predicts a deficit some 35 billion above the grammrudman target 
within the overall guidelines of last falls agreement the 
senate proposal rearranges some domestic priorities that reagan 
proposed when he submitted his budget in february 
while many domestic agencies will face belttightening to absorb 
inflationary costs the budget rejects the presidents call for 
eliminating several domestic development and masstransit programs 
it also rejects his request for tightening up in the medicare 
system the deficitreduction agreement did not cover social 
security or most other benefit programs and none of this years 
budget plans has envisioned cuts in those areas 
the house and senate budgets like reagans proposal call for 
big spending increases on the space program research on aids 
education and air traffic safety 
the senate plan also endorses reagans plan to give a 43 
percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for civilian 
federal workers the house voted a 3 percent acrosstheboard raise 
the senate and house must settle on a single budget resolution 
before it becomes final the budget resolution is a guideline for 
congress fiscal legislation and it does not require the 
presidents signature

sen albert gore jr said monday that he is not 
in favor of a palestinian state but that some sort of temporary 
autonomy could be tested on the west bank 
i support the camp david formula which points us toward a 
period of limited autonomy during which israel and the 
palestinians would be able to judge what autonomy is like in 
practice gore said now the exact formula must be arrived at 
by the parties themselves 
those parties include israel jordan the palestinians and 
perhaps syria gore told reporters during a questionandanswer 
session in the board room at the new york stock exchange 
whatever happens gore said its unthinkable to have an 
armed military hostile presence so close to israels borders 
i think that the eventual formula has to involve assurances 
that israels security will not incur an additional threat said 
the democratic presidential aspirant from tennessee 
gore was in town campaigning for the delegaterich april 19 new 
york primary two hundred fiftyfive delegates are at stake for the 
three remaining democrats gore massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
and jesse jackson gore is far behind the other two in the delegate 
count 
before talking to reporters gore addressed leaders from the 
securities industry in the stock exchange board room 
during a wideranging session with reporters later gore said 
that he was glad jackson seemed to distance himself from the 
palestine liberation organization and that he always thought gov 
mario cuomo was not a candidate for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
on sunday jackson said that if he were elected president he 
would not meet with plo leader yasser arafat gore had criticized 
jackson for being too close to the plo and was asked by reporters 
monday if he took credit for what he termed a very useful 
statement from jackson 
no im not taking credit for that he deserves credit for 
it gore said but by raising the issues openly instead of just 
behind the scenes i think it makes it a healthy process and creates 
opportunities for questions and answers that break new ground 
the tennessee senator added that i think that one of the 
purposes that can be served by drawing contrasts in a primary 
campaign is by making it possible for candidates to more clearly 
elaborate their positions i know i have grown during this 
campaign i know the other candidates have 
also during the weekend cuomo said the correct interpretation 
of statements he has made is that he wouldnt accept a nomination 
draft if one were offered at the democratic convention next july 
he has encouraged people to look favorably at all the active 
candidates gore said i never thought he was a candidate 
because he told me he wasnt a candidate

despite the need to keep the entrance 
channel to cape canaveral free for submarine passage the federal 
government is taking the slow route in dredging the waterway in 
order to protect endangered sea turtles 
federal officials have hired a team of university of florida 
zoologists to study turtle populations at different times of the 
year to guide future channel dredging said karen bjorndal 
director of the archie carr center for sea turtle research at the 
university 
the us national marine fisheries service told the army corps 
of engineers to use only the safest dredging method to avoid 
harming the turtles she said 
the corps would like to use hopper dredging which sucks up 
sediment with a tremendous hydraulic force ms bjorndal said 
monday 
the problem is that the sea turtles get sucked up too and torn 
into pieces she said 
the alternative is clamshell dredging in which a large bucket 
slowly scoops up sediment 
while our work is basic research it has a great effect on 
potential management and conservation decisions said alan 
bolten one of the researchers who catch tag measure and 
determine the species and sex of each turtle the turtles are 
returned to the water within 30 minutes of their capture 
a twoday study doesnt give you enough information because of 
the dynamics of sea turtle distribution bolten said a number 
of years of data need to be collected for a bigger picture 
the team did one survey of the channel last month and plans 
return trips in may and september

movie critic rex reed pleaded guilty monday 
to two counts of attempting to evade the states income tax in a 
dispute he blamed on faulty advice from an accountant 
appearing in city police court reed 49 entered a guilty plea 
on the two misdemeanor counts that stemmed from his failing to file 
state returns in 1984 and 1985 while he was a columnist for the new 
york post 
he was fined 2000 and must pay 50 in court costs 
reed had already paid approximately 20000 in delinquent taxes 
penalties and interest to the state department of taxation and 
finance 
its ironic that this would happen on academy awards day he 
said afterward adding that he would miss attending the ceremony in 
person because he couldnt get a flight to los angeles from albany 
in time and would have to settle for watching it on television 
ill miss chers navel he quipped 
the tax department found that the post paid reed as an 
independent contractor for 1984 and 1985 therefore he was 
earning income from a new york state employer but had not filed 
the new york state returns said nancy connell a spokeswoman for 
the state attorney generals office 
reed said he could have avoided the 2000 fine if he were to 
prove that he was a connecticut resident during 1984 and 1985 but 
he didnt want to face the prolonged legal battle reed said it was 
easier for him to give them their pound of flesh for two thousand 
bucks 
tax officials said reeds primary address was new york city 
reed who currently appears on the television show at the 
movies worked as a columnist for the post from 1982 until last 
year he was also a columnist for the daily news for 12 years 
before writing for the post

that he found a 22caliber slug in the mans brain

parts of a burned 22caliber pistol were found near the body 
believed to be that of todd schenker the prosecutor said 
authorities found ammunition for the gun inside schenkers nearby 
house 
marshall county sheriff donald bordenkircher said a lack of 
dental records has stymied attempts to identify the remains 
positively however the sheriff said all evidence gathered so far 
points to schenker a former member of the hare krishna community 
at new vrindaban 
were not making any judgments at this time between homicide 
and suicide the medical evidence cant tell us that white said 
schenkers wife judith was taken to the ohio valley medical 
center for a psychiatric evaluation after members of the new 
vrindaban community told county mental health authorities that she 
had made suicidal comments the prosecutor said 
it was for her own protection he said 
gadadhar das a spokesman for new vrindaban said mrs schenker 
had mentioned suicide to several members of the community after the 
body was found 
we brought her in to the local authorities gadadhar said 
whether it be suicide or foul play we would like to see the 
whole thing straightened out weve cooperated fully with the

president reagan hailing the valiant 
struggle of the afghan people announced today that he will send 
secretary of state george shultz to geneva to sign the accord 
ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan 
i believe the united states can now join the soviet union as a 
guarantor of the geneva instruments reagan said of the accord 
which opens the way for the pullout of the 115000man red army and 
a return of millions of afghan refugees to afghanistan 
reagan said the proposed pact would provide for the complete 
withdrawal of soviet occupation forces from that country 
shultz is to represent the united states at the signing 
ceremony which is expected to be held thursday 
this development would not have been possible had it not been 
for the valiant struggle of the afghan people to rid their country 
of foreign occupation reagan said adding we take great pride 
in having assisted the afghan people in this triumph and they can 
count on our continued support 
reagan also lauded pakistan for its role as a home to millions 
of afghan refugees during the period of soviet domination of 
afghanistan 
shultz told reporters after reagans announcement that beginning 
may 15 the soviet union is to begin withdrawing its 115000 troops 
from afghanistan with 50 percent of the forces removed over a 
threemonth period all remaining soviet forces are to be out by 
feb 15 1989 
he said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has promised 
to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year ahead of the 
deadline he said the united states will push for that and expect 
that 
while hailing the agreement shultz said the withdrawal of 
soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter 
negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim 
government we know its not easy it will be hard shultz said 
underscoring reagans pledge of continued aid for the 
usbacked rebels shultz said we have stood by the afghan 
people during this 8 years and were prepared to stand by them in 
the coming months to help afghans return home and begin rebuild 
their lives and their country 
shultzs geneva trip gives him another chance to meet with 
shevardnadze before talks in moscow next week to continue 
preparations for the superpower summit meeting in the soviet 
capital beginning may 29 
prior to the announcement shultz reported to reagan on his 
middle east talks last week with arab and israeli leaders which 
failed to produce a breakthrough to negotiations but shultz vowed 
to find the time to return and to continue his effort 
setting the tone for the coming summit in moscow with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev reagan said sunday he looks forward to 
the signing of an agreement providing for the withdrawal of red 
army forces from afghanistan 
if that accord is complied with and soviets withdraw 
irrevocably from that longsuffering country this will be a great 
victory for its heroic people he said at a broadcasters 
convention in las vegas nev it will also be a major 
contribution to the improvement of eastwest relations 
however reagan said the russian economy remains in trouble and 
he doesnt know how the soviet union will be able to compete in a 
changing world marked by new technologies 
nations will have to grant to their scientists complete 
freedom of inquiry to their businessmen and entrepreneurs freedom 
to invest to risk to create new products and with them new 
markets reagan said 
the soviets and their clients must open their countries to 
everwider freedoms or they will see their economies indeed 
their whole way of life fall further behind he said 
reagan made only a passing reference to the agreement reached in 
geneva for the pullout of the soviets 115000 troops from 
afghanistan 
were very optimistic but nothing has been signed yet 
reagan told reporters 
the agreement is to be signed thursday 
the presidents top aides continued planning for the moscow 
summit while reagan and his wife nancy vacationed the past 10 
days at their mountaintop ranch near santa barbara calif they 
returned to washington on sunday 
the may 29june 2 summit with gorbachev is seen by many as the 
likely capstone to the reagan presidency with reagan spending much 
of the rest of the year on the 1988 political campaign trail 
reagan noted that the summit will come almost a year after he 
flew to west berlin to demand that the soviets destroy the berlin 
wall 
as i challenged him in berlin before the washington 
superpower summit i challenge mr gorbachev here today before 
the summit in moscow to tear down this other wall this grim 
invisible wall of oppression he said 
reagan said that while headway has been made on emigration 
peopletopeople exchanges between americans and russians and his 
own access to soviet television much more needs to be done 
reagan also called on gorbachev to work for more openness in the 
soviet union and the warsaw pact countries for western authors 
journalists and broadcasters

soviet television on monday condemned afghan 
guerrillas for shooting down a sovietbuilt passenger jet with 29 
people aboard after announcements that a negotiated end to the 
10yearold afghan war is near 
the national news program vremya showed wreckage strewn over 
a valley near the afghan city of maimaneh about 90 miles south of 
the soviet border 
a tass news agency commentary blamed the attack on the leaders 
of the peshawar seven the main guerrilla organization based in 
pakistan it accused the leaders of prolonging the bloodshed at a 
time when afghans were inspired by recent news from geneva that the 
fighting will cease and 115000 soviet soldiers will go home 
an afghan air force colonel told soviet tv that a us stinger 
missile had been used to down the plane carrying both government 
soldiers and civilians 
this act is especially cynical because it was committed when 
all afghan people were inspired by the joint sovietafghan 
statement by mikhail gorbachev and najib said the colonel 
identified only as zahir referring to thursdays announcement by 
the soviet and afghan leaders that all obstacles had been removed 
to the signing of a peace accord 
tass said guerrilla alliance leader gulbuddin hekmeyar vowed to 
carry on the armed fight and that the insurgents had already 
shot down several civilian planes and the number of those killed 
amounted to almost 200 it was not clear over how long a period 
of time the casualties were inflicted 
the leaders of the insurgents are unwilling to listen to the 
voice of reason and to join the settlement process tass said 
referring to najibs call for insurgents to lay down their arms and 
join his government 
pakistan and afghanistan have announced agreement on a package 
of measures to end the war in afghanistan between najibs army 
backed by about 115000 soviet soldiers and guerrilla forces based 
in pakistan and armed primarily by the united states 
the negotiated peace plan is to be signed on thursday in geneva 
where indirect talks moderated by un representative diego 
cordovez have been under way since 1983 
under the geneva plan soviet troops will begin leaving 
afghanistan on may 15 and at least half will be out within three 
months the remainder would be obligated to leave afghanistan 
within 10 months of the start of the pullout but soviet officials 
have indicated they plan to have their soldiers home by the end of 
this year 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 
the united states and the soviet union are expected to act as 
guarantors of the geneva agreement under a plan worked out behind 
the scenes that would ensure symmetry in continued aid to the 
warring sides 
afghan negotiators had insisted on an end to us weapons 
deliveries to the guerrillas once the soviet pullout began but 
american observers at the geneva talks refused to abide by it 
unless the kremlin stopped arming najibs troops 
soviet officials deemed the us demand an infringement of its 
right to enter into bilateral agreements with a sovereign neighbor 
and initially refused the symmetry plan 
but diplomatic and official sources have reported in recent days 
that moscow and washington have worked out an agreement ensuring a 
balance in aid or a moratorium on arms shipments to the warring 
sides 
earlier monday tass reported that insurgents attacked maimaneh 
killing 13 people and causing serious damage

a house subcommittee member raised the 
possibility monday of imposing criminal penalties against 
scientists who deliberately falsify their research but several 
whistleblowers protested that such a solution would be excessively 
harsh 
the suggestion of a federal statute making scientific fraud or 
misconduct a criminal offense was made by rep john conyers jr 
dmich at a hearing of the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
why are scientists in a different position from anyone else 
who acts against the public interest demanded conyers who also 
is a member of the house judiciary committee 
your point is an excellent one and it makes me squirm 
replied walter stewart a nerve cell researcher at the national 
institutes of health who is a parttime investigator of scientific 
misconduct in the research community 
but stewart and a colleague dr ned feder expressed concern 
that the threat of criminal penalties might create a damaging 
climate of fear among scientists 
two private whistleblowers professor robert l sprague of the 
university of illinois at urbanachampaign and dr jerome g 
jacobstein of the graduate hospital of the university of 
pennsylvania at philadelphia both said conyers idea was going 
too far 
sprague waged a nearly fouryear effort to call attention to 
scientific fraud committed by dr stephen breuning who used a 
grant from the national institute of mental health for research 
into drug treatment of mentally retarded patients 
jacobstein blew the whistle on dr jeffrey s borer a 
cardiologist and professor at cornell university medical college 
for allegedly inducing a medical student to make numerous 
misrepresentations in a report of their scientific study 
sprague expressed interest when the subcommittee chairman rep 
ted weiss dny suggested that one solution might be to create 
an antifraud watchdog organization within the scientific community 
it is not a question of too many watchdogs weiss said we 
seem to have no watchdogs at all in this situation 
weiss complained that neither the national institutes of health 
universities where research financed by nih grants is conducted 
nor the professional scientific societies has shown a willingness 
to guard against fraudulent research 
you cant have it both ways weiss said expressing sympathy 
with conyers suggestion for criminal penalties we cant have a 
continuation of flagrant abuses and say no one can be held 
accountable because it might hurt morale 
stewart agreed with conyers that scientific fraud threatens 
incredible harm and injury to the public but expressed 
optimism that scientists will find a way to police themselves 
without federal intervention 
replied conyers the whole point of criminal laws is to 
deter 
jacobstein said extreme forms of scientific fraud such as 
wholesale fabrication of research data is fairly rare but he 
estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of research papers contain 
unethically flawed results 
the whole climate just fosters this generally feeling that 
everyone does it he said 
stewart and feder who testified jointly said they have talked 
to considerably more than 20 scientists who have alleged 
misconduct to us privately but have been reluctant to make 
formal charges through the nih bureaucracy 
their reluctance strongly suggests to us that the reported 
cases of misconduct represent only a small fraction of the total 
they said 
based on questions raised by stewart and feder the nih has 
formed a special committee to investigate allegations that research 
data was misrepresented in a paper published by nobel laureate 
david baltimore director of the whitehead institute in boston and 
by therza imanishikari of tufts university 
baltimore who won the nobel prize in 1976 for research in 
cellular biology said last week that he welcomed the nih 
investigation baltimore said he hoped it would silence stewart and 
feder who he said had acted like a judge and jury in the case

vermont law school students 
discovered april 1 that the state was in the process of trying to 
buy their school 
it was a big story but it would have been bigger if it were 
true 
the biweekly school newspaper ran the april fools day gag on 
page one describing in great detail a complicated process by which 
the school would be purchased and then leased back 
i spent a lot of time researching to make sure the story was 
credible i wanted to make it as credible as possible said kurt 
terwilliger the author of the article maybe i got a little 
carried away 
the article never said it was an april fools joke and the 
newspaper was the same as usual except for the date march 32 
1988 
near the end of the article terwilliger reported that tuition 
would drop dramatically following the sale because of the states 
surplus and the taxexempt status of the school under state 
ownership 
the toogoodtobetrue news prompted students to overrun the 
business office with inquiries about the possibility of tuition 
rebates 
there were students coming into the business office in twos 
and threes said steve hesse editor of the forum

experts monday began defusing thousands of deadly missiles and 
grenades strewn around the capital after an explosion at an 
ammunition dump killed 93 people and injured 1100 
security forces and rescue teams also searched flattened 
buildings for hundreds of people still unaccounted for after 
sundays blast 
president mohammad zia ulhaq who cut short a visit to kuwait 
called the explosion an extraordinary accident 
zia refused to speculate on the cause of the fire which ignited 
the ammunition dump explosion at ojeri camp between the twin cities 
of islamabad and rawalpindi 
commenting on reports that some of the ordnance was earmarked 
for moslem guerrillas in afghanistan and that some empty casings 
bore chinese labels zia said its nothing but speculation a 
high measure of speculation 
witnesses saw burning trucks sunday near the depot bearing 
afghan license plates pakistan is a conduit for foreign military 
supplies and other aid to the afghan insurgents fighting the 
communist government in kabul backed by an estimated 115000 soviet 
troops 
zia who disclosed the number of dead and injured received 
messages of sympathy from various heads of state including a 
message from afghan president najib 
i wish to convey our deepest condolences to the families who 
suffered from this tragic incident and to all people of the 
republic of pakistan radio kabul monitored in islamabad quoted 
najibs message as saying 
streets in the two cities were littered with an estimated 6500 
unexploded antitank mortars rockets rocketpropelled grenades 
and other devices 
us embassy spokesman kent obee said the embassy had offered 
the pakistani government help in finding and clearing the weapons 
a fourman american explosives expert team arrived sunday night 
from the us task force in northern arabian sea 
obee said the team would also clear ammunition that fell in 10 
to 12 residences of us embassy employees there were no injuries 
or major damage he added 
he said the team began its work monday and will continue as long 
as needed he stressed that the americans would not investigate the 
blast 
zia said seven pakistani soldiers were killed and 32 injured in 
the explosion on monday he toured the areas around the blast site 
and visited hospitals to talk with the wounded 
police and army patrolled the streets and some people began 
repairing their houses 
pakistan radio and neighborhood mosques appealed for missing 
people 
prime minister mohammad khan junejo said the injured and the 
families of the bereaved will be compensated and ordered an enquiry 
into the cause of the explosion 
he also said all ammunition depots situated within populated 
areas will be shifted to safer and isolated places 
some western embassies said they received anonymous telephone 
calls warning of a terrorist bombing shortly before the depot blew 
up at about 10 am 
obee said the us embassy did not receive such a call 
shortly before the explosion a small group of moslem 
fundamentalists were preparing to march toward the us embassy to 
protest against israeli action against the palestinian uprising in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
in india two people were killed and at least 100 others injured 
monday when police clashed with mobs of students who tried to close 
shops in northern kashmir state to show sympathy for the victims of 
the weekend explosion 
the united news of india reported that the injured included 70 
policemen 
india and pakistan have fought three wars two of them over 
kashmir some of the moslems who predominate in kashmir state 
want to unite with pakistan

an american judge on the 
international court of justice said monday the united nations 
should step aside in its dispute with the reagan administration 
over the plos un office in new york 
a un official argued before the world court that the united 
states is ducking its international responsibility by trying to 
close the plo mission 
the diplomatic tugofwar stems from antiterrorist legislation 
signed by president reagan in december the law classifies the 
palestine liberation organization as a terrorist group and bars it 
from operating on us territory 
us attorney general edwin meese iii has tried to use the law 
to close the 14yearold mission with un observer status 
in mondays 90minute session of the world court american judge 
stephen m schwebel challenged a un claim that the reagan 
administration moves constitute an immediate threat to the plos 
presence in new york 
he said the united states has said it would wait for a ruling 
from a us district judge in new york and he said the united 
nations should do the same the us justice deparment has asked 
the judge to rule in favor of the closure in a case initially 
brought by the plo 
the united nations has asked the world court to issue an opinion 
against such a closure which has been denounced by all un 
members but israel and the united states the united nations says 
the dispute should be arbitrated by a special threemember panel 
the world court the uns judicial arm lacks legal powers to 
enforce its decisions and can only issue advisory opinions 
un undersecretarygeneral carlaugust fleischhauer of west 
germany said monday that the american move to close the plo office 
violates a 1947 agreement between the international organization 
and the truman administration 
the united nations says that accord which guarantees the 
unimpeded functioning of diplomats accredited to un headquarters 
also applies to missions with observer status 
the plo was granted permanent observer status at the united 
nations in 1974 and has maintained an office near un headquarters 
in manhattan ever since 
in a brief released by the court monday the united nations 
stated the question at issue goes far beyond the particular 
dispute and has farreaching consequences for the discharge of 
the responsibilities of the united nations in the world at large 
the court asked fleischhauer the uns undersecretarygeneral 
for legal affairs to respond in writing to its queries later this 
week fleischhauer told reporters monday he expected a decision by 
the end of may 
there were no representatives of either the reagan 
administration or the plo at the world court on monday

the airline smoking ban that goes into effect 
april 23 on commercial aircraft will apply to any flight scheduled 
for two hours or less even if delays cause the flight to take 
longer the federal aviation administration said monday 
congress required the smoking ban on short flights in 
legislation last year the faa issued its final rules on the 
prohibition monday although the general outline of the new 
restrictions has been known for months 
airlines since the first of the year have complied with a state 
law in california and banned smoking on flights within the state 
the law enacted by congress last year prohibits smoking on any 
flight of two hours or less on jet aircraft as well as smaller 
commuter planes charter flights and those involving travel clubs 
are exempt from the rules 
the faa clarifying details of the restrictions said monday 
that the length of the flight shall be determined by the elapsed 
time shown for the flight in the official airline guide should a 
flight be delayed so it takes longer than two hours the ban still 
is in effect the faa said 
the ban also will apply to each segment of a flight for example 
a flight that has three legs of 90 minutes 90 minutes and 2 hours 
would require that smoking be prohibited in the first two segments 
and allowed in the final segment according to the faa 
according to the rules flight attendants must remind passengers 
of the smoking ban during preflight briefings 
a passenger who violates the ban would face a civil fine of up 
to 1000 per offense any passenger who tampers with a smoke 
detector in an aircraft lavatory and tries to smoke could face a 
fine of up to 2000

archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
told a gathering of the worlds religious leaders and lawmakers on 
monday that environmental and political problems have imperiled the 
earth 
we are confronted by problems which transcend national and 
credal boundaries which are urgent and potentially terminal and 
which require not less than a global solution the archbishop 
told the conference which is debating global problems 
we live in a world society which desperately seeks some 
measure of world community in order to survive said runcie the 
spiritual head of the state church of england and leader of 70 
million anglicans worldwide 
in an apparent reference to the plight of hostages in the 
hijacked kuwaiti airliner in cyprus runcie said one crisis that 
had to be solved was the terrorism which fouls and feeds on 
global communciation 
runcie took part in the opening of the fiveday global 
conference of spiritual and parliamentary leaders on human survival 
earlier monday the organizers said china pulled out of the 
meeting expressing displeasure at the attendance of the dalai 
lama the spiritual and temporal leader of tibetan buddhism 
the conference is a gathering of the leaders of the worlds 
major religions and elected lawmakers and is aimed at putting their 
influence to work on solving dilemmas such as overpopulation and 
poverty 
in a message of good wishes to the conference indians prime 
minister rajiv gandhi said those who guide the destinies of 
spiritual affairs and those who forge the destinies of nations must 
share the same vision for the betterment of humanity 
about the pulling out of the chinese the very rev james parks 
morton a cochairman of the conference said we worked hard to 
get the chinese here because we are discussing issues of great 
concern to them like population growth 
morton dean of the episcopal cathedral of st john the divine 
in new york city said the leaders of the worlds most populous 
nation had earlier shown a willingness to attend the conference 
but although we had no formal complaint from the chinese 
government about the attendance of the dalai lama we did get a 
letter from one of their bigwigs saying they were not coming 
because he was here morton said 
the dalai lama fled to exile in india in 1959 after china 
invaded his country and has criticized chinas policies in tibet

farmers utilities and fish and game 
officials will be fighting over limited water supplies this summer 
as a major drought parches the west 
thats the big concern the juggling act with water said 
mick jennings a fish biologist for the oregon department of fish 
and wildlife in central point there are so many interests in 
water what might be best for one interest may not be best for 
another interest 
the bonneville power administration quit selling power to 
california last fall to make up for a drop in electricity produced 
by hydroelectric dams on the columbia river system 
but the big victims of the drought will be farmers ranchers and 
fish said wally gibson of the northwest power planning council 
the problem is severe on the fish and irrigation side not the 
power side 
in california san joaquin county already has declared a drought 
after noting snowpack and reservoir levels were approaching the 
lows that preceded the drought of 197677 
weve had a critical premature dieoff of range land and lots 
of water districts are cutting back on farm water allotments 
said ron baldwin coordinator of the san joaquin county office of 
emergency services 
the snowpack in california averages 35 percent of normal 
forcing some ranchers to sell cattle and appeal for federal grain 
subsidies as pastures dry up 
its scary its really scary said billy marr head of the 
tuolumne county water system in the sierra nevada which is 
considering rationing 
the west isnt alone in the southeast georgia alabama and 
south carolina are facing their fourth serious drought in eight 
years with some reservoirs at lower levels than they were at this 
point in the drought years of 1981 1986 and 1987 officials said 
earlier this month 
if we dont get a dramatic increase in rainfall well be 
looking at water restrictions this summer said david word chief 
of water resource management for the georgia department of natural 
resources 
in oregon snowpack and rainfall figures range from nearnormal 
in the northwestern part of the state to 36 percent of normal in 
the south 
ranchers in southeastern oregon are trucking water to their 
cattle as water holes dry up said jay carr an oregon state 
university extension agent in lakeview 
irrigation water will be in short supply for orchards hopyards 
vineyards and livestock around yakima wash on the drier eastern 
slopes of the cascades 
in seattle however unusually heavy rain and snow in march 
relieved fears of a second year of rationing reservoirs are up to 
94 percent of normal 
the outlook is grim in the regions forests which were heavily 
scarred by fires last summer 
southern oregons siskiyou national forest where 110000 acres 
burned already has started its fire season 
drought conditions dont guarantee a bad season said tim 
keith who oversees southwest oregon for the state department of 
forestry but they certainly elevate the potential 
timber companies worked feverishly over the winter and spring to 
stockpile logs 
companies are concerned that well have another serious fire 
season and theyll be locked out of the woods again said ron 
johnson timber staff coordinator for the us forest service 
regional office in portland last summer officials limited logging 
in high danger areas of oregon 
the oregon department of fish and wildlife is particularly 
worried about a disease called furunculosis killing off thousands 
of chinook salmon on their spawning run up southern oregons rogue 
river 
low flows mean warmer water which promote the growth of the 
bacteria said jennings low water also makes it tougher for fish 
to swim up rapids and falls bottling them up in crowded pools 
where the bacteria is more readily spread 
starting friday the corps is to flush immense volumes of water 
down the columbia and snake rivers to help young salmon smolts 
migrate to the ocean it also plans to use trucks and barges to 
carry many smolts around dams where they can be killed by 
hydroelectric turbines or spillway torrents 
the northwest power planning council is facing the prospect of 
less hydroelectricity from the dams on the columbia 
if we have to buy hydropower from canada or if we have to fire 
up the coal plants in oregon which are far more expensive than our 
hydropower we are likely to see some rate increases said 
council spokeswoman dulcy mahar

thailand is forming a new military unit 
to protect cambodian refugees after complaints that a paramilitary 
task force had robbed raped and killed refugees an officer said 
monday 
col sanam kajornklam of the supreme commands operations 
division said the displaced persons protection unit would be 
operating on the thaicambodian border by the end of june 
sanan said international organizations and western countries 
that contribute to the thai refugee relief effort had voiced 
concern about abuses by task force 80 which since 1980 has been in 
charge of security for a quarter million cambodians in camps along 
the border 
the cambodians fled brutal regimes food shortages and a 
guerrilla war in their homeland 
the western officials were concerned and said they would like 
to see improvements sanan said we also wanted to see changes 
and are responding to that 
by improving our people and increasing our responsibilities 
we will be able to provide better security to those inside the 
camps sanan said 
he said the army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh and the 
armed forces chief of staff gen sundhara kongsompong concluded 
in october that the paramilitary must be upgraded and staffed 
with people with caliber 
the new unit comprising 560 defense volunteers is to work 
together with the army and task force 80 sanan said 
the united states the un high commissioner for refugees 
voluntary organizations and the lawyers committee for human 
rights were among those who complained about the task force 
in an influential report issued in february 1987 a delegation 
from the new yorkbased lawyers committee said that its tour of 
the border area found an alarming incidence of abuse by the 
task force rangers 
rangers have robbed beaten and raped the residents of some 
camps with apparent impunity the report said the rangers 
conduct has generated an atmosphere of fear even among those who 
have not been personally victimized 
the rangers also have killed some refugees the report said 
one of the most publicized incidents took place in march 1986 
when three task force officers reportedly used a hot iron and 
burning firewood to torture three cambodians in the khaoidang 
refugee camp which is aided by the united nations the cambodian 
men were suspected of an armed raid on the camp 
thai government officials then denied there had been any torture 
western aid officials working on the border say that there have 
been fewer reported abuses by task force rangers in recent months

the federal trade commission on monday revived 
a complaint that an rj reynolds tobacco co advertisement in 1985 
misrepresented the results of a government study on the effects of 
smoking on health 
in a 41 vote the commission reversed a ruling made last august 
by an administrative law judge who had dismissed the complaint on 
grounds that the ad was an editorial and therefore was protected by 
first amendment guarantees on freedom of speech 
under mondays ftc order montgomery k hyun the administrative 
law judge who dismissed the complaint must reconsider his ruling 
in light of supreme court criteria on determining whether an 
advertisement is protected by the first amendment said dee 
ellison an ftc spokeswoman 
hyun must determine whether the fivemember commission has 
jurisdiction in the case ellison said 
the ftc staff in its original complaint filed in june 1986 
charged that rj reynolds made false or misleading statements in 
an advertisement of cigarettes and science which ran from 
march 1985 to june 1985 by stating that the study provided 
credible scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as 
the public or the reader has been led to believe 
the study called multiple risk factor intervention trial or mr 
fit was conducted by the national heart lung and blood institute 
of the national institutes of health said ellison 
the ftc complaint was based in part on the fact that reynolds 
failed to disclose in the ad that men in the study who quit smoking 
had a significantly lower rate of death from heart disease than men 
who continued to smoke ellison said we charged that omission 
of that information made the ad deceptive 
if the case is decided against reynolds the commission could 
bar the tobacco company from misrepresenting scientific studies but 
could not seek monetary penalties ellison said 
the company views it as a freedom of speech case 
floyd abrams an attorney representing rj reynolds said the 
company denies that it misrepresented the study but the basic 
issue here is who should decide that the government or the public 
as whole 
this advertisement is in our view protected by the same 
first amendment rights as if it were written by anyone in the 
world abrams said 
abrams said that although rj reynolds has not yet had a chance 
to review the entire ruling it will consider all its legal 
options including a possible appeal to the us court of appeals 
in washington or asking the commission to stay further proceedings 
on issue 
remanding to the case to the administrative law judge said 
abrams is unneccesary and in flat violation of the first 
amendment one would not ask the writer or an oped piece why he 
wrote it 
ftc chairman daniel oliver cast the single dissenting vote on 
the case agreeing with reynolds that it is critical for first 
amendment purposes that the public and not the government decide 
the answer to this question 
the coalition on smoking or health which had petitioned the ftc 
to rule against the ad applauded the new ftc ruling 
coalition chairman scott d ballin said the decision means the 
federal government has the power to prevent rjr or any company with 
commerical motives from deliberately misleading consumers about the 
safety of its products by discussing a madeup scientific 
controversy through advertisements that look like editorials 
the coalition comprises the american heart association the 
american lung association and the american cancer society 
rj reynolds based in winstonsalem nc sells 20 brands of 
cigarettes and accounts for about onethird of the us cigarette 
market according to company statistics

president reagan on monday directed secretary 
of state george p shultz to go to geneva to sign historic 
accords by which the united states and soviet union will 
guarantee a peace agreement dictating the removal of all red army 
troops from afghanistan 
reagan called the pact a triumph for the usbacked 
insurgents after a bloody eightyear war with the sovietsupported 
kabul regime he said the rebels can count on our continued 
support 
the rebels have rejected the peace pact and have vowed to 
continue fighting under a compromise with moscow the united 
states will continue sending weapons to the rebels while the 
kremlin continues providing arms to the marxist government 
reagan made the announcement in the sunsplashed rose garden 
before a ceremony to congratulate the mens and womens ncaa 
basketball champions 
this is the first time in the history of the soviet union that 
they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to 
withdraw shultz said later at a white house press briefing 
the peace settlement negotiated between pakistan and 
afghanistan under the auspices of the united nations is to be 
signed on thursday 
shultz acknowledged that the removal of soviet troops will not 
necessarily mean an end to the fighting once the red army is 
withdrawn shultz said then the people of afghanistan have got 
to work things out thats their right and their problem 
perhaps we can get to a period of at least relative stability 
in the rose garden a reporter shouted to reagan that the rebels 
feel they are being sold out by the united states and will not be 
bound by the accord we are not reagan replied 
beginning may 15 the soviet union is to begin withdrawing its 
115000 troops with 50 percent of the forces removed over a 
threemonth period all remaining soviet forces are to be out by 
feb 15 1989 
shultz said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has 
promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year ahead 
of the deadline he said the united states will push for that and 
expect that 
while hailing the agreement shultz said the withdrawal of 
soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter 
negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim 
government we know its not easy it will be hard shultz said 
he said the united states will help the rebels as needed 
but on capitol hill sen gordon humphrey rnh denounced the 
agreement as amounting to a slowmotionsellout of the 
resistance fighters 
its a poor deal a very bad deal he said the soviets 
are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist 
puppet regime in kabul just as lavishly as they please while 
denying the united states the right to resupply the afghan rebels 
the accord calls for the return to afghanistan of millions of 
afghan refugees most of whom moved to neighboring pakistan 
undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from 
outside afghanistan into afghanistan by the millions shultz 
said so there will be immense social dislocation and potential 
for suffering and we and others in the international community 
will want to do everything we can to ease that transition shultz 
said 
the united states has urged the appointment of a special un 
coordinator to oversee the repatriation 
in our view the soviet union having inflicted so much 
suffering on the afghan people have a special obligation to 
provide resources for this resettlement shultz said 
underscoring reagans pledge of continued aid for the rebels 
shultz said we have stood by the afghan people during this 8 
years and were prepared to stand by them in the coming months to 
help afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their 
country 
reagan made the announcement after being briefed by shultz on 
details of the agreement 
i believe the us can now join the soviet union as a 
guarantor of the geneva instruments reagan said i have 
therefore asked secretary shultz to represent us at a signing 
ceremony for the historic accords 
this development would not have been possible had it not been 
for the valiant struggle of the afghan people to rid their country 
of foreign occupation reagan said we take great pride in 
having assisted the afghan people in this triumph and they can 
count on our continued support

the worlds oldest olympic champion last 
saw his two medals nearly 60 years ago somehow says abel kiviat 
the gold and silver medals got misplaced and were never found 
but this week kiviat 95 who ran in the 1912 stockholm games 
and was the roommate of jim thorpe will get duplicates of the 
medals from the greatgrandson of the man who presented him with 
the originals 
king carl xvi gustaf of sweden is to present kiviat with the 
specially crafted medals thursday during a visit to trenton 
glenn kasper a member of the governors council on physical 
fitness came up with the idea of replacing the original medals 
after taking kiviat home from an olympic fundraising event in 
february 
we were driving and my wife said abel where are your 
olympic medals he said to tell you the truth i havent seen 
them in almost 60 years kasper said 
i knew the king and queen were coming here and i thought 
wouldnt it be great if we could get replacement medals to give to 
abel kasper said 
within 10 days of contacting international olympic committee 
president juan antonio samaranch kasper had samaranchs approval 
and copies of the medals in hand 
the duplicates were made by a swiss company using the same molds 
from which the 1912 medals were cast the international olympic 
committee picked up the cost 
how the originals were lost is not entirely clear 
kiviat who was not available for an interview monday afternoon 
told kasper that his family just misplaced them possibly 
during a move to a new home kasper said 
in the 1912 olympics kiviat won the silver medal in the 
1500meter run and the gold medal in the 3000meter crosscountry 
event 
kiviat later worked as a court clerk in us district court in 
manhattan before retiring he now lives in the central new jersey 
community of lakehurst and makes occasional appearances to generate 
support for amateur athletics 
we felt replacing abels medals would be a fitting gesture to 
thank him for the support he has given the governors council 
said ralph dougan executive director of the physical fitness 
council

an ambitious plan to make massachusetts the first 
state to guarantee affordable child care for every child under 14 
was unveiled monday although its sponsor said he didnt know how 
it would be funded 
we are in the midst of a childcare crisis said state rep 
david b cohen cochairman of a special childcare commission 
it is a crisis which affects our children our families and our 
economy 
cohen chief sponsor of the bill to create a cabinetlevel 
executive office of child care to oversee and expand current 
childcare services said three out of five massachusetts children 
need child care because both their parents work or they have a 
single parent who works 
currently the state is providing services to about 80000 
children at an annual cost of 110 million primarily through 
subsidies to the poor he said 
but cohen said conservative estimates point to another 80000 
children whose families cannot find childcare services and 80000 
more whose parents cant find services at a price they can afford 
this crisis will only grow in the future cohen joined by 
other child care advocates told a statehouse news conference 
cohens bill doesnt say exactly how or when the state will meet 
these needs 
the measure would create a 21member gubernatorially appointed 
advisory commission to counsel the child care secretary on how to 
accomplish the mandate 
he said the proposal could double or triple current state 
spending on childcare programs but added the only thing that 
will be more expensive is not providing universal child care 
without it we may find that our economic boom will go bust 
gov michael s dukakis administration has taken no position on 
the proposal which now goes before the legislatures human 
services committee 
asked what the administrations initial reaction was cohen 
said well they broke out in a rash but he said the 
administration hasnt dismissed the idea

police searched monday for a murder 
suspect who drove off in a prisoner transport van after his guards 
went into a convenience store and left the keys in the ignition 
richard lacy letner jr charged in the torturemurder of nurse 
ivon pontbriant of visalia calif kicked out a passengerdoor 
window in the back of the van and drove away in handcuffs sunday 
afternoon said san antonio police spokeswoman sandy perez 
letner 27 drove about a block before using the keys to unlock 
his shackles and then fleeing on foot the suspect who was 
captured in iowa and was being returned to california was one of 
nine prisoners in the van 
interstate extraditions of bloomington ill was transporting 
the men across the country the private firm uses former law 
enforcement officers to ferry 3000 prisoners a year 
i would certainly consider him very dangerous in light of the 
escape and because the information from the murder case alludes 
to that visalia police sgt john gomes said of letner 
jim kuczek chief executive officer of interstate extraditions 
said the prisoner van was en route to silver city nm before 
going on to california but came to texas to make four more 
prisoner pickup stops in beeville and lubbock 
he declined to say if the two guards with more than 20 years 
combined law enforcement experience between them would be 
disciplined 
our procedures indicate that one of the officers should be 
with the vehicle at all times and that the keys should not be left 
in the vehicle kuczek said they officers were saying that 
they were hot and needed air and the prisoners wanted the air 
conditioner to be left on 
letner must have been quite an acrobat we have never had an 
escape like that he added 
shortly after the guards went into the store letner kicked out 
a rear window and managed to drive the van about a block he then 
used other keys on the ring to unlock his handcuffs and shackles 
before abandoning the van authorities said 
none of the other prisoners left the van 
helicopters and dogs were used to search for letner on sunday 
perez said and an allpoints bulletin was issued with letners 
description 
ms pontbriants body was found march 2 in her apartment with a 
telephone cord wrapped around her neck and several stab wounds 
authorities said 
earlier that morning letner and another suspect christopher 
tobin 26 had been found in the womans car but officials did not 
know about the killing gomes said 
about 20 hours later authorities learned about the slaying and 
linked letner and tobin to the killing gomes said 
the suspects were arrested march 29 in council bluffs iowa 
gomes said 
two visalia police officers went to iowa to pickup the 
prisoners but because of restrictions allowing only one prisoner 
per flight only tobin was returned to visalia gomes said

the most detailed assessment of the nations 
business schools in nearly 30 years found widespread complacency 
poor planning and a lack of contact with the business world 
but the 372page report released monday at a national 
convention of business schools drew immediate fire from deans and 
corporate officials who said the report didnt go far enough in 
addressing social and ethical issues including minority 
recruitment 
while both corporate and academic leaders believe business 
schools are performing reasonably well at present they are in 
danger of drifting casually toward the 21st century without 
careful thought and strategic planning about the roles their 
graduates will play in the changing world of business the study 
said 
it chided schools for preaching longterm planning in the 
corporate world but doing little planning themselves beyond the 
next semester 
businesses for their part typically feel they can safely 
ignore most business school research with impunity the report 
said 
the report management education and development drift or 
thrust into the 21st century was commissioned by the american 
assembly of collegiate schools of business an accrediting body 
whose 254 member schools award about 55 percent of all business 
degrees awarded annually 
the report was compiled by lyman porter and lawrence mckibbin 
after a threeyear study of the nations business schools the 
researchers interviewed deans professors placement directors and 
others on 60 campuses as well as chief executives college 
recruiters and those responsible for executive development from 50 
privatesector organizations 
in addition the data includes results from 10000 extensive 
questionnaires mailed to a similar audience 
i was disappointed that after three years of work the 
politics of an organization this large seems to have watered down 
everything said john rosenblum dean of the university of 
virginias graduate school of business 
it just wasnt strong enough he added i think one could 
have left with the impression that we really are all right i dont 
think were all right 
porter a professor at the graduate school of management at the 
university of california at irvine said the report could not 
answer all the concerns of the business or educational communities 
but after the research was complete he said he was pleased to see 
how well the corporations thought of the preparations for their 
employees 
the reactions from the business community were more positive 
than we had anticipated porter said 
mckibbin a professor of management at the university of 
oklahoma agreed 
when we went in we expected to be tonguelashed by our 
colleagues in he corporate world mckibbin said that didnt 
happen at all 
bob pike a spokesman for procter amp gamble said the report 
failed to address the diversity of our work force were looking 
very carefully at things like the minority enrollments in business 
colleges and other social issues our company and many major firms 
are very concerned about these things 
the report concluded business schools were lax in forecasting 
and meeting future trends in the business community 
complacency and selfsatisfaction appear to be the dominant 
attitudes in many schools porter and mckibbin reported there 
is little perceived need for major changes in the way in which 
collegiate management education is carried out 
this is our opportunity to see that and change our 
complacency said richard lewis dean of the business school at 
the university of michigan this could be the single most 
important factor coming out of the study 
since the last major study of business schools in 1959 by 
stanford university business professor james howell the number of 
bachelors degrees in business increased from 50000 to about 
250000 in 1985 and masters degrees increased from 5000 to 
60000 
the study cites the need for improved communication between 
business and business schools greater program diversity among the 
schools more varied and generalized curriculum at each school and 
greater planning for lifelong executive education 
corporations surveyed seemed reasonably satisfied with the job 
business schools are doing preparing future employees but the 
report said managers and executives would like to see more 
realistic practical handson education with greater emphasis on 
behaviorally oriented subject matter in the curriculum and the 
development of people skills

authors saul bellow and studs terkel talked 
monday about a familiar topic writers and writing but to an 
unfamiliar audience a big chunk of their listeners will tune in 
on radios in the soviet union 
the topic was glasnost the new policy of openness promoted 
by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and how writers might help 
foster greater understanding between their two countries 
the program originating live on public radio wbez in chicago 
with panelists commenting by telephone from kiev was recorded for 
broadcast sometime later this week in that city in the soviet 
ukraine 
i think we can say the cold war days have basically had it 
said terkel the chicagobased author and interviewer known for 
such books as working and the good war 
im happy to say that a recent poll revealed that the 
american people think drugs is the biggest fear and not communism 
it shows there is more curiosity than antipathy when the soviet 
union is mentioned today he said 
panelists in kiev and chicago lauded the more tolerant attitude 
towards art and artists in the soviet union 
but alexi gubenko chief correspondent for radio kiev opened 
the 75minute program with an apology to bellow the nobel and 
pulitzer prizewinning novelist whose works have not been ranslated 
into russian 
i can say the ice has already melted in many ways yet it 
is very sad that such distinguished writers as mr bellow are not 
available at this time gubenko said 
i met mr gorbachev at the white house recently bellow 
said but i didnt get a chance to ask him about it 
on a more serious note bellow noted that proposed cultural 
exchanges of the past had promised more than theyd delivered the 
author of the adventures of augie march and most recently 
more die of heartbreak added he hoped that wouldnt be the 
case with glasnost 
soviet writer and critic ivan drach said from kiev that the 
profusion of literary journals in kiev alone and the freedom to 
publish works that had been banned for years suggested glasnost 
would lead to fundamental changes in soviet life 
indeed we said too many sweet words about our past reality 
drach said through a translator the problems have been raised 
the problems are many but at last they are being discussed

private gifts to the nations colleges and 
universities rose a record 11 billion to 85 billion in 198687 
boosted by a sharp increase in alumni contributions according to 
an annual survey 
for the second straight year stanford university was the most 
successful fundraiser with 1985 million topping harvard 
university which raised 178 million 
the 198687 survey results gathered by the council for aid to 
education were projected from data reported by 1174 colleges and 
universities which together account for about 85 percent of all 
private giving to higher education 
council president john r haire said several factors explain the 
unusual rise in contributions the percentage of the population 
with four years or more of college doubled since 1970 meaning more 
people were in a position to give 
colleges were more aggressive in making their case for 
donations haire added and the stock market was still booming in 
198687 
among the survey findings 
support from all sources reached 85 billion up 149 percent 
from the 74 billion raised in 198586

arabamerican supporters of jesse jackson 
splintered bitterly monday over the democratic presidential 
hopefuls latest comments on the middle east with one group asking 
why he had chosen to abandon your principles 
your comments in new york have the appearance of tailoring 
your positions on critical issues to suit the narrow political 
views of powerful special interest groups said abdeen jabara 
president of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee in a 
letter to jackson 
but james zogby executive director of the arabamerican 
institute said suggestions that jackson has shifted are grossly 
exaggerating what happened 
one cant erase a nineyear commitment to palestinian rights 
and to peace and justice for both israelis and palestinians in just 
one day zogby said in a statement issued by his office 
arabamericans in new york and across the nation are strongly 
committed to jacksons campaign 
the institute also released a statement from edward said a 
columbia university professor said is a member of the palestine 
national council often called the political wing of the plo and 
met with secretary of state george shultz in a controversial 
washington session last month 
i feel that rev jackson remains the only presidential 
candidate responsive to arab and palestinian concerns he has never 
backed away from defending the rights of the palestinian people 
whom he described this morning as sovereign said said 
jackson has long been outspoken about a need to meet the 
palestinians needs in any middle east peace agreement and 
arabamericans have provided money and votes to his 1984 and 1988 
campaigns 
on sunday jackson seemed to distance himself from the palestine 
liberation organization and he said that as president he would 
not sit down with plo leader yasser arafat 
we must not equate arafat and the plo with a sovereign people 
the palestinian people he said 
asked on monday to expand that stand jackson said 
it would not be a good approach to start at the table with the 
most extreme elements thats a formula for catastrophe 
jabara said in his letter that jackson is pandering to jewish 
voters in the april 19 new york primary 
on behalf of tens of thousands of arabamericans i wish to 
express my sadness that you felt the need to abandon your 
principles in your campaign for public office jabara wrote 
virtually every arabamerican looked to you as the one symbol of 
strength in a field of political candidates who are notorious for 
their unwillingness to stand up to the proisrael lobby 
in particular jabara said the plo is the spokesman for the 
palestinians 
you know full well that virtually all palestinians regard the 
plo as their sole legitimate representative he said your 
attempts to distinguish the plo from the palestinian people will 
not improve your position with jewish voters in new york but will 
sadly raise questions among your traditional supporters as to your 
willingess to stand firm on principle

spice imports totaled about 439 million last 
year up 12 percent from 1986 the agriculture department said 
monday 
the rise was due mainly to larger imports of vanilla beans 
white pepper nutmeg and mace cassia cumin anise capsicum 
peppers laurel and thyme the departments foreign agricultural 
service reported higher prices of many of the items also were a 
factor 
saffron prices have soared in recent months reflecting a 
short spanish crop the report said

scientists are looking at the neem tree of 
asia and africa as a possible source of material to prevent the 
formation of aflatoxin a naturally occurring food toxin the 
agriculture department said monday 
aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that form on some farm crops 
including corn and oilseeds laboratory tests with animals have 
shown that aflatoxin is among the most powerful cancercausing 
agents known and usda has called it a potential hazard to 
humans 
usda scientist deepak bhatnagar said that as a child in india 
his parents often put leaves of the neem tree inside containers of 
wheat to keep insects from the grain now he has found that the 
leaves also may block fungi from producing aflatoxin 
in tests at the departments agricultural research service 
center in new orleans bhatnagar made solutions containing neem 
leaves he found that the solutions didnt kill the fungi but did 
block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would 
have produced 
the fungi that produce the toxin are aspergillus flavus and a 
parasiticus 
bhatnagar said the results were promising but preliminary 
and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned 
the ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim more than 
80 insect pests including mexican bean beetles colorado potato 
beetles tobacco budworms and carpet beetles are repelled by neem 
extracts

an experimental program using herbicides to 
destroy coca plants is bringing good results and may prove a major 
weapon against cocaine trafficking us attorney general edwin 
meese said monday 
peru has been one of the leaders in the use of herbicides for 
eradicating coca plants we have been cooperating with peru in 
these experimental studies meese said at a news conference 
he later flew to santa cruz bolivia the last stop on his 
weeklong tour of latin american countries where drug trafficking is 
a major problem his threeday visit to bolivia will include a trip 
to the cocaineproducing lowlands of the chapare region 
meese said he agreed with peruvian officials that no herbicide 
should be used on a large scale if it causes ecological damage 
early results have indicated the development of a herbicide 
that does not harm other plants meese said without providing 
details 
the pilot project using herbicides may eventually replace the 
system of manually uprooting the plants the us embassy said 
washington is paying for the experiment 
meese arrived in peru on saturday and toured the huallaga valley 
on sunday 
the valley located on the junglecloaked eastern slopes of the 
andes is the center of coca leaf growing in peru us drug 
enforcement administration officials say more than 60 percent of 
the worlds coca is grown in peru 
in the past year the shining path a maoist guerrilla group has 
agreed to protect cocaine traffickers in the valley in exchange for 
a share of the drug barons multimillion dollar earnings 
meese flew low over the valley to observe coca plots and 
officials traveling with him said he expressed amazement at the 
number of clandestine airstrips and jungle clearings where coca 
grows 
peruvian antidrug police have blown up more than 170 airstrips 
since 1985 but most have been repaired in a matter of days by drug 
traffickers 
more than 250000 peruvians live by growing coca and processing 
the leaves into semirefined cocaine 
the coca paste is refined into pure cocaine in colombia and 
smuggled to the united states and europe 
meese began his tour in the dominican republic last wednesday 
and visited colombia and ecuador before arriving in peru

attorney general edwin meese iii asked his 
longtime friend e robert wallach if he was interested in taking 
a key justice departent post a week or so before being notified 
formally that wallach was under criminal investigation in the 
wedtech scandal a lawyer for meese said monday 
meese and wallach conducted job talks concerning the thenvacant 
post of counselor to the attorney general in limited discussions 
held in late march or early april 1987 meese attorney james 
rocap said 
meese recalls that he was clearly interested in having bob 
wallach at that time come into the department but that no formal 
offer was ever advanced to him rocap said 
the arrangement between the two men was that wallach had to 
make some decisions about what he wanted to do whether he was 
interested in the justice department position said rocap adding 
that wallach was to get back to meese but that never took 
place because the criminal investigation of wallach intervened 
the 77500ayear job of counselor is a position traditionally 
held by one of the most trusted advisers to an attorney general 
rocap said he does not know whether meese or wallach initiated 
the job talks or how many there were 
meese is on a trip to south america this week and was not 
immediately available for comment 
around april 8 1987 the attorney general was notified formally 
under an administrative mechanism involving the fbi that wallach 
had become a subject of the criminal investigation into 
scandalplagued wedtech corp 
rocap characterized as ridiculous unbelievable suggestions 
by columnists rowland evans and robert novak that meese had 
considered the idea of bringing wallach into the justice department 
to be a live possibility until last december when wallach was 
indicted in the wedtech scandal 
when mr meese was told that wallach had become a subject of 
the investigation in april that intervening event terminated 
essentially any substantive discussions of any kind between the 
two men rocap said 
rocap also said meese and wallach considered installing wallach 
on an advisory commission of outside experts in 1985 to examine the 
administration of the justice department and suggest possible 
changes the commission apparently the idea of meese and wallach 
was never created 
the counselors job was vacant after t kenneth cribb jr a 
member of meeses inner circle of conservative advisers went to 
the white house early in march 1987 to handle the transition of 
incoming chief of staff howard baker cribb is now assistant to the 
president for domestic affairs 
the justice department counselors post was filled last may 18 
by assistant attorney general william bradford reynolds head of 
the departments civil rights division 
after being notified officially in early april that wallach a 
san francisco lawyer and longtime friend was under investigation 
meese removed himself from involvement in the wedtech inquiry 
which was being conducted by us attorney rudolph giuliani of new 
york 
however giulianis investigation had been under way since the 
previous fall amid widespread public attention to the fact that 
wallach had done work for the company it was common knowledge at 
the justice department in washington late in 1986 that wallach who 
had received 13 million from wedtech would shortly become the 
focus of criminal investigators 
rocap said however that as of the time of these discussions 
with wallach it was mr meeses understanding that wallachs role 
in the investigation was simply as a witness meese had no 
reason to believe that mr wallach had been engaged in any kind of 
impropriety in late march or early april 1987 said rocap 
a federal grand jury which indicted wallach alleged that he and 
meeses financial manager wedtech consultant w franklyn chinn 
had funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from the 
bronx ny defense contractor in an attempt to influence meese 
and other public officials to help the company 
rocap represents meese in the 11monthold criminal 
investigation of the attorney generals involvement with wedtech 
and other matters including a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline in 
which wallach represented one of the partners 
at wallachs behest meese when he was white house counselor 
intervened on behalf of wedtech in its efforts to win a 32 million 
nobid contract from the army wedtech got the contract in 1982 
after a crucial white house meeting called by meeses deputy 
at a trial last october of two maryland politicians stemming 
from the wedtech scandal mario moreno a former wedtech executive 
and government witness testified that he had illegally paid 
advances to wallach in 1985 in anticipation that wallach would take 
a top justice department post 
in one occasion he wallach told me that he would become the 
attorney generals chief of staff and that therefore we should make 
certain payments ahead of time so that while he was there he would 
continue to help the company moreno testified saying that there 
were several such payments to wallach

more than 2000 chinese studying in the united 
states canada and switzerland have signed a letter to their 
government opposing a plan to cut the number of students abroad a 
student organizer said monday 
the letter which was a revised version of a petition prepared 
two weeks ago was delivered to chinese officials on sunday 
a spokesman at the chinese embassy in washington said the letter 
was an inappropriate way to express discontent 
he denied that chinas policy of sending students abroad would 
change 
according to official reports in the chinese press and a chinese 
document seen in new york china will let 3000 students leave 
china this year of them 600 will be sent to the united states 
last year 8000 chinese students came to the united states 
alone in all 40000 chinese students are studying worldwide 
about 27000 of them in america 
the embassy spokesman on monday confirmed the existence of the 
document but said china was using it only as a test 
we may change this document after using it for a couple of 
months he said 
boston university history professor merle goldman said the new 
policy was aimed at limiting the wests influence on china 
the students letter urged the beijing government to continue 
chinas open door policy started by chinese leader deng 
xiaoping in 1979 
the policy seeks to improve chinas economy by opening it to the 
west 
the letter also demanded that chinese citizens be given the 
fundamental right to study wherever they wish for as long as 
they wish 
the recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseas 
study are fundamentally in conflict with the declared national 
policy of reform and open door the letter said 
a chinese student organizer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said 2132 chinese students from 141 research 
institutions and universities in 38 american states had signed the 
letter 
several students from canada and switzerland also signed the 
petition he said although he did not specify the number 
of the signatories 1279 provided their real names an act ms 
goldman described as courageous 
the students could be subject to reprisals once they return 
home she said they could lose good jobs even their relatives 
could suffer 
the letter marked the second time chinese students in the united 
states have banded together to oppose policy changes in beijing 
in january 1987 more than 1000 students signed a letter to the 
beijing government criticizing a crackdown on their fellow students 
in china who had demonstrated for democracy in late 1986 
of those students 482 signed their real names 
chinese students said most of those who signed the letters 
ranged from their late 20s to their mid40s the generation raised 
during chinas ultraleftist cultural revolution which lasted from 
1965 to 1975 
ms goldman said this was significant because it showed the 
affect that decade had on many chinese 
mao tsetung taught them to criticize and question everything 
and thats what theyre doing she said

the government announced monday that it will 
immediately begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal 
aliens who overstayed their student and tourist visas 
until further notice the immigration and naturalization service 
also said it will defer the fee for such applications and issue a 
temporary work authorization card in accordance with a court 
directive 
the action is in response to a decision by us district judge 
stanley sporkin sporkin ruled march 30 that the reagan 
administration must broaden its standard for determining whether 
illegal aliens who had overstayed tourist and student visas can 
obtain amnesty under the 1986 immigration law 
last week sporkin directed ins to accept the applications 
without the customary 185 individual filing fee 
ins regulations originally stipulated that nonimmigrant aliens 
who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that 
any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention 
of the ins before jan 1 1982 for them to qualify for the amnesty 
program 
in a ruling on a classaction suit sporkin said the regulation 
was too restrictive and declared that congress intended the law to 
mean that any government record such as tax or social security 
documents could be used to document that an illegal alien was 
known to federal authorities as of jan 1 1982 
immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least 
50000 people 
under the 1986 immigration law illegal aliens who have been in 
the country at least since jan 1 1982 may qualify for legalized 
status a 12month application period for the amnesty program is 
due to expire may 4

the government withdrew thousands 
of soldiers from the streets of the capital monday and businesses 
reopened for the first time after violent antius demonstrations 
last week 
restrictions imposed on two cities under a temporary state of 
emergency remained in effect but the government said the emergency 
might be lifted later this week if no further trouble was reported 
protesters attacked and burned the us consulate thursday night 
after a honduran man suspected of drug trafficking was arrested and 
flown to the united states five hondurans were killed in the 
violence the honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of 
honduran citizens 
the state of emergency imposed friday gave authorities the power 
to ban public demonstrations and restrict freedom of movement in 
the capital of tegucigalpa and san pedro sula 125 miles to the 
north the cities are the largest in honduras 
many businesses closed friday as students filled the street for 
an antiamerican demonstration they remained shut saturday as 
thousands of police and soldiers patrolled the tense capital 
major manuel antonio urbina chief police spokesman said 
authorities had detained at least 70 people believed involved in 
the attack on the embassy facilities 
military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
number of people arrested in connection with demonstrations and 
looting could climb to 300 in tegucigalpa and san pedro sula 
thursday nights violence began during a studentled 
demonstration against the april 5 arrest of juan ramon matta 
honduran officials took matta from his tegucigalpa home in a 
predawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the dominican 
republic without a passport 
dominican republic officials later put matta on a new yorkbound 
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by us marshals 
according to us law enforcement officials 
matta held at a maximumsecurity federal prison in marion 
ill was wanted by us officials for questioning in the 1985 
slaying in mexico of a us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena salazar he is also wanted on drug charges in the 
united states 
honduran legislators criticized the incident and the foreign 
ministry launched an investigation 
the violent demonstration was unusual in honduras one of the 
united states closest allies in central america 
about 4000 soldiers and police many in tanks and trucks 
patrolled tegucigalpa and san pedro sula on saturday and sunday 
presidential spokesman lisandro quesada said monday that 
president jose azcona hoyo received repeated death threats in 
anonymous telephone calls over the weekend 
monsignor hector enrique santos archbishop of tegucigalpa said 
in an interview that the demonstrations showed barbaric 
instincts and dealt a blow against the democratic continuity of 
honduras because they tend to undermine human coexistence 
jaime rosenthal oliva one of the nations three vice 
presidents said the violence occurred because the government 
violated the constitution in permitting mattas extradition 
i admire the us fight to eliminate drug trafficking but i 
consider that that nation has sufficient resources to accuse any 
drug trafficker who lives here so that he can be judged in honduras 
after legal evidence is presented he said

texas aampm university nautical 
archaeologists excavating the submerged half of jamaicas port 
royal found remains of a child killed as he tried to flee during an 
earthquake nearly 300 years ago the university said monday 
the partial skeleton of the child probably no older than 6 was 
the first found in such a complete state during seven seasons of 
digging in the sunken city said project leader don hamilton 
port royal once home to english buccaneers and to a young naval 
officer named horatio nelson boasted a welltodo population of 
about 8000 at the time of the quake 
but on june 7 1692 tremors over a period of roughly 30 minutes 
dropped blocks of the city into the bay killing 2000 residents 
nearly 300 years later texas aampm researchers will resume their 
archival work on items recovered so far the university said the 
project will be featured may 2 in the pbs series underwater 
discoveries 
among other finds from the latest round of excavations is what 
appears to be part of the living quarters of welltodo merchants 
remains of a window complete with its slender lead frame have been 
recovered where the front of a twostory house smashed to the 
street during one of the tremors hamilton said 
from what is probably the kitchen have come brass cooking pots 
sieves pewter bowls a womans gold ring candlesticks and 
porcelain dishes the almostintact remains of a cricket were found 
in an unbroken wine bottle excavated where mud had trapped the 
insect 
port royal across the bay from modernday kingston once was 
rivaled only by boston as a center of british commerce in the 
americas residents and visitors apparently liked tobacco because a 
fourth of the nearly 5000 artifacts recovered have been pipes or 
parts of pipes 
the port never regained its former importance because 
earthquakes fires and hurricanes blocked attempts to rebuild 
hamilton said

democratic presidential contenders urged 
congress to stand firm against administration pressure and retain 
in its sweeping trade bill a provision requiring employers to give 
notice of plant closings 
i offer my strong encouragement to your efforts in resisting 
any further weakening of these already quite modest provisions 
jesse jackson said in a letter to senate finance committee chairman 
lloyd bentsen dtexas 
i urge you and other conferees to insist that mandatory 
advance plant notification be included in the final version said 
sen albert gore jr dtenn in a letter to bentsen both 
messages were dated friday and released monday by the office of 
rep william d ford dmich 
the reagan administration has been pushing congress to drop the 
plant closings provision 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis already had called for 
retaining the provision which would require companies with more 
than 100 employees to give 60 days notice before a plant closing 
or largescale layoff 
i am aware that the administration has refused to accept any 
form of advance notice provision and has threatened a veto of the 
trade bill if the conference committees provision passed 
dukakis said in a march 30 letter to bentsen i hope that the 
threat is only that a threat that would not be carried out if the 
situation actually presents itself 
regardless of the presidents intentions i urge you to work 
for retention of the plant closing provision in the trade bill 
dukakis said 
the plant closings provision is one facet of a sweeping bill 
that contains measures ranging from approval for the administration 
to sign trade deals with other countries to repeal of the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies 
at the heart of the bill are provisions that restructure the way 
in which the united states retaliates against violations of 
international trade rules lawmakers say they are designed to open 
foreign markets to us exports 
the measure has been approved in large part by a housesenate 
conference committee although a few finishing touches remain to be 
attended to 
any congressional move to drop provisions that might yield a 
veto most likely would have to start with bentsen under powers that 
have been granted him by senate conferees 
bentsen as vice chairman of the conference committee took the 
lead in dropping a number of stringent provisions opposed earlier 
by the reagan administration 
the administration has been describing the plantclosings 
provision as one that would be disastrously expensive for industry 
while the measure contains no money provisions some business 
groups have suggested it would be a first step toward substantial 
costs later 
the candidates jumped into the debate amid new signals from the 
administation that a veto could await the 1000page trade bill if 
it arrives at the presidents desk with the plantclosings 
provision intact 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said in an interview on 
nbctvs today show that he would meet with congressional 
leaders early this week to discuss what lawmakers must do to win 
presidential approval of the legislation 
at the very least it will take removal of some provisions that 
are now in that bill baker said such for instance as a 
provision requiring that any business in the united states give 
prior notice of layoffs or a desire to close a facility 
he stopped short however of saying that a veto would 
automatically result from trade sanctions in the bill against 
japans toshiba electronics company because of a sale by a 
subsidiary of submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet union 
that is something that we dont like baker said there 
are a number of things in the bill that we do like there are a 
number of things in the bill that we need i dont think you can 
take each and every item in there and say this for sure will 
trigger a veto i think you can say that about the plantclosing 
provision 
my own personal view is that the president will veto the bill 
if that plant closing provision stays in there he added 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said he hoped to bring the 
final version of the trade bill to the house floor for a vote next 
week 
he said that before that happens there may be a few changes in 
the measure and that he is not set in concrete on how the 
provisions are drawn

the department of health and human services on 
monday published the clinical procedures that federal agencies must 
follow in testing their employees for drug use 
the final technical regulations published in the federal 
register are essentially the same as hhs originally outlined more 
than a year ago 
yet to gain final approval are guidelines drawn up by some 40 
separate agencies thousands of pages in all on the more 
controversial matter of how each agency will determine which 
employees to test 
those plans are under review by hhs to make sure each of the 
agencies has adopted the underlying clinical testing procedures in 
their own plans 
once hhs completes that technical review expected within a 
week or two all of the individual plans passing muster will be 
forwarded to congress for review 
aside from the possibility that members of congress could object 
to some of the agency plans an hhs official noted that several 
employee unions have indicated they are likely to challenge the 
agency plans in court once they are issued 
kenneth blaylock president of the 700000member american 
federation of government employees said the guidelines are an 
overreaction to a situation that barely exists in the federal 
sector 
the latest guidelines for conducting random drug tests on 
government employees not only condemns the entire federal work 
force as serious drug abusers but assumes they are cheaters as 
well blaylock said 
even though they do not address the fundamental controversy of 
whether to test the hhs standards themselves have been held up at 
congressional insistence since february 1987 to allow time for 
informal review and public comment 
president reagan ordered drug testing in september 1986 of 
employees who have sensitive jobs and instructed hhs to develop the 
scientific procedures to be followed 
the office of personnel management subsequently issued 
regulations in november 1986 that could make as many as 11 million 
civilian workers subject to testing although only a fraction of 
that number is likely to actually be tested 
designed to ensure that any person being tested is submitting 
his or her own fresh urine the hhs regulations published monday 
call for water in the toilet stalls where the samples are given to 
contain a blue dye and for the samples temperature to be taken 
within four minutes 
both are to guard against the person submitting a sample diluted 
with toilet water or one that was smuggled into the testing site a 
monitor would be nearby but would not watch the person give the 
sample 
the guidelines also include elaborate instructions on 
transportation of samples to make sure they are not mixed up and on 
the laboratory testing procedures

targets in baghdad iraqs capital and shelled the battered port 
city of basra in southern iraq the naval base at umm qasr and 
three border towns 
iran said the iraqi missile attacks killed at least 20 civilians 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitord in 
cyprus quoted brig gen mohammed hussein jalali the defense 
minister as saying iran is now making most of its own missiles and 
was capable of turning baghdad into an inferno if the 
criminal attacks on iranian cities continue 
irna rported jalali said iran is producing two types of missiles 
with ranges of 80 miles or more the report did not elaborate 
iraq also has said it is making its own mediumrange missiles 
iran has used sovietmade missiles and some western analysts 
believe the iraqi missiles are modifications of soviet weapons 
the official iraqi news agency said the missiles were fired at 
tehran and isfahan in retaliation for iranian shelling sunday of 
residential districts in khanaqin and two iraqi border cities 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
in ground action irna said iranianbacked iraqi rebels killed 
680 iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeastern iraq in 
the last few days 
it claimed 180 iraqi troopers were killed near zardeh in 
sulaimaniyeh province in infiltration operations and 500 were 
slain in an ambush of a relief column

strategic region last monthi and iran said the operations were to 
avenge the deaths of 5000 kurds who it said were killed by iraqi 
chemical warfare attacks march 1617

territory in northeastern iraq since march 16

missions against iranian forces and other targets monday 
thats the highest number of missions reported flown in one day 
for months and indicated heavy action along the 730mile front

cities before dawn as iranians prepared to vote for a new 270seat 
majlis as the parliament is called 
dispatches from baghdad said the iraqis stopped shooting after 
that to facilitate the votecasting process hoping that new 
responsible elements would be elected to parliament who might 
seriously view the question of the war and put an end to it 
reports from the iranian agency said iraq sought to disrupt the 
vote and a massive turnout at the polls was a bitter defeat 
for the tottering regime in baghdad 
it confirmed one missile hit tehran on monday and another 
exploded in isfahan which was the capital of persia in the 17th 
century a mosque hospital and homes were damaged in the two 
cities irna reported

air raid near the northwestern city of orumiyeh and several people 
were killed by chemical bombs dropped late sunday on marivan 140

monday but were driven off by antiaircraft fire irna reported 
the latest round of the war of the cities in which thousands of 
civilians have been killed began feb 29 and more than 300 
missiles have been fired by both sides 
baqer karimian head of irans election commission was quoted 
as saying the number of people voting in the majlis election was 40 
percent higher than in 1984 despite iraqi air and missile 
attacks 
according to irna more than 14 million votes had been counted 
moday but final results were not expected for several days it said 
officials had declared winners in 160 of the 270 districts but did 
not indicate who had won 
western political analysts do not expect any change in the 
majlis to hasten an end to the war ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the 87yearold revolutionary patriarch has vowed to continue 
fighting until president saddam hussein of iraq is ousted

republican presidential candidate pat 
robertsons campaign organization said monday it already has 
submitted 1986 financial records the internal revenue service is 
going to court to obtain 
if there is a hearing we will attend to show that we have 
complied with the order said barbara gattullo a representative 
for americans for robertson she said the material was turned over 
last week 
james f patterson treasurer of the organization said it has 
been ordered to court before us district judge j calvitt clarke 
to show why the irs should not be given records needed to verify 
the accuracy of the groups 1986 tax filing the hearing was 
originally set for tuesday but was continued until april 28 
court documents show that the irs first requested the financial 
information in december 1987 the irs also asked for copies of 
fundraising letters sent out and records of any transactions 
with the freedom council or christian broadcasting network 
robertson a former television evangelist founded the 
nonprofit cbn and was its president until last october when he 
announced his candidacy he turned over the operation of the cable 
network to his son tim robertson 
the freedom council was established in 1981 with seed money from 
cbn according to former council officials nearly 3 million was 
pumped into the organization from cbn in 1985 the year robertsn 
began establishing his grassroots campaign organization 
many credit the freedom council also a taxexempt charitable 
organization with mobilizing robertsons cadre of volunteers 
mostly political firsttimers drawn mainly from charismatic or 
fundamentalist churches robertson used these volunteers to pack 
local gop meetings and caucuses to gain control of the party at the 
local level in several states 
under federal tax laws taxexempt entities cannot raise money 
for or support political candidates 
the stated purpose of the council which closed its operation in 
october 1986 was to educate christians on how to get involved in 
politics however critics have charged that the group was a front 
for robertsons thenunofficial political campaign 
the irs currently is probing the taxexempt status of cbn over 
the same general issue 
if the money was used for robertsons campaign then the 
taxexempt status of cbn would be in jeopardy if as cbn and 
freedom council officials have said the money was used to educate 
christians as to how to become involved in the political process 
then it would be legitimate donation 
americans for robertson the campaign organization filed for 
organization with the federal election commission in july 1986 
during 1986 bob slosser president of cbn university served as 
president of the freedom council after retired gen jerry curry 
resigned from the post in the spring when americans for robertson 
the campaign organization was organized in july 1986 marc nuttle 
was named acting director at the same time he was also a paid 
consultant for the freedom council 
nuttle became robertsons campaign manager until last month when 
he was assigned other duties as part of robertsons scaling back of 
his campaign though he remains the lone official challenger of 
vice president george bush robertson admits he has no chance for 
the nomination 
he has laid off most of his national staff and restricted his 
campaigning to occasional appearances in states that select 
delegates to the national convention by caucus

israel expelled eight palestinians from the 
occupied lands monday accusing them of inciting the four months of 
violence there and it issued deportation orders against 12 others 
in the west bank meanwhile israeli troops shot and killed two 
arabs after a group of palestinians threw stones and bottles at a 
patrol the army said hospital officials said eight arabs were 
wounded 
among the 12 receiving deportation orders were six palestinians 
from a west bank village where an israeli settler girl and two 
arabs were killed in a clash last week 
palestinian leaders contended the purpose of the expulsions was 
to appease rightwing politicians and jewish settlers angered by an 
army report that said tirza porat 15 was killed by a bullet from 
another settlers gun 
but israel television quoted a top military official as saying 
the deportations were intended as a warning to palestinians 
in the west bank village of rai near nablus troops shot and 
killed two arabs after a patrol was pelted with rocks and bottles 
the army said 
arab doctors said three other palestinians including an 
11yearold girl and a 14yearold boy were wounded in rai 
hospital officials said four others were wounded in nablus and one 
in jenin another village near nablus 
the deaths brought to 143 the number of arabs killed since riots 
began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war two israelis 
ms porat and a soldier have also died 
the army said monday that 4800 palestinians have been arrested 
since the riots began five hundred of them have been convicted 
3400 are awaiting trial and 900 are being held in administrative 
detention which allows imprisonment without trial for six months 
arab residents of the occupied territories followed palestine 
liberation organization orders to close stores and stay home from 
jobs in israel on monday underground leaflets called for a day 
of firebombs april 21 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
we strongly oppose deportations from the occupied territories 
which he described as counterproductive they only further 
inflame passions 
redman said the practice violates international human rights 
agreements to which israel is a signatory the geneva convention 
bars expulsion of civilians in time of war but israeli officials 
say the convention applies only to mass expulsions 
army helicopters flew the eight deportees to israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in southern lebanon the army offered 
them a medical examination and gave each 50 before soldiers led 
them to two taxis heading for syriancontrolled territory 
israel television showed some of the men carrying their 
belongings in plastic bags when the taxis sped off one of the 
palestinians flashed a victory sign 
foreign minister shimon peres said on israel radio we are not 
expelling residents we are only expelling agitators preachers of 
violence and extremists the past has proven that expulsions are 
one of the most effective deterrents 
palestinian leaders said the expulsions would feed bitterness 
the more the government uses drastic measures the more people 
become determined even though they dont have the power to 
overthrow the authorities said rashad al shawwa a former gaza 
city mayor deposed by israel 
mondays deportation was the second in four months of riots the 
expulsion of four palestinians on jan 13 provoked an international 
outcry more than 1000 arabs have been expelled from the 
territories since 1967 
expulsion orders against five of those expelled monday were 
issued three months ago the most prominent deportee is abed al 
aziz uda rafia 33 of gaza city described by the army as chief 
ideologue of a moslem fundamentalist group pledged to destroy 
israel and create a palestinian homeland through war 
elias freij a christian palestinian who is mayor of bethlehem 
called the deportations a revenge for beita the village where 
arabs attacked 16 teenage hikers and two armed guards from elo 
moreh a jewish settlement 
it was done to appease the settlers freij said 
uri ariel head of the west bank settlements council said 
mondays action was too little too late and demanded more 
expulsions 
the beita clash wednesday has provoked debate along party lines 
since army investigators said miss porat apparently was struck by a 
bullet from the gun of romem al dubi one of the two guards 
accompanying the teenagers 
settlers and rightwing legislators said the army report was 
onesided geulah cohen of the rightwing party tehiya said lt 
gen dan shomron the army chief of staff jumped to conclusions 
and acting as a judge pointed an accusing finger at the 
settlers 
peres who leads the centerleft labor party said to the 
critics this is very serious the attempt to involve the army in 
political matters

soviet and american officials marked the 25th 
anniversary of the limited test ban treaty monday by hailing it as 
a historic pact that laid the groundwork for subsequent nuclear 
arms agreements 
officials gathered at the john f kennedy library and museum to 
reminisce about the events surrounding its signing 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin praised president kennedy who 
oversaw the us side of negotiations saying the treaty would 
not have been attained without a fresh and sober look at 
superpower rivalry by that dynamic leader 
sen edward m kennedy brother of the late president called 
the treaty a watershed event in sovietamerican relations the 
first major arms control agreement involving the superpowers 
the treaty signed july 25 1963 after 10 days of negotiations 
in moscow involving soviet us and british representatives 
banned testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere in outer space 
and under water 
other testing bans have been signed since but the test ban 
treaty remains the only one ratified by both superpowers 
former soviet and us participants in the negotiations agreed 
at a news conference that the treaty gave rise to a series of other 
nuclear arms pacts between the superpowers including last years 
accord to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
mcgeorge bundy special assistant for national security affairs 
from 1961 to 1966 told reporters the signing brought a prospect 
of further and larger agreements and praised kennedy for 
ignoring us perceptions that the soviets were further advanced in 
testing 
alexei roshchkin a disarmament expert in the soviet foreign 
ministry at the time of the signing concurred 
this was a first step in postwar history a first step in 
the field of disarmamanent he said 
theodore sorensen special counsel to the president from 1961 to 
1963 and part of a small group of advisers that guided the talks 
from washington by telephone said there was a great sense of joy 
and relief when word was received at the white house that the 
treaty had been signed 
but backslapping was not the kennedy way sorensen said 
on the contrary he immediately began to worry about senate 
ratification which came in the fall intense lobbying by the 
president left only 11 democrats and eight republicans opposed 
soviet officials recalled the jubilation of their leader nikita 
khrushchev as described by former kennedy aide arthur m 
schlesinger jr in his book a thousand days 
as khrushchev and us undersecretary of state averell harriman 
strode through a kremlin park a huge crowd collected behind 
them schlesinger wrote 
according to the book khrushchev turned and asked the crowd 
weve just signed a testban treaty im going to take him to 
dinner do you think hes earned his dinner the people applauded 
and applauded 
the signing and subsequent ratification followed 336 nuclear 
explosions in the atmosphere by the united states britain and the 
soviet union over 13 years 
the agreement also was important as a tangible sign of emerging 
detente after the cuban missile crisis of october 1962 brought the 
world to the brink of nuclear war 
france and china the only other nations that openly engaged in 
nuclear weapons test programs have not agreed to the test ban but 
all french nuclear explosions have been underground since 1974 and 
china exploded its last atmospheric device in 1980 
disagreement on verification measures has held up joint 
ratification of the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 
peaceful nuclear explosions treaty limiting test explosions to 150 
kilotons a kiloton equals the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt 
us and soviet negotiators began a second round of talks on 
ratifying those two treaties in february and participants monday 
invoked the limited test ban treaty as an example that agreement is 
possible

a senior iraqi envoy said monday there is 
no point in continuing talks on ending the persian gulf war until 
iran accepts a security council peace plan 
we do not want to enter into another round of futile 
discussions and arguments and wrangling wisam alzahawi a senior 
deputy foreign minister told reporters after a meeting with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
nearly nine months have passed since the security council passed 
a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire and troop withdrawal 
as the first steps toward a negotiated end to the 7yearold 
iraniraq war 
iraq endorsed the resolution almost immediately iran has yet to 
do so 
the united states wants the council to impose an arms embargo on 
iran for not accepting the resolution but has failed to muster the 
support of the soviet union 
alzahawi said he told perez de cuellar that iraq is ready to 
sit and negotiate with the iranians under the auspices of the 
secretarygeneral once the security council obtains irans 
unequivocal clearcut official acceptance of the resolution 
iraq says it accepts a ceasefire and troop withdrawal as the 
first steps in a settlement of the war iran wants the united 
nations to condemn iraq as the aggressor in the war before it pulls 
out any troops 
alzawahi said iraq is not entering into any details of 
implementation at this stage before we have a clearcut acceptance 
from iran 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammed larijani held talks 
with perez de cuellar last week larijani dismissed irans position 
on the resolution as irrelevant and instead urged the security 
council to condemn iraq for using chemical weapons 
irans un representative mohammad jaafar mahallati repeated 
this request at a news conference monday saying the council should 
ban the export to iraq of chemicals used to make the deadly weapons 
alzahawi dodged questions from reporters about iraqs use of 
chemical warfare and accused iran of using the weapons he said 
iraq would observe the rules of international combat if iran 
did 
alzahawi also denied that he and perez de cuellar has discussed 
the issue of chemical weapons on monday the un chief has sent 
teams to tehran and baghdad to investigate charges that such 
weapons were being used 
iran has charged that iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs 
on three kurdish towns in iraq in march killing 5000 kurds

arab hijackers killed a second hostage on 
monday tossed his bloody body from a commandeered kuwaiti jet and 
threatened to kill nearly 50 other captives if the plane wasnt 
refueled 
the gunmen said the dead man was a kuwaiti officer he was 
the second kuwaiti military man slain by the hijackers during the 
weeklong ordeal aboard the kuwait airways jet 
the hijackers have demanded that kuwait release 17 proiranian 
terrorists convicted in 1984 for bombings at the us and french 
embassies 
sources close to the negotiations said however that the 
hijackers demanded freedom monday only for the three men among the 
17 who have been sentenced to death kuwait has rejected all of the 
gunmens demands 
in kuwait foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed alsabah said 
his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give in 
to terrorism 
we will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the 
plane but we will not surrender to any blackmail even if we lose 
more of them he told a news conference this is not the 
decision of kuwaits government it is a decision of the people 
there are 52 people aboard the boeing 747 including three 
members of kuwaits extensive royal family and the hijackers who 
are wearing blue hoods and armed with grenades and handguns 
sabah said there are at least eight hijackers all of them 
arabs carrying forged passports from bahrain iraq and colombia 
he was asked if the jet would be attacked and said the 
decision to storm is not ours it lies with the cypriot government 
on whose land the plane stands 
the man killed monday was pushed from the blueandwhite plane 
at 307 pm 807 am edt after cypriot officials ignored two 
deadlines to refuel the jet 
doctors at larnaca morgue said he had suffered injuries to the 
side of his face apparently from a beating they said he had been 
shot twice in the head at close range before his body hands bound 
behind his back was thrown onto the tarmac at larnaca airport 
we have executed a kuwaiti officer a hijacker told the 
control tower we also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled 
immediately immediately before we take more dangerous steps 
at dusk the hijackers put one of the passengers identified as 
fadl marzouk eloteibi on the radio 
speaking in arabic he told the control tower the hijackers 
say that if you dont give us fuel they will kill all the 
passengers please listen to this and greetings to my family 
the hijackers said they wanted about nine hours worth of fuel 
so they could fly to an unspecified neutral country 
on saturday the hijackers killed their first victim a 
24yearold kuwaiti border guard 
they set the first deadline for refueling monday at 1 pm 6 
am edt and warned that we will kill a personality related to 
the unjust kuwaiti regime 
the members of the royal family on the plane are businesman 
fadel khaled alsabah and his sisters ebtesam and anware 
the first deadline passed without incident after malaz abdo 
deputy director of the palestine liberation organizations office 
in nicosia and a cypriot official negotiated with the hijackers 
the hijackers then set a 230 pm 730 am edt deadline and 
told the tower that refueling must start or youll receive the 
corpse fortyseven minutes later the body was thrown out 
on sunday a proiranian shiite moslem faction in lebanon 
threatened to kill american and french hostages it holds if any 
attempt is made to storm the plane 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war made the threat in a 
statement delivered to the reuters news agency in beirut along with 
photographs of american terry anderson and frenchman jeanpaul

refused to let it touch down at their airports and it landed at 
larnaca after the pilot radioed that he was running out of fuel 
another captive an ailing 32yearold kuwaiti was freed in 
larnaca saturday 
the hijackers reference to a neutral country monday was the 
first time since landing at larnaca that they have given any

the attorney for an american convicted 
of drug trafficking filed an appeal monday of his sixyear sentence 
a threejudge provincial court found conan owen 23 of 
annandale va guilty of drug trafficking on april 5 and sentenced 
him to six years in prison 
owens lawyer ana campa said she had filed an appeal she said 
the prosecution had meanwhile appealed the courts decision to 
aquit her client on a separate charge of possession of contraband 
that charge would carry an additional three years in prison 
ms campa said it was normal in spanish drug cases for the 
prosecution to appeal if the court failed to convict on the 
contraband charge 
owen is a 1986 syracuse university graduate a 1984 summer 
intern in vice president george bushs office and a second 
lieutenant in the us army reserve 
he went on trial in barcelona on march 26 after serving more 
than a year of pretrial detention in the citys 85yearold prison 
owen was arrested march 13 1987 at barcelonas airport after a 
customs agent found about four pounds of cocaine in a suitcase he 
had checked through on his flight from santiago chile via 
amsterdam to barcelona 
owen told the court he believed he was taking a suitcase full of 
tourist brochures to barcelona for a travel agency that hired him 
for a fourday freelance photo assignment he had been given the 
suitcase by george barahona of alexandria va he said 
attorney general edwin meese iii personally delivered copies to 
spanish judicial authorities of a statement by barahona saying owen 
knew nothing about the drugs and had been used as a courier 
under a 1987 spanishamerican treaty us citizens convicted of 
crimes in spain can serve their prison terms in the united states 
but a transfer cannot be approved until all appeals have been 
exhausted 
he court said it was convinced owen knew there was cocaine in 
the suitcase but it said the cocaine had not passed out of the 
airport customs area and so it rejected the contraband charge

democrat michael dukakis said monday that arab 
leaders by refusing to negotiate with israel are responsible 
for the turmoil and the violence in the west bank 
addressing jewish leaders dukakis said the government of 
israel as well as the generation of young palestinians in the 
region do not bear the responsbility for recent violence there 
just as camp david stands as an example of what can be 
accomplished when leaders choose peace the recent events in the 
west bank and gaza show what happens when arab leaders are 
unwilling to walk in the footsteps of president sadat the late 
egyptian leader dukakis said 
dukakis made the comments in an address to the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations an umbrella 
group of leaders of 44 of the largest national jewish organizations 
with the race for the democratic presidential nomination 
focusing on new yorks primary april 19 rival albert gore jr 
spoke to the group earlier and strongly sided with israel on the 
violence in the occupied territories 
the third democratic candidate jesse jackson has declined an 
invitation to address the group citing scheduling problems 
organization spokesman richard cohen said 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts spent much of the day at 
the state house in boston before flying to new york 
he later visited a new york restaurant and planned to attend a 
private reception and stop at a rally on staten island he also was 
attending an academy awards reception 
dukakis cousin olympia made a pitch for him as she accepted 
her academy award for best supporting actress on monday night in 
los angeles ok michael lets go she said waving her oscar 
statuette ms dukakis won for her role in the comedy 
moonstruck 
earlier addressing the jewish leaders dukakis said it is 
critically important that the world understand who is responsible 
for the turmoil and the violence of recent weeks between 
palestinians and israelis 
it is not the generation of young palestinians who have grown 
up in uncertainty and who have been taught by their elders to 
hate he said 
it is not a government in jerusalem that struggles to maintain 
order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with responsible 
arab leaders about the future of the territories dukakis said 
it is regretably arab leaders themselves who have time and 
again rejected the chance to sit down with israel and negotiate a 
permanent peace in the middle east he said 
dukakis cited principles for policy in the middle east 
that real progress toward peace will not be made until arab leaders 
are willing to negotiate directly and until they accept 
israels right to exist within borders that are secure and 
defensible 
dukakis cited his own remarks of 11 years ago saying israel 
needs room to breathe and a return to the 1967 borders is out of 
the question 
he later told reporters there will have to be some exchange of 
land for peace but short of a return to israels prior borders 
he said the palestine liberation organization cannot be a middle 
east negotiator until it renounces terrorism in word and deed 
until it accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 and until it renounces 
its own statement that peace can only come at the price of 
israels right to exist 
dukakis said i welcome secretary of state george shultzs 
peace initiative while not agreeing with evey aspect 
taking questions from the jewish leaders dukakis was asked if 
he supports establishment of a palestinian state he said that 
should be a matter of negotiations between israel and neighboring 
countries 
he was also asked about the future of jerusalem and said it too 
has too be subject to negotiation he later told reporters 
im for a united jerusalem under israeli control 
dukakis was asked why he hasnt drawn more distinctions with 
jackson with one questioner describing jackson as an 
antisemite 
dukakis said we have differences in the middle east he 
later told reporters im not going to characterize any of the 
people in this race 
he said the next president should insist that the soviets 
let jews and other minorities leave if they wish and let them 
worship freely

when their plane began to take off they saw a van on the runway 
carrying a man with an automatic weapon driver testified 
under crossexamination driver could not recall what weapons 
bahamian police carried when he visited the island last year

police officer and seeing a weapon in the hands of a thug driver 
told defense attorney ed shohat 
shohat objected to much of drivers testimony claiming it was 
hearsay driver has been allowed to sit through the testimony of 
all witnesses in the trial 
when members of wards smuggling group were indicted in 1981

to normans cay by merkle mueller and driver that showed the 
island had become nearly deserted 
introduced into evidence monday were address and telephone books 
confiscated in a raid on reeds house in february 1987 
the books contained phone numbers for lehder in colombia plus 
the names of others identified in the trial 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise a separate miami indictment accuses 
him of being one of the leaders of the medellin cartel which 
officials say is responsible for about 80 percent of the cocaine 
shipments into the united states 
reed of san pedro calif is charged with only being a member 
of the smuggling conspiracy

hollywoods reigning royalty turned out 
monday evening in basic black and white with a few dashes of color 
as elegance replaced glitz for the 60th annual academy awards 
except for cher 
the star of moonstruck who arrived fashionably late 
knocked the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her 
limousine outside the shrine auditorium in an almostnotthere 
diaphanous gown only partly covered by a dark black cape 
but cher was one of the exceptions to the rule 
actress liza minnelli typified this years style with a bright 
red cape draped over a long crepe black dress while marlee matlin 
exemplified the few bright exceptions wearing a strapless 
kneelength purple dress with a large bow hanging from her side 
perennial edie williams wore a bikini top over a pale blue mini 
skirt and sported a puppy on one shoulder but the rest of the 
turnout at the cavernous shrine auditorium exercised good taste and 
classic styling 
fifteen minutes before showtime actresses meryl streep and 
glenn close nine months pregnant and aided by a cane were seen 
marching quickly up jefferson boulevard to the theater in an effort 
to make it to the academy awards on time 
protesters on jefferson boulevard included biblethumping 
christians carrying signs reading movie idolaters repent 
fear god and repent or perish 
guardian angel leader curtis sliwa and his selfdeclared band of 
redbereted crimebusters chanted alongside the christians and 
marched around mock caskets in protest of fridays release of the 
realistic police gang movie colors 
los angeles police are in the midst of a declared war against 
gangs and sliwa said the motion picture will incite more violence 
it shouldnt be released now at the height of the storm he 
said 
many oscar guests in limousines and passenger cars gave sliwa 
and his troops thumbs up signs of approval as they passed 
fans in the bleachers were whipped up by oscar greeter and 
columnist army archerd who conducted an impromptu fan poll the 
best picture winner on the applause meter was moonstruck 
in the middle of the bleachers were seven glenn close

michael dukakis said monday that arab leaders are responsible 
for the turmoil and the violence in israels occupied territories 
as democratic presidential candidates wrestled with middle east 
policy looking for the right moves for victory in new york 
jesse jackson often attacked for what critics call proarab 
stands continued to distance himself from the palestine liberation 
organization by saying that allowing extremists at the bargaining 
table would be a formula for catastrophe 
albert gore jr who earlier exchanged sharp words with fellow 
democrats on the middle east took a conciliatory line he also 
admitted he has to do well in the april 19 new york primary to 
continue in the race 
dukakis meanwhile got a boost from his cousin olympia 
dukakis who won an academy award monday night as best supporting 
actress for her role in the comedy moonstruck 
ok michael lets go she called as she accepted the award 
at the nationally televised ceremony in los angeles 
dukakis was making an appearance at an italian restaurant in 
greenwich village that figured in the film and planned to call his 
cousin from there with congratulations 
the massachusetts governor had said beforehand that he thought 
ms dukakis was just marvelous in the role and her victory he 
said may be a sign of good things to come in new york in a 
week 
republican nomineeapparent george bush got back on the trail 
monday visiting an ibm research facility in new york and 
proclaiming his strong support for israel as a reason for jews to 
back his candidacy 
i think everyone shold vote for me besides that im a good 
friend of israel bush said 
the vice president brushed off concerns that the 
allbutconcluded gop contest could drop him out of the voters 
eyes as the democrats continue to fight we dont have all the 
excitement that exists on the democratic side of the aisle but we 
have a lot more unity and fewer problems he said 
for pat robertson bushs only remaining challenger there were 
new problems the internal revenue service asked for a court 
hearing tuesday on whether robertsons campaign had complied with 
irs demands for documents in a complicated investigation of the 
former television evangelists organizations the campaign said it 
has complied 
yet another declaration from noncandidate mario cuomo also 
roiled the waters this time politicians tried to judge the impact 
of the new york governors roundabout confirmation over the weekend 
that he would reject a draft at the democratic convention in july 
with jews expected to make up nearly a quarter of the democratic 
primary voters in new york israel and middle east policy have held 
the spotlight in the primary campaign with 255 delegates at stake 
dukakis went before the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations in new york to give his first 
extended discussion of the violence in the west bank and the gaza 
strip 
it is critically important that the world understand who is 
responsible for the turmoil and the violence dukakis said in his 
prepared remarks it is regrettably arab leaders themselves who 
have time and again rejected the chance to sit down with israel and 
negotiate peace 
it is not the generation of young palestinians dukakis 
said it is not a government in jerusalem that struggles to 
maintain order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with 
responsible arab leaders about the future of the territories 
on monday jackson distanced himself further from plo leader 
yasser arafat with whom he met in the late 1970s he had said 
sunday that the plo and the palestinian people are not the same and 
that he would not meet again with arafat 
it would not be a good approach to start at the table with the 
most extreme elements thats a formula for catastrophe jackson 
said when asked to expand on his comments on arafat 
gore who had strongly criticized jackson on arafat called that 
a very useful statement and vowed to continue his style of 
drawing contrasts between himself and dukakis and jackson 
by raising the issues openly instead of just behind the 
scenesit makes it a healthy process and creates opportunities 
for questions and answers that break new ground gore said i 
know i have grown during this campaign i know the other candidates 
have 
earlier in the day gore admitted that he must do well in the 
new york primary 
were running to win here he said but at a minimum we 
have to have a finish which convinces observers that gore did 
it he has the momentum and he has the strength to go on 
on the middle east issue gore repeated his opposition to an 
independent palestinian state saying the preace pocess should 
follow the camp david agreements that foresaw an area carved out 
for palestinians with limited autonomy 
im for a peace process that could result in a change of 
status of the west bank on terms that could be worked out by 
parties involved in the middle east gore said adding quickly 
its unthinkable to have an armed military hostile presence so 
close to a vulnerable point in israel 
cuomo once again stirred the political pot this weekend by 
saying that he does not want to be the choice of a deadlocked 
democratic convention and in so many words rejecting such a 
possible draft 
that was not news to gore 
i always heard his words clearly i thought he wasnt a 
candidate because he told me he wasnt a candidate the tennessee 
senator said 
perhaps the quickest reaction was from new york mayor ed koch 
at odds with cuomo in recent days who said he would endorse gore 
or dukakis this week 
in the allimportant delegate contest dukakis continued to hold 
a small lead over jackson the ap delegate count gave dukakis 
74505 and jackson 70955 gore trailed with 3958 while 51435 
were uncommitted sen paul simon of illinois who has suspended 
his campaign after a string of poor showings had 1715 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta in july 2082 
votes are needed to win the nomination

the weapons aboard a hijacked kuwaiti airliner 
may have been smuggled aboard in bangkok through the ramp area used 
by caterers and cleaning crews an international air transport 
association official said monday 
on the basis of discussions weve had so far the probability 
is weapons were placed on board the aircraft through the coercion 
or collusion of staff on the ramp said rodney wallis head of 
security for the association 
caterers engineers cleaners and loaders all have access to the 
ramp area where the cabin of the kuwait airways boeing 747 was 
serviced and cleaned before it left bangkok on tuesday he said 
thai authorities have not completed their investigation he 
added 
there are believed to be at least five arab hijackers on board 
the jumbo jet which was commandeered tuesday on its way to kuwait 
and has been sitting on the tarmac in larnaca cyprus since friday 
the hijackers have killed two passengers and threatened to kill 
the remaining passengers if authorities do not fulfill their demand 
that the plane be refueled about 45 hostages are being held 
wallis said he thought the weapons were placed on board through 
the ramp area because it is highly unlikely five people could take 
guns and grenades through security gates at bangkok airport 
the international air transport association is a montrealbased 
international association of commercial airlines 
the initial reaction of the thais was it couldnt have 
happened here wallis added but the most logical place for it 
to have happened was while it was on the ground in thailand it was 
on the ground there for a considerable period 
paul sheppard head of the security section of the international 
civil aviation organization said the operation was obviously well 
planned and the weapons could have been smuggled aboard any number 
of ways 
security is like a great spider web over the whole world and 
theres no way of plugging up every single little gap said 
sheppard the chain of security is only as strong as its weakest 
link 
the plane was bound for kuwait from bangkok on april 5 when it 
was seized by the hijackers who demanded the release of 
proiranian terrorists imprisoned in kuwait 
the jumbo jet was forced to land in northeastern iran where 57 
people were released the aircraft then left iran and landed in 
larnaca on friday after being refused permission to land in lebanon 
and syria 
the montrealbased international civil aviation organization is 
a united nations agency that sets international standards and 
regulations for safe air transportation

two sikh extremist groups on monday ruled 
out peace talks with the government unless they focus on the 
radicals demand for an independent nation 
also monday police reported five more people killed in the 
6yearold guerrilla war for a sikh homeland in the northern state 
of punjab authorities have blamed sikh extremists for killing 
nearly 700 people mostly hindus and moderate sikhs since the 
start of the year 
the fivemember panthic committee and its 11member council of 
khalistan a subgroup said monday that anyone who negotiated with 
the government and did not demand sikh independence would be killed 
no one will be allowed to negotiate with new delhi for less 
than khalistan the panthic committee said using the name sikh 
extremists have given to their wouldbe nation 
the struggle for khalistan is being fought in an organized 
manner and whosoever comes between the sikhs and khalistan will be 
taken care of the group announced in a statement at the golden 
temple in amritsar the holiest shrine for sikhs 
jagar singh a spokesman for the groups read their statements 
members of both the panthic committee formed in 1986 and the 
council of khalistan created in october generally operate 
underground many of them are wanted on sedition and murder charges 
by the government 
the panthic committee claims it is the official voice of the 
sikh separatists and has rejected the authority of traditional 
sikh institutions 
the sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias 800 million people but constitute a majority in 
punjab 
indian government officials have repeatedly said they are 
willing to discuss grievances of the sikh community but ruled out 
any discussion of independence 
the militants statements came a day after jasbir singh rode 
chief priest at the golden temple told the united news of india 
that he was willing to explore negotiations with the government 
but he said militants do not seem interested in talks with the 
government at present 
the separatists statements appeared aimed at undercutting rode 
who has called for a gathering of sikh faithful on wednesday in 
southern punjab 
the council of khalistans statement reiterated an assertion by 
several militant groups that the radicals were not responsible for 
the recent surge in attacks on sikh families 
the statement blamed the attacks on the black cat commando 
force a special unit created to guard prime minister rajiv 
gandhi it said the slayings of sikh moderates were aimed at 
discrediting the militant movement

reference to noriegas jowly pockmarked face 
commerce and industries minister mario rognoni said monday after 
a meeting with more than 30 representatives of american companies 
that panama planned to be flexible with firms affected by the us 
sanctions 
however he said if the companies do not pay utility bills 
because of the us executive order their services would be cut 
it is a delicate situation for which we are looking for a way 
to help the american companies continue operating in panama he 
said 
fred denton executive director of the american chamber of 
commerce in panama city said he had received numerous calls from 
representatives of us firms asking how the tax sanctions would be 
applied 
if we take this to the letter of the law i wouldnt be able 
to buy a panamanian postage stamp denton said were in a 
complete state of confusion 
president reagan on friday invoked the sweeping economic 
sanctions law against panama to force the ouster of noriega the 
commander of the 15000member defense forces and the power behind 
the civilian government 
the treasury department in washington was expected to issue 
guidelines this week covering the sanctions imposed under the 1977 
international emergency economic powers act 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended 
the steps as an attempt to deny noriega money that could be used 
to perpetuate his stay in power 
noriega repeated his claim that the us actions are an attempt 
by washington to renege on the treaty that will turn over full 
control of the panama canal to his country at the turn of the 
century 
they want to rewrite history cancel the treaties by imposing 
a government controlled by them and reversing the social 
achievements made since 1968 he told the paris newspaper le 
monde in an interview published monday 
asked if his departure from the country would end the crisis and 
alleviate the suffering of panamanians noriega said if the 
people are suffering it is because of the united states not me 
panamas crisis began when noriega had the national legislature 
depose president eric arturo delvalle on feb 26 the day after 
delvalle tried to fire the general the united states still 
considers delvalle the legal head of state 
noriega is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges which he denies 
in caracas venezuela a panamanian opposition leader forced 
into exile said panama will start running out of basic foodstuffs 
in days and such a shortage could lead to the final push to 
remove noriega 
carlos gonzalez de la lastra arrived in caracas sunday night 
from panama city after 11 days in prison he was imprisoned after 
leading a protest march and said authorities told him he could 
either remain in jail or go into exile 
in an interview with the associated press gonzalez urged latin 
american nations to abandon their opposition to us economic 
pressures designed to remove noriega 
we have been successful in that in ten months we have taken 
away all noriegas support without shedding blood what he needs 
now is a final push and this could be when the economic situation 
grows sharply worse in the next few weeks basically for a lack of 
food he said

president chaim herzog may further reduce the 
sentences of three leaders of a jewish terror group that operated 
for four years in the occupied territories israel radio reported 
monday 
herzogs spokesman ami gluska said in a written statement that 
all such reports are baseless 
the radio said the president is considering reducing the 
sentences of menachem livni shaul nir and uzi sharbaf jewish 
settlers who staged a gun and grenade attack at the hebron islamic 
college that killed three palestinians and wounded 33 in august 
1983 
they were sentenced to life in prison in july 1985 but herzog 
reduced their punishment last year to 24 years each several 
rightwing political leaders have appealed to herzog to pardon the 
men 
the radio said the president was considering a further reduction 
of their terms in honor of israels 40th anniversary 
the three settlers were among 25 arrested in 1984 and charged 
with planning and conducting six attacks against arabs in the 
territories captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
on april 1 herzog ordered the freedom of two other people 
convicted of taking part in the groups activities gluska called 
the move part of a general trend to reduce sentences in the 
framework of the 40th year of the state 
one of those freed was new yorkborn ira rappaport who was 
serving a twoyear sentence for helping to plant a bomb in the car 
of thennablus mayor bassam shaka in 1980 shaka lost his legs in

former white house spokesman larry speakes 
says in a new book that on two occasions he attributed to president 
reagan remarks on crucial international issues that the president 
did not make 
speakes says that in 1983 in the aftermath of the shooting down 
of a korean air lines plane with 61 americans aboard he credited 
the president with statements made by secretary of state george 
shultz 
he also says that during reagans summit meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in geneva in 1985 he attributed to 
reagan remarks that he and an assistant press secretary mark 
weinberg manufactured 
speakes who has often boasted that he never lied to the press 
during his six years as reagans chief spokesman makes the 
statements in his book speaking out scheduled for publication 
next month by charles scribners sons 
reagan cut short a vacation at his california ranch to return to 
washington and meet with the national security council and with 
congressional leaders after a soviet plane shot down the kal 
aircraft on aug 31 1983 
speakes says in his book that shultz declared during the 
congressional leaders meeting that the incident was not a problem 
between the united states and the soviet union but a soviet 
versus the world problem 
in meeting with reporters the former spokesman says he did a 
little improvising on my own 
since the president had had almost nothing to say during the 
national security and congressional leadership meetings i made 
presidential quotes out of shultz comment about the incident 
pitting the whole world against the soviet union as well as some 
of shultz suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should 
take speakes writes 
my decision to put shultz words in reagans mouth played well 
and neither of them complained 
in his account of the geneva summit speakes says he felt that 
gorbachev was really getting the advantage over us in his 
giveandtake with reporters while reagan was very tentative and 
stilted in his comments 
fearing that reagan was losing the media version of star wars 
i instructed mark weinberg to draft some quotes for the 
president speakes says i polished the quotes and told the 
press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one 
session the president said to gorbachev there is much that 
divides us but i believe the world breathes easier because we are 
talking here together 
speakes says that cbs used the quote in its evening television 
news and chris wallace of nbc reported the talks were frank the 
presidents best statement came off camera aides quoting him as 
saying the world breathes easier because we are talking 
together 
another reagan quote which we manufactured that received 
extensive play in the press was our differences are serious but 
so is our commitment to improving understanding speakes writes 
in retrospect it was clearly wrong to take such liberties 
the former spokesman says in his account of the geneva meeting 
certainly reagan would not have disavowed the words but the 
soviets could have said they never heard anything like that 
luckily the russians didnt dispute the quotes and i had been able 
to spruce up the presidents image by taking a bit of liberty with 
my pr mans license 
in an interview published in tuesdays editions of the 
washington post speakes said that making up presidential quotes 
is not lying when youre a press secretary you develop a 
bond of understanding with the president so that you think like the 
president i knew those quotes were the way he felt

jesse jackson referring to yasser arafat as one 
of the most extreme elements in the israelipalestinian 
conflict called monday on jewish and arab americans to start 
middle east peace talks in the united states 
talks can in fact begin right here in this country 
jackson said 
his proposal came as the new york presidential primary campaign 
entered its final week 
nearly one quarter of the democratic electorate on april 19 will 
be jewish and for many of those voters the future of israel is a 
critical issue 
jackson appeared to be reaching out to jewish voters on sunday 
when he declared that as president he would not meet with arafat 
whom he has been criticized for meeting several years ago 
at a breakfast meeting on monday he also ridiculed suggestions 
that he would come under greater scrutiny as a result of the 
electoral successes that have placed him only a handful of 
delegates behind gov michael dukakis of massachusetts in the 
democratic race 
running third in the threecandidate race was sen albert gore 
jr of tennessee 
jackson the former civil rights activist said there had been 
suggestions that the news media and the other candidates would get 
tough with him 
well get tough he said who else has a budget for 
fighting the drug crisis 
who else has a budget deficit plan 
who else has significant foreign policy experience 
and then he said i look forward to tougher days 
jackson was asked about arafat and he said it would not be a 
good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements 
thats a formula for catastrophe 
instead he said in this city some of your top palestinian 
leaders in the world live some of your top jewishamerican and 
proisraeli leaders live we should begin to talk here to implore 
both sides to a higher level of security 
he brushed aside questions about whether he would meet with the 
council of presidents of major jewish organizations a group 
dukakis spoke to on monday he said he also was addressing concerns 
of haitians living in new york of people from the caribbean as 
well as of italian and irish americans 
later an aide said jackson had no room on his schedule to meet 
with the jewish group 
monday evening labor leaders and the rank and file turned out 
in force at a labor rally in support of jacksons candidacy 
the candidate was interrupted repeatedly with shouts of win 
jesse win an updated version of the run jesse run 
slogan chanted during his unsuccessful first run for president in 
1984 
jackson told about 5000 supporters at the jacob k javits 
convention center that bluecollar workers will have a friend in 
the white house if he becomes president 
jackson reminded the crowd which represented a wide 
crosssection of the labor movement that he has stood with them 
many times on picket lines and asked them to stand with him now by 
supporting his candidacy 
jackson also campaigned north of the city addressing a rally at 
rockland community college and greeting workers at a general motors 
plant in north tarrytown 
at the college he urged students to seize that leadership 
young america must lead 
at the gm plant he sounded his familiar theme of battling 
economic violence and told the workers we built our campaign at 
the plant gate

old said its discoverer simon lilly of the university of hawaii 
at manoa even though the universe was only a few billion years 
old at the time were looking at this the galaxy itself was 1 
billion or 2 billion years old so this pushes back the time at 
which galaxies formed in the early universe

in the geriatric world of taiwans 
parliament lawmakers have been dying this year at the rate of two 
a month and the young china party has a representative who is 74 
the legislative yuan the highest of the three lawmaking 
branches of parliament is populated by scores of octagenarians and 
nonagenarians elected in 1948 on the chinese mainland many are 
hospitalized today and cannot attend sessions including 
97yearold chao chuhsu the senior member 
six members died in the first three months of 1988 lowering to 
306 the number of mainlandelected lawmakers still in the 884seat 
body at the end of march 
the aging lawmakers were part of the chiang kaisheks 
nationalist mainland government which was forced to flee to taiwan 
a year later by the victory of mao tsetungs communists in the 
civil war chiang died in 1975 at the age of 87 and mao died in 
1976 at 83 
the nationalist leaders on taiwan still claim to be the rightful 
rulers of all china and have frozen the lawmakers elected in 1948 
into office until the government can return to the mainland to hold 
new elections starting in 1969 however taiwanese were allowed 
seats in the legislature 
but with native taiwanese seeking a greater say in todays 
government and the mainlandelected lawmakers becoming increasingly 
feeble the nationalists are facing calls to take the gray out of 
the legislative yuan 
over the past 40 years the nationalist party has never paid 
enough attention to the voice of the people said chu kaocheng 
a lawmaker from the opposition democratic progressive party the 
whole constitutional structure is distorted and destroyed 
in february the nationalist party or kuomintang proposed 
voluntary retirement for the remaining mainlandelected lawmakers 
and an increase in the number of seats open for election on taiwan 
which now stands at 73 the proposal also would apply to the 
934seat national assembly the branch that meets every six years 
to choose taiwans president the other legislative branch is the 
control yuan which serves as a watchdog 
the opposition party has denounced the nationalist plan 
however arguing that all seats including those of the 
mainlanders should be open for election 
in the meantime chu and 11 other opposition party members 
elected in 1986 are making life miserable for the aging lawmakers 
most of the mainlandelected members belong to the nationalist 
party but some belong to smaller groups including 74yearold liu 
tzupeng of the young china party 
democratic progressive party lawmakers constantly refer to the 
elderly members as old thieves they also get into fights with 
the nationalists rip apart furniture and generally cause chaos 
whenever possible during legislative yuan sessions 
the 33yearold chus exploits in this have earned him the 
nickname rambo in the local media 
on april 7 chu stormed the legislative yuan podium to stop a 
vote on the budget he wound up in a wild melee with several 
nationalists that resulted in a decision to provide the legislative 
yuans aging president and vice president with bodyguards 
the masscirculation united daily news said that among those who 
punched and kicked chu during the scuffle were several elderly 
nationalist lawmakers who had suppressed their displeasure for 
too long 
opposition lawmakers recently have taken to the streets to 
protest the 10000year parliament and in march led a group of 
more than 1000 people to a walled suburban compound where many of 
the aging nationalists live at least 16 people were reported 
injured when demonstrators clashed with the security forces 
opposition party members also have publicized the telephone 
numbers of mainlandelected representatives and have urged people 
to call them to demand they retire 
nationalist lawmaker chang hunghsueh 72 said he receives one 
or two calls late each night some callers curse while others 
remain silent he said he added that he receives paper money 
traditionally offered to the dead with his name on it 
this is shameful and mean but it does not bother me 
chang said in a recent interview he said he always replies to the 
callers with a polite thank you i am still alive 
chang believes that holding elections in taiwan for the entire 
legislative yuan would be unconstitutional on grounds that it would 
become a local lawmaking body his belief is shared by other 
mainlandelected representatives 
but reform of the parliamentary system was firmly pushed by 
president chiang chingkuo chiang kaisheks son who died at the 
age of 77 in january as part of his sweeping policy to introduce 
democratic change to the island 
his successor president lee tenghui is a firm supporter of 
the voluntary retirement package and final details are expected to 
be announced in coming months

the writer who is based in rome recently was a 
guest in libya and took notes for this story while waiting 
around as guests often must do 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a guest in libya and there are guests 
galore does a lot of waiting but theres always the 
entertainment of watching other guests 
recently there was the man who identified himself as arthur 
blessit from southern california 
he showed up one day pulling a wooden cross on wheels and said 
hes been doing that for the past 19 years in all parts of the 
world 
he told a libyan television crew he and his teenage son planned 
to pull the cross from tripoli through the desert to ghadames 250 
miles to the south near the borders of algeria and tunisia 
when blessit and his cross rolled out of sight heinz weifenbach 
came by the hotel lobby where other guests were waiting around 
weifenbach is the burly mustachioed west german who turned to 
col moammar gadhafi for financing for his ice hockey team back 
home and he said he was waiting to catch a plane to tobruk near 
the egyptian border to hear the libyan leader make a speech 
according to jana the official libyan news agency guests pour 
into libya all the time from all over even from indian 
reservations in the united states 
judging by jana these guests most of them members of 
official delegations dont have a spare moment theyre busy 
bringing flowers to gadhafi busy touring his barrackshome that 
was damaged in the us air attacks in 1986 busy denouncing 
imperialist aggression busy signing guestbooks 
libyan officials like to present guests with programs 
programs are sometimes a tight schedule of hospital tours factory 
visits maybe even a suddenly arranged latenight chat with the 
leader as gadhafi is known here 
but the programs follow libyan time and libyan time 
means long waits in hotel lobbies and in airport lounges some 
guests frustrated by the waiting give up and start for home only 
to be yanked back at the planes door with a promise of an 
encounter with the leader 
but they eventually find out theyve returned only for more 
waiting at the hotel and looking out over the blue mediterranean 
that doesnt sound bad the trouble is all you can do generally 
is look since its difficult to get out the hotel door 
journalist guests for example are often assigned 
assistants these usually are enthusiastic but sometimes 
sourfaced young men or women who work for the information 
ministry they seem to materialize just when the guest is about to 
slip out the door for a look around 
oh you know there might be a press conference with the 
leader my assistant tells me maybe an interview maybe very 
soon 
the guest sinks into a lobby sofa and orders another soft drink 
or tea alcohol is forbidden in gadhafis revolutionary islamic 
society 
for a change of pace from lounge lounging there is corridor 
pacing many of the pacers in hotel corridors are proponents of 
various causes and countries looking for a sympathetic ear 
visitors sometimes feel like theyre in a spy movie with guests 
approaching each other stealthily whispering messages to each 
other 
an arab man leaned toward a western woman in the hotel 
restaurant and said i have something important to tell you 
yes 
you have nice legs 
one sunny afternoon four western visitors asked their 
assistants for a car to go to sabratha site of an ancient 
grecoroman theater 45 miles west of tripoli 
yes maybe there was a car but it was broken it might be 
fixed but not for several hours and the ruins close at sunset 
the guests turned to the taxi drivers outside 
sure said one fifteen dinars about 50 
the libyan assistants appeared and said something quietly in 
arabic to the driver 
thirty dinars maybe 50 said the driver 
it was clear the assistants didnt want the guests going off 
without a program 
a few days later jana reported on the doings of an austrian 
youth delegation 
the youths went to a poultry factory and to the ruins of 
sabratha it said 
they had a program

two years after brian keenan 
disappeared in beirut his mother and two sisters say they too have 
become hostages to unknown kidnappers 
if they could only let us know whether hes alive or dead 
even if hes dead it would be better than hoping all the time 
said his younger sister elaine spence 
despite petitions and appeals to the lebanese people and the 
iranian and syrian governments no group has claimed responsibility 
for the disappearance of the 37yearold teacher who is a citizen 
of the irish republic to the south even though he was born and 
lived in northern ireland 
keenan rushed out of his apartment april 11 1986 late for an 8 
am lecture at the american university in beirut where he had 
taught for four months 
his mistake the family believes was to forget his irish 
passport 
they believe he was kidnapped by people who may have thought he 
was american or british rather than a citizen of a small neutral 
country 
irelands only involvement in the middle east is through aid 
groups and its contingent in the united nations peacekeeping force 
in lebanon 
immediately after keenan disappeared the irish government in 
dublin issued photographs of his passport and repeatedly broadcast 
that he was an irish citizen raising the familys hopes that he 
might be released quickly 
but two years later keenan remains the only irishman among the 
22 foreigners missing in lebanon 
his family is resigned to an indefinite wait for his return 
we still feel hes alive and were not going to give up 
hope said his older sister brenda gillham we never thought 
it would last as long as this but were going to keep on fighting 
until we see him released 
irelands ambassador to iraq patrick mccabe who is also 
accredited as the envoy to lebanon was quoted in dublins sunday 
press newspaper april 3 as saying people we have talked to do 
not think mr keenan is dead he added the newspaper reported 
that hostages could be held for years without their captors making 
contact and that gives us some hope 
the only reported sighting of keenan came from a french hostage 
camille sontag 85 who was freed in november 1986 he said one of 
the five westerners held with him in an underground prison in south 
beirut by proiranian shiite moslems slipped him a piece of paper 
on which was written i am irish please tell my family 
keenans sisters and his 65yearold mother minnie were 
encouraged by sontags message but disheartened this past march 
when nabih berri leader of the lebanese amal militia said that 
because he had heard nothing about keenan he feared him dead 
a photograph of keenan and a scrapbook of news clippings about 
all the hostages in lebanon have a special place in mrs gillhams 
tidy living room in a statesubsidized development in east belfast 
its not only the hostage himself thats held his familys 
held hostage as well she said in our own home youre afraid 
to go out in case the phone rings if you go out for a night out 
you feel guilty the fact that you might be trying to enjoy 
yourselves and brians sitting in a cell somewhere 
belfastborn keenan had lived in the turmoil of sectarian strife 
that has gripped northern ireland for nearly 20 years 
a protestant he chose to become a citizen of predominantly 
roman catholic ireland rather than of britain which governs the 
province everyone born in northern ireland has the option of 
becoming a citizen of either 
in addition to teaching keenan was a community worker for the 
belfast city council 
he has many protestant and catholic friends said mrs 
gillham he tried to build communication on both sides he loved 
his country 
mrs spence said the family did not want his kidnapping to 
become a political issue 
in december two senior officials from sinn fein the legal 
political wing of the outlawed irish republican army went to 
beirut without the familys knowledge to try to win keenans 
freedom 
mrs gillham said it was the similarities between northern 
ireland and lebanon that attracted her bearded easygoing brother 
to beirut 
when he told me he was going i said to him are you sure you 
know what youre doing its like going from the frying pan into 
the fire 
but as brian said theres a war there theres a war here at 
home and life has to go on

even though eastwest relations have 
thawed communist espionage is on the rise in west germany and 
probably is aimed more at hightech industrial secrets than 
military or political ones officials say 
west germany has been infested with communist spies since its 
creation in 1949 in the ashes of world war ii the spying has 
ranged from east german truck drivers rolling through the 
countryside to moles in the highest of government offices 
among the most important spies caught were guenter guillaume 
who wrecked chancellor willy brandts government in 1974 margret 
hoeke who was a secretary to five presidents and manfred rotsch 
who delivered topsecret nato documents to the soviets 
but just last month west german federal police arrested 11 
people suspected of working for the kgb the soviet intelligence 
agency and are investigating others 
the large number of arrests confirms that instead of 
refraining from activating agents in a time of detente the east 
bloc is intensifying its espionage activities interior minister 
friedrich zimmermann told reporters after the march sweep 
hansgert lange spokesman for the office for the protection of 
the constitution west germanys counterespionage agency said 
warmer eastwest relations increase the opportunities for spying 
the thaw has increased interest in obtaining information and 
also improved conditions for espionage lange said in an 
interview at his cologne office 
lange added that because some communist countries have loosened 
emigration restrictions a danger increases that agents have been 
planted among the refugees 
emigration plays an important role in espionage in the federal 
republic west germany as has been shown by the arrest of the 
suspected kgb agents lange said 
among the 11 suspects arrested in march were four soviet emigres 
with communist research lagging behind the west in many areas 
soviet bloc agents have intensified their efforts to obtain secrets 
from private companies in science and hightech fields lange said 
the interest in political secrets is still great but for 
technological and scientific matters it has grown considerably 
lange said 
security officials estimate that as many as 3000 spies are at 
work in west germany most of them from east germany between 30 
and 50 suspected spies are arrested each year the 
counterintelligence office says 
secretaries and other government employees in bonn the nations 
capital are among those who have been caught 
also security officials have long suspected that east german 
truckers driving through west germany report on military movements 
and gather other information for the east german secret service 
but a spy can come from anywhere 
west germany automatically grants citizenship to all ethnic 
german refugees from the east bloc making the task of isolating 
communist agents extremely difficult 
in addition west germany and east germany have improved 
relations over the past few years resulting in more contacts 
between the two sides and greater chances for espionage 
east german authorities have allowed the resettling of its 
citizens to west germany to increase dramatically reaching a high 
of 30000 in 1984 compared to just 7000 the year before 
according to federal statistics 
past spy scandals have damaged the nations image among other 
nato allies 
west germany arrested 16 communist agents in 1976 after cracking 
east german infiltration methods but it turned out that two of the 
spies lotharerwin lutze and his wife renate had been passing 
nato documents to east germany since the 1960s west german defense 
minister georg leber resigned over that scandal 
in 1974 guenter guillaume a close aide to chancellor brandt 
was exposed as an east german agent and brandt resigned 
guillaume began serving a 13year jail sentence in 1975 the 
longest ever given by a west german court to a convicted spy but 
he was released six years later in an exchange of agents with east 
germany 
in 1985 the constititution protection office itself was rocked 
by the defection to east germany of hansjoachim tiedge who headed 
an agency group responsible for catching east german spies 
security officials believe many of the communist agents in west 
germany now can do only minor damage 
but one must be careful when one uses the term small fish 
said lange a small fish can always become a bigger one

the disappearance of a leading nuclear 
scientist has taiwanese fuming at the united states and worrying 
about damage to their national security 
newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after col chang hsienyi 
vanished in midjanuary that he worked for the us central 
intelligence agency and might have turned over nuclear secrets to 
the americans 
chang was a deputy director of the official institute of nuclear 
energy research he disappeared while on leave from his post 
we immediately looked at this map maybe he fell off a 
cliff said liu kuangchi secretary general of the government 
atomic energy council as he moved to an office wall map of taiwan 
and traced a route along rugged interior roads 
but several local newspapers provided a different scenario for 
changs disappearance reporting that he was a cia informant who 
left for the united states with details about a taiwanese nuclear 
weapons program 
a us state department spokeswoman phyllis e oakley said in 
washington last month that the department had no comment on whether 
chang was an informant for the united states 
in taipei david hess spokesman for the american institute of 
taiwan which oversees us interests here has told the government 
and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to chang 
taiwan officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear 
bomb communist china has said the production of atomic weapons by 
taiwan would be reason to invade the island which beijing regards 
as a renegade province 
nevertheless the uproar over chang has increased antiamerican 
sentiment that already was brewing here because of washingtons 
tough trade talk with taiwan which last year had record 16 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
although the united states in 1979 broke diplomatic relations 
with taiwan and recognized the communist china government 
washington remains the islands major trade partner and arms 
supplier the american institute of taiwan serves as an operative 
diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy 
i get a lot of hot reaction from my students said su chi a 
member of the institute of international relations who also teaches 
at national chengchi university until this point theres always 
been a huge reservoir of good will toward the united states but 
i think the reservoir has cracked 
the taiwan media which has given intense coverage to changs 
disappearance also has criticized the united states 
a march 25 commentary in the masscirculation china times said 
that no matter what the motive the act of stealing our defense 
secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a 
certain degree no one can interpret this as friendly 
behavior 
taiwan officials now believe chang is in washington they have 
asked the united states for information about him but the reagan 
administration claims it does not know his whereabouts 
deputy foreign minister john chang recently said taiwan cannot 
lodge a protest with the united states because we dont have 
evidence showing us government or cia involvement 
but jaw shaukong a maverick lawmaker from the governing 
nationalist party is demanding retaliatory action 
the government probably should expel some us diplomats 
from taiwan expel some cia it cannot keep silent said jaw who 
views the united states as an imperialist nation 
jaw said he fears chang took important military secrets 
possibly classified information about taiwans missile development 
program jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into 
the hands of communist china 
liu the nuclear energy official noted that many of changs 
classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the 
militaryrun chungshan institute of science and technology 
the government maintains however chang did not take any 
sensitive information from chungshan liu believes the missing 
scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew 
of work done by the nuclear energy research center staff for 
militaryrelated chungshan projects 
professor su believes changs disappearance is unlikely to cause 
a serious reevaluation of taiwaneseus relations but could 
eventually lead to public debate of the countrys nuclear policy 
in early april the masscirculation united daily news newspaper 
published a poll that indicated taiwan was split over the 
development of nuclear weapons 
according to the survey 35 percent of the 767 people polled by 
telephone said taiwan should make atomic bombs while 34 percent 
were against such a policy the poll with a margin of error of 35 
percentage points indicated most people believe taiwan is capable 
of making the weapons 
nearly threefourths of the respondents said that if taiwan 
developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland 
china

excellence in education set off alarms with a provocative report 
that warned of a rising tide of mediocrity in us schools the 
man behind that report terrel h bell says he never expected such 
a stir but now he fears the school reform movement has left behind 
the bottom 30 percent of americas children the poor the 
minorities the dropouts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
th bell considered by many to be the father 
of the school reform movement views himself as a failure when it 
came to educating the most important pupil he ever faced ronald 
reagan 
three years after he quit the reagan cabinet bell frets that 
school reform didnt do a darn thing to solve the problem of 
dropouts and those who can barely read the words on their high 
school diplomas most are poor many are minorities 
were losing 30 percent to 40 percent of the rising 
generation says the former secretary of education theyre out 
of school and theyre unemployed and unemployable 
it might have been different he says if president reagan had 
taken to heart the message of the bombshell report that bell 
commissioned a nation at risk 
the national commission on excellence in education made 
headlines on april 26 1983 with its blunt warning the 
educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded 
by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a 
nation and a people 
reagan responded by extolling tuition tax credits and prayer in 
public schools two things that a nation a risk never touched 
upon 
but the president and his advisers soon realized that it made 
political sense to pay more attention to education reagan began 
visiting schools and speaking out about the need for tougher 
standards for students and teachers alike 
bell who had come to washington to preside over a department 
reagan had promised to abolish began traveling with the president 
on air force one and handing out flags of excellence to schools 
at white house ceremonies governors and business leaders took the 
school reform message to heart and began pouring more dollars into 
local school budgets while seeking to hold educators more 
accountable 
republican party chief frank fahrenkopf jr called bell the 
secondmost important man in this administration and in perhaps 
the ultimate compliment reagan who had sought to cut billions 
from the education budget actually proposed a modest budget 
increase in 1984 an election year 
but when that election was over bell says the white house sent 
word that reagan would try with renewed vigor to boot education out 
of his cabinet bell submitted his resignation and returned to salt 
lake city to teach at the university of utah 
now he has written a book the thirteenth man a reagan 
cabinet memoir that lays bare his struggles within the 
administration and the regrets that set in after he left it 
i tried to convince the president and his people of the bonds 
that tie together education the economy and military strength but 
notwithstanding the fact that i had been a teacher for much of my 
adult life i never succeeded in getting this lesson across to 
them bell wrote 
bell in his book made no mention of his successor william j 
bennett who has been a forceful advocate of tougher standards for 
schools and colleges and has made his own headlines with studies 
comparing us and japanese schools and proposing a core high 
school curriculum 
but bell thinks the reagan administration reponse in the second 
term has been inadequate 
bennett has very effectively used the bully pulpit bell 
said in an interview but for some reason the response hasnt 
been such as to rally the whole nation around this the fact that 
were losing a third of the whole nation to academic deficiency and 
illiteracy im not talking about bennett so much as i am about 
ronald reagan 
we missed an opportunity to fully take advantage of a nation 
at risk and all the attention on it by not giving it a high 
priority and a high profile in the second term bell says had 
the president done that the results of the reform movement would 
have been much more impressive than they are 
bell credits reagan with moving the country away from the 
drift toward the welfare state and highlighting the strength of our 
capitalist free enterprise system but bell adds he could 
have added to that by being the president who turned around and 
solved the american education system we cant say that now 
bennett asked about the bell book at a congressional hearing 
said the thirteenth man suggests bell was the only virtuous 
man in the administration and the rest were knaves and louts 
unlike bell i wont leave the job and then go write a book 
criticizing the people for whom i worked bennett said

bell takes no comfort from the education rhetoric he has heard 
from the presidential candidates including promises from both 
george bush and michael dukakis that they will be the education 
president 
we should be asking the presidential candidates if elected 
what do you plan to do to lead the nation into a truly great 
education system and to transform america into a learning 
society 
even before it was published the thirteenth man made 
headlines with bells claim that he heard midlevel rightwing 
staffers in the white house and at omb make racist jokes and 
ethnic slurs bell has never named names 
the book recounts bells bitter often losing struggles within 
the administration on budget personnel and policy with people whom 
he regarded as conservative ideologues 
conservatives regarded bell as a mole of the education 
establishment in the reagan cabinet a bigspending liberal who had 
testified in 1978 in favor of creating the education department 
if they needed any evidence to support those views bell 
provides it in abundance in the thirteenth man 
those who accused me of being part of the educational 
establishment were right said bell who had served two previous 
stints in washington one as us commissioner of education in the 
ford administration between school posts in utah 
bell calls for 25 billion in new federal state and local 
spending on the chapter 1 remedial program for disadvantaged 
students head start the preschool program for poor children and 
the job corps 
he said the country should attack the problems of illiteracy and 
dropouts with a national movement of the magnitude of the 
marshall plan that helped rebuild the warravaged nations of europe 
at the end of world war ii 
but he says money by itself is not the answer we cannot 
ignore the other part of education and thats the home and 
family 
bells own life story is testimony to the power of both 
education and the family 
bell grew up in poverty in lava hot springs idaho his father 
died in an accident in 1929 when bell was 8 his mother alta 
martin bell raised nine kids in the depression on virtually no 
money 
when he graduated from high school as valedictorian he wore a 
suit that without his knowledge mrs bell had bought with money 
donated by his teachers he headed off to the college with the 
lowest tuition in the state albion state normal school it charged 
1150 per semester 
my life at albion opened richnesses beyond anything i ever 
imagined he recalls i was ignorant of our own history and of 
the great literature of the western world i knew nothing of the 
federalist papers the works of tolstoy or the rudiments of 
economics this all came to me courtesy of the taxpayers who 
founded and supported a state normal school to prepare teachers to 
teach their children and grandchildren 
it also came courtesy of president franklin d roosevelts new 
deal and the congress which supported the parttime national youth 
administration job that paid him 17 a month enough to cover his 
4 rent and leave 13 for food which his mother supplemented by 
mailing four loaves of bread every wednesday 
his experiences at albion now defunct made it all the harder 
for bell to support reagan cuts in student aid cuts he now says 
were absolutely wrong 
bell said that when he left washington to return to salt lake 
city i had a nagging feeling of betrayali felt frustration at 
not having been able to secure an enduring commitment to the cause 
of education at the highest federal level 
on the positive side he says we are educating 60 to 70 
percent of the youth of america better than in previous decades 
collegeentrance test scores have stopped sliding states have 
raised high school graduation requirements dramatically and 
installed competency tests for both students and entrylevel 
teachers and at least 30 states have taken steps to build career 
ladders for teachers that reward distinguished teaching 
performance 
but he says then there are the bottom 30 percent to 40 percent 
of students for whom the push for school reform didnt do a darn 
thing 
in my mind he adds nothing could have assured ronald 
reagans place in history more than his enduring commitment to the 
school reform movement that he supported so effectively for 18 
months only to abandon it after the election 
failure to educate millions of our people adequately will move 
us toward disaster if we do not alter course he warns

county fla which encompasses miami local schools are given more 
autonomy and teachers themselves help make the decisions the final 
grades arent in yet but it looks like the program is getting good 
marks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when school administrators sit up and pay attention 
to what teachers have to say students learn more 
thats the theory behind a pilot program in miami and the rest 
of dade county that has educators across the country taking notes 
we people on the front lines and we really are on the front 
lines have a real contribution to make says linda lentin a 
firstgrade teacher at north miami elementary and dade countys 
teacher of the year a classroom instructor with 30 years of 
experience 
schoolbased management and shared decisionmaking are the 
cornerstones of the program implemented by the dade county school 
board and united teachers of dade in the fourthlargest school 
district in the country with 255000 students in 260 schools 
other elements of the program include a proposal to improve 
innercity schools by involving various community organizations 
saturday classes a satellite kindergarten in an insurance company 
and various professional growth initiatives 
but the decision to give schools more say in their own 
management with input from teacher committees is the most 
fundamental of the reforms which had the enthusiastic support of 
the teachers union 
last spring 53 schools designed programs detailing how they 
would make decisions normally handed down from a central or 
regional office concerning such things as budget curriculum and 
schedules 
eighteen elementary schools 10 middle or junior schools four 
high schools and one adult education center were chosen to 
participate in the fouryear program that began this school year 
the people that are the closest to making the decisions as to 
what needs to be done to educate the kids were talking about the 
teachers are actively involved in that process says elliott 
berman principal of southwood junior high 
the concept of teachers committees participating is 
revolutionary according to pat tornillo executive vice president 
of the teachers union 
its put dade county at the cutting edge of educational reform 
says joseph a fernandez superintendent of schools 
people across the country are looking on in amazement 
berman said recently just before he left for acapulco mexico 
with three other dade educators to discuss whats happening here 
dade officials have been invited to cities across the united 
states to explain the program and interest has been expressed from 
as far away as japan says lynn shenkman a spokeswoman for dade 
schools educators from elsewhere also come to dade to see the 
innovations she says 
we have a lot of people that come in and marvel says larry 
feldman principal of palmetto elementary school 
feldman says that since the program was implemented enrollment 
has jumped from 360 to 480 volunteers have increased and 
businesses are proposing school projects 
palmetto which was 25th in attendance among dades 178 
elementary schools moved up to first place with 974 percent 
average daily attendance record 
since parents had expressed dissatisfaction with the schools 
spanish program the committees proposed hiring teachers from 
berlitz language school one of the more widely publicized changes 
in dade 
teachers also decided it would be better to spend money on aides 
rather than a parttime assistant principal but the most important 
change members of a fiveperson steering committee unanimously 
agree is something they call flipflopping 
under the scheduling innovation classes are divided into 
thirds twice a day one third might go to music class and another 
third to library the classroom teacher then gets to teach basic 
skills to a very small group of children 
were able to really work with them and give them the 
individual help they need says bobbie z davis a fourthgrade 
teacher on the steering committee 
when were flipflopping we dont have discipline problems 
says mercides hunter the schools union steward who chairs the 
steering committee and teaches third grade 
carole wiener who chairs the schools scheduling and curriculum 
committee praises the flipflop for another reason it enables her 
to teach social studies through art a specialized class she 
developed under schoolbased management 
the changes initiated by teachers have varied widely from school 
to school 
at mrs lentins school a common dismissal time was adopted for 
all grades for the safety of younger children who previously had to 
wait for older brothers or sisters to get out of school 
in bermans school teachers outlined major objectives for the 
school year including closing the minority achievement gap 
infusing critical thinking throughout the curriculum increasing 
teacher expectations encouraging handicapped students to stay in 
school and improving standardized test scores 
in bunche park elementary school in opalocka mildly 
handicapped students now have a housekeeping lab to learn how to 
take care of themselves and elaborate report cards come out every 
six weeks instead of every nine weeks 
charles hadley elementary in western dade county came up with a 
new way of hiring good teachers let teachers themselves do the 
hiring 
our current teachers interview prospective teachers says 
hadley principal menia stone oooh theyre tough they ask 
questions i wouldnt dare ask 
six new teachers have been hired so far and stone has not gone 
against her teachers recommendations once 
hadley is also offering sixthgraders two elective courses on 
friday afternoons when students can take drama advanced 
computers video productions geography and other courses not 
normally offered 
schoolbased management is the kind of program teachers have 
dreamed about for years says merri mann a professional issues 
specialist with the teachers union

for a generation or two of rowdy texans it was a little bit of 
both now the partys almost over 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was a gaudy mix of burglars 
bootleggers and billionaires rogues and royalty whores and hit 
men rednecks and roughnecks and college kids on the prowl 
it was cold beer and hot dice and warm summer nights dancing 
under the stars at lake worth 
it was murder and mayhem cops and robbers rhythm and blues and 
the big band sounds of billy may and paul whiteman 
it was the rocket the skyliner the black cat the showboat 
the barrel the casino the 3939 the four deuces the cocoanut 
grove the bad liquor masseys and the lure of a young babyfaced 
stripper named candy barr 
it was jacksboro highway or texas 199 a neon ribbon of revelry 
flowing northwest out of fort worth toward azle jacksboro wichita 
falls and amarillo 
in its heyday a 10mile stretch of that highway was a symbol of 
the states roughandtumble heritage and a playground for the 
brave bold adventuresome and foolhardy

as a youngster growing up on jacksboro highway pat kirkwood 
scrambled atop the roof of his dads gambling joint on saturday 
nights and assessed the economy by activities along the road below 
if it was a threeambulance evening money was a little 
tight he recalls but seven or eight ambulances meant 
everything was ok people were out spending money and boozing and 
brawling 
kirkwood 60 called them the good old bad days 
well the good old bad days are gone and so is the jacksboro 
highway of yesteryear and whats left of thunder road is about 
to give way to a new eightlane freeway 
a victim of urban growth changing lifestyles and its own wicked 
reputation jacksboro highway has become in recent years something 
of a toothless lion and a bit of an eyesore 
the new freeway with a 1990 start date may cut down the few 
remaining landmarks and provide the final nail in the coffin of a 
wild and woolly era

tincy eggleston was not the toughest of the jacksboro highway 
regulars but he ranked right up there with the meanest like his 
buddies cecil green and gene paul norris and several other world 
class thugs tincy had a high tolerance for violence 
at 210 am on may 3 1955 tincy and cecil green were busy 
examining the fruits of an extortion caper when two gunmen opened 
fire on their car parked outside a jacksboro highway nightspot 
tincy escaped in a fierce gunbattle but green was fatally 
wounded and died the next day 
unfortunately tincy later had a serious falling out with gene 
paul norris perhaps over the loot from a robbery linked to a cuban 
weapons deal norris killed tincy blew his head away in fact and 
dumped his body in a well 
old gene paul spent an extraordinary amount of time in trouble 
himself none worse than what occurred on april 29 1957 that day 
he and a pal named william humphrey were rehearsing a scheme to rob 
the carswell air force base payroll 
incidentally the jacksboro highway was off limits to carswell 
personnel in part because someone finally figured out that 
cowboys cedar choppers cold beer and yankee flyboys were a 
volatile mix 
at any rate an army of law enforcement officers that included 
the police chief the sheriff and the texas rangers interrupted the 
robbery rehearsal and chased gene paul and his crony out the 
jacksboro highway nearly to springtown 
after wrecking their car the two desperadoes exchanged gunfire 
with officers as they fled on foot along walnut creek both were 
gunned down and died at the scene

i grew up in a strange environment he quips 
he and others of his era maintain that pappy kirkwoods club 
enjoyed a reputation not only as a squeaky clean gambling den but 
also a place where the rich and powerful could eat drink and wager 
in private 
that group kirkwood said included dick kleberg of the vast 
king ranch family us house speaker sam rayburn and big game 
hunter frank buck 
they were our house guests all the time he said pop 
would close the gambling joint sometimes and he and sam would knock 
down about two quarts of jack daniels a day i didnt know much 
about politics but i knew this was a powerful man 
it was a gambling joint and maybe a little illegal but sam 
and the others were comfortable there pop had new york strip 
steaks flown in and served the finest duck and geese and the best

aside from tincy eggleston and his crowd among the bestknown 
and bestliked figures on the jacksboro highway were a gambler a 
sheriff and a man who probably has owned more clubs than anyone 
along the strip 
that in itself says much about the jacksboro highway 
the gambler was of course pappy kirkwood who died in 1983 and 
the sheriff was the late sully montgomery who friends say winked 
at the law when it came to gambling girls and illegal booze but 
would not tolerate serious criminal activities 
those same friends concede that sully raked off a generous 
amount of the cash flowing up and down the highway but they 
maintain he was a first cousin to robin hood and shared his 
wealth with the less fortunate 
it is not clear however who those less fortunate were 
but for sheer dash color and staying power few could rival 
cliff helton whose clubs included the cocoanut grove the magic 
lounge the barrel the sugar pool and the thunderbird 
i owned the barrel seven different times says helton 72 
who in the good old bad days was known as mayor of jacksboro 
highway 
helton met and mingled with the best and worst of the jacksboro 
crowd and knows a great deal more about the strip than hes willing 
to tell for the record 
he took a reporter on a recent tour of the highway pointing out 
such landmarks as the skyliner ballroom where stripper candy barr 
performed and the spot where tincy eggleston and cecil green were 
ambushed 
helton explained how a gambler survived an intricately conceived 
house bombing behind the original chenaults drivein only to be 
gunned down later on watauga road 
it was back down the highway at the albatross club that heltons 
buddy junior dodd celebrated his last birthday a gambler best 
known to reporters and lawyers for his homesmoked barbecue junior 
was shot to death shortly after leaving the party 
heltons tour that evening took him past the chateau once a 
gambling palace called the 3939 club and out to lake worth and 
casino beach site of the grand old casino ballroom 
in the 1950s that was the nicest place on the jacksboro 
highway recalls a 50ish beverly nettles who grew up on the 
north side they had all the big bands and you could dance 
inside or outside 
thirty years ago at that age that was the place to be the 
skyliner and the rocket were raunchier 
helton noted that a car lot stands now where first the ring side 
and later the ultraplush 400 club provided latenight and 
afterhours dining and dancing downstairs and gambling upstairs 
retired state judge byron matthews says the 400 club flourished 
in the 1930s and 1940s with name bands and top floor shows and what 
may have been the first precut steaks in texas 
it was first class said matthews who earned a reputation 
as the best criminal trial lawyer in town by defending more than 
100 accused killers a sizeable number of them from jacksboro 
highway 
heltons tour took him finally to masseys club 21 which holds 
the oldest continuous beer and wine license in tarrant county and 
is probably the oldest business establishment on jacksboro highway 
opened in 1934 in an old streetcar masseys today is the 
quintessential texas roadhouse with its neon beer signs leather 
bar stools tombstone pizza and dancing on wednesdays fridays and 
saturdays to a group called the jacksboro highway band 
hanging behind the bar is a 1936 photograph of a dapper cliff 
helton standing beside a wrecked ford coupe 
laughing helton recalled the time years ago when a drunk 
entered one of his clubs and asked where he could get a bite to 
eat helton directed him to masseys 
a short time later the phone rang it was massey 
cliff dont you ever send me no more business he wailed 
the drunk had driven his pickup truck through a wall into 
masseys kitchen 
masseys widow adrian is still a jacksboro highway fixture and 
his soninlaw bobby sitton now runs the club 
bemoaning the pending freeway told a reporter it looks like 
theyre going to put us out of businesstheyre tearing down 
tradition here

editors note they live in a cluster of towns in the suburbs 
of new york city a mixedrace people not fully accepted as whites 
blacks or indians but leaders of the ramapo mountain people insist 
they are descended primarily from the lenni lenape indians 
indigenous to the region and have asked the federal government to 
recognize them as a bona fide tribe at stake are some economic 
benefits not the least of which is prospects for a lucrative bingo 
business

from atop manhattans world trade center 
you can just about see chief ronald redbones homeland 
redbone and a 2800member tribe of the ramapo mountain people 
live about 30 miles away beyond the broad waterway that henry 
hudson claimed for the dutch in 1609 beyond the suburbs and 
department stores of northern new jersey beyond too the great 
highways and metropolitan traffic pulsing through the jetstreaked 
smog 
there live redbone and his people in the bosom of the ramapo 
mountains on the edge of the din professional shingles are few 
and many eke out marginal livings as mechanics domestic help 
school bus drivers and the like much industry that once bolstered 
their community like the ford mahwah plant where redbone worked 
for 28 years has left for more desirable locations 
the community is a cultural eddy of mixedrace people not fully 
accepted as whites blacks or indians my grandfather was wearing 
a threepiece suit while indians out west were still shooting bows 
and arrows redbone says 
the chief is leading his peoples effort to wrest formal 
recognition as a bona fide indian tribe from a wary us government 
by years end community leaders say such recognition could 
eventually translate into increased public assistance millions in 
profits from highstakes bingo games which are allowed on indian 
reservations and jobs for many of the tribes idle young people 
some ramapo people also hope it will put to rest forever the 
identity crisis of their community reviled as inbred and dangerous 
by many outsiders and grasping at fleeting threads of a heritage 
disputed by anthropologists 
weve been recognized as a little bit of everything but what 
we want to be recognized as says nicholas van dunk of hillburn 
a village on the new yorknew jersey border where hundreds of 
ramapo mountain people live we know that were a mixed people 
but we know too that the strongest part of our background is 
american indian 
the ramapo people sometimes shy about talking to outsiders say 
theyve been victimized by prejudice the press and even by 
progress 
the characterization they put on us was that we were shifty 
you couldnt go near us if you gave us a job wed rob you 
redbone says if somebody would tell the truth not make out like 
we were going to doggone skin you alive it would be a lot easier 
also known as ronald van dunk redbone is a first cousin and 
neighbor of nicholas van dunk van dunk mailboxes line the streets 
of hillburn you also see many de freeses de groats and manns 
in fact in order to be accepted as a tribe member a person 
must either carry one of only six family names or one of his 
ancestors must have the chief says 
the ramapo people who live mainly in three communities 
straddling the new yorknew jersey border have been held in 
contempt by many outsiders for inbreeding 
its one of the few communities you go through where 
twothirds of the people have two family names and the other third 
is probably related says a state legislative aide from the area 
who asked to remain anonymous 
redbone a handsome man of 55 with ruddy skin gray hair and a 
pancho villa mustache that belies his shyness dismisses questions 
about inbreeding hes heard them before 
what people dont understand is that not every van dunk is 
related he says thats been part of the problem people think 
theres incest and all that but thats not really true 
the actual origins of the ramapo people are obscured by fallible 
memory folklore and prejudice knowledgeable people agree the 
community represents a complex amalgam of white black and indian 
heritage 
yet the exact racial blend remains disputed with some 
anthropological authorities challenging the tribes mainly oral 
account of its own history 
david cohen who directs the ethnic history program for the new 
jersey historical commission in trenton argues that redbones 
people derive from a handful of freed black landowners of dutch 
heritage originally from new york city who eventually found shelter 
in the ramapo mountains in the early 1800s

<TEXT>
cohen made his case in a book the ramapo mountain people 
that he wrote in 1974 after living for several months in the 
community the handbook of north american indians a basic 
reference work accepts his account 
in his book cohen also tried to debunk as folklore a story that 
redbones people find their beginnings in english and west indian 
prostitutes who escaped from british troops stationed in new york 
city one of the sailors who brought the women was supposedly named 
jackson and even today some outsiders refer to redbones people as 
jackson whites 
cohen is now viewed by many in the community as persona non 
grata because he argued for the primacy of black rather than 
indian ancestry i think david cohen was a little bit out in left 
field says nicholas van dunk redbones cousin he had a 
racial problem i think 
though community members present a range of skin tones and 
racial features leaders say ramapo mountain families have always 
considered themselves american indians descended primarily from 
lenni lenape indians indigenous to the area they say their 
community has always maintained some form of tribal leadership one 
of the criteria they must meet to satisfy the federal government of 
their authenticity 
todays tribal council includes three members from each of the 
ramapos main communities all within about a 10mile radius 
hillburn and on the new jersey side of the border mahwah and 
ringwood those three communities also constitute geographically 
defined clans hillburn of the deer mahwah the fox and ringwood 
the turtle 
redbones own indian name stems from his peoples belief that a 
red haze enshrouds the bones of a true indian 
but the ramapo mountain people need more than their own beliefs 
to gain washingtons seal of approval 
bud shapard branch chief of the acknowledgment and research 
division of the us bureau of indian affairs in washington says 
its difficult for many communities to demonstrate to the 
government theyre indians he said they must show among other 
requirements that theyve been viewed by the surrounding 
community other tribes and state agencies as a separate community 
from the first contact with european settlers until the present 
its a very lengthy process at this time shapard says he 
notes that his department this year can handle only three or four 
of the more than 100 petitions for recognition pending nationwide 
the ramapo people have already achieved some acknowledgment from 
their states both the new jersey legislature and the new york 
assembly have recognized them as a legitimate tribe 
still the farflung ramapo people must make an especially 
difficult argument in order to join the more than 500 federally 
acknowledged tribes their people though concentrated in hillburn 
and mahwah are strewn from the southern catskill mountains of new 
york as far south as north carolina even in their new yorknew 
jersey border communities the ramapo people mingle in varying 
proportions with other residents 
not being on a reservation redbone says you dont really 
get the closeness 
the administrative review process can take up to 10 years 
according to the tribes washington lobbyist charles blackwell 
the ramapo people hope to sidestep the difficulties and bottlenecks 
at the bureau of indian affairs by pleading their case right to 
congress which does in rare instances act to recognize a tribe 
by a simple majority vote of both houses 
some local outsiders fear recognition would herald a land claim 
by the ramapo people similar to those of other new york tribes 
that would put their property in jeopardy they are uneasy with the 
prospect of an indian reservation exempt from many state and 
federal taxes and regulations 
following the lead of many tribes around the country the ramapo 
people hope eventually to derive a hefty income from highstakes 
bingo profits they have turned to florida real estate developer 
bob frank whos bankrolling the recognition drive with about 
250000 
in return the ramapo people will let him and another private 
investor from the new york city area run the bingo operation frank 
estimates the games will rake in up to 12 million annually which 
he will split roughly halfandhalf with the tribe for the first 10 
years 
naturally the big thing with this is providing employment for 
members of the tribe he says it also provides a living for 
me

editors note to cynthia moss who spent years in the wilds of 
africa elephants are special endearing animals in her book 
elephant memories she tells why describing the close familial 
relationships and bonding among elephants i want people to know 
that so they care enough to save them she says 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
cynthia moss native of ossining ny 
philosophy major at smith college and magazine researcherreporter 
for four years took a fiveweek vacation when she was 27 to visit 
a friend in africa 
i went to see one of the last wilderness areas but i ended up 
falling in love with the country she says 
and later with elephants 
so much so that without any scientific training she has become 
an authority on the elephants of amboseli national park in kenya 
and has published an account based on 13 years of observing the 
population and its behavior through periods of drought and 
scarcity plentiful rain and overabundance she watched as 
poachers masai warriors injury disease and tourists interfered 
some survived some did not 
her book elephant memories tells much about the intricate 
bonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout their 
lives 
its a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings of 
relationships from the most intense the mother and her newborn 
calf to the mother and her other immature offspring through 
family units bond groups and clans 
moss was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchs 
in times of drought confirming the powers of elephants memories 
they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was most 
likely to survive and so they managed in tough times she found 
elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively 
she saw that family members will risk danger charging the 
poachers to protect their own while more distant clan members will 
run 
the book is not just about numbers says moss director of 
elephant research in the park i want people to realize how 
special elephants are how funny how endearing they can be i want 
people to know that so they care enough to save them 
she writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other after 
a separation or as young males gleefully playfight with each 
other she writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calf 
tries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life and 
tries over and over to hoist it to its feet 
she writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains as 
they come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them 
throwing them in the air perhaps to decipher the correct obituary 
one prestigious critic who liked the book accused her of 
anthropomorphizing the behemoths 
thats a rather outofdate thing to say retorts moss a 
scientist would not make that accusation that is all part of field 
work 
moss considers herself lucky for getting a head start in her 
field work by being offered a research assistants job by iain 
douglashamilton a pioneer in using extensive photography so that 
he could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in a 
study in tanzania moss worked with him for several years before 
embarking on her own 
today it would be almost impossible to do it the way i did 
it she says for someone with no field experience to get a 
paying job would be almost impossible 
she estimates that her research paid for mainly by the african 
wildlife foundation the merlin foundation and the new york 
zoological society probably cost 100000 for her nearly 20 years 
in the wild 
moss did not live all alone for long periods such as jane 
goodall did initially in her studies of chimpanzees or the late 
diane fossey in her gorilla work other researchers were nearby

because we were all expatriates and interested in the same 
things there was a real camaraderie she says but she was out 
alone most days in her research vehicle following the elephants 
observing photographing taking notes that would later be fed into 
the computer the elephants had both descriptive names such as 
slit ear and threedigit code names more palatable to computer 
analysis 
it is still a hard life moss suffered through bouts of malaria 
and tick fever and was once badly frightened when menaced by a 
black mamba a snake whose bite is fatal 
the thing i dont like about mambas is that they refuse to run 
away like any other lawabiding snake she says 
she has shooed leopards away by shouting at them endured mock 
charges at her vehicle by the elephants and had her camp 
totaled by elephants when it was left unguarded and the smells 
of fresh bananas and other delicacies overcame whatever inhibitions 
they had 
moss found love among the elephants a remarkable process when 
bull elephants are in must ready to mate they show swollen 
temporal glands on their cheeks that exude viscous liquid the 
bulls also exude a green substance from the business part of the 
anatomy which she first mistook for some kind of infection or 
disease 
she tells about a young female a bride the first time who 
didnt know the rules after breeding with a powerful must male a 
more experienced female sticks close to her consort for three or 
four days insuring that lesspowerful but greatly interested other 
males keep a safe distance 
this novice kept wandering off from the must male drawing 
instant pursuit from the lesser males who wouldnt have ventured 
close with the must male on hand he was forced to thunder across 
the plain to drive off his rivals 
because of the duration of her study moss was able to note this 
female had learned proper etiquette by the time she was ready to 
breed again 
some of the interesting tidbits such as the fact that elephants 
also communicate on an infrasonic level are not directly from 
moss research but interwined with other researchers 
her decision to pack up and move to africa years ago was made 
easier by the fact that she had no immediate family in the united 
states at the time both her parents had died and her only sister 
was living in italy 
she wrote an earlier popular book portraits in the wild 
which deals with the life of a field worker she has published her 
findings in a number of scientific journals but because she is not 
professionally trained she concedes she may not get full respect 
in some quarters 
she holds no rancor i cant apply for funds from certain 
organizations i was terribly lucky getting started the way i did 
moss objects strongly to some parks practices of culling 
the elephants killing part of the population to keep the numbers 
under control 
elephants are not so many rodents to be exterminated they 
deserve something better than that and i am not afraid to say that 
ethics and morality should be essential considerations in our 
decisions for their future she writes 
killing the elephants seems the simplest and most direct 
solution but only to people who have not watched individuals over 
14 years have not seen the elephants greet one another with 
trumpets of joy seen elephants adults and calves alike running 
and playing across an open pan in the moonlight seen elephants 
trying to lift and hold up a stricken companion seen a female 
stand by her dead baby for four days or seen a 7yearold calf 
gently fondle and stroke and feel the jaw of his dead mother 
i wrote this book she says to share this

editors note a new reconstruction era has come to 
louisiana as a result of the oil bust and historical landmarks 
throughout the state have fallen on hard times many of the 
antebellum mansions that were eventually restored following the 
civil war are back on the market because of the economic crunch 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after the civil war the onceelegant 
plantation mansions along the mississippi river hid their poverty 
behind mossdraped oaks their spacious lawns overgrown with weeds 
the reconstruction era saw house after house fall into ruin 
victims of an economy destroyed by the war and the end of slavery 
finally the 1950s brought the oil boom and a stable national 
economy and people began looking for ways to invest and enjoy their 
money homes on the national historical register became tax 
shelters and those antebellum mansions were purchased by the dozens 
and restored 
now a new reconstruction era has come to louisiana one 
created by another war of sorts an economic one that sent the 
price of oil to the bottom 
historical landmarks throughout louisiana have fallen on hard 
times especially those operated by the state government which 
faces an accumulated deficit of 2 billion 
and many of those proud old mansions are back on the market 
one of them is owned by o j daigle who remembers trudging 
down the dusty river road as a youngster with little money and no 
thought of a future past a wonderful old house named tezcuco 
daigle eventually prospered because his mother sold newspapers 
to send him to college he bought tezcuco which was built in 1855 
by a mexican war hero and restored it to its original grandeur 
when i was a boy i hated what had happened to tezcuco says 
daigle a retired major general who headed the louisiana national 
guard and made his fortune in real estate and the auto business 
the owners put a tin roof on the house because it was cheap and 
theyd keep painting it different colors green red you name 
it 
alas tezcuco is up for sale again with a price tag of 19 
million along with another mansion daigle owns in natchez miss 
its the economy times are bad and its a buyers market 
sighs billy wilcox whose st francisville real estate firm is also 
trying to sell other antebellum homes 
history is taking it on the chin in other ways too 
across the state the museum system has been cut from over 3 
million in operational funds to 1 million and even the famous 
cabildo in the french quarter seat of government in 1795 is 
open only on a parttime basis 
not all of our buildings are open the ones operating are open 
wednesday through sunday said state museum director james f 
sefcik the cabildo is open on that basis we just dont have 
enough staff but these are tough times and we have to recognize 
that 
roy boucvalt a wyoming physician has offered to donate 
mintmere plantation dating from 1857 to an iberia parish cultural 
district if the district will assume a 237000 mortgage on the 
land 
but the parish like the state is hurting for money and has not 
yet taken up boucvalt on his offer 
and across the mississippi river from daigles tezcuco the 
awesome oak alley can be bought for just under 5 million 
they were good tax shelters and they still are says zeb 
mayhew one of seven heirs joining a foundation to sell oak alley 
which is perhaps the most picturesque home in the state 
the highlight of the place is the lane leading to the front 
entrance one created by 28 live oak trees thought to be up to 250 
years old 
more than 70000 tourists paid 5 each to visit oak alley last 
year and those fees plus bedandbreakfast money pay for the 
daytoday operations mayhew says 
however he says the mansion doesnt take in enough money to 
pay for major maintenance work 
the house and outbuildings are owned by a foundation set up to 
take donations to preserve oak alley but people arent as 
interested in saving old houses as they are in helping the poor 
the starving mayhew says i certainly understand that 
nearly all antebellum homes are open to tourists for fees and 
many of the owners take in bedandbreakfast guests 
but not all of the homes command the big prices 
in downtown st francisville sits propinquity built in 1809 and 
used in the civil war as a sanctuary for confederate soldiers who 
stayed in the cellar as the union army rolled by the asking price 
is 250000 
times are bad and i just cant afford the notes says 
clifford wilcox the owner 
his real estate firm also is trying to sell rosebank built in 
1808 and used as an inn for travelers on the natchez trace the 
twostory estate with stately columns can be purchased for 
750000 wilcox says the 10acre estate also includes two smaller 
houses 
daigle wants 250000 for the antebellum house in natchez it 
was owned by governor holmes he says he was governor when 
mississippi was a territory i had it open for tourists but closed 
it years ago because i couldnt find a good manager 
daigle and owners of the other properties arent worried about 
ultimately selling the houses because there are many people around 
the nation like frances kermeen who owns the myrtles in st 
francisville 
im from california and i took a trip down the mississippi 
river about nine years ago on a steamboat kermeen says i 
heard this house was for sale and knew immediately it was for me 
kermeen left what she called a mellow california lifestyle 
and settled in at the myrtles which was built in 1796 by general 
david bradford who fled his native pennsylvania after leading the 
illfated 1794 whiskey rebellion 
i live in this house i love it here kermeen says 
sometimes i wont leave the house for a week 
she operates a bedandbreakfast operation gives guided tours 
and has plans for a large hot tub on the grounds for guests 
im fortunate she says i have other sources of income i 
can afford this lifestyle

nearly five years after it was written 
chess has found its way to broadway 
the musical has survived the illness and death of its first 
director michael bennett technical and set problems that nearly 
capsized the london opening and a confusing flurry of onagain 
offagain announcements about its new york production which fed 
speculation that chess had been checkmated for good 
it has been slow but i dont think that really matters 
says tim rice the man who wrote the lyrics and coauthored the new 
book for the 6 million musical which mixes a love triangle with a 
ussoviet chess match 
its very important to get things right this time its just 
a regular ordinary panic rice laughs but every show goes 
through that 
the other day before the first broadway preview the genial 
43yearold englishman was sipping coffee in a madison avenue 
hotel happy that the postponements are in the past 
the only reason chess has been delayed in all honesty was 
because of the tragedy of michael bennett he says when 
michael got ill we lost our director with 12 weeks to go before 
the london opening we had this enormous set and show and no one 
quite knowing what to do with it 
trevor nunn the man behind cats les miserables and 
starlight express stepped in to supervise the west end 
production he was up against an expensive and recalcitrant 
computerized set involving scores of television monitors 
the tinkering by technicians was frantic but everything was 
finally made to work the show which opened in may 1986 became a 
sizable hit and is still running 
trevor had saved us but he then was totally booked up for the 
best part of two years rice says we thought it was best to 
wait for him for broadway 
while the show waited rice and others refined the show several 
new songs were added to the score which has music by benny 
andersson and bjorn ulvaeus two members of the rock group abba 
playwright richard nelson came aboard to help redo the book more 
spoken dialogue was added 
chess is not based on anything else rice says its not 
an adaptation of a classic or a piece that has no story whatsoever 
its not meant to be just a spectacle its meant to be a story 
the expensive london set designed by robin wagner was jettisoned 
for new york the english production on broadway would have cost 
12 million and require a twoyear run just to pay back its 
investment but there were other reasons that wagner reworked his 
design 
i think we got carried away in london with the set which was 
fantastic but which took away from the plot rice says it 
made a lot of the situations seem unreal youd see songs that were 
being sung in some futurist bathroom and what we were just trying 
to do was tell a story about real people 
chess is rices first broadway musical without andrew lloyd 
webber his partner in three consecutive broadway successes 
jesus christ superstar evita and joseph and the amazing 
technicolor dreamcoat 
rice commuted to sweden during much of 1983 to work with 
andersson and ulvaeus on the score recording sessions began in 
stockholm and london late that year with a cast elaine paige 
tommy korberg and murray head that would eventually appear in the 
london stage version 
releasing the show on record was a tactic rice and lloyd webber 
had used to great success with jesus christ superstar and 
evita it allows songs from the show to find a public 
when chess was released as a tworecord set in late 1984 
several numbers proved popular particularly one night in 
bangkok 
in america they played it as a disco record and it was a 
massive hit rice says i doubt whether many people who bought 
the record understood it came from a show 
another song i know him so well was a no 1 seller in 
england and the rest of europe but fared less well in the united 
states rice says because american radio stations just wouldnt 
play it 
helping put chess on stage has only been a small part of 
rices current activities he runs a cricket team writes books on 
the sport as well as on pop music supervises a publishing company 
and occasionally performs as a singer and actor 
rice has a book about cricket and art paintings about cricket 
coming out in the fall hes an enthusiastic booster of the game 
which mystifies most americans 
american football is instant and very easy to understand once 
its explained he says cricket one game can take five days 
and even then you may not have any results to be honest its more 
like chess than any other game 
the great thing about cricket is the social side of it he 
adds long tea intervals sandwiches and sitting on the lawn in 
deck chairs 
rice also has a passion for pop music a sound he heard first as 
a child in tokyo his father was the far eastern representative for 
an english aircraft company and rice would listen to american armed 
forces radio it was the days of rock around the clock the 
ballad of davy crockett and cherry pink and apple blossom 
white 
almost any pop record released from 1957 to 1967 i love with 
total lack of discrimination he says

the goldmining industry is the powerhouse of 
south africas economy the strongest in africa and the fuel is 
the ore dug from thousands of feet below the surface by blacks 
supervised by whites and barred by apartheid from advancing in 
their jobs or even living where they want an associated press 
correspondent descended into a south african gold mine with a black 
work team recently and this is what she saw 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thousands of feet 
below the cornfields of orange free state men are at work 20 hours 
a day in heat dust and danger digging out the ore that feeds 
south africas 15billionayear gold industry 
ninety percent of them are blacks barred by apartheid from 
advancing any farther in an industry that drives south africas 
economy 
in this mine 3600 feet below the corn there was no breeze to 
cool the sweaty brow this day the only sound as the day shift 
started its work was that of the men carrying drills picks and 
shovels as they trudged in heavy boots through the mud toward a 
band of dark quartzite that signifies a goldbearing reef 
the men had stripped down to short pants to work in the 
90degree heat of the mine hanging their outer pants jackets and 
shirts on pegs or beams along the walls of the tunnel 
the danger was there as it always is when their drills started 
screaming into the rock and the men hacked with picks and shoveled 
the rubble aside preparing holes for the explosives that would 
blow the ore loose 
about 800 miners a year die on the job in south africa from 
rockbursts caused by underground pressure tunnel collapses 
poisonous fumes fire and other accidents 
this part of the work digging out the ore is for the 
unskilled and semiskilled for the blacks who put in the the 
longest hours for the lowest pay 
they operate the drills the ore carriers the air hoses and 
pulleys but the highest position they can hold is that of team 
leader which pays up to 1200 rand 600 a month for directing 
operations at the rock face thats still 200 rand 100 less than 
the lowestpaid whites in the mines 
the blacks are prevented by law from handling explosives a job 
that would qualify them for the supervisory positions leading to 
management 
western holdings mine owned by the anglo american corp has 
about 18000 employees with 285 percent from nearby lesotho the 
enclave kingdom within south africa 256 percent from transkei a 
south african black homeland and 29 percent including 9 percent 
whites from south africas four provinces 
as the men worked this day sweat streamed down their faces from 
under the plastic safety helmets worn by the 13 black team members 
and their white supervisor the screaming water drill sprayed tiny 
granules of rock back into their faces and bare chests the 
drilling bore the holes for the placement of explosives to blast 
the ore loose then came the shrill whistle of the air hose used to 
clear the holes 
the noise was deafening 
anglo american company is negotiating with the national union of 
mineworkers which represents 60 percent of black employees in its 
mines to require miners to wear ear muffs because the noise of the 
drills and blasting eventually affects hearing 
there is a tradition of deafness being something to be proud 
of indicating long service but we just cant accept that said 
andrew robb section manager of no 5 shaft 
this shaft one of six on western holdings mine produces 70000 
tons of ore a month from which about 17600 ounces of gold is 
extracted it is one of seven adjacent mines that together produced 
about 4 million ounces of gold in 1987 for anglo american the 
countrys largest mining company 
the average black miner prohibited by law from advancing up the 
ranks to supervisory work earns 650 rand 325 in cash a month 
five times less than the average white mineworker plus room and 
board at anglo american mines 
the company has threatened to take south africas apartheid 
government to court over the law which is being rewritten anglo 
is also quietly defying government restrictions on where its 
employees can live allowing some single black men such as 
engineers to live in housing designated for whites 
according to 1950s projections western holdings mine should 
have been abandoned by now but the current price of gold hovering 
around 450 an ounce makes mining lowgrade sections feasible 
after the men at the rock face finish their day shift a new 
crew takes over to collect the gold ore and the day shift rides the 
elevators back to the surface 
the whites go home the blacks go to hostels where they are 
required by law to live 
anglo american is trying to combat the law which requires black 
miners to live in segregated singlesex hostels on mine property 
while their families must remain in faroff rural tribal homelands 
or even in other countries 
the law does not apply to the foreign whites many of them from 
scotland and wales 
in addition to lesotho black miners at western holdings come 
from nearby mozambique botswana swaziland and malawi 
anglo american is subsidizing apartments and houses in the black 
township of thabong for many of its black employees who want to 
live with their families and can afford it many are single and 
many others do not want to give up their rural homes or are 
foreigners whose families cannot come to south africa 
a few thousand probably will get to move into the homes in 
thabong when they are completed the rest will remain in the 
hostels sending money to their families and visiting them once or 
twice a year 
at the hostel for the no 5 shaft 5146 black men live in a 
setting with the combined atmosphere of a prison a college 
dormitory and an english boarding school 
eight to 16 men sleep on bunk beds in each room 
the men take their meals in a central kitchen for each of the 10 
dormitory blocks which are mixed tribally the complex includes a 
sports field a technical training center and a bar

from the crumbling manor he shares with 
his sheep adolphe bonnevie frowns into his field glasses at a 
france caught between star wars and louis xiv he is not cheered by 
the presidential campaign around him 
what will change whoever wins he asked expressing a 
common view of the likely reelection of francois mitterrand 
what changed in the last seven years more unemployment the same 
problems 
in paris lawyer alain spilliaert made a similar point 
people believed in ideologies in 1981 they elected mitterrand 
as a socialist to bring about change now they see their problems 
are beyond ideology theyll vote for a person not a party 
across france people echo bonnevies concerns over jobs 
technological competition agriculture education and urban 
problems few are willing to express more than guarded optimism 
unemployment is 105 percent last years trade deficit of 55 
billion was 60 times higher than in 1986 economic growth of 2 
percent lags far behind britains 
but more frenchmen see an erosion of culture and a breaking 
down of the fabled art of living that once set france apart old 
roots are dying and new growth is too sparse 
around villages like le fornet tucked away in a back corner of 
the french alps the crisis takes tangible shape 
bonnevie an aging farmer owns most of the village old stone 
buildings cobblestones and a patchwork of fields he sits in the 
sun and trains his binoculars on passersby most are in ski clothes 
le fornet is three miles from val disere which in preparing 
for the 1992 winter olympics has hurtled itself into the space age 
a sleek train rockets skiers straight through the mountain to 
the top of la daille val diseres relaxed little main plaza has 
vanished below a gigantic hotelmall 
the last remnants of the past a stone home built in 1642 a 
generation before louis xiv the sun king are hardly visible amid 
a forest of garish signs 
this is a ski factory grumbles jeanfrancois lamy who sold 
his squaw valley hotel and is moving to geneva they have lost 
all the flavor the old way of life and theyll never get it 
back 
in albertville headquarters of 1992 winter olympics old 
regulars still shuffle into the cafe des 4 vallees and wait 
without a word for marcel to bring their petit blanc their 
glass of wine 
but the cafe redone in plastic and formica no longer serves 
frances hallowed melted ham and cheese sandwich the croque 
monsieur now there is a goopy microwaved substitute called 
lovecroquy sold along with les love double cheeseburger 
on easter sunday the baker lady was selling brioches at au 
peche mignon 
mitterrand someone else whats the difference she said 
with a merry laugh im still working every weekend 
down the mountain in lyon the heart of oldstyle france a 
conflict of ages is evident in the modern new neighborhood called 
part dieu which translates roughly to gods little acre 
futuristic trains cut the old time in half to two hours from 
paris to lyons hightech part dieu station but the hertz 
carrental office closes four hours for sunday lunch 
the huge mr chef cafeteria advertises open 11 am to 9 
pm even sundays but it closes for lunch at 230 pm 
campaign posters cover every flat surface of part dieu but few 
people questioned in the street say they think any of the 
candidates can make headway against underlying problems 
most pictures show the jovial face of raymond barre lyons 
favorite son who warns that any serious economic recovery will 
take at least two years of job retraining 
his rival conservative for the chance to run against mitterrand 
in the may 8 runoff is premier jacques chirac who argues roughly 
the same thing with a flashier style 
posters also tout archconservative jeanmarie le pen who 
argues foreign cultural pollution is taking france from the french 
as a dark horse his ads call him loutsider 
it makes no difference said andre duranson a lyon driver 
who prefers sports to politics all of them want the same 
thing he patted his wallet pocket they clean up and then 
they go

a malaise was reflected in lexpress magazine a poll indicated 
54 percent of a sample of the nations elite thought france was in 
decline 
the country is finding it costly to retain the grandeur of 
charles de gaulles defiant defense and foreign policies 
france is quietly moving closer to the north atlantic treaty 
organization recently 1000 us marines from the 6th fleet came 
ashore for a twoweek exercise the first on french soil since 1966 
economically france is to blend into a unified european system 
by 1992 
our motherland is france but our future is europe 
mitterrand put it 
less easily defined signs indicate a concern that traditional 
french values and tastes are at risk 
le pens main plank is to send home immigrants fueling racism 
among those who worry that 2 million people of north african 
extraction will curdle the melting pot 
ironically le pens farright national front has taken votes 
from the communist party replacing the old left as the place for 
disgruntled workers to register their protest 
even dyedinthewool communist supporters expect their 
candidate to poll less than 7 percent half of their 1981 showing 
and less than a third of their highwater mark after world war ii 
more generally middle class french parents worry that youths 
are growing up selfish without depth or respect for traditions 
few see campaign programs that might counter the trend 
for a large number it is a cultural vacuum especially on 
television 
the two private channels licensed last year amid great hoopla 
show only 245 percent original french programing one offering is 
sexy clips in which nude couples stress togetherness in ways 
outlawed in some american states 
on la roue de la fortune a perky frenchwoman turns letters 
for contestants who spin a giant wheel to decipher a blanked out 
message in french the shows name means the wheel of fortune 
there is also le juste prix the price is right both 
french productions are licensed by the shows they copy 
at 8 am viewers choose among daffy duck andy panda and dan 
rather the pay channel canal plus retransmits the cbs evening 
news in english at that time and it is fast gaining popularity 
some frenchmen worry that much of france is falling into foreign 
hands 
foreigners bought up 1 billion worth of french real estate last 
year a fifth of the market 
japanese investors built an office complex at montparnasse where 
once ernest hemingway could barely afford a cup of coffee 
most important people are caught in the middle as the country 
meshes with the modern world but old ways foul the gears 
mitterrand has made it clear that in a second term he would set 
aside socialist dogma in favor of letting france find its own pace 
he told an interviewer the country is headed toward a 
freemarket economy and so lets play it to the hilt let us have 
no half measures 
but now there is opa an acronym meaning corporate 
takeover that is a new french fad word 
when schneider sa a diversified holding company tried to 
take over the industrial automation group telemecanique electrique 
however workers blocked it by marching in the streets the way 
frenchmen have done since the revolution that broke the sun kings

beetlejuice 
 
sometimes a devilishly dynamic performance lifts a movie out of 
the ordinary that happened last year with jack nicholsons satanic 
furioso in the witches of eastwick now comes michael keaton in 
the title role of beetlejuice 
keaton outroars a banshee his head rotates with a velocity of 
which linda blair never dreamed he is so unspeakably devotedly 
evil that he becomes almost lovable its a great comic performance 
that redeems the obvious crowdgrabbing strategy behind 
beetlejuice 
curiously the movie begins much the same as the witches of 
eastwick the camera hovers over a picturepostcard new england 
village and travels through the immaculate streets and freshly 
painted buildings to focus on a hilltop house that looks a bit huge 
for its surroundings 
the occupants are a pair of cheerful yuppies alec baldwin and 
geena davis whose main occupation appears to be puttering around 
the mammoth house their work is interrupted when they drive into 
town for supplies on the return they swerve on a covered bridge 
land in the river and drown 
rather confusedly they return to the house as ghosts slightly 
less sophisticated than cary grant and constance bennett in 
topper their lives continue much the the same though 
invisibly until the house is sold to a new york developer jeffrey 
jones he moves in with his deathobsessed daughter winona ryder 
and his second wife catherine ohara who is hellbent to transform 
the house into a chic monstrosity 
alarmed by what is happening to their house the yuppies seek 
help from the afterlife bureaucracy a useless exercise finally 
they enlist the infamous keaton who rises from his grave to 
perpetrate his monstrous deeds 
director tim burton peewees big adventure is a former 
disney animator and his film has the kinetic energy of a cartoon 
there is also a synthetic plot credited to michael mcdowell and 
warren skaaren which affords little of the logic needed for a 
convincing fantasy 
unrecognizable in his weirdo makeup keaton behaves 
outrageously its a marvelous characterization also helpful are 
jeffrey jones ferris beullers day off catherine ohara 
sctv and winona ryder as the invaders 
beetlejuice was produced by michael bender larry wilson and 
richard hashimoto the warner bros release is rated pg mostly for 
its scare quotient running time 92 minutes

the seventh sign 
 
an intense man walks purposely through the sands of a beach in 
haiti he stares ponderously at the sea breaks a small round 
token and tosses it and a piece of parchment into the water almost 
immediately sea life washes up dead 
this purportedly foretells the coming of the apocalypse the 
ultimate destruction of evil and triumph of good it is the first 
of seven signs and in the carl schultz movie the seventh 
sign only one woman can stop it 
the woman is demi moore 
demi moore demi moore of the brat pack demi moore who is also 
mrs bruce moonlighting willis demi moore who is about as 
compelling on screen as gumby what in the name of boris karloff is 
she doing in a serious occult thriller 
however moores tepid performance in the tristar pictures 
release is only one problem with this meandering and misguided 
movie 
one by one the signs happen a village is frozen in the middle 
of the negev desert a river runs with blood hail the size of a 
baseball falls in southern california theres an unexpected 
eclipse in which the moon becomes red interestingly enough no one 
in the news media science or government takes any notice 
the stranger jurgen prochnow rents a room from russell and 
abby quinn who are played by michael biehn who limps through his 
role and moore 
abby who is seven months pregnant discovers more tokens and 
parchments in his room and takes one of the pages to a rabbi for 
translation but she offends him and instead gets assistance from 
the scholars brash young neighbor avi manny jacobs who not 
only tells her that shes up to her agnostic chin in the apocalypse 
but also becomes her sidekick 
meanwhile hot on the heels of the quinns boarder is a priest 
named lucci peter friedman who is investigating the strange signs 
for the vatican is he good or evil if you can sit through another 
20 minutes of the movie youll find out 
while abby tries to figure out how to stop the apocalypse her 
lawyer husband tries to save his client jimmy from the gas 
chamber 
john taylor a 20yearold who has downs syndrome gives an 
excellent and sensitive performance as the tormented jimmy who 
killed his mother and father in gods name because they were 
brother and sister incest was against the way of god 
abby has constant flashbacks to another time in history little 
flickers of a centurion a tortured man of goodness a woman 
holding a water vessel its easy to figure out who is who and what 
is what especially since the movie was released during the 
easterpassover season 
whats not easy to figure out is why the filmmakers didnt pay 
more attention to organization and sense in their production and 
plug in the many holes that make the seventh sign the eighth 
wonder of muddled movies 
the interscope communications production with a script by ww 
wicket and george kaplan is saved only by the lovely and dramatic 
photography of juan ruiz anchia and stephen marshs sets the movie 
is rated r for strong adult themes and some nudity

dancers 
 
when this herbert ross movie starring mikhail baryshnikov first 
came out in october 1987 it pirouetted right off the screen after 
a thrashing by critics 
dancers is not the greatest ballet movie ever made it will 
never fill those red shoes it was directed by herbert ross who 
also did the turning point but falls short of his earlier 
effort 
still the movie seems to find a comfortable niche on the home 
screen somehow its more believable and engaging 
the plot revolves around anton sergeyev baryshnikov the 
worlds star male dancer hes also a ladykiller whos in italy to 
film a production of giselle there are sexual innuendoes and 
flirtations and some excellent performances by the american ballet

deadly illusion 
 
get a giant cauldron drop in billy dee williams vanity and 
morgan fairchild and what do you get a soupy unappetizing mess 
called deadly illusion 
williams plays a private detective with the improbable name of 
hamberger his repeating line throughout the movie is please no 
jokes about the name vanity whose leather and lingerie cover 
her lousy acting plays his girlfriend and assistant fairchild 
who has a brief lusty romp with williams is the villain who sets 
up hamberger for murder 
hamberger ever so friendly with the local police is given 48 
hours to prove his innocence sound familiar and find the real 
killer 
forget the action forget the thrills there arent any nor is 
there any slick dialogue in this movie written by larry cohen who 
codirected with william tannen 
with two directors youd think theyd be able to keep their 
geography straight not these guys they have williams racing 
through rockefeller center in midtown manhattan he looks over his 
shoulder turns a corner and in a blink is downtown in the wall 
street area in the same chase scene not even the best marathon 
runner could accomplish that

birth school work death epic the godfathers 
 
for a while there it seemed like bands from england had 
forgotten how to rock and roll 
thatchers island lately has produced an overabundance of 
frothing pop and synthesizerdrenched angst now along come the 
godfathers with a sound as vaguely sinister as their name 
the godfathers combine classic 1960s rock song structures with 
the aggressive cynicism of punk frankly theyd be lost in the 
crowd if placed in either of those two eras but the current lack 
of energy makes the godfathers stand out 
the title track of birth school work death performed 
with a sneer by peter coyne puts the life stinks then you die 
bumpersticker philosophy to music in the process it sums up the 
workingclass frustrations that course through the godfathers 
music 
unfortunately cliches litter their writing and nowhere is it 
more evident than here far better is if i only had time with 
a melody that leaves a more lasting impression than the chanted 
chorus of the title cut if i only had time coyne sings id 
think of the perfect crime 
guitarists mike gibson and kris dollimore shine with a sloppy 
exuberance leading one to believe their own personal godfather is 
keith richards theyre at their best in the rockabilly stb 
and the droning lead guitar salvages the silly psychedelia of 
when am i coming down 
in sound and stance the godfathers could be british cousins to 
the georgia satellites minus the sense of humor their youthful 
energy wins them more respect than their songs at this point but 
the godfathers are worth keeping an eye on

judge reinhold has his own gauge on how fast 
celebrity can overtake an actor in todays hollywood 
the week before beverly hills cop opened i was asked to 
show two pieces of id to cash a check at my bank where i had an 
account for two years he related the week after the film 
opened i had a family in a station wagon scream at me on the 
freeway to pull over for an autograph 
reinhold has been on a roll ever since adding to his credits 
off beat ruthless people beverly hills cop ii his 
current release is vice versa in which he changes identities 
with his 11yearold son played by fred savage 
yes he realizes that the plot parallels those of like father 
like son but he claims priority 
our story was taken from a childrens book written in england 
in 1880 a very popular enduring book thats still popular it 
concerned a duke who switched consciousness with his son there was 
a movie vice versa made with peter ustinov in the early 1950s 
reinhold admitted he was at first reluctant to undertake vice 
versa because of the similarity to like father like son but 
as soon as he was committed he jumped into his research 
i hung out in video arcades and gymnasiums he recalled i 
was once asked to leave a playground by the police because i was 
just standing around watching the kids i didnt have the nerve to 
say do you know who i am so i just left quietly 
in the early stages of vice versa the actor was concerned 
about the casting of his son i knew the kid would make or break 
the film we saw a lot of kid actors who had a lot of kidactor 
tricks they knew adults would respond to fred had none of that he 
came in like a little jimmy cagney and just took the part 
as soon as fred was cast i knew we had something special 
he said hes got this comedy timing that must be godgiven i 
dont know where else he could get it we became real pals i had 
him record all my lines and i recorded all his lines so wed go 
home and study each others inflections and nuances 
reinhold showed the completed film to his mother and asked if he 
had been anything like the kid in the movie her reply oh no 
you were much more obnoxious 
he was born edward ernest reinhold jr in wilmington del but 
at the age of 2 he looked so much like a judge that the name stuck 
he grew up in comfortable surroundings his father was a trial 
lawyer and the actor remembers him as an aloof man whose command of 
a courtroom probably fostered his sons acting ambitions 
i was pretty comically oriented as a kid he said that 
was how i got attention 
after drama classes in four eastern universities reinhold spent 
a year playing a variety of roles in stock and dinner theaters 
when his father died in 1977 he moved to california he worked in a 
frozen yogurt store by day to finance his night acting classes at 
the james best workshop his arrival in hollywood was perfectly 
timed 
i hit town in 1977 and in 1978 animal house came out and 
opened up a whole new genre of youthoriented films he recalled 
i was plucked up pretty fast 
reinhold appeared in such films as stripes fast times at 
ridgemont high the lords of discipline and gremlins 
as the rookie detective in the megahit beverly hills cop 
reinhold hit the big time he followed with head office 
ruthless people and beverly hills cop ii but reinhold now 
figures playing the goofy guy can be too much of a good thing 
im at an important point where if i continue along these 
lines people arent going to accept me any other way he said 
i really do want to have a wellrounded and enduring career do 
all kinds of different things much as i love comedy i will have 
to hold back right now 
i did my first dramatic tv movie with rosanna arquette 
promised a miracle its about two fundamentalist christians who 
take their diabetic son off insulin and he dies three days later of 
insulin shock its a true story very powerful stuff i want to do 
more dramatic work 
despite his newfound fame reinhold feels a trifle uneasy 
sometimes i feel im pushed into a place where im supposed to be 
more special than somebody else i dont feel real comfortable with 
the idea that because im somewhat famous im more special that 
means im working

jackson pollock was the american artist who 
abandoned brushes and dripped and splashed paint straight from the 
can onto canvases laid out on the floor and walls 
his work was controversial in his lifetime and it has been 
argued about ever since he died in a car crash in 1956 
londons tate gallery has no doubt of his importance and the 
state museum of british and 20thcentury art has just doubled its 
holdings of pollock works to six from three it says thats more 
than any other museum outside new york 
jeremy lewison the tate curator responsible for american art 
said no other state museum in britain has even one pollock 
the tate now has europes finest collection of american 
abstract expressionism he said 
that is the term for the painting style of pollock and his 
fellow artists mark rothko barnett newman franz kline and 
pollocks wife lee krasner an alternative term was action 
painting the invention of critic harold rosenberg 
pollock liberated the application of paint lewison said 
sir alan bowness the tates director is a pollock enthusiast 
and dismisses with a smile claims that pollock and the other 
members of the new york school of the 1940s and 50s were not true 
artists 
i am quite sure that pollocks place in the history of art is 
secure he said in an interview the three paintings we have 
acquired are classic masterpieces and not simply innovative new art 
pollock was the first great american painter and one of the 
major artists if not the major one of the mid20th century he 
had a sense of his importance because he was the first to make 
paintings like that his work has elements of the work of picasso 
and miro but he did something completely new 
the three pollocks birth summertime and number 14 
were painted between 194151 they had been on loan to the museum 
since 1982 
the director wouldnt say how much they cost but said it was 
rather more than we would receive from the government in any one 
year the tates 1988 grant from the government for the purchase 
of pictures is 3375 million 
the record price for a pollock painting was the 25 million 
paid at sothebys in new york last may for number 26 painted 
in 1950 
bowness recalled that when he was appointed director in 1980 
the tate had three pollocks and one of his priorities was to obtain 
more 
i went to new york at the end of 1980 to talk to lee krasner 
a very remarkable lady and an undervalued artist in her own 
right he said 
she wanted to see her husbands work properly shown 
internationally and loaned us these three works which her husband 
had retained during his lifetime 
shortly before she died in 1984 krasner agreed to sell them to 
the tate over a fouryear period because the museum couldnt afford 
them all at once 
the purchase has been made from the pollockkrasner foundation 
inc which is funded with the bulk of krasners estate and has 
granted more than 15 million to some 300 worthy artists who are 
in need 
bowness praised the foundation saying he thought it a fine 
thing that money from the sale of art should be recycled to 
help artists 
the most striking of the three works is summertime just 
under 3 feet high and nearly 18 feet long like a frieze pollock 
laid out the canvas on the floor in 1948 and poured and dripped 
paint and enamel over it in swirls and patches 
the painting first seen at the betty parsons gallery in new 
york in 1949 expresses a sense of exhilaration and joy 
pollock wrote at the time when he was living near the atlantic 
ocean my concern is with the rhythms of nature the way the 
ocean moves i work from the inside out like nature 
pollock liked to paint on a big scale born in 1912 in cody 
wyo his canvases took on the characteristic of what he called the 
vast horizontality of the land in the american west 
his nephew jason mccoy is a new york art dealer whose father 
sanford was an artist another uncle charles was also a painter 
mccoy attended a recent reception at the tate to announce the 
pollock purchases 
painting was always treated seriously in my family recalled 
mccoy who grew up in deep river conn 
it had true meaning then something i think impossible to 
conceive of now in the late 1980s it wasnt about the monetary end 
of it but the genuine concern with the action of painting 
mccoy was 8 years old when his uncle died so he doesnt remember 
too much about pollock as an artist although he does recall his 
uncle giving him his first bicycle 
pollock lived on long island at that time and while the boy 
visited his house his studio was not a place one toured 
lightly mccoy said 
but young as i was my childhood was infused with the belief 
that jackson pollock was an important painter 
he said with a rueful grin my father eventually stopped 
painting to make a living he went into printed circuits for 
rockets

since releasing its first album in 1978 the 
australian rock group midnight oil has taken on a wide range of 
issues the environment human rights the arms race unemployment 
diesel and dust their latest lp is no exception songs 
such as beds are burning and dreamworld warn about coming 
to terms with a changing world the dead heart attacks 
exploitation of aborigines in australia warakurna is a demand 
for a better life 
the groups lead singer peter garrett is not the type of 
person who keeps his opinions to himself 
i am prepared to debate anybody said garrett who is 
recuperating from a leg injury suffered during a recent show i 
grew up in a household where politics was not a dirty word 
i have a great interest in whats going on i have opinions 
but i also want to be able to back it up 
garretts interest in the affairs of his country go beyond 
making records he has written newspaper columns on current issues 
taken an active role in trying to rewrite the australian 
constitution and most prominently ran for the senate in 1984 as a 
candidate for the nuclear disarmament party 
the major politicians tried to make fun of the issue they 
said it was simplistic emotional singleissue naive politics 
said garrett who was narrowly defeated they alienated everybody 
who liked rock music it changed peoples attitudes 
i was surprised that the leading politicians were lying we 
were trying to tell the truth 
midnight oil was formed in the 1970s and released its first 
album midnight oil in 1978 while they have yet to achieve 
major popularity in the united states their records have 
consistently sold well in australia in 1982 the lp 
10987654321 reached no 1 and went triple platinum 
red sails in the sunset released in 1984 also topped the 
australian charts 
midnight oil contributed royalties from 1985s species 
diseases to a trust fund for peace and disarmament they have 
performed at countless benefit concerts 
were making our people understand weve got a part in their 
lives garrett said we care about the price of the tshirts 
were not pop stars on a guided tour the bands not that kind of 
band 
besides garrett the band features drummer rob hirdt guitarist 
martin rotsey guitarist and keyboardist jim moginie and bassist 
peter gifford all the songs on diesel and dust are credited to 
midnight oil and all the songs are about australia 
we find so much going on in australia garrett said were 
never without something to write about 
midnight oil has spent considerable time helping aborigines an 
ancient tribe whose plight has been similar to american indians 
they have toured aboriginal communities and on diesel and dust 
included the song bullroarer which refers to an aboriginal 
musical instrument 
the bullroarer is used to provide warnings when sacred 
ceremonies are being undertaken by aboriginal people garrett 
said having gone into the desert and spent time with them has 
given us a shot in the arm about trying to write about these 
things 
because australia is still a member of the united kingdom and 
has extensive relations with the united states garrett is 
especially conscious of the impact those countries have on his 
native land 
on the dead heart garrett sings of britain we dont 
serve your country dont serve your king 
the queen is still head of australia said garrett our 
constitution is in england 
garrett also has been critical of the united states especially 
of its policy of bringing nuclear armed warships to australia he 
acknowledges however the enormous influence the united states has 
had on his country 
youre very conscious of the headmaster the bully that whole 
thing of size and power and strength and vitality awesomeness that 
cant be escaped garrett said youre eating it youre 
consuming it as entertainment it affects your standard of living 
its always there its like the sun 
garrett also believes that being an australian as opposed to an 
american band has helped midnight oil stay in touch with its fans 
in america its quite natural to have stars he said in 
australia we tend to view each other as just people 
garrett insists however that he is not antiamerican ive 
said some terrible things about america but there are parts of it 
which i think are terrific 
although garrett spends a great deal of time focusing on the 
problems of his country and the world he is far from pessimistic 
about the future 
the last song on diesel and dust is called sometimes 
the last words of sometimes are you dont give in 
this is not end of the world music garrett said theres 
always hope thats what its all about

early in 1937 a brash dashing actor named 
douglas fairbanks jr had a call from one of hollywoods biggest 
and most important filmmakers david o selznick he wanted 
fairbanks to play the bad guy in a remake of the prisoner of 
zenda 
fairbanks although happy to have an offer was upset i was 
set back on my heels at being asked to be a supporting or featured 
player to anyone even so fine an actor as ronald coleman he 
recalls in volume one of his new autobiography the salad days 
doubleday 1995 
what to do only one person to turn to the one person he never 
wanted to use to further his career his father the great silent 
film star whose romance with mary pickford made them a celebration 
of the movie world 
so fierce was young fairbanks in wanting to make it on his own 
he even considered changing his name but the minute word got 
out i knew there would be too much publicity so i didnt he 
said in an interview 
those feelings toward my father are hard to recapture i 
suppose partly i didnt want to emulate him the theatrical hero of 
my youth was john barrymore 
he had long sought his fathers approval he said and finally 
got it with zenda 
fairbanks sr told his son to take the part because not only 
is the prisoner of zenda one of the best romances written in a 
hundred years but rupert of hentzau the role fairbanks would 
play is probably one of the best villains ever written he is 
witty irresistible and sly as iago 
young fairbanks of course went on to star in the movie 
creating one of the most sophisticated villains the screen world 
has ever seen it remains his favorite role 
the zenda tale is but one tasty morsel in the autobiography 
a veritable salad bar of celebrity browsing he was married at the 
age of 19 to joan crawford the marriage lasted a blink he had an 
affair with marlene dietrich and was once greeted by a bobby as he 
left her hotel room by a fire escape early one morning 
the book is punctuated with the famous of the day noel coward 
david niven irene dunne laurence olivier 
however fairbanks is too much the gentleman and bon vivant to 
assault his readers with a lusty kissandtell book 
i tried not to be sensational i just tried to tell it 
straight he saidkissandtell books are the easiest things to 
do 
instead fairbanks leads a friendly tour of his family his 
youth his movies and finally his diplomatic work for president 
roosevelt during world war ii volume one ends in 1941 and hes 
already started the concluding volume it was doubledays idea to 
do two books 
noel coward took three volumes to tell his story fairbanks 
said with a wink 
fairbanks started writing the book three years ago in longhand 
but his experience dates back to his teen years when he started 
writing for vanity fair why did he begin an autobiography at this 
time in his life 
a publisher came along with a good offer its as vulgar as 
that he said with that stringofpearls smile that once caused 
grown women to blush 
i think if i had my druthers id prefer to be a writer more 
than anything else he said i think id like to be a painter 
next and an actor last but i would rather write about something 
else than about myself 
the hardest problem in writing the autobiography he said was 
trying not to sound pompous or sounding like gary cooper you 
know digging my heels in the ground and saying ah shucks and 
being overly modest 
fairbanks has appeared in 75 films and has produced others 
including the exile in 1948 he also collaborated on the 
writing for the movie a talky swashbuckling period piece set in 
the days of charles ii 
his last movie was john irvins ghost story in 1981 
costarring with fred astaire melvyn douglas and john houseman 
ah yes ghost story he said quietly with a reflective 
smile it was very sad melvyn douglas character dies in the 
movie and during shooting he quipped im learning how to do it 
he died a few months later 
if fairbanks could turn back the clock and do it all over again 
he said hed like to have performed more classics 
everyones done hamlet or they think they want to he 
laughed i would like to do faust by goethe but id rather 
have written faust 
i like production its part of creating but to interpret 
ones own creation must be fun 
however his regrets in life are not profound ones he said 
my biggest regret is not having writtten a play 
i believe very strongly that you should follow your star it 
doesnt matter if you succeed as long as you make the effort 
fairbanks who lives in new york still cuts a fine figure of 
elegance with his silvery hair and classic features but the 
pencilline mustache is gone 
dont worry ill grow it back he laughed i just took it 
off to do something different and to see if anyone would notice no 
one did

with a gold t in the center

tiptoe through the tulips is trying for a comeback as a 
country music singer 
hes released a country record titled leave me satisfied for 
the small nlt records label of nearby burns tenn the song is 
about a plea from one lover to another as a breakup unfolds 
despite his turn to country music the 55yearold performer 
says i havent forgotten my high falsetto 
its his second foray into country music since his heyday when 
he married miss vicki victoria budinger of haddonfield nj 
in 1969 on the tonight show starring johnny carson 
ten years ago he recorded a sinceforgotten song called 
country queen about a cowboy who didnt get noticed as a singer 
so he decided to dress like dolly parton by donning a huge wig 
more recently tiny tim has been the headliner for two years 
with allan c hills great american circus which played 
onenighters in dozens of dusty small towns from march to november 
he was billed as americas very own eternal troubadour 
he says about his legacy im the first longhaired 
whitefaced singer before kiss before the beatles and im the 
first hasbeen star to sing with the great american circus 
tiny tim whose real name is herbert khaury was wearing white 
pancake makeup and sporting long locks 30 years ago and he remains 
the focus of attention wherever he is 
he said his unusual appearance and mannerisms during his tv 
performances years ago set him apart from other entertainers the 
mail came in like mad people were asking whered you get him 
what a shock ma you gotta see this creep 
the people want something new all the time boynextdoor 
pat boone couldnt even get arrested and i came along 
in addition to his current country music career tiny tim stars 
in a dcumentary movie street of dreams which is to premiere 
in brighton england in late may in it he sings 139 songs for 
more than two hours 
a few years ago he acted in the movie blood harvest

this country but should be released soon in japan he said 
he and miss vicki were divorced in 1977 she has remarried twice 
since then he married jan alweiss a new york city graphics 
artist in 1984 
millions of tv viewers watched tiny tim and miss vicki get 
married on carsons show where their vows included a pledge never 
to get puffed up 
in an interview he said he believes carson suggested the 
wedding take place on the show in order to raise ratings in the 
face of a challenge by another late night show hosted by merv 
griffin 
hes a competitor tiny tim said he saw this as a shot in 
the arm he succeeded 
nbctv he said bought 10000 worth of tulips and paid for 
miss vickis gown 
id have never married her but i didnt want to break her 
heart he said i really did love her but i could see some 
problems 
they had a daughter tulip who will turn 17 in may she lives 
in new jersey and is studying computer science he said miss 
vicki he said is living near cherry hill nj 
im not in touch with her 
he estimated that he was a guest on carsons show 10 to 12 
times the last one in 1979 that time he sang a song about the 
gas crisis tiptoe to the gas pumps and did his version of rod 
stewarts do ya think im sexy in which he rolled on the floor 
in a burst of showmanship 
but the song hes most associated with is his 1968 recording of 
tiptoe through the tulips 
it flowed well with the high voice he said it was sung 
in a different sound people said hey whats that it had a 
great melodic theme melody is 99 percent of every song 
but no radio station wanted to play it at first he 
recalled a dj in birmingham ala went on strike over the song 
it was going against the odds but good ol new york city didnt 
let me down they began playing it there and then it hit in 
california by june 1968 it was the big hit of the year 
how does he want to be remembered 
he played his part well he said

a national antismoking group says it plans 
to ask shareholders of major airlines to do what it says the 
federal government has not done enact a total ban on smoking 
during all domestic flights 
ahron leichtman president of citizens against tobacco smoke 
said in a weekend interview the group will attempt to arrange 
shareholder votes at major us airlines over the issue 
leichtman said the new federal law that will ban smoking on 
domestic airline flights of two hours or less beginning april 23 is 
a good first step but contains loopholes 
because congress used a time limit rather than mileage airline 
flights scheduled for just under two hours could escape compliance 
he said flight time can be altered by the rate of climb flight 
altitude the type of aircraft being used headwinds and the 
schedule of the airports involved leichtman said 
the federal ban on smoking during shortterm flights will expire 
in two years if congress takes no further action but leichtman 
doesnt expect that to happen nevertheless his cincinnatibased 
group does not want to wait for two years to get further action 
leichmtan said the group planned to take the issue to the annual 
stockholders meetings of every major airline in addition to 
seeking a total smoking ban the group wants airline executives to 
designate 50 percent of all flights over two hours as smoke free 
the group chose minneapolis to announce its new strategy because 
northwest airlines based in the suburb of eden prairie already 
has banned smoking on nearly all of its domestic flights leichtman 
said 
he said the group planned to go to miami dallas chicago 
atlanta and tentatively kansas city where other major carriers are 
based to raise questions about the health safety economic and 
legal issues raised by passenger smoking on aircraft he said 
we are going to attempt to prove to the national 
transportation safety board that increased carbon monoxide levels 
caused by smoking in airplanes puts a flight attendant at risk by 
reducing the ability to think clearly leichtman said 
he suggested that smokers be provided with nicotine gum or 
nicotine pills if they could not otherwise physically handle 
smokefree flights

the senate this week takes up a 11 trillion 
budget plan accompanied by far less acrimony than usual because it 
complies with last falls deficitreduction agreement with 
president reagan 
the fiscal 1989 budget proposal drafted by senate budget 
committee chairman lawton chiles dfla and sen pete domenici of 
new mexico the senior republican on the committee has received 
bipartisan support in committee 
the electionyear budget doesnt propose new tax increases 
beyond the 14 billion already enacted for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 it also avoids eliminating any spending 
the plan was crafted to stay within the overall spending limits 
of the deficit agreement which preset totals for military 
foreign aid and domestic agency spending 
within those guidelines the senate proposal is closer to 
reagans priorities than the house plan approved last month it 
includes a 27 percent increase in spending on the space program and 
trims back development programs that reagan proposed to kill 
the chilesdomenici plan also endorses reagans plan to give a 
43 percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for 
civilian federal workers the house voted a 3 percent 
acrosstheboard raise 
both the house and senate plans envision big increases in 
spending on aids research and education grants 
like the house the senate decided to adopt the administrations 
optimistic view of the nations economy by doing so the plan 
claims that the deficit will be just 136 billion in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 in compliance with the grammrudman budget 
balancing law 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office forecasts that the 
deficit will be about 35 billion higher 
the budget resolution is a guideline for congress fiscal 
legislation and it does not require the presidents signature 
however it has often passed weeks or even months past the april 15 
deadline as congress and the administration battle over spending 
priorities 
senate action this week and a speedy housesenate agreement 
could make for the earliest budget approval in years 
the deficit agreement with the president settled for the year 
what normally is the biggest battle the balance between domestic 
and military spending 
under the agreement the budget includes 2995 billion in 
budget authority and 2940 billion in outlays for the military 
1481 billion in budget authority and 1692 billion in outlays 
for annually appropriated domestic programs and 181 billion in 
budget authority and 161 billion in outlays on foreign aid 
budget authority the legal authority for agencies to spend 
their allowances often differs from cash outlays because the 
government doesnt always spend whats authorized during a single 
fiscal year

wall street giant merrill lynch amp co said 
earnings tumbled 371 percent in the first quarter compared with a 
year earlier largely because of slumping business in the aftermath 
of the october stock market crash

months ended march 31 compared with 1086 million in the 1987 
first quarter pershare earnings fell to 62 cents a share from 1 
a share 
revenue fell 5 percent to 24 billion from 25 billion 
commission revenues a significant portion of merrill lynchs 
business fell 33 percent to 440 million from the yearearlier 
record quarterly total of 654 million which the company 
attributed to reduced stock market activity 
like other investment giants reacting to the october crash 
merrill lynch instituted or accelerated staffing and cost 
reductions anticipating leaner times in what historically has been 
a cyclical business 
given the relatively lower level of activity in the financial 
markets during the quarter these results demonstrate the 
broadbased strength and diversity of our core business 
operations william a schreyer chairman and chief executive 
officer said in a statement 
we are also beginning to realize the impact of the structural 
costreduction programs initiated during the previous quarter 
schreyer said 
daniel p tully president and chief operating officer said 
obviously 1988 will be a year of challenges and we are confident 
that merrill lynch is well positioned to meet them

kansas city southern industries inc 
says an antitrust judgment of at least 2442 million against the 
company conflicts with a supreme court decision and likely will be 
overturned 
landon h rowland president and chief executive officer of 
kansas city southern said saturday the jury award announced friday 
in south dakota was a distressing result which was not expected 
in a matter which has been in progress for years 
in the case in federal court in sioux falls sd a jury agreed 
with the state of south dakotas contention that the companys 
railroad subsidiary kansas city southern lines had conspired with 
other railroads to block a coal slurry pipeline proposed by energy 
transportation systems inc 
the jury awarded south dakota 200 million in antitrust damages 
which the company said would be tripled to 600 million under 
federal law but the jury also provided an alternative award of 
200 million for interference with contractual relations and 442 
million in punitive and other damages 
at the end of 1987 kansas city southern reported a net worth of 
361 million the company has a workforce of about 2500 in kansas 
city 
rowland cited a victory in a related case to bolster his 
contention that the south dakota judgment would be overturned on 
appeal 
kansas city southern successfully sued in 1982 to block the 
federal government from providing water to the slurry pipeline 
project energy transportation systems appealed but higher courts 
upheld the decision including the supreme court in february 
in view of the unanimous decision of the supreme court in the 
etsi case rowland said we expect our position to be 
vindicated 
the slurry pipeline was proposed to carry a mixture of 
pulverized coal and water between wyoming and several southern 
states 
south dakota had a contract to supply the pipeline with water 
from the missouri river for 50 years which would have brought 9 
million a year in revenue to the state 
the suit contended kansas city southern and others violated 
federal antitrust laws in delaying the 1400mile 38 billion 
pipeline which would have crossed railroad tracks attorneys for 
the state produced a document that said kansas city southern was 
designated to be the lead railroad to fight the project and the 
water sale 
kansas city southern argued that it opposed the pipeline but 
that there was no conspiracy the company also contended that the 
project was financially doomed regardless of south dakotas water 
contracts 
the jury verdict came amid kansas city southerns quest to 
acquire control of the southern pacific railroad kansas city 
southern has asked the interstate commerce commission to reject a 
competing offer from rio grande industries inc

oil prices jumped 77 cents a barrel early today 
to the highest level since early this year which traders 
attributed to speculation that opec would enlist outside producers 
to restrict world supplies 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for may delivery 
of west texas intermediate crude jumped from 1688 per 42gallon 
barrel friday to 1765 an unusually large move that put prices at 
the highest point since jan 5 
experts differed over whether the rise was a shortterm 
development or reflected a reversal in what has been a dismal oil 
market 
the opec thing is clearly the reason theres no question 
about it said john odea manager of international energy 
futures at dean witter reynolds inc in new york whether it 
should be that strong or not who knows my attitude has been talk 
is cheap with that crowd 
the market move followed disclosures that leaders of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries would invite 
government representatives from at least seven independent 
oilproducing nations to meet with five opec oil ministers on april 
23 all 13 opec members are to meet two days later 
the invitation announced by a committee of five opec oil 
ministers on saturday was seen as a clear acknowledgement by the 
cartel that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil 
supplies to support prices 
some analysts said the markets rise today reflected a more 
fundamental change in sentiment toward rising prices and the opec 
development was merely an excuse to buy 
this is not a flash in the pan this is the beginning of a 
bull move said peter beutel assistant director of elders 
futures inc in new york the real story is the oil market cycle 
has turned its ready to go higher

jim s gilmore jrs office looks more 
like the winners circle at the indianapolis 500 than corporate 
headquarters for his 200 millionayear business empire 
visitors have a hard time figuring out the color of the wall 
paint photographs and paintings of race cars and triumphant 
drivers accepting roses and trophies cover the office walls and 
line the corridors from floor to ceiling 
but gilmore isnt in the racing business at least not for a 
profit 
most of gilmores income is generated by his broadcasting 
corporation and automobile dealerships 
his success in those areas has allowed gilmore to pursue his 
lifelong passion for auto racing a preoccupation he adopted from 
his father in 1973 gilmore signed on friend and indy 500 champion 
aj foyt creating the gilmorefoyt racing team 
one of the greatest moments in my life was when aj won the 
indy 500 for the fourth time in 1977 said gilmore 61 a 
cheerful grayhaired man whose blue eyes ignite with excitement 
each time he mentions racing 
the feeling is obviously mutual with foyt 
i cant say enough about jim hes stuck by me through thick 
and thin said foyt who 15 years later continues to drive 
gilmorebacked cars 
though backing a winner in the indy 500 was a new experience 
gilmore was already well accustomed to corporate victory from his 
grandfathers profitable downtown kalamazoo department store 
gilmore brothers gilmore has created a diverse business empire 
with about 1000 employees 
of his three auto dealerships the one in miami fla is 
consistently among the top four chevrolet dealerships in the 
country selling as many as 21000 cars each year gilmore says 
gilmore also recently announced he would become a partner in foyts 
chevrolet dealership in houston 
gilmore owns two midwest television stations weht in 
evansville ind and kodetv in joplin mo and two florida radio 
stations wlve in miami and wivy in jacksonville 
then theres all that real estate in downtown kalamazoo 
including several office buildings and parking lots and the 
2700acre hog farm in northern kalamazoo county 
and more gilmore also owns an insurance company is director of 
a kalamazoo plastics manufacturer and sits on the boards of two 
banks he is a partner in the parent company of the kalamazoo wings 
hockey team and partowner of their stadium he also has minority 
interests in a kalamazoo advertising firm and an automotive 
engineering company in daytona fla 
as if that werent enough to keep him busy gilmore serves on 
dozens of local state and national commissions ranging from the 
presidents council on sports and physical fitness to the local 
chamber of commerce 
the parent company for his holdings jim gilmore enterprises 
has had annual revenues as high as 300 million 
in 1985 forbes listed gilmore as one of the 400 wealthiest 
americans estimating his worth at 160 million 
forbes was close but a little on the high side gilmore 
says with a smile 
maybe so but its still not bad for a firstyear college 
dropout who started out by mopping floors at the family department 
store 
gilmore is quick to admit that most of the money he started out 
with was inherited after his grandfather died his grandmother 
married the founder of upjohn co the pharmaceutical company 
merging kalamazoos two wealthiest families 
but gilmores workaholic and perfectionist tendencies have 
allowed him to make the most of his head start 
after growing tired of working in the familys department store 
gilmore was elected kalamazoos youngest mayor a position he held 
from 195961 
a diehard republican gilmore remained active in politics for 
many years heading five congressional campaigns for former rep 
garry e brown gilmore also made an unsuccessful bid of his own 
for a congressional seat in 1980 two years after his first wife 
died of cancer 
running was one of the best things i did in my life although 
losing didnt feel very good said gilmore the father of five 
grown children and stepfather to his second wifes four children 
though gilmore contends he has no plans to get back into the 
political arena he may be lured to washington dc if his good 
friend of 12 years vice president george bush is elected 
president in november 
i think were good enough friends that theres a good 
possibility i might be asked to do something in a bush 
administration gilmore said 
gilmore the public servant also believes in continuing his 
familys tradition of philanthropy instead of sharing his profits 
with the community through a foundation after his death gilmore 
says he believes in working on things while were still alive 
every night when i get home from work i put on a sweater and 
take a walk downtown and i take notes on things that need to be 
done he said 
and he doesnt believe in procrastination for example when a 
kalamazoo homeless shelter needed repairs late last year gilmore 
donated 30000 for an immediate renovation 
maybe thats why aj foyt gave gilmore the diamondstudded ring 
that went with his indy victory 
when he gave it to me he said jim you may lose everything 
else but you wont lose this

it may sound like a childhood nightmare 
come true people buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions 
but this is the age of the designer onion and industry 
officials say the lower rio grande valleys grapefruitsize variety 
known as the texas 1015 supersweet has onion enthusiasts crying for 
more 
at least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the valley 
at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion 
theyll put them in there with some of this eastertype grass 
and ship them ups united parcel service said dr leonard pike 
a texas aampm university horticultural scientist who developed the 
1015 
since 1974 valley growers have helped fund 1 million in 
research grants for the continuing project pike leads in the quest 
for a sweeter milder onion 
he released his texas grano 1015 named for the optimum 
planting date of oct 15 in 1983 providing increasing 
competition for sweet onions such as the sweet vidalia from 
georgia hawaiis maui maui and californias imperial valley 
grano in the 1015s name means it is a round variety as 
opposed to flatter granex onions 
its helped us because its got a lot more people eating 
onions that didnt eat them before said dale deberry owner of 
progreso produce co you can see that by the number of tourists 
who come by here asking for 1015s 
on a recent afternoon a steady stream of winter texans drove up 
to his company near the border town of progreso but the round 
yellow 1015s werent in yet 
the sweet spring onions are only available for a sixweek period 
beginning in midapril 
deberrys company and others have started labeling the 1015s 
with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name 
right now theres a national obsession for sweet onions and i 
know that sounds strange said paula fouchek executive director 
of the harlingenbased texas fresh promotional board which is 
waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the states 
designer onions 
theres a lot of people who are really fanatical about them 
she said 
about 80 percent of texas onion crop is the sweet spring 
variety said erv sandlin a promotional marketing coordinator with 
the texas department of agriculture 
onions last year brought 778 million to onion producers in 
texas making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables said 
doug bierstedt with the texas agricultural statistics service 
statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19000 acres of 
which 14000 is for the spring crop bierstedt said about 3500 
texas acres are planted in the 1015 
texas niche in the national market is that its south texas 
spring crop hits the market early growers say 
we come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about 
gone and spring begins said othal brand sr whose mcallenbased 
griffin amp brand inc is the largest onion producer in texas 
until the spring onions hit the market consumers are eating the 
more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states 
on an early spring afternoon brand who is mayor of mcallen 
tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop 
isnt that beautiful brand asked after pulling two of the 
bulbs up the only thing prettier than that is money in the 
bank 
other texas onions usually begin hitting the market before the 
1015s are ready the drawback from the spring crop grown in the 
short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage 
growers say 
pike said he is working on ways to store the spring onions 
longer 
he also is researching just what makes the 1015 mild and said 
it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic 
acid which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that 
give the vegetable a bad image 
very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your 
eyes pike said 
the 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems said 
pike who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will 
eat the mild ones of the spring season 
most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound and some have been 
reported at three pounds according to pike 
bob scarborough who manages gift packages for bartlett groves 
in mcallen said his company started shipping the special boxes of 
onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus 
for several years 
as a matter of fact i still have a little trouble with it 
when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges 
or grapefruits scarborough said

consider increasing its offer if farmers management would agree to 
negotiate 
the issue is complicated by a dispute between batus and 
insurance regulators in kansas one of nine states in which farmers

shearson lehman hutton inc today defended its 
role in the hostile takeover attempt of koppers co and denounced 
the bizarre allegation that shearson rather than a group led 
by beazer plc was trying to acquire koppers 
from an american express co viewpoint not only do we think 
this to be a shearson transaction and activity in the normal course 
of its business but we also view the uproar by some allies of 
koppers as illinformed provcative and illadvised harry l 
freeman executive vice president of parent company american 
express told the senate banking committee 
he said it was illinformed because of the continued erroneous 
assertion that that somehow shearson rather than beazer is trying 
to acquire koppers which is simply not true and strikes the 
management of american express co as a bizarre allegation 
freeman said it was unfair to characterize shearson lehman as 
having taken an equity position in the takeover attempt he said 
shearon lehman was providing advice and bridge financing for the 
transaction both normal functions for us investment banks 
but charles r pullin chairman and chief executive officer of 
koppers a pittsburgh construction materials concern said 
shearsonamerican express has dominated and actively guided every 
aspect of the planning and execution of the koppers takeover 
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago 
beazers unsolicited cash tenderpoffer of 45 a share on march 3 
has since been sweetened to 60 per share 
brian c beazer chairman and chief executive officer of the 
british materials and construction firm that bears his name told 
the senate panel i am not a corporate raider 
beazer said his firm was not the sort of organization that 
seeks to put people out of work far from it 
commenting on koppers refusal to try to negotiate a merger 
agreement beazer said it appears to me that you can never know 
anything aboet an opposing side until you at least can hear their 
view

it is a tenet of president reagans philosophy 
so deeply imbedded in his political approach that it might be 
referred to as a cornerstone of policy 
aspects of it were endorsed by the grace commission in 1982 by 
the general accounting office in 1983 by the office of management 
amp budget in 1984 and by a bipartisan presidential commission in 
1988 
its efficacy has been shown when used at the local level and 
whenever practiced at the federal level but privatization 
specifically the contracting out of government services now 
performed inhouse has grown slowly 
the reasons why are not surprising since government has long 
been accused of footdragging but oddly some of the skidmarks of 
reluctancy seem to have come from the white house itself in spite 
of its avowals of support 
that curious claim becomes even more so since it is made in a 
paper from the heritage foundation which is generally supportive 
of the president and has in the past been a font of ideas for the 
administration 
the authors of the study privatization subtitled a 
strategy for taming the federal budget states that the most 
disheartening obstacle to contracting out has been the reagan 
administrations lack of initiative 
editors steven moore and stuart butler cite a 1985 omb study of 
22 federal agencies showing that in a threeyear period half of 
them awarded no service contracts to outside firms as the result of 
cost comparisons ordained by omb 
though making the story even stranger some background also 
sheds light on at least one the reasons why government regulations 
the same ones meant to encourage contracting out put the 
outside contractor as a disadvantage 
reading through the report it appears that a selfserving 
bureaucracy rather than the white house is the culprit since the 
bureaucracy apparently has the power to frustrate the intent of 
toplevel orders and goals 
for example 
in keeping with omb circular a76 private firms must compete 
with inhouse suppliers through a detailed costcomparison process 
the agency then must choose the least expensive alternative 
inhouse or contracted out 
but according to moore and butler the costcomparison 
procedure has been transformed by the federal agencies into a de 
facto moratorium on contracting out the bureacracy defends 
itself well 
among other things it handicaps the private vendor by skewing 
the meaning of comparison the private bidder for example 
must beat the inhouse cost estimate by at least 10 percent in 
order to get the contract 
thats just the beginning unlike the government agency the 
private firm must also include all indirect costs such as rent and 
corporate salaries a process that places private bidders at about 
a 35 percent handicap 
even worse the agency itself conducts the cost comparisons and 
awards the contracts the bureaucracy say moore and butler can 
delay the proceedings for as long as three years so that very 
few contracts are ever awarded 
they maintain that federal contractingout policy is so 
routinely disregarded and so fervently opposed by the federal 
bureaucracy that only a forceful statement by reagan can put it 
back on track

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states dropped by 25 this week to total 916 baker hughes 
inc announced monday 
the rig count the widelywatched industry index of drilling 
activity had posted a slight increase of six the previous week to 
total 941 
baker hughes rig count reflects the number of rigs actively 
exploring for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs 
producing oil 
a year ago the count was 749 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
the rig count reached a peak of 4500 active rigs in december 
1981 which was the height of the oil boom but oil prices plunged 
to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the 
rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among the major oil producing states texas was the big loser 
this week as its count dropped by 12 counts in ohio and oklahoma 
were each down by five wyoming lost three and michigan lost two 
new mexico colorado and north dakota each lost one rig kansas

soviet fertilizer plants will be equipped with 
hightechnology production control equipment under a 
multimilliondollar venture announced monday by honeywell inc and 
the soviet government ministry 
the deal was announced as a group of 400 americans led by 
commerce secretary c william verity arrived for trade talks with 
soviet officials 
prospects for more such joint projects which the soviets are 
promoting to help stimulate their economy are a main topic for the 
talks of the ussoviet joint commercial commission 
honeywell and the soviet ministry of mineral fertilizer 
production are forming a company that will design automated control 
systems for factories under the ministrys jurisdiction and is 
expected to sell to third countries as well said james verrant a 
honeywell senior vice president 
the soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using 
the new technology thereby also improving harvests in the weak 
farm economy 
honeywell will own 49 percent of the company and the soviet 
ministry will own 51 percent verrant said the company has been 
named sterch after an endangered species of siberian crane that 
was saved by ussoviet cooperation in the 1970s 
a honeywell statement said the companys investment in the 
initial marketing and design phase will be about 1 million 
verrant told a news conference that once the joint venture begins 
installing the production control equipment purchases from 
honeywell could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 
million volume in the first year of operation 
because the soviet ruble cannot be exchanged for hard currency 
the method of receiving profits is a major problem for western 
firms trying to set up joint ventures with the soviet union 
but verrant said that under soviet legislation adopted in 
september the minister of the soviet fertilizer industry has 
access to some of the countrys hard currency earnings 
honeywells future income from the project will depend on 
increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be 
marketed to third countries and on installation in other countries 
of systems in plants that the soviets have helped manage verrant 
said 
most of the joint ventures employees will be soviets verrant 
said 
the agreement will be signed thursday and official registration 
of the company may take a month or more 
giorgi prityko a top official in the soviet ministry said 
bulgarias 10 years of experience with a similar honeywell system 
was an important reason the soviets chose the minneapolisbased 
company 
we just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in 
bulgaria he said 
members of the joint commercial commission are expected to hear 
from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
verity said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks 
although they could improve the climate for greater ussoviet 
trade 
he said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only 
if the soviets make improvements in other areas such as human 
rights and emigration

the american public may be less willing 
than the television industry believes to embrace a highresolution 
tv system with improved picture quality clearer images and more 
brilliant color according to a study released monday 
the results of the study by the media laboratory at the 
massachusetts institute of technology contradict the accepted 
wisdom which posits that high definition tv knocks the socks 
off everyone who sees it 
the study found that to most viewers the differences between 
conventional tv and high definition tv called hdtv are subtle and 
that screens would have to be two to three times the size of sets 
found in most american living rooms to have a significant impact 
the japanese have been working on hdtv for nearly 20 years and 
are moving forward quickly they plan to give a preview of their 
system with broadcasts of this summers seoul olympics to hdtv sets 
in about 50 bigcity department stores throughout the country 
the picture on a standard television set in the united states is 
produced by a signal that scans more than 200000 dots on 525 
lines the japanese system has 1125 scanning lines 
of the 613 people who participated in the study 62 percent said 
they preferred the quality of hdtv overall 
however this indicates that hdtv is not the same kind of 
revolutionary shift in technology as experienced in the transition 
to color in the 1950s and 1960s in the united states said a 
report on the study written by w russell neuman associate 
professor at the media laboratory and released at the national 
association of broadcasters convention here 
although engineers and broadcast professionals see the 
difference immediately and stronly prefer hdtv the differences 
are more subtle to the untrained eye of the mass audience the 
report said 
hdtv is the most talked about development at this years 
convention which began saturday and ends tuesday 
broadcasters are concerned that us research efforts to develop 
an industry transmission standard for hdtv still years away in the 
united states may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable 
japanese invasion of the new technology 
hdtv is expected to be introduced by the japanese to homes in 
their country in 1990 
the japanese system requires more than the space allocated to tv 
channels on the electromagnetic spectrum in japan the hdtv system 
called hivision will be transmitted by satellite to small rooftop 
antennas avoiding the bandwidth problem that would be faced by 
overtheair broadcasting but special hdtv receivers will be 
needed to see the enhanced picture 
one of the us broadcasters greatest fears is that the 
japanese will begin exporting to the united states hdtv video 
cassette recorders and receiver sets that would not receive 
overtheair broadcast signals 
were fooling ourselves if we dont think the people in the 
video cassette cable and movie industries are going to take 
advantage of that said michael j sherlock of nbc which is 
developing a system that improves picture quality though not as 
significantly as the japanese hdtv system 
broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if 
we take too long to meet the competition with an improved 
television picture he said 
but neumans report said the american public is unlikely to rush 
out to buy hdtv sets which are expected to cost upwards of 3500 
when first introduced 
the media lab study admittedly an early experiment was 
conducted in a shopping mall in danvers mass in early december 
1987 for 30 minutes a total of 613 randomly selected shoppers in 
groups of five to 20 watched a variety of programs on conventional 
and hdtv sets 
though viewers could usually see a difference in picture quality 
between the two sets and overall liked hdtv more they preferred a 
conventional picture for some of the programming the study found

ah robins co told a federal judge monday 
his decision to set 2475 billion in compensation for dalkon 
shield victims helped kill a pending buyout of the pharmaceutical 
company 
but a lawyer for rorer group inc which planned to acquire 
robins told us district judge robert r merhige jr the judges 
ruling did not automatically destroy robins pact with rorer 
merhige and us bankruptcy judge blackwell n shelley listened 
to arguments on whether robins should pay a 25 million 
breakup fee to rorer plus 9 million in expenses associated 
with the failed merger 
the rorerrobins pact negotiated last november included the 
25 million fee to rorer if the deal fell through its key 
provision called for paying 175 billion to women who suffered 
injuries from using the dalkon shield intrauterine device which 
robins sold in the early 1970s 
a month after the agreement was reached merhige determined that 
2475 billion was needed for dalkon shield compensation 
dennis drebsky an attorney for robins said the agreement with 
rorer for all intents and purposes was a dead letter after the 
higher compensation figure was established 
they were siamese twins and when one of the twins died the 
other went with it drebsky said of the rorer merger and its 
175 billion compensation proposal 
but arthur l liman the attorney for the rorer group said his 
company had the sole right to withdraw from the agreement when the 
higher figure was set robins had no such right he said 
also liman said robins officials continued to negotiate with 
rorer executives after merhiges decision as if the two firms could 
adjust the terms of their deal to accomodate the larger 
compensation 
robins knew the agreement was not dead he said it was 
clinging to it in case talks with two other potential buyers the 
american home products corp of new york and the parisbased sanofi 
sa a major european pharmaceutical manufacturer fell through 
robins accepted an american home products offer in late january 
the judges did not rule immediately on rorers request for the 
breakup fee but merhige said the fort washington pa company 
would not receive all the 9 million in expenses 
merhige interrupted arguments on the dispute for about two hours 
monday to allow the attorneys to try to work out a settlement but 
no deal was struck 
robins the richmondbased maker of the robitussin series of 
cough medicines and other pharmaceuticals has been in federal 
bankruptcy court under chapter 11 protection from creditors since 
august 1985 
the chief issue in the companys reorganization has been 
payments to some 195000 women with injury claims because of the 
iud 
robins merger with american home products and the dalkon shield 
compensation package will be voted on by creditors after ballots 
are mailed out april 25 votes are due back july 11 and merhige 
has set july 18 for a hearing on confirmation of the reorganization 
plan

the chairman of goodyear tire amp rubber co 
told shareholders monday that a top priority this year will be 
eliminating about 36 billion in debt incurred in fending off sir 
james goldsmiths 1986 takeover attempt 
robert e mercer also said he expected 1988 earnings to surpass 
the 7705 million earned last year which included 257 million 
from discontinued operations 
at the shareholders meeting mercer said that reducing debt 
caused by goodyears antitakeover stock buyback plan would require 
several measures including possibly divesting its interest in a 
joint pipeline 
mercer said a recent court ruling permitting the final segment 
of the all american pipeline in texas should enhance the sale 
prospects 
the pipeline is a project of celeron oil and gas a former 
goodyear subsidiary until it was sold last year as goodyear 
concentrated on its core tire business 
continuing advances in cost control and keeping capital 
expenditures as close to depreciation levels as is competitively 
practical should allow us to make some contribution to the debt 
reduction this year from operating income mercer added in our 
assessment of the remainder of 1988 the global tire market looks 
promising 
meanwhile executive vice president stanley j mihelick 
confirmed that goodyear is considering building a new tire plant in 
canada 
a 550acre site in napanee ontario about 25 miles west of 
kingston ontario could be home for a radial tire plant subject 
to working out details with canadian authorities he said 
the ontario government has approved a 32 million loan to assist 
in establishing the plant 
during the weekend the united rubber workers union targeted 
goodyear for negotiations toward a threeyear labor contract that 
labor leaders say will set the tone for negotiations with the rest 
of the industry 
a 12member advisory committee on saturday unanimously chose 
goodyear over companies such as firestone tire amp rubber co as the 
patternsetting company according to a news release from milan 
stone urws international president

richard nixon opened china to americans in the 
early 1970s now his soninlaw is opening china to more and better 
advertising billboards 
chinas eagerness to put up more billboards is a sign of 
progress in the communist nation edward cox said monday in 
announcing a deal between china and patrick media group inc of 
scranton pa 
if youre going to have a marketoriented economy the most 
important thing is free passing of information and advertising is 
a big part of that cox said in an interview 
cox a finance lawyer and the husband of patricia nixon cox 
acted as a gobetween on behalf of patrick media which bills 
itself as the worlds largest outdoor advertising company 
patrick media will give the chinese advice on such matters as 
standardizing the sizes of billboards upgrading its paint and 
attracting business from nonchinese advertisers 
an initiative like this like sports or arts transcends 
advertising or business it goes to the germ of our being said 
gerard p joyce the companys 36yearold president and chief 
executive 
with more than 1 billion consumers and only about 7000 
billboards china is a little more naked than the united 
states joyce said meaning that each advertising message has more 
impact 
china hopes to increase its number of billboards to 10000 
within five years said zhao guihong general manager of the china 
national united advertising corp which is responsible for almost

shearson lehman hutton inc on monday defended 
its role in the hostile takeover attempt of koppers co against 
senators claims the american express co subsidiary had crossed 
the line between banking and commerce 
from an american express co viewpoint not only do we think 
this to be a shearson transaction and activity in the normal course 
of its business but we also view the uproar by some allies of 
koppers as illinformed provocative and illadvised harry l 
freeman executive vice president of parent company american 
express told the senate banking committee 
he said it was illinformed because of the continued erroneous 
assertion that somehow shearson rather than beazer plc is trying 
to acquire koppers which is simply not true and strikes the 
management of american express co as a bizarre allegation 
beazer is a british materials and construction concern it led a 
group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of 45 a share for 
koppers on march 3 a deal that has since been sweetened to 60 per 
share or 17 billion the pittsburghbased koppers produces 
construction materials and chemicals and employs 1300 people in 
the pittsburgh area and 12300 nationwide 
freeman said it was unfair to characterize shearson as having 
taken an equity position in the takeover attempt 
steven b wolitzer managing director of shearson said the 
firms role was limited to providing shortterm or bridge 
financing for beazers tender offer and giving advice such 
financing is typical for investment banks in deals of this 
kind he said 
wolitzer also said shearson was contributing equity of its own 
of 23 million in the bidding group but he said management and 
control of the group would be held by beazer plc 
but charles r pullin chairman and chief executive officer of 
koppers said shearson has dominated and actively guided every 
aspect of the planning and execution of the koppers takeover 
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago 
in effect what we have is a bank acting as a corporate 
raider said sen jim sasser dtenn 
shearson has crossed the traditional boundary separating banking 
from commerce and industry said sen john heinz rpa 
shearson is only the first to cross a line that wall street 
believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the 
future heinz said 
without naming anyone freeman said it was odd that 
government officials had jumped into the fray without taking care 
to learn about the proposed acquiring company or to familiarize 
itself with its management and its track record in the us and 
abroad 
brian c beazer chairman and chief executive officer of the 
firm that bears his name told the senate panel i am not a 
corporate raider 
beazer said his firm was not the sort of organization that 
seeks to put people out of work far from it 
commenting on the refusal by koppers to try to negotiate a 
merger agreement beazer said it appears to me that you can 
never know anything about an opposing side until you at least can 
hear their view 
beazers offer has been extended until april 15 while courts 
consider legal challenges by koppers that have slowed the takeover 
bid

irving bank corp said monday its firstquarter 
profit jumped 83 percent as tax benefits combined with strong 
growth in interest income and other gains more than offset a rise 
in costs 
the company which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from bank 
of new york co said its profit rose to 524 million or 271 a 
share in the first quarter compared with 286 million or 151 a 
share a year earlier 
chairman joseph a rice said the results included 123 million 
in tax benefits related to the loanloss provisions that the 
company took in 1987 in anticipation of problems in collecting some 
third world loans 
net interest income rose 12 percent to 1469 million from 
1312 million a year earlier as the difference between what the 
bank paid in interest to obtain funds and what it received on its 
money widened in the banking companys favor 
in the quarter irving took a provision for credit losses of 
196 million in 1988 compared with 218 million in 1987 that 
left its loan loss allowance at 6965 million or 438 percent of 
loans compared with 2248 million or 162 percent of loans a 
year earlier 
noninterest income increased 16 percent to 119 million from 
1026 million a year earlier including a 24 percent rise in trust 
income securities trading generated revenue of 63 million in 
contrast with a loss of 28 million a year earlier 
noninterest expenses rose 11 percent to 179 million including 
a 10 percent rise in salary and employee benefits 
irving said earlier this month that it expects to earn 234 
million in all of 1988 in contrast to a loss of 1932 million a 
year earlier 
it is trying to convince its shareholders to reject bank of new 
yorks 108 billion tender offer of cash and securities for all of 
irvings stock 
bank of new york is offering 1575 shares of its own stock and 
15 a share in cash for each of the 184 million shares of irving 
stock that it doesnt already own

boeing co declined monday to comment on reports 
that four major airlines had reported defects in the aerospace 
companys 747 and 767 widebody jets 
the problems reportedly ranged from wrong parts to incorrectly 
installed firefighting systems 
t craig martin a spokesman for boeings commercial airplane 
division deflected questions about the reports saying the company 
planned to hold a news conference tuesday to discuss the matter 
the newspaper accounts said boeing had received complaints of 
defects from american airlines japan air lines all nippon airways 
and british airways 
the seattle postintelligencer said monday that all nippon a 
japanese domestic carrier disclosed it told boeing of several 
instances of poor workmanship in 747 and 767 airliners mostly on 
newly delivered planes 
the problems included a wing flap disintegrating in flight on 
the first day of service smoke from a misassembled power unit that 
caused an emergency landing and problems in a fire extinguisher 
system all nippon said 
dean thornton head of boeing commercial airplanes was quoted 
by the newspaper as saying a jetliner is a big complicated piece 
of machinery 
the complaints were isolated instances that shouldnt 
happen he said were gonna bust our butt to make sure they 
dont happen again 
yoshiyuki funatsu all nippon executive vice president told the 
postintelligencer that problems with defects had been increasing 
recently at boeing he said that while many had been minor some 
had safety ramifications although none of the defects had caused 
accidents 
bob baker american airlines senior vice president for 
operations told the newspaper the companys maintenance crews had 
found faulty firesuppression systems in the cargo holds of three 
767200s the system pipes firefighting chemicals to the forward 
and aft compartments of the cargo hold 
the pipes were misrouted baker said if you light them 
off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear 
baker said that after being informed of the problem by american 
boeing found one faulty system on its production line and all 
nippon and japan air lines found several in their planes 
last week it was reported that japan air lines president susumu 
yamaji had complained of manufacturing mistakes in a march 30 
letter to boeing chairman frank shrontz besides the fire 
extinguisher system the airline complained about engine 
temperature sensors being installed in reverse order in a 747 
which would cause temperature gauges to register for the wrong 
engines 
in its saturday editions the seattle times published excerpts 
from a letter from dk craig british airways chief engineer for 
technical and quality services to phil condit executive vice 
president of boeing commercial airplanes 
craig said british airways inspectors at boeings plant found 
problems in their jets ranging from missing fasteners to wrong or 
missing parts one missing part caused the floor of a jet to bow so 
much that a main deck cargo power drive unit would not work the 
times said 
my quality inspectors can only properly inspect a very small 
proportion of each aircraft craig wrote they should never 
ever come across missing fasteners missing parts cracks 
bodged rivets fasterners fitted the wrong way round yet we find 
instances of some of these on every aircraft

chrysler corps planned closing of its 
kenosha auto plant would cost 209 million in welfare and 
unemployment benefits along with lost taxes for the first two 
years after the shutdown a unioncommissioned study concluded 
monday 
the analysis by the midwest center for labor research in chicago 
estimated that the plants closing would cost federal state and 
local governments a total of 38000 for each unemployed chrysler 
worker 
chrysler announced in january it plans to end auto production at 
kenosha by sept 30 resulting in the layoffs of 5500 workers 
chrysler took over the plant last year as part of its purchase of 
american motors corp 
of about the two dozen studies that weve done thats the 
highest figure weve ever come up with greg leroy mclr research 
director told a news conference at the united auto workers local 
72 headquarters 
leroy said the study which was commissioned by the union local 
was based on a previous mclr study in 1985 but used more 
comprehensive welfare and employment figures from the state 
kenosha and racine counties and the us bureau of labor statistics 
it estimated that the plants closing would result in 624 
million in unemployment compensation 545 million in lost federal 
income tax revenue 26 million in lost social security tax 
revenue 214 million in welfare expenditures and 17 million in 
lost state sales and excise tax revenue 
wisconsin gov tommy thompson has threatened to sue chrysler 
claiming the detroitbased automaker broke a promise to keep the 
plant open for five years 
chrysler officials have said they may have been overly 
optimistic when negotiating with the state for improvements and job 
training funds but have repeatedly denied making any such promise 
the study indicated that 531 percent of the kenosha workers 
would still be unemployed two years after the plants closing 
in addition the study estimated that 9796 other workers in the 
state would be dislocated by the shutdown most of those jobs would 
be in companies that supply chrysler as well as people in retail 
service and other jobs supported by the buying power of chrysler 
workers 
in an economy like this the absorbtion rate just isnt there 
if jobs arent there people arent going to get reemployed 
leroy said 
he said the figures for kenosha were higher than those in other 
communities hit by large plant shutdowns because of several 
different factors in the southeastern wisconsin economy and in the 
status of unionized chrysler workers among the differences he 
cited 
kenosha has an above average unemployment rate which has 
remained above the national average for several years 
the area is strongly dependent on employment at the plant more 
than onethird of the areas total jobs would be lost with the 
shutdown 
chrysler workers make above average salaries and wages 
29120 and have benefits that many other potential employers in 
kenosha do not have 
unionized workers in general have a harder time finding new 
employment 
leroy said the study also estimated that chrysler workers would 
experience a loss in living standards within the first two years 
with welfare and compensation benefits and new employment the 
workers average income in the second year would still decline by 
775 percent he said 
local 72 negotiator rudy kuzel said the union commissioned the 
study as a public service some people in the public perceive 
this as a problem for the workers in the plant and dont realize 
its going to cost them a lot of money also he said 
kuzel said the study would be sent to state and local officials 
to aid in negotiations with chrysler

atampt on monday announced changes to make it 
easier for customers to use computers based on its unix operating 
system 
the new open look feature of unix software will allow users to 
manipulate the computer with graphic symbols instead of written 
commands american telephone amp telegraph co said 
the changes represent another step toward acceptance of unix in 
the business world until recently unix was seen as mainly for 
science and engineering 
open look was designed for atampt by sun microsystems inc the 
burgeoning maker of engineering workstations based in mountain 
view calif 
suns design is based on original work contributions from atampt 
and technology licensed from xerox corp which originated many of 
the ideas for graphic screen symbols the companies said 
the open look screen somewhat resembles that of apple computer 
incs macintosh apple famed for the ease of use of its 
computers has been fighting to protect its turf and recently sued 
microsoft corp and hewlettpackard co over a software copyright 
issue 
apple spokeswoman brooke cohan said the company had no comment 
on the atampt announcement 
unix is a base layer of software in a computer that serves as a 
traffic cop for its internal operations open look is a user 
interface which determines the look and feel of a computer to 
someone sitting at the keyboard 
a wide range of companies endorsed open look including software 
makers such as lotus development corp ashtontate corp and 
oracle corp computer makers such as unisys corp amdahl corp 
and ncr corp and chip makers such as motorola inc and national 
semiconductor corp 
atampt will circulate specifications of open look for comment 
starting this summer and will make the available in the years 
third quarter software that is written to use open look will be 
available mainly in 1989 and after

bankamerica corp which bitterly fought 
off one hostile takeover bid two years ago and could become a 
target again adopted a takeover defense plan on monday 
bankamericas board of directors said the preferred share 
purchase rights plan was intended to protect shareholders in the 
event of partial tender offers squeezeouts and other abusive 
tactics to gain control of bankamerica without paying all 
stockholders a premium 
the plan would make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
by allowing bankamerica common shareholders to acquire a new issue 
of preferred stock in the event a party acquired 20 percent of the 
companys common shares or launched a tender offer to acquire 20 
percent or more 
bankamerica is the nations thirdlargest bank holding company 
following no 1 citicorp and chase manhattan corp both of new 
york 
aw clausen bankamericas chairman said the plan was not in 
reaction to any specific buyout proposal he noted that hundreds of 
other companies had adopted similar plans 
bankamerica stock closed down 12 cents to 11 a share monday on 
the new york stock exchange 
first interstate corp based in los angeles waged a lengthy 
and bitter hostile bid for bankamerica beginning in 1986 but gave 
up its chase last year in the face of a major bankamerica 
restructuring that the suitor said diminished the value of its 
target 
i dont know why they took this action at this point except 
that maybe the time to do it is when you dont need to dan b 
williams of san franciscobased sutro amp co inc said of 
bankamerica maybe they just want to be prepared 
nevertheless williams added if the company did not have 
further major problems with its troubled third world debt portfolio 
it might be able to produce a string of profitable performances 
that could make it an attractive target 
separately bank of america announced the formation of three 
regional capital markets operations to serve europe the americas 
and asia each will be responsible for trading merchant banking 
and investment banking activities in its respective region 
were reorganizing our operation from productoriented to 
geographyoriented said bank spokesman jim mitchell

wheelingpittsburgh steel corp can sell most 
of its idled mill in monessen to sharon steel corp a federal 
bankruptcy judge ruled monday 
the 181 million deal approved by us bankruptcy judge warren 
bentz in erie is unusual because both companies are reorganizing 
under federal bankruptcy laws 
the deal does not include a 120 million rail mill that is to be 
sold in three months by the federal agency that financed and later 
foreclosed on it 
sharons offer which edged out four other bids was for 
monessens coke ovens raw steelmaking facilities and continuous 
bloom caster a piece of equipment that produces semifinished 
products 
sharon has until may 15 to complete the purchase but has 
reserved the right to back out of the deal if the environmental 
protection agency and judge hubert teitelbaum refuse to grant 
temporary relief from pollution control standards imposed on coke 
operations at the westmoreland county mill 
attorneys for wheelingpittsburgh and its creditors said sharon 
steels offer was best partly because the steelmaker would provide 
a ready market for the coke they also said wheelingpittsburgh 
would be better able to press any financial claims against another 
company that was reorganizing under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law than against one that was not 
walter sieckman sharon steels chief executive said his 
companys plans to reopen the coke ovens will bring back about 150 
jobs the ovens were idled in june 1986 but kept partially fired to 
prevent their brick linings from deteriorating 
a restart of the operations also would enable sharon steel to 
recall about 90 to 100 of its own workers who were laid off last 
week when a shortfall of coke a necessary ingredient in 
steelmaking caused the company to temporarily idle one of its two 
blast furnaces 
sharon steel purchases coke on the open market but has been 
unable to fill its requirements
