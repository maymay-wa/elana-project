bourhane was repairing his radio christmas day 
when the chinese crowds came 
down with black devils they shouted black devils go 
home the chants echoed off the walls of his dormitory at the 
nanking polytechnical institute 
i thought they wanted to kill me kill all of us from africa 
said the 23yearold student from the african country of comoros 
who uses one name i started pacing the room my sweat was cold 
for the next four days thousands of chinese youths marched 
through nankings streets shouting racist slogans and calling for 
the punishment of african students who brawled with chinese at a 
dance when the chinese objected to the africans bringing chinese 
women 
the racial incidents which began in nanking at the christmas eve 
dance and spread to three other cities were fueled by a mixture of 
racism and political restiveness chinese youths wanted to express 
anger and frustration africans were an easy target 
in hangzhou africans boycotted classes because they said 
university operators were telling chinese that all africans have 
aids in the central city of wuhan chinese youths threw rocks at 
foreign students dormitories and in beijing africans at one 
college stopped going to class after chinese protested an alleged 
assault by a black man on a chinese woman 
african students have been coming to china since 1959 as part of 
beijings policy of asserting a role of leadership in the third 
world today about 1500 african students a year receive chinese 
scholarships 
but africanchinese relations are strained many chinese are open 
about their disdain toward black people 
when i look at their black faces i feel uncomfortable a 
25yearold said during a demonstration in nanking when i see 
them with our women my heart boils 
most chinese have little or no contact with different races or 
cultures so a foreign face naturally draws attention but africans 
say the chinese treat whites and other asians better 
not a day goes by when im not insulted said billy sissoko 
a student from mali today someone looked at my skin and asked me 
after six years in china why havent you become whiter 
chinese often say they find dark skin ugly because it implies 
that a person engages in manual labor still not a glorious calling 
in this dictatorship of the working class 
black gods in chinese mythology are invariably wicked black 
children is the name given to unplanned children 
chinese also look down on those poorer than themselves and many 
african nations fall into that category 
this feeling of superiority turns to resentment when chinese 
discover that african students in china receive about 10 times the 
monthly stipend of about 6 given chinese students 
add the issue of women to this mixture of economic and cultural 
prejudice and the situation becomes explosive 
most african students in china are men sent here for as long as 
six years they say it is only natural they should mix with the 
local women many chinese object 
one night sun min a 20yearold woman in nanking invited an 
african man and a white american woman to dinner later she said 
her neighbors gossiped you had a foreigner to dinner thats not 
bad but how could you also invite a black man 
the chinese government insists racism does not exist in china and 
that it played no part in the recent confrontations 
the official xinhua news agency blamed the clashes in nanking on 
a group of africans and said chinese demonstrators who shouted 
erroneous slogans were immediately stopped 
xinhua also accused the associated press the voice of america 
and agence francepresse of distorting the incidents by reporting 
the racist elements in the clashes 
by the third day of demonstrations in nanking protesters had 
turned their wrath from the africans to the chinese government a 
main concern was that africans should not receive special treatment 
under chinese law 
in effect students used the demonstrations to attack special 
privileges given to foreigners the christmas eve clash gave them 
an excuse to address a sensitive political issue without confronting 
it directly 
it doesnt matter if youre a foreigner or deng xiaopings son 
if you break the law you must be punished said one chinese 
student in nanking thats why i am marching 
chinese students who marched in beijing last tuesday echoed the 
call 
we are chinese and we feel the law isnt protecting us one 
woman said what good is the law then 
african students say the only way to change chinese attitudes 
toward blacks is through education 
but these people dont want to learn about africa said tchek 
baisa a student from zaire they dont need us anymore 
indeed chinese foreign policy has changed since the 1960s and 
70s when third world solidarity was a central priority now 
chinas main focus is on western trade and investment 
in nanking bourhane said he didnt think much would change 
really i just want to go home before things become too much 
worse he said

the legality of executing mentally 
retarded people is being challenged before the us supreme court 
this week by a texas murderer with the mind of a 7yearold 
the high court wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments on 
whether executing johnny paul penry for a 1979 rapeslaying would be 
cruel and unusual punishment banned by the constitution 
a federal appeals court previously rejected penrys arguments 
the 32yearold penry has an iq estimated at between 50 and 60 
his schooling consists of a few days in the first grade and he was 
in and out of mental hospitals while growing up near houston 
i was abused treated like a dog my mother broke my arm about 
eight times my left arm is three inches shorter than my right 
penry said in an interview last summer 
convicted of rape in 1977 he served two years of a fiveyear 
prison term three months after his release he was charged with the 
murder of pamela mosely carpenter a livingston housewife who was 
raped beaten and fatally stabbed with scissors she was using to 
make halloween decorations 
penrys case is the second within a year to result in supreme 
court review of the texas capital punishment law which since 1974 
has sent nearly 300 men and women to death row since 1976 when the 
high court allowed capital punishment to resume 29 men have been 
put to death in texas more than any other state 
among them was donald gene franklin whose attorneys last year 
argued that texas jurors were not allowed to consider mitigating 
circumstances such as his good behavior in prison in deciding 
whether he should be put to death 
penrys case is viewed in part as a followup to franklins 
whose challenge was rejected in june by a 63 vote franklin was 
executed nov 3 
the court will be asked to consider whether jurors should have 
considered penrys retardation before deciding to impose a death 
sentence and whether anyone with penrys mental capacity ever should 
get the death penalty said penrys attorney curtis mason 
a court ruling that people with penrys mental capacity should 
not be executed could have major nationwide impact according to 
bob walt an assistant texas attorney general who handles capital 
cases 
you can always find psychiatrists who come in and say this 
person is mentally retarded walt said 
mason is optimistic about a ruling in his favor and sees penry 
getting a new trial or having the death sentence commuted to life 
he dismissed the idea that many killers would contend they are 
retarded to avoid the death chamber 
with somebody who is retarded there generally is a long 
history mason said with penry his history goes way back when 
he first was diagnosed as retarded he was 9 
walt however said the penry case already has resulted in 
execution delays for inmates who are not retarded but claim to be 
i have six or seven where they brought in a psychiatrist and 
say hes mentally retarded walt said he added that penry is the 
only texas death row inmate considered retarded by state officials 
texas attorney general jim mattox said that although penry has 
low intelligence he was aware of what he was doing when he raped 
and killed mrs carpenter 
his iq may be below 70 mattox said but the question is 
whether or not he can adapt his behavior to what he knows is right 
and wrong and theres no doubt in this particular case that he 
knows the difference between right and wrong he had enough 
intelligence to know if he raped a victim that he needed to kill the 
victim 
a supreme court decision is not expected for three or four months 
penry who says he cant remember the year he was born and barely 
can write his name haltingly told interviewers of his miserable 
childhood and said i do need help all that i can get i dont 
think by executing me they can get the job done

cuban troops who fought south african 
forces in angola say they have done their duty and are ready to 
leave under an accord intended to secure independence for namibia 
and peace in this wartorn nation 
the 450 troops officers and noncommissioned officers form the 
first group of a contingent of 3000 cubans who must leave angola by 
april 1 under terms of the accord signed dec 22 by angola cuba and 
south africa 
all cuban troops estimated at 50000 to 52000 must be out of 
angola by july 1 1991 
weve done our duty weve helped the angolan people now its 
time to go home and resume our studies said daniel felipe manero 
a 21yearold antiaircraft gunner from matanza cuba who spent two 
years at a base in menongue in southern angola 
manero and other soldiers met reporters sunday at the futungo 
transit camp outside the angolan capital 
cuban government spokeswoman eurina cabral said the 450 will 
leave tuesday for havana following a ceremony to be attended by 
topranking cuban military officials including deputy armed forces 
minister gen abelardo colome ibarra 
cubas military involvement in angola began in 1975 with 
operation carlota an airlift of troops to back the fledgling 
government of the angolan popular liberation movement just after 
angola gained independence from portugal 
immediately after independence the cubanaided forces began 
fighting south african and ussupported rebels of unita the 
national union for the total independence of angola for control of 
the country 
there is some question of how a un observer force of 70 
military officials and 20 civilians will actually monitor the 
departures of tens of thousands of cubans from several ports and 
airports around the country 
what is important is that it has een agreed the cubans should 
leave the un observer force chief brazilian gen pericles 
ferreira gomes said in an interview in what kind of transporter 
or how many at a time are just details 
we are relying on the good word of both countries angola and 
cuba and the important thing is they are agreeing to the 
withdrawal he said 
angola and cuba have asked the united nations to pick up the 800 
million tab for the cuban pullout which angolan president jose 
eduardo dos santos has said will proceed at a rate of 25003000 
soldiers per month 
ms cabral said she had no details on who was paying what but 
something is certainly being worked out 
she also asked for the remains of all cubans killed in angola to 
be returned to cuba she could not supply casualty figures but some 
western intelligence sources put the figure at about 5000 
throughout the war the policy has been to bury the cuban dead in 
angola 
under an aug 22 ceasefire south african forces withdrew from 
southern angola across the border to namibia a territory 
administered by pretoria since world war i 
but angolas rebel unita forces were not party to usbrokered 
talks that led to the ceasefire and they continue to skirmish with 
angolan troops 
the united states says it will continue to help unita until both 
sides in the civil war sit down and talk something president dos 
santos says is out of the question 
gen venancio avila guerrero commander of cuban troops at the 
decisive battle of cuito cuanavale this spring when the cubans 
routed south african forces in southern angola said he had no 
doubts angolas government forces would be able to handle the battle 
with unita alone 
theyve been ready for years they can take care of this and 
morale is high he said as cuban troops some of them women with 
their hair in rollers played a game of volleyball in the scorching 
midday sun 
unita representatives claim many cuban soldiers will remain in 
the country as angolan citizens married to local women 
thats total lie theres not one cuban married to an angolan 
woman or staying here said lt jesus abad from pinar del rio in 
eastern cuba were professionals who came to do a job and now 
were leaving 
army reservist olga lidia rodriguez proenza was 20 when she 
arrived in angola from her hometown of hologuin two years ago as a 
volunteer in a public health team 
like many others at the camp some of whom have also served in 
nicaragua and ethiopia she said she planned to resume studies in 
pharmacy once back in cuba

has any one told ronald reagan he only has less 
than two weeks left in the white house hes not conducting his 
foreign policy that way 
consider the following actions by the reagan administration in 
the past month 
reagan met in new york with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who announced a decision to reduce the red army by 
500000 helping redress the military imbalance that reagan made a 
campaign issue in 1979 a decade ago 
reagan on dec 15 authorized a dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization following statements by plo chairman yasser 
arafat renouncing the use of terrorism and accepting two un 
resolutions that recognize the right of israel to exist 
reagan agreed after holding out for years to a soviet 
proposal for a multinational human rights conference in moscow the 
moscow session would come in 1991 following similar meetings in 
paris and copenhagen over the preceding two years 
secretary of state george p shultz launched a diplomatic 
initiative to curb the proliferation of chemical weapons following 
the reported use of such poisons by iraq in its war with iran and 
iraq and reports that libya had built a chemical weapons plant 
american forces bloodied the nose of libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi the man reagan loves to hate as two us f14 tomcat 
fighters shot down two libyan mig23s that the pentagon says 
approached with hostile intent 
thats an active foreign policy agenda compared to that of 
previous recent presidents as they awaited their successors to take 
office 
two years ago as reagan was embroiled in the irancontra affair 
few predicted that he would close with such a flurry but in 
december 1987 the man who had severely criticized previous arms 
controls treaties signed one of his own eliminating mediumrange 
soviet and american nuclear weapons 
and in may 1988 the president who five years earlier called the 
soviet union the evil empire traveled to moscow to bless 
gorbachevs reforms 
in some of these instances reagan may have been reacting rather 
than acting and many people believe that presidentelect bush 
despite his denials already has become the de facto president with 
reagan spending much of his time in california 
one student of the presidency says the recent activism probably 
would have been impossible if mike dukakis had defeated bush 
if dukakis had won there would be less chance that he could 
pull it off said samuel kernell a professor of political science 
at the university of california at san diego 
what reagan has done is likely to have been cleared by the bush 
people and is not likely to be undone by bush after jan 20 said 
kernell 
and it is no coincidence that reagans activities have been in 
the foreign rather than the domestic realm said kernell 
foreign affairs is one area in which presidents can act more or 
less on their own said kernell the only problem that they face 
is that foreign leaders are less interested in them 
but for once it was in the soviets interest to continue 
working with reagan that was probably helped by fact that bush was 
reagans protege 
one liberal critic of reagan john steinbruner of the brookings 
institution in washington said that although there has been a set 
of events that gives great promise i dont think the administration 
initiated them 
this business about chemical weapons is driven by international 
events steinbruner said the libyan plant was just finished and 
the international conference was scheduled for a long time 
and clearly gorbachev set the schedule for the troop reductions 
in europe 
despite the skepticism reagans finale compares favorably with 
his predecessors 
president carter defeated by reagan in november 1980 spent his 
last 444 days preoccupied with the american hostages who were 
released by iran on the day reagan took office 
president gerald ford beaten by carter in 1976 left little 
imprint on us foreign policy during his 29 months in office 
president nixon spent his last months in office battling the 
watergate scandal which forced him to resign on aug 9 1974 
president johnson surprised the nation and many of his closest 
advisers with the televised announcement in march 1968 that he 
would not seek reelection and spent last nine months in office 
futilely seeking a solution to the vietnam war

the government said saturday it 
will ask the united states to help battle an electricity shortage 
that has reduced working hours curtailed transportation and even 
trimmed television broadcasts 
public works minister rodolfo terragno who is traveling in the 
united states is to meet with us energy officials on tuesday in 
washington the stateowned news agency telam said in a communique 
terragno also will seek world bank financing to accelerate the 
completion of a large thermoelectric station in bahia blanca 418 
miles southwest of buenos aires 
there was no immediate comment from the us embassy 
a month ago the government took steps to curtail electricity 
consumption including rotating power cuts of up to six hours a day 
reduced street lighting and cutbacks in the hours of operation of 
subways and television stations even clocks were set ahead by one 
hour 
hundreds of thousands of state workers were given friday and 
monday off with pay as government offices closed in response to 
temperatures in the mid 90s and lack of air conditioners 
the government attributes the situation to drought which lowered 
water levels in the rivers that feed argentinas hydroelectric 
projects and to equipment breakdowns at several fossil fuel power 
stations 
also the smaller of the countrys two commercial nuclear 
reactors is out of service 
carlos menem the opposition peronist partys candidate for 
president attributes the situation to the governments lack of 
foresight the lack of responsibility and lack of ability to manage 
the energy sector that is so important 
the department of energy calculated two weeks ago that of a total 
installed capacity of 12118 megawatts the national power grid was 
producing only 2500 kilowatts 
the situation has wreaked havoc with daily life the stock 
exchange suspended operations briefly last thursday newspapers have 
missed press runs people have been stranded in elevators sections 
of the capital are without water due to the shutdown of electric 
pumps 
we are really close to a blackout the president of the 
staterun electric utility segba pablo caravelli said

official trade unions have pledged to 
strike and mount other protests if wage and social reforms fail to 
offset price increases planned by the government a union newspaper 
said saturday 
also saturday an apartment renters group asked the government 
in an open letter to refrain from planned increases in water and 
sewage costs in order not to aggravate social tensions 
the two separate reactions to the governments program were a 
clear indication that it will face difficulties in imposing price 
boosts of up to 15 percent on a variety of goods and services 
a quarter of consumer prices are to go up in the near future 
government spokesman gyerogy marosan announced on jan 2 the 
increases will affect food transportation water and homeheating 
fuels 
the trade union daily nepszava reported that a friday session of 
leaders of the central council of hungarian trade unions said the 
successive price increases have touched off social tensions that 
absolutely require state authorities to take concrete steps in 
coming months to work out and introduce as soon as possible a wage 
and social policy reform 
in the open letter to premier miklos nemeth the leaders of the 
association of apartment renters strongly rejected planned water and 
sewage rate boosts 
the letter quoted by the daily magyar nemzet referred to a 
situation where the rents actually paid for apartments shops 
offices workshops storeroom more than cover the costs of 
maintenance and a profit of about 400 million forints about 8 
million has been amassed by the offices handling this state 
property 
referring to responsible politicians predicting social 
tensions the association said we question the correctness of 
deepening this further by increasing the sums payable by renters in 
this unjustified unfounded and unjust and unlawful manner

the government on saturday pushed forward its 
efforts to cool tripledigit inflation with measures that included a 
285 percent devaluation of the currency 
the package which took effect saturday is the third in a series 
of devaluations and austerity measures since september they are 
aimed at controlling rampaging inflation which hit an alltime high 
of 1722 percent last year 
in the latest measures the centerleft populist government of 
president alan garcia devalued the peruvian inti from 500 to 700 to 
the dollar lifted the price of basic foods an average of 60 
percent and boosted salaries for most workers by 30 percent 
according to the government paper la cronica 
this third package of measures forms part of a policy to 
progressively reduce inflation while promoting exports and slowly 
diminishing food subsidies economy minister carlos rivas said in 
announcing the program late friday night 
he has predicted the 1988 inflation figure will be cut by half 
this year 
but independent economists say the program has not gone far 
enough in reducing the governments heavy spending policies they 
forecast inflation this year of at least 6000 percent 
the official rate valued the inti at 33 to the dollar before the 
september devaluation 
analysts say rocketing inflation coupled with a dramatic 
shrinkage of the economy last year estimated at 84 percent have 
hit perus working class and its poor the hardest 
they say the deteriorating economy and an eightyear insurgency 
by leftist guerrillas have undermined government stability rumors 
of a pending military coup have periodically sprung up in recent 
months 
the economic woes began to mount late in 1987 when dollar 
reserves dried up and the government continued its spending program 
despite a widening fiscal and trade deficits a cutback in 
investment and lack of fresh loans to bolster the dollar reserves 
in ayacucho 225 miles southeast of lima police said saturday 
that maoinspired shining path guerrillas used explosives and 
machine guns to ambush and kill three policeman in a jeep 
officials say rebel violence claimed nearly 2000 lives last year 
and more than 12000 since 1980

homeless residents and their advocates won a 
victory saturday when a judge ruled the city must be prepared to 
open new shelters within three days in neighborhoods where existing 
shelters fill to capacity for two consecutive nights 
district of columbia superior court judge harriett r taylor also 
said the city must make available within 72 hours 50 additional beds 
for single women 
taylor ordered the actions during a special weekend court session 
in response to a suit filed by the community for creative 
nonviolence and several homeless men and women 
in a highly critical fourpage order taylor said the city must 
immediately provide the space for single women who have fewer 
shelters available to them than men 
this extraordinary session also must be contrasted with the 
actions of the district of columbia government which are a classic 
example of too little and too late said taylor 
talyor said the citys actions in response to the need for 
shelter by the homeless was so inadequate and so inept that the 
court was forced to step in with an extraordinary remedy 
about 200 homeless people and advocates gave the judge a standing 
ovation upon hearing the ruling 
the judge set no limit on the number or cost of the additional 
space the city must provide 
were spending between 18 million and 20 million on the 
homeless and thats more per capita than any other city in the 
country said john white a spokesman for mayor marion barry in 
disputing the judges characterization of city efforts on behalf of 
the homeless 
the districts corporation counsel said the city would appeal the 
ruling

the soviet union will start destroying its massive 
stockpiles of chemical weapons this year soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze announced sunday 
addressing an international conference on chemical weapons 
shevardnadze said the soviet union is finishing construction of a 
plant to eliminate chemical arms that will go into operation this 
year 
representatives of other countries will be invited to visit the 
facility he said he did not elaborate 
he said that some might ask whether the soviet union waited too 
long to stop production and the answer would be yes we did in 
fact wait too long we are quickly making up for time lost over 
the past two years 
the soviet position has changed quite radically in recent 
years shevardnadze said the soviet union has gone from 
manufacturing to abandoning altogether chemical weapons 
in the course of the year 1989 we will begin elimination of 
chemical weapons stockpiles at a facility built for that purpose 
he said 
in april 1987 soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said his 
country had stopped manufacturing chemical weapons in october the 
soviet union destroyed some chemical weapons in front of a group of 
western observers but this was done to illustrate openess on the 
subject and not as part of a program to begin destroying the toxic 
agents 
the united states and the soviet union have been the only 
countries to acknowledge producing and stockpiling chemical weapons 
the united states says it produces the arms to counter those 
produced by the soviets 
in 1987 the soviet union declared it had 50000 tons of chemical 
weapons western military experts put soviet stockpiles at between 
100000 and 500000 tons 
the united states has about 30000 tons officials say after an 
18year lapse the united states resumed production of chemical 
weapons in december 1987 saying that much of its aging stockpile 
was obsolete 
shevardnadze called on other countries to end production of 
chemical weapons without referring to the united states by name he 
said there is another country that possesses equally significant 
chemical weapons stockpiles and who could share with us the task of 
finding compromise solutions in the interest of comprehensive and 
global verfication 
the united states also has invited the soviet union to inspect a 
facility used for eliminating obsolete chemical weapons but the 
soviets have not accepted the invitation 
shevardnadze said the soviet union wants to see a convention 
banning use production and stockpiling of chemical weapons signed 
this year 
negotiators have been at work in geneva for 17 years on such a 
convention but an accord has been blocked over a variety of 
problems especially verification 
a 1925 geneva protocol the only existing accord only bans the 
use of chemical weapons not their production or storage and has no 
enforcement power 
the paris conference attended by 145 nations aims to reaffirm 
the geneva protocol and press negotiators in geneva to conclude 
successful negotiations on a global ban 
iran has condemned iraq for using chemical arms in the persian 
gulf war the most recent verified use of the weapons 
the united states has accused libya of constructing a chemical 
weapons plant but libya says the plant at rabta is for 
manufacturing pharmaceuticals

more than 600 north korean art works 
have arrived in south korea marking the first direct trade between 
the two rival korean states government officials said sunday 
the paintings and pottery worth 104000 were imported by daewoo 
corp of seoul in a direct deal with a north korean trading firm 
said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it was the first direct deal between the two koreas since the 
seoul government lifted a ban on trade with north korea in october 
as part of its new policy of seeking improved relations with the 
communist state 
the art works will be sold to the public after display at major 
department stores in seoul and other cities the officials said 
they did not say how the goods arrived in south korea but they are 
believed to have been transported by ship via a third country 
the government has said no duties would be levied on imports from 
north korea because they would be regarded as internal trade 
several other trading houses in seoul are reportedly moving to 
import fish coal and other industrial raw materials from north 
korea under the new government policy the officials said 
they said direct trade between the two koreas is expected to 
increase as north korea appears to be willing to open its society to 
the outside world the two koreas were divided in 1945 
chung juyung honorary chairman of south koreas giant hyundai 
group has been invited to visit north korea to discuss investment 
and other development projects there

eight years have passed since ronald reagan 
arrived in washington promising many things but with one common 
dominator change 
we may not run this like a quarter mile but were going to run 
it reagan said on his first full day in the job of president 
were going to make some changes if for no other reason than 
that they have to be made the people are waiting for us to do it 
he exits this month that promise kept with his era over and his 
presidency a matter for the historians what can be said of the rest 
of reagans promises on what did he deliver and on what did he 
fail 
there are plenty of partisan opinions the democrats even 
published a book cataloging their view of reagans broken promises 
four years ago when he faced reelection 
reagan swept democrat jimmy carter from office in 1980 with a 
pledge to improve the economy at home and to improve americas 
standing abroad central to this goal was a trio of promises he 
would cut taxes build up the military and balance the budget 
so how is two out of three 
reagan won from the democratic congress a 25 percent reduction in 
federal income tax rates he later engineered a broad rewrite of the 
tax laws that eliminated many deductions in exchange for reduced tax 
rates all in the name of simplification 
yet he supported tax increases too and followed the 1981 tax 
cuts a year later with a 98 billion tax increase 
the nations military defenses grew with infusions of new money 
for sophisticated weapons systems and his administration will be 
remembered for what is often called the reagan military buildup 
it was a buildup in fact that leaves reagans successor with 
crushing demands for more money to continue so much so that the 
ability to prune pentagon wish lists was a central factor in 
presidentelect bushs search for a defense secretary 
but it was the federal budget deficit where reagan clearly 
failed not only did it not go lower it mushroomed the nation it 
turned out could not generate growth as a result of the tax cuts 
sufficient to balance the budget and there were no budget cuts 
sufficient to do the job either 
reagans targets for a balanced federal budget kept getting put 
off he never submitted a balanced budget to congress and the 
annual deficit grew to nearly 200 billion a year before starting to 
head down in his last years 
democrats love to point out that the nations total debt under 
reagan was more than that sustained under all the presidents before 
him federal debt was under a trillion dollars when he took office 
in 1981 today it is more than 26 trillion 
but reagan delivered on much of his economic promise inflation 
abated after an early recession that helped wring spiraling prices 
from the economy growth was steady indeed peace and prosperity 
was a powerful argument for his vice presidents campaign to succeed 
him last fall 
reagan also came into office promising to prune the thickening 
vines of the federal bureaucracy his first official act was to 
impose a freeze on the hiring of most civilian federal employees 
he pledged to eliminate the two cabinetlevel creations of the 
carter administration the education and energy departments both 
survived 
whats more the size of cabinet government grew in his final 
year reagan endorsed then signed into law the creation of the 
department of veterans affairs out of what was the independent 
agency known as the veterans administration 
yet the reagan years were characterized by annual attempts to 
trim government by cutting the federal budget he succeeded in his 
stated goal of reducing the rate by which federal spending grows 
each year 
cries against the reagan budget cuts were an annual 
occurrence domestic programs fell victim 
gone now are many programs that were aimed at helping urban 
america revenue sharing the embattled ceta jobtraining program 
urban development action grants federal housing assistance was cut 
dramatically drawing protests from the nations mayors 
ironically some of these had republican not democratic 
origins revenue sharing stringfree payments to local governments 
was a pet project of richard nixon 
cutting government regulations was another promise reagan brought 
to washington and one he pursued while here 
the airline industry for one has been remade as a result of 
reduced government regulation although the foundation was laid for 
that by the carter administration reagan pulled deregulation levers 
where he could 
the results remain a matter of debate many rules are gone but 
many remain in place too 
reagan had plenty of other aims call them promises or not many 
fell short his plan for new federalism returning food stamps 
to state and local governments and swapping some other welfare 
programs along with the means for paying for them never got off the 
ground 
he kept promises to back vouchers or tax credits that would help 
students attend private schools but he didnt win them from 
congress 
no one expected a perfect record however and in his inaugural 
address eight years ago reagan stated what may have been his 
priority promises 
it is time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government 
back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden 
reagan said these will be our first priorities and on these 
principles there will be no compromise

money how to raise it how to spend it will preoccupy state 
lawmakers as they get down to work in 1989 with every legislature 
trying to squeeze the most out of state tax dollars 
for some it will be a chinese puzzle that nonetheless will have 
to be solved there just isnt enough money coming in to cover 
required outlays most states will be able to make it by sticking to 
fairly tight budgets a lucky few will be able to salt money away or 
give breaks to taxpayers 
bound up in the legislative purse strings are calls to improve 
education including raises for teachers relieve prison 
overcrowding repair highways lower property taxes and spend more 
on human services ranging from fighting drug abuse to cleaning up 
the environment 
there are also nonmoney items aids legislation in virginia 
utah illinois the death penalty in rhode island and kansas 
insurance reform in california new jersey pennsylvania and south 
carolina and government restructuring in mississippi and north 
dakota 
finances loom foremost the national conference of state 
legislatures in a survey released friday of staff analysts in the 
50 legislatures found that more than half said the main fiscal 
issue was obtaining enough revenue to balance state budgets other 
findings showed a broad concern for the soundness of state finances 
we are literally being tugged at from all sides and frankly i 
dont think our resources are able to be stretched much further 
said senate president philip rock of illinois where gov james r 
thompson has campaigned unsuccessfully for an income tax increase 
the past two years 
lawmakers having read voters lips are loath to talk about tax 
increases however the idea is being considered in states with the 
biggest money woes west virginia new york massachusetts arizona 
and louisiana 
west virginia with a budget of only 146 billion may be the 
worst off it will need an additional 290 million in revenue to 
meet bills in the new fiscal year said house finance chairman 
george farley and thats without a newly uncovered loss in 
investments and other setbacks totaling 390 million farley said a 
tax increase of 75 million to 80 million is necessary and a sales 
tax on food abolished in the early 1980s may reappear 
new york and massachusetts saw surpluses from previous years 
quickly turn into deficits 
massachusetts has a projected shortfall of at least 636 million 
in the current 116 billion budget and gov michael s dukakis 
recently proposed laying off 300 managerial employees and other 
spending cuts many believe he will seek an increase in the gasoline 
tax and a cut in capital gains tax deductions 
new york is short by more than 1 billion this year according to 
gov mario cuomo for the fiscal year beginning april 1 cuomo has 
estimated that even with his lesstheninflation budget he will need 
an additional 700 million in revenue and he has already proposed 
increasing sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to raise about 
200 million the third year of a threeyear tax cut could be 
delayed too although cuomo is reluctant to do so 
the richestorags example is not lost on welloff states like 
hawaii kansas idaho utah maryland minnesota nevada oregon 
virginia and wisconsin its real easy to make a tax cut right 
now and we all look good for reelection said hawaii house 
finance committee chairman joseph souki but is that the wisest 
thing 
for the majority of states which fall somewhere in the middle 
there will be hard choices many have balancedbudget requirements 
in their constitutions 
minnesota is in far better shape than it was two years ago and 
gov rudy perpichs biennial budget is expected to be 139 billion 
a 145 percent spending increase that would be achieved without 
raising taxes but even so its a very very very very tight 
budget he said i mean tight budget some of the favorites 
that ive been very supportive of be it the arts tourism its 
just not there this time 
educational spending ranks high on most states lists 
education and economic development go together said max coll 
chairman of new mexicos house appropriations and finance committee 
who is going to relocate or expand in a state that doesnt offer a 
really good education system at both the public school and higher 
education levels 
even after budgets are settled lawmakers wont lack items to 
debate rising auto insurance rates are expected to come under 
scrutiny in new jersey pennsylvania and south carolina california 
is awaiting the results of a court challenge to proposition 103 a 
citizens initiative passed in november that requires a 20 percent 
rate rollback for most kinds of insurance 
there may be an effort to repeal illinois yearold requirement 
for premarital testing for exposure to the aids virus in utah 
there are bills calling for mandatory reporting of people who test 
positive for the virus mandatory testing of inmates and a 
strengthening of laws to protect the privacy of aids patients 
virginias general assembly also will consider bills requiring aids 
tests for sexcrime suspects and making it a felony to knowingly 
donate or sell aidstainted blood

hugs and tears marked the reopening of the 
riverhouse restaurant where a customer a waitress and a gunman who 
held 20 people hostage were shot to death four days earlier 
all but three of the 35 employees showed up to greet customers 
saturday night at the restaurant after waitress sally mills and 
customer fenton crookshank were killed in the bloody finale to 
tuesday nights siege

copp who has owned the restaurant for two years but the people of 
loveland 35 miles northwest of denver held true to the citys name 
and showered the restaurant staff with support 
they have been nonstop in their calls of support copp said 
thats probably one reason that were going on 
the other reason is the strong bond among employees 
copp said his employees met to discuss their emotions after the 
ordeal and decided to get back to work 
investigators say the gunman wayne strozzi apparently went 
berserk after his estranged wife refused to go back to him police 
say strozzi then ambushed two law enforcment officers wounding one 
before running into the restaurant and taking some 20 people hostage 
tuesday night 
the siege ended when police shot strozzi who then apparently 
killed ms mills as he lay dying crookshank was accidentally killed 
by police as he tried to escape through a window 
when the restaurants doors reopened saturday there were a few 
hugs and a few tears as the regulars came in first the phone rang 
and rang 
copp who said he was nervous about what to expect from the 
customers relaxed as the seafood and steaks started arriving at 
tables 
as he rang up his first sale saturday at the cash register where 
strozzi took his first hostage tuesday copp said it was like 
starting over again 
i feel like were opening up for the first time copp said

and commissions into about 15 departments but the plan has met with 
a cool response 
missouri finding a way to improve the states higher education 
system and stepping up the war on drugs will be the two dominant 
issues the state has a balanced budget requirement but revenues

the costs of courtordered desegregation and medicaid spending 
montana the state must fashion a new system of funding public 
elementary and secondary schools to replace a method that was 
declared unconstitutional last year the budget now before lawmakers

million surplus at the end of the fiscal year 
nevada adoption of a budget for the coming two fiscal years

will occupy legislators althought nevada has a projected surplus 
it is one of the fastestgrowing states in the nation demands for 
expanded services already have produced state agency spending 
requests that would erase the surplus 
new hampshire the big question is whether to create a public 
energy authority with the power to take over public service company 
of new hampshire and thereby keep electric rates under state 
regulation public service filed chapter 11 last year and in its 
reorganization plan seeks to reform under federal regulation that 
would allow it to bypass a state law barring it from passing along 
costs of its stalled seabrook nuclear power plant to utility 
customers 
new jersey rising auto insurance rates and ocean pollution are 
expected to dominate debate after new jersey suffered a second 
consecutive summer of beach closings because of high bacteria levels 
and medical waste washing ashore the legislature passed a series of 
measures to help clean up the states ocean waters however 
proposals to track the disposal of medical waste impose tougher 
penalties on polluters and create a powerful commission to protect 
its coastline remain mired in legislative disputes

plo chief yasser arafat said sunday the 
bombing of a pan am jet last month was aimed at sabotaging middle 
east peace efforts but he said he did not know who was to blame 
we consider that the crime of bombing the pan american jet is 
one of these efforts to abort the peace efforts arafat told a 
news conference in the jordanian capital 
i dont have information that allows me to accuse anybody 
because the thing is still under investigation he said 
the new yorkbound jetliner blew up dec 21 over the town of 
lockerbie in scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others 
on the ground 
arafat noted that during a news conference in geneva in december 
he had warned there would be a lot of efforts by mossad israels 
intelligence agency and other antagonistic organizations to carry 
out operations in order to abort all the peace efforts in the middle 
east 
during that news conference arafat said he recognized israels 
right to exist and renounced terrorism triggering a us decision 
to end a 13year ban on talks with the palestine liberation 
organization 
hardline palestinian factions attacked arafats acceptance of 
israel and israeli leaders denounced washingtons decision to talk 
with the plo 
arafat also claimed sunday he had accurate information of 
proposals of terrorist operations by israel inside and outside the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
arafat said he knew that israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir has accepted these proposals 
he did not offer details but claimed israel has drawn up a war 
scenario aimed at carrying out aggression against the 
palestinian presence in lebanon 
arafat denounced suggestions by shamir and israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens for elections and limited autonomy for 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza occupied by israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
i am not responsible for the sick dreams of shamir and arens 
he said they are talking in prehistoric terms 
he noted that the proposals are based on the 1978 camp david 
agreement between israel and egypt and that egypt has said the 
portion of the pact dealing with the palestinians is dead egypt 
accused israel of reneging on the usbrokered pact 
despite the us decision to talk with the plo israeli leaders 
have insisted they will never do so shamir also rejects arab 
proposals for a unsponsored international conference leading to a 
palestinian state 
asked about a possible truce in the 13month palestinian uprising 
suggested by mayor elias freij of the west bank town of bethlehem 
arafat noted that brother elias freij has retreated on the 
suggestion because he realized the israelis are not intending to 
take a step forward in order to attain peace in the middle east 
arafat earlier had been quoted as saying anyone trying to stop 
the uprising exposes himself to the bullets of our people 
arafat aides denied the statement had been meant as a threat to 
freij 
arafat wore his trademark checked arab headdress and khaki 
military uniform during the session at jordans official guest house 
on his third day in amman 
he said his talks with king hussein had covered efforts to reach 
peace with israel the new plo dialogue with the united states and 
efforts to convene an arab summit as soon as possible 
he thanked hussein for permitting the plo to upgrade its mission 
in the country to an embassy arafat raised the plo flag in front of 
the building saturday

congressional supporters of the ban on smoking 
on most airline flights are moving to try to make the restrictions 
permanent heralding a replay of the 1987 battle that pitted tobacco 
interests against health groups 
supporters of the prohibition who fought a longodds campaign 
two years ago will be loaded with ammunition this time around 
government statistics show that there have been few problems 
connected with the restrictions officials from the airline industry 
which had opposed the legislation and the flight attendants 
unions say the ban has mostly worked out just fine and supporters 
in congress say they believe the public is pleased with the rules 
whenever im introduced at speaking engagements and its 
pointed out that im the senate author of the smoking ban its an 
applause line said sen frank lautenberg dnj a sponsor of 
the bill in 1987 it goes over better than my jokes 
reps dick durbin dill and bill young rfla authors of 
the legislation that became law introduced a bill last tuesday 
the first day of the 101st congress that would make permanent the 
current prohibition on flights of two hours or less 
the measure has already attracted 50 cosponsors and other bills 
that would prohibit smoking on all routes are likely to follow 
without an extension the ban which took effect last april 
would expire in april 1990 
the lawmakers want to move on the extension this year because 
their best chance for success may be to attach their legislation to 
spending bills which are passed late in the year waiting until 
1990 may be too late 
tobacco industry officials say that as they did in 1987 they 
will oppose the smoking ban 
the system of separating smokers from nonsmokers worked and 
there was no need to do what they did said gary miller a 
spokesman for the washingtonbased tobacco institute the industrys 
trade group 
miller said there is no evidence that the 33 billionayear 
cigarette industry has lost sales because of the airline smoking 
restrictions which affect fourfifths of domestic flights 
cigarette sales have declined by about 2 percent annually for about 
six years a drop attributed to general attitudes about smoking he 
said 
at least one original opponent of the ban now concedes that the 
system has worked the airline industry which initially feared that 
enforcing the restrictions would cause problems for flight crews 
says the crews simply refer disruptive situations to local 
authorities 
none of the horror stories people anticipated have 
materialized said spokeswoman leslie rowland of the air transport 
association the washington office that represents the nations 
airlines its worked pretty well 
in november the federal aviation administration told congress 
that in the first 10 weeks of the laws existence investigations 
were launched of 18 incidents in which passengers allegedly violated 
the ban 
eight of the 18 actions involved southwest airlines a 
dallasbased carrier serving the western united states southwest 
spokeswoman charlotte goddard said the airline has an unusually high 
proportion of shorthaul flights so that the smoking ban applies to 
more than 90 percent of its routes 
its worked well for us she said of the restrictions 
both rowland and goddard said industry officials have noticed 
that smoking has increased at gates immediately before takeoffs 
forcing many carriers to set up more nonsmoking areas and to 
provide more ashtrays 
the largest union representing airline flight attendants also 
says the ban has been a success spokeswoman cindy yeast of the 
association of flight attendants an original supporter of the 1987 
law says the public has accepted the restrictions 
flight attendants are finding its relatively easy to 
enforce she said once they remind people that its not a 
smoking flight thats usually the end of it 
people caught violating the ban can be fined up to 1000 in 
addition they could face 2000 fines if they have tampered with a 
smoke detector in a planes bathroom considered the most dangerous 
place for an aircraft fire because of waste paper

three former drug agents accused of dealing 
cocaine and money laundering possibly were seduced by the glamorous 
hollywood lifestyle and the large sums of money to be made from 
southern californias growing drug trade officials said 
the alleged conspiracy among the three men part of a 150agent 
drug enforcement administration contingent assigned to the los 
angeles area worries officials because cases of multipleagent 
corruption are rare 
but it apparently was isolated despite increasing temptations in 
the region assistant us attorney joyce karlin said 
three bad apples out of the whole force is no embarrassment 
ms karlin said you could offer any of the dea agents ive worked 
with 1 million or 10 million to sell out and they would just laugh 
in your face 
the probe of alleged corruption by the trio of agents charged 
with tax evasion is widening into allegations of heroin and cash 
thefts from a dea vault and cocaine trafficking ms karlin said 
former agents john jackson darnell garcia and wayne countryman 
already indicted for tax fraud in an alleged conspiracy to launder 
608000 through swiss banks will face new charges including 
cocaine trafficking by the end of january ms karlin said 
officials have given few details on what the men are accused of 
doing internal revenue service agent john anderson said there was 
evidence the three were involved in money laundering and narcotics 
trafficking during and following their employment all three had 
left the drug agency before the indictments were handed up 
defense lawyers have said the dea and us attorneys office are 
smearing their clients with condemnations leaked to the news media 
and have alleged racism in the investigation against the agents who 
are all black 
attorneys for all three declined requests to be interviewed by 
the associated press 
the west coast scandal uncovered by internal agency reviews came 
during beefedup dea efforts in south florida that led many drug 
smugglers to use southern california as an alternative point of 
entry 
the high cost of living frustrations over increasing work 
pressures gambling and the alluring hollywood lifestyle were 
blamed as possible causes for the alleged corruption 
people get disgruntled with the system they get disgruntled 
with the work or maybe they just get burned out said ms karlin 
who is prosecuting the case 
the alleged tax evasion conspiracy began in 1984 and other 
alleged wrongdoing occurred during the same period when the west 
coast experienced an influx of drug smuggling she said 
maybe theres something about the glitzy la lifestyle like 
miami that attracts the corruptible things like the abundance of 
mercedes jaguars bmws pricey shops fancy restaurants and luxury 
homes she said 
the average dea agent earns between 30000 to 40000 a year 
ms karlin said 
the case is significant because it involves allegations the three 
agents worked together she said 
jackson 39 was being held without bail because he was deemed a 
risk to flee or pressure witnesses in the case ms karlin said 
countryman 45 was freed on 120000 bail garcia 42 eluded 
agents following him just hours before his planned arrest and 
remains a fugitive 
jackson and countryman both pleaded not guilty when they were 
arraigned in us district court on dec 19 
the three indicted agents also are being investigated in 
connection with the disappearances of heroin and cash from a dea 
vault in late 1984 and early 1985 office spokesman agent ralph 
lochridge said 
john zeinter dea agent in charge of the los angeles office 
refused to reveal how much heroin and cash were missing until the 
additional charges were filed by federal prosecutors 
but published reports said up to five pounds of heroin worth an 
estimated 75 million and nearly 100000 in cash vanished in at 
least three separate thefts 
agencywide figures on past corruption convictions of dea agents 
were unavailable dea spokesman bill deac said the last los angeles 
agent convicted in a drug case was george hoelker who was found 
guilty five years ago of conspiring to sell about five pounds of 
cocaine 
gerald caiden a professor at the university of southern 
california who specializes in law enforcement corruption said the 
problem is growing nationwide 
this case is only symptomatic of wider corruption and a general 
decline in public morality in last 30 years anything goes as long 
as you dont get caught caiden said 
each of the three agents told colleagues of outside business 
endeavors which are now banned by the dea lochridge said 
for example jackson reportedly explained his mercedesbenz 
sports car and sometimes heavy gambling losses during allnight 
poker games by saying he used money made from operating an amway 
franchise

kenyas population of black rhinoceroses 
prized by poachers for their unusual horns is on the increase the 
minister of tourism and wildlife said in an interview published 
sunday 
george muhoho was quoted by the sunday nation as saying a new 
survey has shown the number of black rhinos in four special reserves 
at slightly more than 600 about 100 more than the government 
estimated a year ago 
the minister attributed the higher figure to improved survey 
techniques stiffer antipoaching measures and better breeding 
conditions in the rhino sanctuaries the lake nakuru nairobi 
amboseli and aberdares national parks 
a single rhino horn actually a spiked tuft of hair can fetch up 
to 24000 in the far east where it is used for medicinal purposes 
and in the middle east where the horns are prized as ornamental 
handles for daggers 
private wildlife conservation experts have generally placed the 
number of rhinos in this east africa nation at well below government 
estimates but muhoho said the new survey indicates the situation 
is not as desperate as some people have tended to make it sound 
in the early 1970s there were thought to be 60000 black rhinos 
in africa most private estimates put the figure at around 3000 
today 
concerned about mounting assaults on wildlife the government 
issued shoot to kill orders to law enforcement officers late last 
year since then at least 12 poachers have been killed and dozens 
arrested in the crackdown

the federal government is spending more than 
800 million a year on irrigation subsidies for western farmers who 
grow crops already in surplus according to a congressional study 
administration officials acknowledge such subsidies exist but 
say they are a fourth a large as reported by a house subcommittee 
staff study and stem from agreements that are 20 or 30 years old 
the farmers in question are receiving water subsidies from the 
bureau of reclamation to help irrigate part of their land to grow 
surplus crops while receiving us department of agriculture money 
not to grow the same crops on other sections of their land said 
rep sam gejdenson dconn 
farmers must choose their subsidy said gejdenson who issued 
the report if they choose to continue to receive irrigation water 
at the subsidized rate they should not receive usda commodity 
benefits if they choose to receive usda commodity benefits they 
should have to pay the full unsubsidized cost of providing 
irrigation water to their farms 
gejdenson chairman of the house interior and insular affairs 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations is urging 
presidentelect bush to eliminate the double subsidies as a way 
to help reduce the budget deficit 
double subsidies increase the cost of the usda commodity 
programs place farmers who do not receive federal irrigation 
water at a disadvantage in the marketplace and make it more 
difficult for congress to approve administration requests for new 
and expanded water projects gejdenson wrote in a letter to bush 
but interior department officials who dismiss the subcommittees 
estimates as heavily inflated said the governments nointerest 
contracts with farmers for the irrigation programs would be 
difficult and costly to change 
most of our projects were built 20 to 30 years ago said 
mitch snow deputy assistant secretary for water and science we 
cannot go back in there and fiddle with the contracts unilaterally 
it would probably cost more to implement than it would result 
in savings he said we dont see that as beneficial 
the subcommittee report estimates that the interior departments 
bureau of reclamation provides 22 billion annually in irrigation 
subsidies and that 830 million of that goes to farmers who receive 
usda surplus subsidies 
interior officials estimate the annual irrigation subsidy at 534 
million including an estimated 203 million to farms growing 
surplus crops both estimates are less than onequarter of the 
subcommittee figures 
administration officials say the discrepancies stem from 
differences in calculating interest rates and whether the cost of 
building dams and canals should be included in the subsidy 
estimates the interior department estimates do not include those 
costs 
were dealing in numbers snow said you can get 52 
economists in a room and come up with 110 answers all of which are 
defensible 
but the subcommittee in its harshly worded report charged that 
the department purposely underestimated the estimates and later 
interfered with the subcommittees investigation by withholding key 
irrigation subsidy documents 
the departments official estimates of the irrigation subsidy 
have no basis in reality and are politically motivated the report 
said 
peter yeo a subcommittee aide said if every member of 
congress knew what these irrigation subsidies were costing the 
federal government the political will for constructing or expanding 
irrigation projects would be significantly less 
snow denied the charges saying that the interior department 
cooperated fully with gejdenson and that the differences in 
estimates were legitimate discrepancies among economists

the stars of the us fashion industry 
unabashed by disclosure that nancy reagan borrowed much of her 
highpriced wardrobe while living at the white house are honoring 
her for outstanding contributions to fashion 
critics of the first ladys borrowing habits argue the practice 
amounted to providing free advertising for the designers whose 
clothes she wore 
at a lavish dinner monday at new york citys metropolitan museum 
of art mrs reagan is receiving the industrys equivalent of the 
oscar the lifetime achievement award from the council of fashion 
designers of america 
mrs reagans award is one of 10 bestowed by the group and will 
be presented by abc correspondent barbara walters 
the council which is composed of many of the key fashion 
designers in the country such as calvin klein ralph lauren and 
donna karan voted sept 29 to give mrs reagan the award 
oscar de la renta president of the council said it recognizes 
the outstanding contributions she had made to american fashion 
during the past eight years as first lady she has supported our 
industry with grace and dignity and has represented our country both 
here and abroad with great style 
carolyn gottfried a public relations executive working on the 
council dinner said the controversy over the first ladys borrowed 
wardrobe was not a problem for the designers 
they are very supportive of her she said pointing to de la 
rentas statement as typical of the feeling many in the industry 
have for the first lady 
no its not a problem otherwise they wouldnt be giving her 
this award she said 
the group was founded in 1962 as a nonprofit institution to help 
promote american fashion proceeds from the awards dinner will be 
donated to the costume institute at the metropolitan ms gottfried 
said 
mrs reagan has refused to speak at length about her practice 
first reported in time magazine in october of borrowing expensive 
designer gowns and jewelry without making any reports on her 
husbands annual financial disclosure forms 
the magazine quoted one los angeles designer david hayes as 
saying hed made some 60 to 80 madetoorder outfits available to 
the first lady over the years she returned more than half and had 
kept the others the report said 
at the time of the report the first ladys spokeswoman elaine 
crispen acknowledged that mrs reagan had broke her little 
promise to stop accepting items lent her by leading couturiers 
when the practice first came into question in 1982 it was 
decided that mrs reagans transactions would be reported on 
president reagans financial disclosure form the first lady also 
vowed at the time to discontinue accepting the designer clothing 
but the office of government ethics has since reaffirmed a 1982 
decision that such disclosures were not required under the ethics in 
government act the ethics law requires reporting by an officials 
or by the officials spouse of any loans in excess of 10000 in 
any year 
some of the gowns and clothing lent the first lady would carry 
thousanddollar price tags if purchased at full price from a fashion 
house 
after the disclosure white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reagan considered the report a cheap political shot against the 
first lady

the two dukes michael dukakis and george 
deukmejian are retiring at the end of their current terms and 
their abrupt decisions are focusing attention on the gubernatorial 
races that will be a critical political battleground the next two 
years 
both men surprised observers by their timing if not their 
decisions neither was expected to opt for lame duck status this far 
ahead of the 1990 campaign 
this will be my last term as governor of massachusetts 
dukakis told a news conference on tuesday the 1988 democratic 
presidential nominee pointedly refused to rule out another run for 
the white house in 1992 
i did not come to public office to set some record of 
longevity said deukmejian two days later in ruling out a run for 
a third term as governor of california 
of the 10 largest states new jersey elects its governor this 
year and the other nine do so in 1990 in five of those states 
california texas ohio massachusetts and new jersey the 
incumbent governor will not be seeking reelection 
gubernatorial elections are of special political interest the 
next two years because those contests will have a major impact in 
determining which party controls the redrawing of congressional 
district lines after the 1990 census 
twentyeight of the nations 50 governors are democrats of the 
36 races in 1990 democrats will be defending 20 governorships 
republicans 16 
in california for example democrats control the legislature if 
they capture the governors office as well they will be in a 
position to repeat their post1980 census triumph when they picked 
up five seats in the states congressional delegation 
the only republican other than deukmejian to hold statewide 
office in california is sen pete wilson and there is speculation he 
might run for governor in 1990 an office he sought unsuccessfully 
in the past 
attorney general john van de kamp is regarded as the frontrunner 
for the democratic nomination for governor but former san francisco 
mayor diane feinstein also is exploring a possible candidacy 
on the republican side peter ueberroth leaving his post as 
major league baseball commissioner on april 1 is the best known 
potential candidate other than wilson 
dukakis decision coupled with the announcement two days later 
by boston mayor ray flynn that he wouldnt run for governor offered 
republicans hope in a state where they rarely have any reason for 
optimism 
andrew card tabbed for a top white house post in the bush 
administration might reconsider and return to massachusetts 
another gop name mentioned is former assistant us attorney general 
william weld 
but the strongest names in the early speculation still are on the 
democratic side including rep joseph kennedy lt gov evelyn 
murphy and former attorney general francis bellotti 
the two 1989 governors races are in new jersey and virginia where 
the incumbents a democrat in virginia and a republican in new 
jersey are ineligible for reelection 
lt gov doug wilder is the oddson favorite for the democratic 
nomination in virginia while former sen paul trible rep stanford 
parris and marshall coleman are the best known gop candidates 
big fields are forming in new jersey for the race to succeed 
thomas kean 
the other 1990 races without incumbents are in texas where gop 
gov william clements has said he wont seek another term and in 
ohio where democratic gov richard celeste cannot seek a third term 
a big name looking at the governors race in texas is george bush 
jr son of the presidentelect 
in the other big states democratic gov mario cuomo of new york 
reelected with 65 percent of the vote in 1986 has said he expects 
to seek a third term another democrat james blanchard of michigan 
drew 68 percent of the vote in 1986 and also is considered a likely 
candidate for a third term 
republicans dont rule out upsetting firstterm democrat robert 
casey in pennsylvania but concede theyd need a particularly strong 
candidate to oust him if he doesnt stumble politically 
the nations senior governor is republican jim thompson of 
illinois now in his fourth term will he seek a fifth nobody 
knows a lot of republicans were hoping hed get a big job in the 
bush administration and move to washington democrats always start 
out optimistic against thompson but hes still in office 
in florida gop gov bob martinez is expected to seek a second 
term and appears to have made a partial recovery from a rocky start 
when he ran into a firestorm of criticism for backing a services tax 
increase soon after taking office and then calling for its repeal 
after businesses protested 
democrat buddy mackay a former congressman who lost a close 
senate race in 1988 while george bush was carrying florida by a 
landslide is reported considering challenging martinez

a peregrine falcon who decided to hang 
out on a skyscraper picked an appropriate one the home of the 
state fish and game department 
office workers in the 17story government office building 
building have dubbed the bird that perches on a rooftop railing 
claudette because of its deadly claws which it uses to snatch 
prey 
peregrine falcons which are considered the worlds 
fastestmoving predatory species are an endangered species 
since claudette has a band around its ankle it was born in 
captivity and then released probably by wildlife experts who have 
been trying to increase the number of peregrines mating in their 
natural habitat 
david dick of the fish and game department said it is unusual but 
not unheard of for peregrine falcons to live in urban settings 
the number of peregrine falcons fell drastically in the 1960s and 
early 70s because of the use of the insecticide ddt which weakened 
the eggshells of the birds

iranianbacked shiite moslems captured five 
key south lebanon villages from prosyrian rivals in bloody 
handtohand fighting sunday and seized control of a key area 
bordering israels security zone police said 
a top commander from the prosyrian amal militia mohammed 
hammoud and his brother ahmed were killed in a dawn raid on their 
home by hezbollah fighters loyal to iran said a police spokesman 
who cannot be identified under standing rules 
the palestine liberation organization offered to deploy fighters 
to separate the warring shiites but there was no immediate response 
from either side 
at least 35 people were killed and 66 wounded in housetohouse 
combat in kfar hatta kfar melki kfar beit kfar filla and jbaa 
villages in the former applegrowing district of iklim eltuffah 
the spokesman said 
that increased the overall casualty toll to 60 killed and 149 
wounded since fighting erupted on new years eve in beirut and south 
lebanon between hezbollah or party of god and amal arabic for 
hope 
several hundred masked hezbollah fighters hurling grenades 
seized the villages strung along the main road from sidon in a 
fourhour battle 
in a counterattack shortly before sundown about 500 amal 
fighters rushed in from other districts of south lebanon succeeded 
in recapturing kfar hatta police said they gave no other details 
the police spokesman said the hammoud brothers died in their beds 
during a grenade attack on the family residence in the kfar melki 
village 
five other amal militiamen manning a checkpoint in the same 
village were captured and summarily executed by a hezbollah 
firing squad he said 
a hospital spokesman in sidon 25 miles from beirut and the 
provincial capital of south lebanon said the police casualty 
estimate probably was too low 
some of the corpses brought in earlier were headless which 
indicates the ferocity of the battle he added speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
rescuers are now leaving the dead on the battlefield theyre 
just bringing in the wounded some of whom died on the way to 
hospital 
six rescuers three from lebanons red cross and three from the 
civil defense department along with a policeman were wounded by 
crossfire in kfar melki and kfar hatta 
the rival militias are fighting for mastery of lebanons 1 
millionstrong shiite community the countrys largest sect 
hezbollah seeks to set up an islamic state in south lebanon the 
more secular amal loyal to syria rejects irans religious 
influence over the shiites 
in moslemcontrolled west beirut syrian troops from a 
pecekeeping force sent patrols to halt intershiite clashes in the 
noweiri and bourj abu haidar residential districts police said no 
casualties were reported 
the village seizures left hezbollah poised to attack the market 
town of nabatiyeh the biggest shiite urban center held by amal 
lying just north of the security zone that israel carved out for 
itself in 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its troops from lebanon 
if nabatiyeh falls to hezbollah the fundamentalists will be in 
control of most of south lebanons inland territory the police 
spokesman said 
capturing the town also would enable the proiranian militia to 
link the south with their main stronghold in the eastern bekaa 
valley and trap the amal fighters along the mediterranean coast the 
spokesman said 
the killing of the hammoud brothers was the second serious loss 
in the amal leadership in recent months on sept 22 daoud daoud 
the militias commander in the south and two other senior amal 
commanders were assassinated in south beirut 
amals chief nabih berri accused hezbollah of staging the 
killings 
in sidon yasser arafats representative said plo fighters were 
ready to help stop the fighting 
i appeal to brethren in amal and hezbollah to respond to this 
initiative especially since the israeli army is preparing a 
largescale aggression on south lebanon the representative zeid 
wahbeh said 
the plo which has ties with hezbollah last month reached a 
peace pact with amal to end years of fighting over control of 
palestinian refugee camps in beirut and south lebanon

secretary of state george p shultz said sunday the 
soviet union promised to look into us allegations that libya has 
built a factory to manufacture chemical weapons 
shultz said he outlined the us case and offered a description 
of the plant to soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze at a 
meeting in paris where an international conference on chemical 
weapons opened saturday 
based on this general flow of evidence shultz said 
shevardnadze pledged the soviets would make their own inquiry 
since he cares about the subject and the soviet union cares 
about the subject there is no doubt the questions to libya will 
be pointed shultz told reporters just before leaving paris 
i think that is a constructive response he added 
libya has denied the us claim and said the facility 60 miles 
southwest of tripoli is intended to produce pharmaceuticals 
earlier in a speech to the conference shevardnadze announced 
his government will begin destroying its stockpile of chemical 
weapons this year shevardnadze did not comment to reporters after 
his meeting with shultz 
shultz said the soviets were given a statement of us concern 
over the plant during the visit to new york last month of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev but in the meeting sunday with 
shevardnadze they heard a little more about it shultz said 
he said the us goal is to prevent the plant which the state 
department has said was on the verge of producing chemical weapons 
from achieving production of poison gas if we can succeed in 
that well feel gratified he said 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi often has turned to the soviets for 
support when his country was the target of us condemnation but in 
this case shultz said the soviets share the us aversion to 
chemical weapons 
he said he believed the soviets ultimately would back the united 
states on the issue 
shultz sidestepped shevardnadzes statements that the soviet 
union had never transferred poison gas to other countries 
i put that in terms of a pledge and i take it that way 
shultz said 
in the past the united states has alleged sovietbacked forces 
in afghanistan used chemical weapons against usarmed rebels 
shultz reminded reporters that presidentelect george bush had 
proposed outlawing possession of chemical weapons five years ago at 
a 40nation disarmament conference in geneva 
shultz and shevardnadze also signed two accords on drug 
trafficking and on scientific cooperation and toasted each other 
with champagne afterward 
the two countries are to share information on suspected drug 
traffickers and methods of intercepting drugs they also agreed to 
cooperate in scientific research including an exchange of experts

when amelia earhart was 7 years old she 
recruited her younger sister muriel to help build a wooden 
rollercoaster in their backyard in atchison kan 
a couple of years later when amelia developed a keen interest in 
hunting rats in their grandparents barn muriel was the future 
aviators eager sidekick armed with bb gun and 22caliber rifle 
muriel first went up in a plane soon after her sister bought one 
at the age of 24 
more than half a century has passed since amelia earhart vanished 
over the pacific attempting to become the first woman to fly around 
the world muriel morrissey now 89 and a retired schoolteacher 
still reveres and promotes the memory of her big sister 
the pain of her sisters loss has faded little from the day she 
learned of the disaster july 2 1937 
of course its hard to lose a sister she said and its 
renewed every time when they have some of these crazy stories that 
are bandied about once in a while 
she was referring to occasional speculation that earhart wasnt 
lost at sea but was captured by the japanese or executed as a spy 
i guess its because people just wont accept the natural 
solution that she was low on fuel and crashed into the ocean and 
thats it it was a tragedy of the sea she said 
the sisters born 2 years apart were nurtured by parents who 
anticipated feminism their mother who climbed pikes peak in 
colorado as a girl designed trousers for them so they could play 
unhindered by the long skirts then worn by most young ladies their 
father a railroad lawyer whose alcoholism complicated the familys 
uneven fortunes encouraged their tomboy zeal 
muriel came to this old boston suburb in 1925 to teach she 
married manufacturing executive h albert morrissey who died in 
1978 and had two children 
most of the time i was not as ambitious and as adventurous 
said mrs morrissey tall and slender like her sister amelia had 
her planes and i had my children that was the difference 
the worlds lasting fascination with her flying sister mrs 
morrissey believes is largely due to earharts straightforward 
personality there was no commercialism amelia was herself she 
said 
mrs morrisseys home is a kind of shrine to amelia beside the 
bed is a tiny pink airplane on a key ring a golden toy plane hangs 
in a doorway trophies plaques and parchment testimonials to her 
sister fill shelves 
hanging on the walls are paintings and drawings of amelia 
flashing her wide smile an airplane somewhere in the background 
the earhart sisters settled in the boston area when muriel was at 
harvard university earning a masters degree in education amelia 
took up social work at a settlement house teaching english to 
immigrants but quit social work to write and lecture about her 
aviation feats becoming an early emblem for women wanting the same 
freedom as men 
in 1928 earhart became the first woman to fly the atlantic 
taking the 20 hour 40minute flight to britain as a passenger with 
two male fliers afterward she set more than a dozen speed and 
distance records including flying the atlantic solo in 1932 
becoming the first woman to do so 
in 1931 she married publisher and explorer george putnam she 
was very careful to choose a man who would see that she could fly 
mrs morrissey said 
earhart intended that 27000mile flight around the equator to be 
her last longdistance jaunt when she and her navigator ran low on 
fuel about 100 miles before reaching a speck of land called howland 
island they had clocked 22000 miles 
last january at mrs morrisseys request the federal aviation 
administration retired the registration number of the twinengine 
plane earhart flew on her last flight 16020 
i realize that if knowing about amelia will help one young 
woman accomplish her goal i am glad i did it mrs morrissey said

navy officials reversed the 
courtmartial of a helicopter crewman who complained of safety 
lapses and began disciplinary action against 10 people at the navy 
station where he worked 
the corpus christi naval air stations commander and his 
predecessor are among those targeted 
this says that what i was saying all along was true the 
exonerated whistleblower bryan sims said saturday basically 
the only justice i want to see next is the maintenance practices 
stopped 
sims was convicted in october of lying to superiors disobeying 
orders and losing gear the charges he claimed were trumped up to 
punish him for raising questions about helicopter safety 
sims a 27yearold helicopter crewman and rescue swimmer served 
a 30day detention on the base and his petty officer rank was 
reduced 
but on friday vice adm john disher chief of naval education 
and training dismissed the charges against sims and restored his 
rank with the accompanying pay 
theyve hurt me but ive withstood it sims said saturday 
i guess im stronger than they thought i was he had accused his 
superiors of harassing him since 1986 when he refused to transfer 
crucial untested parts to searchandrescue helicopters from a huey 
helicopter that crashed in 1985 killing three crewmen 
navy regulations forbid recycling of parts without testing 
vice adm vernon smith dishers top assistant apologized to 
sims 
your allegations have substance smith said i regret this 
whole damn thing mr sims 
disher ordered disciplinary hearings for 10 current and former 
base personnel accused of being involved in improper parts 
procurement and maintenance practices at the base operations and 
maintenance department 
navy officials would not identify the individuals but said the 
current commander a former commander and the base maintenance 
officer were among those being charged capt craig l reynolds is 
the current commander 
the base said sunday that reynolds home telephone number would 
be released there was no answer sunday at his office telephone 
sims said saturday that although he didnt want to see anyone 
ruined he believed action should be taken against those 
involved in the alleged maintenance practices he also said he was 
surprised by the number of people the navy is taking action against 
i expected two or three but i didnt expect 10 even though 
its true and needs to be done sims said 
the navy said nine of the individuals including the two base 
commanders have the option of nonjudicial hearings in which they 
would report to a superior for discipline if they dont exercise 
that option they could face a courtmartial a hearing in which a 
military jury hears evidence and renders a verdict 
the maintenance officer the navy said will be subject to a 
special courtmartial on a charge of dereliction of duty

libyan officials on sunday expelled most of 
the foreign journalists who poured into the country after two us 
fighter jets shot down two libyan warplanes over the mediterranean 
sea 
at least 100 journalists most of them american and european 
were put on an afternoon flight to rome however at least 30 others 
stayed on 
the remaining journalists including an associated press 
reporter managed to avoid government officials assigned to keep 
tabs on them libyan officials said they could stay one more night 
the expulsion orders came a few hours after the journalists were 
taken saturday evening to the site at the edge of the desert of a 
plant that the united states claims was built to produce chemical 
weapons 
the journalists were not allowed inside the facility at rabta 60 
miles southwest of tripoli and because it was already dark they 
could see very little from the outside the libyan government 
insists the plant is being constructed to manufacture medicine 
journalists saw a ring of surfacetoair missiles around the 
plant and a radar station a few miles away libyan officials said 
the defenses were put into place after president reagan last month 
said he could not rule out a military strike on the plant 
earlier saturday col moammar gadhafi showed up at the hotel for 
an impromptu news conference in which he called for direct talks 
with the united states to ease tensions us officials later 
rebuffed the offer 
when the journalists were returned saturday evening from their 
tour of the plant grounds libyan officials at the hotel told them 
they had a few minutes to pack their bags for a flight to malta one 
official said the reporters rooms were needed for a delegation that 
was arriving 
information ministry aides assigned to monitor the foreign 
journalists movements told some of them on saturday night they must 
leave immediately on two special planes for malta others heard only 
from their colleagues that they were to be expelled but no one was 
forced out and by midnight it appeared the news corps would be sent 
packing in the morning 
ministry aides refused on sunday to explain the expulsion order 
one aide in the hotel lobby when pressed for a reason walked away 
without a word 
at least 100 journalists were put on two buses for the airport 
for the flight to rome on sunday afternoon some avoided being put 
on the flight by staying in their rooms or leaving the hotel 
those who remained behind were told to check out of their hotel 
rooms and plan to take a charter flight sunday evening to malta 
but the flight never materialized as reporters camera crews and 
photographers milled about the hotel lobby some drank tea coffee 
or other softdrinks in the bar of this country where alcoholic 
beverages are banned 
security guards stood by but took no action finally the 
journalists were allowed to check back into their rooms but were 
told it was for one night only 
on thursday the day after the libyan planes were shot down 30 
foreign journalists who arrived in tripoli on a flight from rome 
were refused entry and after 90 minutes were put back on the next 
flight to italy 
many of those journalists some of them still without a visa 
returned the next day on a flight to rome and were allowed into 
libya without any problem

egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and

of land at the northern tip of the red sea that israel refused to 
return to egypt when it withdrew from the sinai in 1982 
a team of international arbitrators ruled late last year that the 
disputed beach belonged to egypt under a 1979 peace treaty but the 
specific borders still have to be determined by the two sides

nuclear weapons to the middle east israel has never responded 
directly to allegations of its nuclear capacity saying only that it 
will not be the first nation to introduce nuclear weapons into the 
region

emperor hirohitos death engulfed britains royal 
family in a frontpage debate sunday about whether this country 
should send representatives to the japanese monarchs funeral 
many opposition lawmakers and world war ii veterans still regard 
hirohito as an unpunished war criminal they say it will insult 
thousands of british servicemen if official representatives go to 
the burial of the emperor who died saturday at age 87 
about 27000 british war prisoners died at the hands of the 
japanese in world war ii many during forced construction of the 
notorious burma railway 
both prime minister margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth ii sent 
condolence messages saturday that made no mention of the wartime 
enmity and both were expected to send representatives to the feb 
24 funeral 
the queen has asked her son and heir prince charles to 
represent her in tokyo the british broadcasting corp reported 
sunday 
buckingham palace said no decision had been made and the foreign 
office said no government representative had been picked yet 
the royal family already is being criticized for failing to send 
a member to last weeks memorial service in lockerbie scotland for 
victims of the dec 21 pan am crash 
if it wasnt good enough for them to come to the lockerbie 
service i dont see why they should go all that distance out there 
for a service for somebody that treated our servicemen in such a 
way that people suffered for years said jim campbell chairman of 
the midannandale comrades club 
former foreign secretary david owen who now leads the centrist 
social democratic party said the queen should send charles or her 
daughter princess anne as a goodwill gesture 
the problem is the royal family has got themselves in a slight 
mess he told britains commercial tvam not attending the 
lockerbie funeral was wrong and has caused understandable anguish 
and criticism 
the debate was frontpage news in most london newspapers 
royal dilemma over hirohito was the headline in both the 
sunday times and sunday express which added after lockerbie 
memorial row who will honor japans dead emperor 
freddie tompkins spokesman for the 17000member burma star 
association said he was absolutely flabbergasted by suggestions 
prince charles might attend the funeral 
this man was a monster and should have been tried as a war 
criminal he said of hirohito 
ted leadbitter an opposition labor party legislator who served 
as an artillery officer during the war said it would be quite 
hypocritical after what happened with all the atrocities the 
torture the bloodshed and misery that our people went through for 
us to attend that funeral 
alan amos a governing conservative party legislator spoke of 
the bitterness of prisoners relatives 
it is deeply insensitive and outrageous that messages of 
condolence should be sent in relation to this war criminal he 
said

britain has been convinced since 1987 that libya is 
building a plant to produce chemical weapons and first alerted the 
united states to its concerns 18 months ago the sunday times of 
london reported 
the newspaper quoting what it called wellplaced sources said a 
long and intensive british intelligence operation included detailed 
monitoring of the shipment of materials from european and japanese 
factories to libya 
in a separate investigation following the british tip the 
americans had reached the same conclusion the newspaper said 
britain was the first country to support us allegations that 
libya is building a factory to produce chemical weapons near rabta 
60 miles south of tripoli libya maintains the factory will produce 
pharmaceuticals 
the foreign office said wednesday it had independent information 
about the plants purpose but would not say what it was 
the sunday times quoted unnamed american sources as saying both 
the united states and britain had been trying for more than three 
years to persuade allied governments principally west germany 
italy and japan to stop private firms from supplying libya with raw 
materials and technology required to build the plant 
apart from a degree of japanese cooperation in identifying the 
foreign companies working for libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
the effort failed the newspaper said 
the observer another weekly london newspaper reported that the 
man responsible for building and equipping the libyan plant is dr 
ihsen barbouti an iraqi citizen living in london and operating 
through a string of small firms in several countries 
it said barboutis companies in switzerland west germany and 
libya have been responsible for the civil engineering at the complex 
however it said the observer has no reason to believe that dr 
barbouti was aware of what the us claims to be the purpose of the 
plant but he has declined to be interviewed

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has urged 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to ask iran for a new ideology 
that would replace communism the islamic republic news agency said 
sunday 
the agency monitored in nicosia was reporting the full text of 
a message sent by the ageing revolutionary patriarch to gorbachev 
last week 
i expressly declare that the islamic republic of iran as the 
greatest and most powerful base in the world of islam can easily 
fill the ideological vacuum of your regime the agency quoted the 
message as saying 
khomeinis special envoy ayatollah javadi amoli traveled to 
moscow on friday at the head of a mission to deliver the message to 
gorbachev 
the iranian patriarch praised gorbachev for his decision to allow 
more religious freedom in the soviet union saying this proved he 
had turned his back on communism a bankrupt ideology the 
agency said 
but he warned the soviet leader to avoid the green garden of 
western capitalism 
while there is no such thing as communism in the world anymore 
you must not get caught in the western capitalist snare of the 
great satan the agency said iranians often refer to the united 
states as the great satan 
if you look to western capitalism to solve your problems you 
will not only fail to solve the ills of your society but leaders 
who come after you will have to work to mend your mistakes the 
message said 
khomeini invited gorbachev to send some of his sharpminded 
experts to qom the traditional bastion of shiite islam to study 
the works of moslem ideologues and bring the message of islam back 
to the soviet leader the agency said 
the root of the soviet problem is not the lack of freedoms or 
the communist economy but its long insolent campaign against 
belief in god the agency quoted his message as saying

central american summit would endanger a regional peace plan 
ortega on friday said costa rican president oscar arias proposal 
to delay the jan 1516 summit of central american presidents until 
after presidentelect george bushs inauguration could practically 
kill the peace plan 
arias suggested the delay friday saying it would give bush time 
to formulate a central american policy bush takes office jan 20 
the statement of president ortega is out of line and clumsy 
deputy foreign minister carlos rivera was quoted as saying sunday in 
the san jose newspaper la nacion 
we reject what ortega said because everybody knows that our 
president and our people are the ones most interested in seeking 
peace in our region rivera said 
arias won the nobel peace prize for authoring the peace plan 
signed by the central american presidents in august 1987 
the summit to be held in san salvador is intended to advance 
the stalled peace plan which calls for negotiated solutions to 
civil wars in nicaragua el salvador and guatemala political 
amnesties and democratization 
on saturday ortega said arias proposal is under consultation 
and the meeting definitely has not been suspended ortega said he 
opposed any delay of the summit

the brother of the longestheld american 
hostage in lebanon is spearheading a drive he hopes will direct 
200000 letters to the white house by george bushs inauguration 
jan 20 
the state department has told us they have no mandate on this 
issue they think the people dont care said john anderson an 
ocala resident whose brother terry was kidnapped in beirut almost 
four years ago were out to show them the people do still care 
anderson said he thinks bush will be more responsive to his 
pleadings than president reagan but he doesnt plan to take that 
attitude for granted 
our effort is to be sure he keeps the hostages in mind to 
make it one of his first concerns 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 eight other 
americans taken hostage since then are still being held captive 
his brother said he disagrees with those who speculate that 
attention only makes the hostages more valuable to their kidnappers 
virtually every hostage who has been released has made 
statements that it was because of efforts to keep their names in the 
news he said if the terrorists thought nobody cared theyd 
just kill them this is most definitely an effort to keep them alive 
as well as to get them freed 
john anderson said he and his family are not asking the 
government to deal with the terrorists just open a dialogue and 
release iranian assets frozen in this country 
would it hurt to simply open the lines of communications he 
said were not asking them to trade terry for rifles and 
missiles lets just give them what is theirs and talk to them

christmas trees still sparkle in local homes 
but folks already are stocking up on carnival beads and city work 
crews are building parade stands for one of the earliest mardi gras 
celebrations in years 
were going to be in more of a frenzy than normal if thats 
possible said blaine kern whose company makes most of the 
carnival parade floats well barely have time to breathe this 
year between parades and thats not counting all the balls and 
parties that will go on during the month 
carnival begins on twelfth night jan 6 with various balls and 
parties and ends fat tuesday or mardi gras the day before ash 
wednesday this year with an early easter things got a head start 
because mardi gras falls on feb 7 
the early date leaves barely a month for reveling before lent 
when repentance descends on the city 
the earliest mardi gras dates found in the louisiana almanac on 
a list from 1969 till 2000 is feb 7 this year and in 1978 most 
dates are middle to late february and five times fat tuesday occurs 
during the first few days of march as late as march 7 so you can 
say mardi gras falls this early only twice in the three decade 
period 
about two weeks before mardi gras a series of parades in the 
metropolitan area begin marking countdown before shrove tuesday the 
first of 50 metropolitan parades rolls on jan 21 this year 
we made our deliveries right after christmas i think just 
about everyone had it on the shelves by new years said dom 
carlone of accent annex enterprises inc which specializes in mardi 
gras items such as the colorful beads that are thrown by float 
riders 
work crews began erecting bleachers along city streets dec 19 
and officer asa french special events coordinator for the new 
orleans police department said barricades used to control crowds 
and traffic are being put in place this week 
at haydels bakery carnvial king cakes went on sale before 
christmas david haydel president of the company said bakers turn 
out 2000 to 3000 cakes a day during the height of the party 
season this year they also hope to ship 100000 nationally 
king cakes big donut shaped pastries covered with purple 
green and gold sugar contain a small plastic baby tradition has 
it that the person whose slice has the baby must be the host of the 
next party 
we started out shipping about 75 a day out in 1985 last year 
we shipped 8000 haydel said this year were advertising 
nationally and we expect to sell better than 2 million of our mardi 
gras packages 
even though this years festivities are compressed into a 
shorterthannormal time span local authorities believe carnival 
will see record numbers of people spend millions of dollars 
this is turning out to be one of the best mardi gras in 
history said beverly gianna of the greater new orleans tourist 
commission and what were seeing is that reservations for 
accommodations began coming in much earlier than usual she 
attributed the interest to the exposure the city received last 
summer as host of the republican national convention 
mardi gras is expected to pour more than 2 million into the 
hardpressed local economy 
people just love it gianna said if they have less time 
for it they just go harder during that time

report that cyanide was found at the home of a teenager who has 
been in a coma since eating yogurt laced with poison 
camden county prosecutor samuel asbell and fbi officials in 
newark would not comment on a story in saturdays courierpost of 
cherry hill that quoted unidentified sources as saying cyanide was

search warrants found the cyanide thursday professor lee is 
chairman of the biology department at the camden campus of rutgers 
the state university 
it was not clear whether the cyanide found in the home and 
laboratory were of the same origin nor whether either sample was 
the same form of the chemical ingested by the boy the newspaper 
reported 
asbells spokesman george kerns repeated on sunday that 
attempted suicide was one of three possibilities investigators were 
exploring the others are tampering and attempted homicide 
asbell said saturday that one reason authorities included suicide 
as a possibility was that the cyanide was placed on the top of the 
yogurt rather than mixed into the product 
on sunday kerns would not elaborate on any aspect of the case 
the emphasis in the beginning was on tampering its a wide 
open field now he said 
an fbi official who refused to give his name on sunday referred 
all questions to the agencys media coordinator drucilla wells who 
will be available monday he said 
lee remained in a coma and on life support equipment sunday at

cyanide and investigators have ruled out tampering during the 
manufacturing process

a cattle rancher suspected by 
authorities of ordering the killing of a prominent amazon ecologist 
surrendered to police because he was tired of living on the run 
authorities said sunday 
darly alves da silva who police believe masterminded the 
shooting death of ecologist francisco mendes on saturday walked 
into the police station in the jungle town of xapuri near the 
bolivian border according to mere maia of the acre state security 
department 
mendes 44 led a local rubber tappers union in xapuri where he 
was shot outside his home on dec 22 
the union whose members collect rubbermaking substances from 
the trees often block ranchers efforts to clear rainforest by 
standing in front of bulldozers with family and other community 
members 
da silva is the father of 21yearold darcy pereira da silva who 
has confessed to the killing two other brothers remain in custody 
in connection with the case and another one is sought by police 
the father also was wanted by police in the southeastern state of 
parana in connection with several other murders 
he turned himself in because he said he was tired of living on 
the run antonio gomes campos director of the acre state 
penitentiary system told the associated press by phone from the 
region 
but he said he had no participation in the crime he said he 
heard about the killing and his sons part in the murder through the 
newspapers 
darcy pereira de silva told journalists he shot mendes because he 
forced my father to live on the run from rubber tappers he said 
mendes found out about the earlier warrant for his fathers arrest 
and forced him into hiding 
federal police chief romeu tuma called the shooting of mendes a 
family decision by the da silva clan 
later saturday the elder da silva was taken to the francisco de 
oliveira conde penitentiary in the acre state capital of rio branco 
campos said 
mendes received the 1987 un global 500 award for top 
ecologists he was best known for devising ways to develop the 
amazon without harming the fragile ecosystem 
the issue of how to develop the jungle an expanse of rainforest 
that covers about twothirds of brazilian territory has often led 
to bloody clashes between large landowners and politicians on one 
side and peasant farmers on the other 
since 1980 more than 1000 people have died in such landrelated 
conflicts according to conservative estimates the human rights 
group amnesty international says people were brought to trial in 
only three cases

the soviet union will destroy its massive stockpiles 
of chemical weapons starting this year soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze announced sunday 
secretary of state george p shultz said shevardnadze promised 
him the soviets will also look into us allegations libya has a 
plant to produce chemical weapons 
addressing an international conference on chemical weapons 
shevardnadze said the soviet union is finishing construction of a 
chemical arms elimination facility that will begin operation this 
year 
he said his country would not wait for an accord to be reached at 
geneva talks on chemical weapons before beginning to destroy its 
stockpiles 
american delegates said the soviets were simply playing 
catchup a senior us official said the united states had been 
routinely destroying aging chemical weapons since the early 1980s 
shevardnadze said representatives of other countries will be 
invited to visit the soviet facility but he did not say when 
he said the soviet position had changed quite radically in 
the recent past going from manufacturing chemical weapons to 
abandoning them altogether 
when you get into the facts of the matter it is that we have 
been doing the same kinds of things said lynn hansen director of 
the bureau of multilateral affairs at the us arms control and 
disarmament agency 
the soviet position now corresponds to our own position 
hansen said we simply dont get the press because for us its 
more routine when they do it all of a sudden its news 
the fiveday conference was marked by conflicts involving middle 
eastern countries 
delegates from 16 arab nations said any ban on chemical weapons 
must be accompanied by nuclear disarmament 
iraqi vice premier tarik aziz in a fiery speech sunday to about 
80 foreign ministers among the delegates from 150 nations accused 
israel of posing a serious threat to the security of arab 
nations 
he said israel kept nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons 
and missiles that can reach many arab cities 
israel called the iraqi statement blatant hypocrisy iraq is 
known to have used chemical weapons in its 8year war with iran 
the conference is aimed at giving new political impetus to a 1925 
geneva protocol that prohibits the use of such toxic chemical and 
biological agents 
shevardnadze said the soviet union had stopped production of 
chemical weapons an announcement first made in april 1987 by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
we shall immediately proceed with the elimination of our 
stockpiles of chemical weapons and indeed we shall begin doing 
that even before a convention is concluded shevardnadze told 
delegates 
he did not give dates or make clear if a schedule had been worked 
out 
us officials said they did not yet know whether the soviet 
facility was a pilot plant or one capable of destroying massive 
quantities of weapons 
shevardnadze said representatives of other countries will be 
invited to visit the soviet facility 
addressing the thorny issue of verification a major stumbling 
block for negotiators shevardnadze said a new convention should 
provide for a short notice challenge inspection of any facility 
suspected of manufacturing chemical weapons and that there should 
be no right of refusal of any such inspection 
he said the soviet union supports proposals for enlarged powers 
for the un secretarygeneral to investigate alleged chemical 
weapons use and he proposed setting up an international 
verification agency working under un auspices 
shultz speaking to reporters at a news conference before leaving 
paris said he was pleased shevardnadzes speech had recognized the 
importance of inspection 
but shultz added transferring this principle to workable 
procedures is difficult 
shultz also said he had won a promise from shevardnadze during a 
private meeting to look into us allegations that libya has a plant 
south of its capital tripoli that is intended for the production 
of chemical weapons libya has denied the charge 
the united states and the soviet union are the only two countries 
to admit they have chemical weapons according to us estimates 
about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacture 
chemical weapons 
the soviet union was thought to have started toxic agents after 
world war ii continuing to do so until gorbachevs 1987 
announcement 
the soviet union says it has 50000 tons of chemical arms 
stockpiled while the united states has about 30000 tons however 
both those figures are thought to be largely underestimated 
the soviet foreign minister said his country while possessing 
chemical weapons has never used them has no chemical weapons 
stockpiles outside soviet territory and has never transferred 
chemical weapons to other nations 
he called on all countries to end production of chemical weapons 
the united states halted production of chemical weapons in 1969 
but resumed 18 years later to counter the soviet stockpiling

stateowned automaker renault who was gunned down in front of his 
paris home 
nathalie menigon 31 and joelle aubron 28 are charged with 
murder ms menigons companion jeanmarc rouillan 33 and georges 
cipriani 38 are charged with complicity in the shooting of georges 
besse on nov 17 1986 
if convicted by the special alljudge panel hearing the case the 
four face possible life sentences 
all are considered leaders of the extreme leftist group direct 
action implicated in about 80 attacks between 1979 and 1988 
in letters sent to several news organizations in paris direct 
action on feb 11 1987 claimed responsibility for killing besse a 
later direct action statement said the shootings were not planned 
the four were convicted in february 1988 of criminal association 
and each sentenced to 10 years in prison ms menigon also received 
a 12year sentence for the attempted murder of two policemen on may 
31 1983 
during the february trial defendants shouted at judges joked 
among themselves and refused to answer questions 
for about two months last year the four held a hunger strike

consisted of bombings or shooting at buildings housing french 
government offices and those of other groups like the international 
police organization interpol an israeli bank and the european 
space agency

connection with the slaying of two americans but they are still 
accused of murder a newspaper said sunday 
the americans alberto g radelat of fort worth texas and john 
walker of minneapolis disappeared on jan 30 1985 in

the government announced a series of 
sweeping price increases sunday that the official trade union 
leadership has warned may spawn strikes unless swift wage and social 
reforms are enacted 
the increases in the next five months the first beginning 
monday reflect cuts in subsidies and will cost every consumer an 
average 25 per month or about 10 percent of the average national 
per capita earnings per month 
the government announcement gave no reason for the price rises on 
food drugs autos public transit and other items but it was clear 
from previous official statements that the changes were in part 
aimed at qualifying for more help from the international monetary 
fund in financing the countrys 17 billion foreign debt 
as of monday food prices will rise an average 17 percent state 
secretary bela szikszay president of the national price office was 
reported as saying dairy products will go up 40 percent 
pharmaceuticals will increase 82 percent although drugs for 
treating serious diseases will be decreased or become free he told 
the vasarnapi hirek sunday newspaper car prices are to increase as 
much as 38 percent 
szikszay said food production subsidies will be cut by an 
equivalent 200 million this year which accounts for 40 percent of 
the food price hikes and that the other 60 percent is due to 
increased farming costs 
szikszay vaguely referred to plans for making the wage system 
more flexible so as to reward better performance by higher wages 
the presidium of the central council of hungarian trade unions 
warned friday that the price rises in the first half of this year 
could touch off strikes unless wage hikes and other social measures 
are introduced 
according to the trade union daily nepszava the union leadership 
demanded that funds set free by cutting state subsidies should not 
only be used to reduce the budget deficit but to support those 
hardest hit 
the international monetary fund and the world bank require that 
debtor governments slash price subsidies as a condition for 
obtaining credits or rescheduling debt payments 
last year the warsaw pact country spent over 3 billion on 
servicing its foreign debt including 1 billion on interest 
repayment 
altogether szikszay said this years consumer price index rise 
is to be kept to about 15 percent slightly lower than in 1988 
the government is making compensations for the lowest income 
bracket including a 7 extra payment to pensioners as of jan 1 
this year 
on an average real wages in 1988 were 15 percent lower than ten 
years ago and in fact dropped to the level of 1973 last year the 
central statistical office said in a survey 
the average monthly net wage equals about 130 while the 
government has set the minimum pension at 70

a memorial service for a female whooping crane 
that was shot last week drew about 30 environmentalists who called 
for a campaign to educate the public about endangered species 
the bird was killed last tuesday by a houston hunter who said it 
was accidental it was the first reported shooting of a whooping 
crane in 21 years 
on saturday members of the houston audubon society gathered at 
the edith l moore sanctuary for the service to remember the bird 
and to remind others of the fragile coexistence between man and 
animals said jane scheidler the societys vice president for 
environmental affairs 
she was a wonderful precocious bird said sandi hoover 
audubon executive director 
ms hoover said the bird was unusual because it was only 4 years 
old but had already had a chick while most female whoopers first 
have chicks at age 5 
about 200 whooping cranes exist today and about 130 of them 
roost each winter along the texas gulf coast before conservation 
efforts began there were only 21 whooping cranes wintering in texas 
in 1941 
i think this whooping crane incident is an indication of the 
whole general problem out there said rex wahl a zoologist with 
the texas parks and wildlife departments natural heritage program 
in austin 
for most people theres an unawareness and a lack of 
information it just galls me that somebody doesnt care enough 
to identify what theyre shooting at 
the houston businessman who shot the bird while at the aransas 
national wildlife refuge north of corpus christi said he mistook it 
for a snow goose the whooping crane was flying through heavy fog 
with her mate 
government wildlife officials said they have not decided what 
will happen to the hunter though they say they may seek restitution 
of 4000 to 10000 
but ms scheidler said the man should be forgiven because he 
turned himself in to authorities who then withheld his name

three hundred journalists who shunned a 
union created for them after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown voted to 
seek reinstatement of their old organization a representative said 
sunday 
its the right moment said stefan bratkowski president of 
the former association of polish journalists on the second day of a 
twoday meeting of the journalists in the basement of the 
association of polish authors building 
the journalists on saturday drafted a letter to the warsaw city 
administration asking that the polish journalists association be 
registered because the official union is not fulfilling our 
goals 
several longbanned groups such as the pen writers club have 
recently received permission to function legally as the government 
implements political reforms the freer atmosphere has raised hopes 
that the journalists union might again be accepted 
broadcast and print journalists from around the country attended 
the weekend meeting some of the participants were well known before 
martial law but now work for obscure publications or in completely 
different professions such as construction 
the association of polish journalists dominated by supporters of 
the solidarity trade union was banned along with solidarity in 1982 
and replaced by the promartiallaw association of journalists of 
the polish peoples republic 
at the same time the government mounted a drive to win back 
control of the media by purging from 500 to 1000 journalists 
nationwide for their political sympathies 
some writers who refused to join the new union were barred from 
working at statecontrolled publications others resigned rather 
than submit to new editorial policies 
in recent years officials say the new union has consolidated its 
position and now has nearly 8000 members as many as the old union 
before its dissolution

the soviet union will upgrade the status of the 
israeli consular mission in moscow and view it as an address for 
political activities foreign minister moshe arens said sunday 
the move appeared to be part of a soviet effort to improve 
relations with israel in order to help broker a middle east peace 
plan said arens 
arens said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told 
him during a meeting in paris saturday that moscow will allow our 
delegation to expand the volume and raise the level of its activity 
and to view it as an address for political activities 
i think theres an important progress in it he said in a 
telephone interview from paris with israel army radio arens and 
shevardnadze are in the french capital for an international 
conference on chemical arms 
shevardnadze said on israel television the ministers decided to 
create normal working conditions for our consular groups in tel 
aviv and moscow and to hold personal meetings 
the israeli delegation operates from the dutch embassy building 
in moscow and the soviet one from the finnish embassy in tel aviv 
the soviet union cut diplomatic ties with the israel following 
the 1967 middle east war in which israel captured territories from 
moscows arab allies but relations have improved in the past two 
years 
a wellinformed foreign ministry official told the associated 
press the mandate of the israeli delegation previously banned it 
from holding any political discussions or working from the former 
building of the israeli embassy in moscow which it is now likely to 
do 
the group also had to renew visas every three months a practice 
now expected to be abandoned said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
foreign ministry sources indicated in private conversations the 
israelis may also be permitted to independently process visas for 
soviet jewish emigrants and jews wishing to visit israel 
the soviets have allowed more jews to emigrate to israel and sent 
a lowlevel consular delegation to tel aviv in july 1987 israel was 
allowed to send its own consular group to moscow in july 1988 
arens said israel and the soviet union remain far apart on how to 
resolve middle east conflicts 
mr shevardnadze presented the soviet position about the peace 
process and the plo their stand is totally different from ours 
arens said 
but he added they feel they can contribute to the peace 
process and want to convince us they can together with that or 
maybe because of that they want to build channels of communication 
more systematically 
the soviet union wants a unsponsored peace forum and says the 
palestine liberation organization must participate 
israels prime minister yitzhak shamir head of arens hardline 
likud bloc fears the conference might force israel into territorial 
concessions in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel also refuses to negotiate with the plo which it views as 
a terrorist group 
arens said shevardnadze reiterated the soviet appreciation of the 
israeli rescue and medical aid provided to the victims of the 
earthquake in armenia in december and israels handling of the last 
months plane hijacking affair 
the case involved five soviets who traded hostage children for a 
plane and about 2 million in cash and then flew the jet to israel 
the jewish state returned the hijackers the plane and the money to 
the soviets on dec 3

president mikhail s gorbachev said in a speech 
published sunday the kremlin is besieged by financial problems that 
may require a cut in defense spending and are sapping public faith 
in his reform efforts 
gorbachevs speech to writers editors and artists painted a 
picture of a leadership struggling to solve budget deficits improve 
labor productivity and implement price reforms while consumers blame 
reforms for shortages 
in the speech published in the communist party daily pravda the 
soviet president complained that intellectuals spend too much time 
bickering among themselves 
people are talking about a lack of goods food about queues 
about the housing problem about deficits of services and other 
spheres that touch the everyday lives of people gorbachev said 
and the thing is that the criticism is not just of these 
deficits people directly connect it with perestroika they say that 
so far it has provided nothing socially or economically that in 
many cases the situation even has gotten worse he said 
gorbachev said the kremlins budgetary problems were so acute 
that we will have to look at our expenditures on defense 
preliminary study shows that we can cut defense not 
lessening the level of safety and defense preparedness of the 
government he said 
the soviet leader has said many times in the past that he wants 
to lessen international tension in order to devote more resources to 
his domestic reforms 
on dec 7 gorbachev announced a unilateral cut in soviet 
military forces foreign minister eduard a shervardnadze said 
sunday in paris the soviet union will destroy its stockpiles of 
chemical weapons starting this year 
in contrast to many other pronouncements about perestroika his 
reform program gorbachev directly defended his policies against 
specific complaints 
gorbachevs speech friday and a subsequent questionandanswer 
session with writers scientists artists and editors filled the 
front page of sundays edition of pravda and took up slightly more 
than half of the papers six pages 
gorbachev called budget deficits the gravest heritage of his 
predecessors whom he accused of carefully hiding the deficits 
from society until they were revealed this fall 
the soviet leader gave no names but he has been particularly 
critical of the 18year rule of leonid i brezhnev who died in 1982 
the soviet union passed a 1989 budget last fall that runs 58 
billion in the red and government officials said the budget had 
been out of balance for a decade gorbachev said the situation had 
only worsened during his nearly four years in power 
the government lost 60 billion in income in 19851988 because 
world oil prices fell and lost another 78 billion because of his 
cuts in production and sale of alcoholic beverages gorbachev said 
the chernobyl nuclear power disaster the armenian earthquake and 
the soviet unions involvement in afghanistan also are draining 
large amounts of money he said 
in addition officials have not been able to halt a 20year 
spiral in which wages have risen faster than labor productivity nor 
decide how to reform prices gorbachev said 
he credited his reforms with boosting labor productivity 51 
percent in 1988 many other areas of the economy are improving but 
not fast enough he said 
previous soviet leaders spread too much money over too many 
development projects that have not produced anything gorbachev said 
gorbachev renewed his pledge that price reforms would not lower 
workers standard of living but he added that the problem was so 
difficult that several officials had changed their minds more than 
once in the last few months about how to solve it 
i want to stress that we are far from thinking that everything 
is already clear to us gorbachev said 
but he said it was also wrong to think the kremlin leadership 
does not have a program worked out 
the soviet president defended his policies from critics who he 
said feel nostalgic for the good old days and a firm 
hand an apparent reference to the years of dictator josef stalin 
gorbachev also said a special commission of the ruling communist 
party politburo will finish debate on ethnic unrest in the republics 
of armenia and azerbaijan on jan 11 the work of the commission 
which began in early december was delayed by the dec 7 earthquake 
in armenia

the british midland airways jet that crashed 
sunday in england was one of the first 737400s produced by boeing 
commercial airplanes a boeing spokesman said 
the 737400 was certified by the federal aviation administration 
in september and probably a half dozen or so airlines are flying 
a total of 17 of the new 28 million to 32 million jets boeing 
spokesman jack gamble said sunday 
the belfastbound jetliner which carried 126 people crashed 
near a highway in central england killing at least 32 people

leasing in shannon ireland which leased it to british midland he 
said it is the first accident involving a 737400 or a 737300 
which is 10 feet shorter than the 400 series 
he said the engine used on both 737 models is the cfm56 which 
is built in france by a consortium made up of general electric and 
smecma a french concern 
there have been no problems at all with the 300 or the 400 
he said 
he said the engines are brought to the united states and 
reassembled and tested at a general electric plant near cincinnati 
the completed engines are shipped to the boeing plant at renton

1500 of them are still flying

was in march depending on the interior design the jet can seat 130 
to 150 passengers first deliveries of the jet were in september to 
piedmont airlines 
the 737 is the smallest jetliner made by boeing the first

counsel at belfasts airport on sunday as nervous relatives waited 
anxiously for details of a flight that never arrived 
news that the belfastbound boeing 737400 jet crashed with 126 
people aboard beside a highway in central england brought people 
rushing to aldergrove airport outside the northern ireland capital 
many were unaware which of the frequent shuttles their relatives 
had taken 
some were relieved to find their loved ones had missed illfated 
flight bd92 which took off from londons heathrow airport at 752 
pm 252 pm est 
others waited for news of the survivors a woman sobbed quietly 
in a corner of the shiny new terminal recently opened for 
international traffic after a major refurbishment 
there is a spirit of anxiety and of course a lot of patience is 
being exercised said the rev ian paisley the presbyterian 
minister and a leading politician in the province 
he spoke to relatives at aldergrove a 40minute drive from 
belfast the religious and political violence between roman catholic 
and protestant extremists dictates the strictest airport security in 
britain 
people realize they must just wait and hope and pray their 
loved ones are going to be all right he said in a situation 
like this you always prepare yourself for the worst but the 
relatives are bearing up very well the airline is doing everything 
possible 
jack mcconnell chief executive of northern ireland airports

a jury convicted a teenager of 
seconddegree murder sunday for a shooting spree in a high school 
cafeteria last year that left an assistant principal dead and two 
other adults wounded 
jurors deliberated approximately 8 hours over saturday and 
sunday before finding jason harless 16 guilty of killing richard 
allen 
harless also was convicted on charges for wounding two other 
members of the schools faculty and for shooting at pinellas park 
police officers as he fled the school 
patrick doherty the teenagers defense attorney said he and 
his client were pleased that the jury returned a lesser conviction 
in allens death 
theres a profound difference between murder two and murder 
one he said sunday theres an array of choices that the judge 
can choose for sentencing 
harless faces a maximum punishment of life in prison rather than 
the death penalty that firstdegree murder can carry in florida 
circuit judge claire luten set sentencing for march 10 
harless and a friend jason mccoy ran away from home feb 10 
taking along two 38caliber handguns from a neighbors house they 
went to say goodbye to their friends the next day at pinellas park 
high 
harless admits punching two school administrators pointing a gun 
at one of them and shooting studentteacher joseph bloznalis but he 
says he doesnt remember shooting allen and assistant principal 
nancy blackwelder when they tried to take away a gun from mccoy in 
the school cafeteria 
harless said he regained his memory as he ran from the school 
firing three shots at two pinellas park police officers 
harless had been charged with firstdegree murder two counts of 
attempted firstdegree murder and aggravated battery a charge of 
burglary was dismissed before the case went to the jury saturday 
doherty argued saturday that harless was in a dissociative 
state during the shooting and was not responsible for his actions 
during the threehour closing arguments harless sat quietly his 
head bowed his mother sat nearby across from allens family 
including his three children 
what happened in that four to 10 seconds has changed the lives 
of a lot of people and its a tragedy the defense attorney said 
prosecutor mary mckeown argued that harless was a vicious 
calculating young man who deliberately shot and killed allen 
maybe it was because he had an alcoholic father who beat his 
mother she told the jury saturday does that excuse his crime 
hes a kid who has made choices and the choices have all been 
wrong he gets angry and violent and thats the bottom line

david harris stood horrified in his 
garden as a twinengine jetliner flew 60 feet over his head and 
crashed nearby turning the night sky red thoughts of lockerbie

over the scottish town of lockerbie the residents of the small 
central england town of kegworth watched british midland airways 
flight 92 its left engine aflame crash as it tried to make an 
emergency landing at east midlands airport 
i was in the front bedroom of my bungalow when i heard a low 
sound which was obviously an aircraft in trouble harris said i 
rushed out into the garden literally 60 feet above ground was the 
aircraft obviously coming down 
my wife ran to the back of the house and shouted she could see 
the left engine on fire seconds later there was an explosion as it 
hit the ground on top of the motorway just a short distance from 
our house the sky lit up red he said 
the pilot did well to avoid our builtup area in kegworth 
village it was only seconds away from hitting the center of the 
community harris said 
george mellors 46 another resident of this town of about 2000 
said the plane sounded more like a train it was going bang bang 
like a train going over points 
we have been very lucky he said it could easily have been 
another lockerbie 
in the pan am crash all 259 people aboard were killed along with 
11 lockerbie residents whose homes were hit by some of the jumbo 
jets wreckage 
the british midlands boeing 737400 bound from london for 
belfast had 126 people on board and police reported at least 32 
died it managed to just miss the m1 englands main northsouth 
highway hitting a grassy embankment by junction 24 before splitting 
apart 
it undershot the runway by about half a mile shearing off 
treetops and ripping apart with its tail embedded in the ground 
while the cockpit ended up in a thicket 
bewildered motorists swerved in fright and there were some minor 
collisions

the scene 
at first he said there was a silence then people began 
screaming and moaning 
joe westonwebb 50 who lives in the nearby village of sutton 
bonningale said he saw many bodies while helping the rescuers 
the seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had 
gone forward and the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpit 
end and the people had all been shunted together there were people 
in a sort of concertina you had to take the seats from the back of 
the people in front to get them out he said 
many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and facial injuries 
he said 
it seems a miracle that any one got out alive though and i 
cant believe that it all didnt go up in flames it was 
horrendous 
angwin said i ran across the fields to help and dragged three 
bodies from the wreckage and five people who were still alive 
it was total devastation he said i saw a baby taken out 
alive luckily there were more survivors than dead 
the rev michael brandon 32 described how he say prayers for

in honduras on rebel infighting 
the killing saturday of manuel adan rugama acevedo is another

more than 438000 mournings came out in drizzling rain to honor 
the dead emperor at the imperial palace akihito became emperor 
shortly after hirohito died of cancer saturday at age 87 
the 55yearold akihito spoke in clear and somber tones for four 
minutes the new empress michiko 54 was on his left wearing a long 
black veil the new crown prince naruhito 28 was on his right 
i pledge i will be always with the people at any time and abide 
by the japanese constitution akihito said the postwar 
constitution bans the emperor from any role in government and limits 
him to ceremonial functions signing bills into law and serving as 
symbol of the state and the unity of the people 
based on this i will exert my responsibility i hope for 
further development of the countrys fortunes and world peace and 
improved welfare of the human race he said 
in japanese tradition akihitos statement was his first imperial 
rescript a time for a new emperor to set a tone for his reign and 
to mourn his predecessor 
i sincerely mourn the late emperors demise akihito said 
based on stipulations of the japanese constitution and the 
imperial rules i hereby succeeded to the throne considering 
its heavy duties i recognize solemn feeling from the bottom of my 
heart 
the ceremony held in the main hall of the imperial palace 
lasted just seven minutes but was an important milestone in the 
transition to akihitos new imperial era of heisei or achieving 
peace 
the simple rite was attended by prime minister noboru takeshita 
and about 300 people from the imperial family government 
parliament and the judiciary 
hirohito will be buried feb 24 after lying in state for more 
than six weeks the cabinet announced sunday 
thousands of police were deployed to prevent attacks by radical 
leftist and rightist groups who equate the emperor with japanese 
militarism and nationalism 
hirohito died after a 62year reign that stretched from japans 
descent into militarism and defeat in world war ii to its 
astonishing recovery into an economic superpower 
chief palace physician akira takagi said doctors knew in 
september 1987 that hirohito had cancer in his upper intestinal 
area but for various reasons did not announce it or tell the 
monarch 
japanese doctors and family members often do not tell people they 
have cancer as it is considered demoralizing and because of their 
belief the disease is almost always fatal and the patient will 
become discouraged 
the yomiuri shimbun newspaper said it knew the emperor had cancer 
long ago this was not reported because the emperor himself had 
not been informed of the true nature of his ailment it said 
government spokesman keizo obuchi said the cabinet decided 
funeral costs will be shared by the government and imperial 
household 
some opposition groups have warned government sponsorship of 
funeral ceremonies closely linked to japans native shinto 
religion could violate constitutional separation of religion and 
state 
hirohito is the first emperor to die under japans postwar 
constitution obuchi said funeral ceremonies will be held at tokyos 
148acre shinjuku gyoen imperial gardens from there his body will 
be taken in procession to an imperial mausoleum in hachioji 28 
miles away 
a foreign ministry official said dignitaries from 130 nations are 
expected for the ceremony where the akihito will preside 
more than 60 funeral and transition rites some simple and some 
complex are expected in coming months akihitos coronation will be 
delayed by a years mourning although he automatically became 
emperor when hirohito died 
obuchi said security is a major concern and the minister of 
home affairs said he wants to make sure there will not be any 
guerrilla incidents 
hirohito officially was commander in chief of the armed forces 
during world war ii which was fought by the japanese in his name 
most historians agree he had no direct personal role in the war but 
critics say he should have prevented japanese aggression

the rules of the corporate name game could change 
drastically if toyota motor corp loses its struggle to hang onto 
lexus as the name for its forthcoming line of luxury cars 
if a federal appeals court bars toyota from using lexus because 
of trademark infringement the precedent might vastly complicate the 
already brainbusting job of choosing new names 
its a humdinger isnt it said jerome gilson a chicago 
lawyer who helped prepare the report that formed the basis for last 
years federal trademark law revisions 
when japans biggest manufacturer ran afoul of mead corps lexis 
trademark it was only the latest corporate giant to be snagged by a 
smaller company with a prior mark 
among previous victims usx corp general motor corps saturn 
division and nbc whose shortlived n logo happened to be the 
same as that of the nebraska educational television network 
even the italian gun maker beretta has gotten into the act suing 
gms chevrolet division over using the beretta name for a sporty 
compact coupe the suit is pending 
the lexuslexis decision could be bigger than any of them 
though thats because us district judge david n edelstein went 
unusually far in siding with the holder of an existing trademark 
an affirmation by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals which 
will hear the case jan 30 would have national repercussions 
because of the prestige of the panel which is one notch below the 
us supreme court 
toyota is allowed to use lexus at auto shows but not in national 
advertising until the appeal is heard the line is scheduled to go 
on sale in september 
a loss for toyota would be disastrous edelstein said toyota had 
to either drop the lexus name or among other things put a 
disclaimer in all its advertising saying lexus was not related to 
lexis 
even beyond toyotas difficulties the worldwide stakes in 
trademark battles are enormous the dollar value of famous names 
explains the wars for control of companies such as rjr nabisco inc 
which owns names like oreo ritz winston and hawaiian puch 
toyota was given a judo flip by mead a dayton ohiobased 
company that owns a computer dataretrieval service called lexis 
that is used mainly by lawyers journalists and researchers 
mead failed to prove confusion was an issue clearly no one who 
wants the lexis computer service would mistakenly stumble into a 
lexus showroom and buy a luxury car 
rather mead succeeded under a new york state law that protects 
trademarks from dilution it said toyotas lexus would become so 
wellknown that potential lexis customers would think of the car 
first when they heard the word lexis ergo dilution 
the idea that a trademark can be diluted is a departure from the 
main tradition of trademark law which protected trademarks only 
when there was clear potential for confusion between two products 
more than 20 other states have antidilution statutes including 
california illinois and massachusetts like new yorks those have 
usually been given weak interpretations by the courts but as long 
as they are on the books they can be enforced 
new yorks 35yearold antidilution law was a ticking time 
bomb that went off with edelsteins ruling said gilson the 
trademark expert 
the us trademark association tried to defuse the states legal 
bombs last year by proposing a federal antidilution provision that 
would supercede state laws and protect only truly famous trademarks 
on the order of tiffany and yves st laurent lexis most likely 
would not have made the cut 
the provision was rejected because congress didnt want to 
tinker with the state system said william borchard counsel to 
the us trademark association 
striking a blow for the little guy edelstein said lesserknown 
but distinctive trademarks deserve as much protection as the famous 
names owned by the largest and most powerful corporations in the 
country 
the problem with protecting all trademarks equally no matter how 
obscure is that soon in fact now no good names will be 
available for companies that need them 
in a typical recent debacle hnginternorth inc switched its 
name to enteron upon the advice of lippincott amp margulies only to 
discover it was a name for the human alimentary canal it settled 
for enron 
meads own nexis service a sibling of lexis shares its name 
with at least a dozen other products including a haircare line 
called nexxus 
clive chajet chairman of lippincott amp margulies which worked 
with toyota but did not pick lexus said mead should stop 
complaining 
if i were mead i would send a thankyou note to mr eiji 
toyoda the chairman for raising the awareness level of my 
product chajet said

president reagan sends congress his final 
budget proposal monday a 115 trillion spending plan that would 
award the military a hefty increase while calling for the 
elimination of scores of domestic programs 
but congress is already looking beyond reagans budget to see how 
presidentelect bush will keep his campaign promises to boost 
spending for education child care and housing without raising taxes 
while at the same time erasing the budget deficit through a 
flexible freeze on other government programs 
the reagan administration insists that its final budget for the 
1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 is not irrelevant even 
though reagan will be out of office 11 days after it is unveiled 
joseph r wright jr reagans budget director said the spending 
plan would give bush an excellent starting point for his own 
negotiations because it does not seek any new taxes and leaves 
social security untouched two commitments bush also has made 
reagan will leave office with a budget that proposes collecting 
106 trillion in revenues and spending 115 trillion leaving a 
budget deficit of 925 billion 
the deficit figure if realized would be the lowest since a 
737 billion deficit in 1981 the year reagan took office with a 
pledge to balance the budget by 1984 reagans campaign promise was 
swamped under a tide of red ink that has almost tripled the national 
debt 
the budget deficit in the current fiscal year is projected by 
many economists to total 155 billion identical to the deficit in 
the fiscal year which ended last sept 30 
the presidents final budget is an ideologically conservative 
document that revives many of reagans favorite themes against big 
government proposing to eliminate 82 government programs while 
protecting his defense buildup and recommending a big increase for 
the spacebased nuclear shield known as star wars 
to trim the deficit reagan will propose closing down the 
interstate commerce commission reducing subsidies for the amtrak 
railroad passenger service and moving some regional power 
authorities into private hands all ideas reagan has advanced 
before without success 
this is a responsible conservative budget it has been put 
through a reasonableness test wright said sunday if he wants 
to use it that way it provides presidentelect bush with a good 
base to begin negotiations with congress during a very tough year 
reagan also will propose the sale of about 6 billion in 
government assets and call for further cuts in farm subsidies the 
budget also will seek to trim about 4 billion from doctor and 
hospital fees in the huge medicare program which provides health 
care for the elderly and disabled 
in the way of increases reagans budget will propose spending 5 
billion a year over the next five years to close or merge hundreds 
of failed savings and loan associations it also makes a down 
payment of 900 million to start cleaning up and rebuilding the 
governments aging nuclear weapons plants 
however some estimates of the cost of the sampl bailout now top 
100 billion and the energy department has said the weapons plants 
could require as much as 138 billion over the next 20 years 
democratic critics say the gap between what reagan is 
recommending for the sampl crisis and the nuclear cleanup and the 
expected costs highlight the problems bush will face in keeping his 
nonewtaxes pledge 
in addition bush is expected to have a list of his own programs 
where he will be seeking higher spending to fulfill promises made 
during the presidential campaign 
new mexico sen pete domenici senior republican on the senate 
budget committee said in a recent interview that he expects bush 
will ask for additional money over the reaganrecommended levels for 
day care education acidrain prevention housing for the homeless 
a project to fight the effects of global warming and antidrug 
programs 
bush said last friday that he would outline his own spending 
recommendations during a joint session of congress within the first 
few weeks after taking office 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine said sunday 
that congress will closely examine the bush spending plan to see how 
he will stick to his flexible freeze approach to lowering the budget 
deficit without raising taxes while at the same time increasing 
spending in many areas 
under the flexible freeze the growth in total government 
spending would be held to the yearly increase in inflation with 
certain programs such as social security exempt from any cuts 
my own view is that it is very difficult mitchell said on 
nbcs meet the press but bush has said it can be done and 
that he will do it my feeling is lets give him a chance to 
see if he meant what he said and if he can do what he promised 
senate republican leader bob dole appearing on the same program 
said it would be a mistake to count on bush retreating from his 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes 
i think george bush meant it and if people dont read lips in 
this town i think they are going to be left out somewhere dole 
said
