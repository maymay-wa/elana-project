a former accountant for the department of housing 
and urban development pleaded guilty friday to one count of theft 
from the us government for allegedly embezzling 1 million from a 
hud rentsubsidy program 
douglas r turner entered the plea before us district court 
judge james carrigan as part of an agreement that called for three 
other theft counts to be dropped in exchange for his guilty plea 
turner 38 could be sentenced to a maximum 10 years in prison 
and fined up to 250000 no sentencing date has been set 
turner was indicted aug 29 for allegedly embezzling 1 million 
from hud and putting the funds to his own use he has been free on 
personal recognizance bond since that time 
turner was a 28000ayear supervisory accountant in huds 
denver regional office 
prosecutors say turner used a government computer to 
electronically transfer about 1 million from the hud section 8 
rentsubsidy program to the bank account of a real estate company 
he owned green view developers inc green view developers was not 
eligible to participate in the program 
the transfers occurred between december 1988 and may 1989 and 
turned up during a routine audit prosecutors said 
investigators said turner apparently found an account number for 
a housing project once used by hud and made charges to that account 
to make it appear the section 8 program funds were being spent 
legitimately 
he allegedly used this system to wire money on at least four 
occasions from the us treasury into the colorado state bank 
account of green view developers 
when the investigators began investigating turners role in the 
affair they allegedly found a burgeoning stock portfolio recently 
purchased real estate and a 500000 custom home under 
construction they said turner also bought a car with the money 
assistant us attorney james allison said fbi and hud 
investigators have so far seized property worth 470000 from 
turner that will be used as restitution in the case 
the justice department has also filed a 1 million civil lawsuit 
against turner in an effort to recover the remainder of the 
embezzled funds 
the civil and criminal actions are a cooperative effort to 
recover the money with the 470000 already seized to be the only 
restitution in the criminal proceeding said turners attorney 
dianna degette 
turners case emerged at the height of concern over allegations 
of widespread fraud in the denver hud operation us attorney mike 
norton said that investigation is still continuing

mike royko says people in the fox valley 
are cheeseheads but the regions officials believe the 
newspaper columnist has been outfoxed 
the eastcentral wisconsin area is busy trying to lure chicago

only helps their cause 
greg hunt vice president of economic development for the fox 
cities chamber of commerce said roykos column introduced millions 
of readers to fox valley and let them know we are among the 
safest communities in the nation in its promotional effort the 
region compares itself with chicago one postcard shows a chalk 
outline on a sidewalk depicting a chicago murder victim compared 
with a chalk outline of a hopscotch game in the tranquil fox valley 
towns 
the implication brought a stinging attack from royko in his 
column in wednesdays chicago tribune 
most of the cheeseheads are fine citizens content to chomp on 
a bratwurst burp yank on the underside of a cow and wear long red 
underwear to formal social events the pulitzer prizewinning 
columnist wrote theres nothing wrong with long red underwear 
but up there they wear it as an outer garment 
royko wrote that people in fond du lac a community in the fox 
valley appear so tranquil that their eyes are glazed their jaws 
hang slackly and a few drooled 
fox valley marketing inc a business development group sent a 
series of postcards to about 500 paperrelated buinesses in the 
chicago area about a dozen businesses have made inquiries 
the cards maintained that fox valley has many advantages over 
chicago fastermoving traffic a more productive work force 
cheaper energy safer streets better industrial sites and more 
affordable housing 
royko a sharptongued defender of chicago didnt like the 
postcards but he gingerly confessed it was silly to get angry 
like it or not crime has a role in our history countless 
movies and tv drama have been made about chicagos gangsters

it when was the last time you saw a hit movie about a wisconsin

here is a brief look at some legal issues that could be raised 
by the defense for gen manuel antonio noriega in proceedings on 
drug trafficking charges 
the defense could try to force the government to drop charges 
by seeking court disclosure of classified information pertaining to 
noriegas relationship with the cia 
pretrial publicity nationwide could make it difficult to 
assemble an unbiased jury 
evidence seized during the military invasion of panama could 
be subject to exclusion if the warrantless search violates 
noriegas fourth amendment rights 
the arrest and transportation of noriega could have violated 
us law and provisions of both the panama canal treaty and the 
geneva convention 
the court could lack jurisdiction because noriega could be 
considered a political prisoner brought to the united states 
illegally 
the case could be dismissed if the court finds noriega is 
being selectively prosecuted to force him into concessions on 
control of the panama canal and the governing of panama 
noriega could be immune from prosecution if courts recognized 
his stature as de facto head of state of panama the judge in the 
case has already rejected this argument but it is subject to appeal

president bush plans to cut four energy 
conservation programs by 85 percent next year sources say a 
proposal critics say would belie stated administration concerns 
about the environment 
in the fiscal 1991 budget the president unveils jan 29 bush 
will propose spending 30 million on the programs the sources said 
thursday this compares to 200 million the programs are pegged at 
this year 
chief among the victims will be the 161 million weatherization 
program under which the government supplies poor families with 
insulation weather stripping and other energysaving materials 
also slashed will be a program that will distribute 25 million 
this year to save energy in schools and hospitals one that will 
spend 10 million to help states publicize conservation measures 
such as van pooling and another budgeted at 4 million that 
assists states in providing energysaving counseling to businesses 
and individuals 
spokesman roger meyer of the department of energy which 
administers the programs and spokeswoman dede spitznagel of the 
office of management and budget which draws up the budget 
declined to comment 
but lobbyists who support the programs criticized the proposal 
if this is true it would be remarkable that a president whos 
concerned about energy conservation and global warming would ignore 
a program offering serious conservation potential said meg 
power lobbyist for the national community action foundation which 
supports programs for poor people 
the department of energy claims that from the weatherization 
programs start in 1977 through 1988 it paid for the 
weatherproofing of 18 million american homes saving an equivalent 
of 45 million barrels of oil annually 
the department says that between 1978 and 1988 the program that 
helps conserve energy at schools and hospitals disbursed 22413 
grants worth more than 700 million and saving 19 billion in 
energy costs 
jeffrey genzer counsel to the national association of state 
energy officials noted the programs were favorite budgetslashing 
targets of former president reagan when he presented his first 
budget to congress last year bush proposed eliminating federal 
spending on them 
what we hoped for was this president would be turning the tide 
of the last few years and trying to support energy efficiency 
genzer said if these numbers are correct that wouldnt be 
consistent with that view 
bush who has pledged to make environmental concerns a priority 
of his presidency signed a proclamation wednesday designating 
april 22 as the 20th annual earth day 
he said the day should inspire us to save the land we love to 
realize that global problems do have local solutions and to make 
preservation of the planet a personal commitment 
for the 1991 fiscal year which begins oct 1 the grammrudman 
deficit reduction law requires that the president submit a budget 
with a shortfall of no more than 64 billion budget experts 
believe this means bush must find about 40 billion in savings in 
his 12 trillion budget 
the two sources who spoke on condition they not be identified 
said they were not certain how the 30 million would be spent among 
the four programs but one said it was likely the money would be 
distributed in the same proportions by which it is now spent 
sources said previously that bush also will propose cutting from 
14 billion to 105 billion another program that subsidizes the 
home heating bills of about 61 million lowincome american 
households

two days before he was ousted nicolae 
ceausescu the best son of romania held the limelight in the 
staterun press the newspapers dec 20 published 12 photographs of 
him on a state visit to iran 
three days after the dictator and his wife elena were executed 
on christmas day the daily newspaper truth published its first 
anticeausescu cartoon a report from hell which showed the 
former first couple in a boiling cauldron 
we protest shrieks elena we want to boil only in a 
golden cauldron 
the press has been using its new freedom with a vengeance 
informing romanians each day of more excesses committed by the 
reviled ceausescus 
on dec 26 truth began serializing excerpts from red 
horizons the memoirs of former counterintelligence chief ion 
pacepa who defected to the united states in 1978 
in his book published in the west two years ago pacepa 
chronicled how ceausescu and other romanians tried to steal western 
technological secrets and recruit jimmy carters brother as an 
agent dinfluence or spied on romanians abroad and at home 
sending and executing death threats 
elena ceausescu was portrayed as a domineering crude woman who 
relished listening to tapes secretly made each week at her 
childrens apartments and the homes of top officials 
what can be read in the pages of this book appears to be the 
fruit of a sick fantasy and yet every word is true truth said 
as it introduced the pacepa excerpts to romanians 
the publication of this book played an uncontested role in 
revealing in all its hideousness the true face of a dictatorship 
which with diabolical cunningness had managed at the outset to 
outfox a part of the world the newspaper said 
the united states and other western powers originally cultivated 
ceausescu for his relatively independent foreign policy within the 
warsaw pact moving away only when ceausescus rule grew harsher 
and other pact countries began to reform in the mid1980s 
the personality cult ceausescu built during his 24year rule 
took on the trappings of worship and pervaded practically all 
aspects of public life his portrait lined the streets in bucharest 
and other romanian cities 
now the leader formerly called the genius of the 
carpathians the hero among heroes and the founder of a new 
country is called romanias no 1 terrorist a paranoid 
and a doberman an allusion to pets he reportedly fed with 
imported meat 
his portraits and books have been burned by angry romanians who 
suffered widespread food and energy shortages and were spied upon 
by the securitate ceausescus secret police 
he called himself with the most abject impudence the most 
beloved and esteemed but he talked like the illiterate peasants 
from the beginning of this century ion marin wrote in truth in 
an editorial titled vipers 
mrs ceausescu the secondmost powerful person in the country 
added to her name the title of scientist of world repute but 
she omitted to say that she could not write and she could hardly 
read at all marin said 
elena whose official title was academician dr eng elena 
ceausescu was trained as a chemist but officials said privately 
even while she was in power that her title was merely political 
truth on thursday published elenas school records and marks 
showing that she dropped out of school like ceausescu after the 
fourth grade 
in other recent articles and editorials romanias avid readers 
learned that 
thousands of women died seeking abortions over the past few 
years due to woefully inadequate medical conditions linked to 
ceausescus nearban on abortions 
ceausescu decreed the virtual abortion ban to encourage 
procreation roamanias new interim government swiftly lifted the 
law 
mrs ceausescu had deposited in savings the equivalent of 
130000 at the official rate of exchange for her daughter and each 
of her two sons 
she canceled romanias subscriptions to international news 
agencies to save 75000 annually and stopped delivery of all 
foreign newspapers to keep romanians isolated according to the 
official news agency rompres 
ceausescus obsession with being photographed cost the country 
28 million all the pictures were heavily retouched so he would 
look younger 
as soon as ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 agerpres abolished 
censorship and pledged to inform subscribers in romania and abroad 
in an honest and civilized way 
on jan 2 the facelift was completed with a name change 
agerpres an acronym for agentia romana de presa romanian press 
agency now is rompres 
aside from the desire to break with ceausescus era the name 
change may have been prompted by a desire to get rid of unkind 
jokes ager in romanian means quick or quickwitted a 
description that always gave romanian and foreign journalists a 
laugh when applied to ceausescus docile news agency

manuel antonio noriega is in us hands and 
president bush is claiming total victory for his panama gamble now 
comes the hard part 
ahead lies the unglamorous task of helping panama staggered by 
sanctions and stealth fighter bombs restore its oncevibrant 
economy 
panama has been in a steep economic decline for more than two 
years partly the result of the punitive sanctions imposed by the 
united states in its campaign to oust noriega 
beyond that is the cost of the us invasion of panama which 
according to some estimates dealt a 2 billion blow to the 
economy entire neighborhoods were leveled and scores of businesses 
were wiped out because of looting 
the reagan administration had systematically dismantled a host 
of programs designed to increase panamas exports and to attract 
us investment partly as a result panamas per capita income has 
dropped from 2000 a year to between 1600 and 1700 
reversing the decline wont be easy panama is burdened by a 
foreign debt listed at 543 million fresh money from the united 
states aside from emergency relief is not in the offing because 
just about all the foreign aid money is already earmarked by 
congress the administration doesnt have the authority to help 
panama by taking funds from another aid recipient 
the united states can restore the trade and investment benefits 
but the impact is not expected to be felt for some time at least 
panamas new government can count on the 370 million in assets 
which were frozen by the us government last year and which now 
are being unfrozen also the capital flight that took place under 
noriega has been reversed since the invasion 
for a time bush will be able to bask in victory americans in 
panama who walked the countrys streets in fear just weeks ago 
are now being regaled as heroes particularly the troops who helped 
force noriega into humiliating exile 
the international protests over the us invasion reflected in 
votes cast at the united nations and the organization of american 
states have been displaced somewhat by the outpouring of popular 
support shown for the us action by the panamanian people 
in a country accustomed to military domination rarely have the 
prospects for civilian rule been brighter us officials have 
reason to hope that the united states will be able to turn over the 
panama canal to a stable democratic government at the end of the 
century when us control over the waterway ends according to 
treaty obligations 
still the pitfalls are many for one thing panamas democratic 
roots are shallow the last time panama had an unambiguously fair 
election was 1968 the winner was dumped by the military after 11 
days in office 
the expectations of the panamanian people are running 
dangerously high and the countrys embrace of the united states 
could turn to wrath if over time the aspirations for a better 
life are unfulfilled 
the united states is insisting that panama needs a strong 
defense force to replace the one now decimated that noriega 
led us officials reason that a weak military would not be able 
to defend the canal adequately but some panamanians are worried 
that a powerful successor defense establishment would like the one 
run by noriega dominate the countrys political life 
perhaps inevitably the invasion produced tragic loss of 
innocent lives an estimated 300 panamanian civilians are believed 
dead and the heat of battle produced some decisions that came 
under widespread criticism 
there was the controversy over the communications techniques of 
the us military the playing of boombox music through stereo 
speakers in a bid to thwart suspected eavesdroppers and perhaps to 
drive noriega out of his vatican embassy sanctuary 
under vatican pressure the soldiers threw in the towel and 
agreed to silence the din after a few days wednesday night it was 
noriega who threw in the towel for all its problems panamas 
prospects seem better than his

here are some questions and answers on the 
legal situation surrounding former panamanian dictator manuel 
antonio noriega who surrendered to us authorities and now faces 
trial on drugsmuggling charges 
the answers were distilled from interviews with experts 
including two professors specializing in international law and the 
american legal system and a lawyer in international practice 
q can noriega get a fair trial 
a the courts will say he can whats the alternative are we 
supposed to say that someones notoriety prevents him from ever 
being brought to justice the question is not whether people have 
reached any conclusions or have any impressions in the case but 
whether they can put aside their impressions or opinions to judge 
guilt or innocence 
q president bush has called norega a thug other officials have 
had equally harsh assessments can a jury be found that is not 
affected by these characterizations 
a the emotions will quiet down by the time the case comes to 
trial which may be a year or a year and a half or more people 
will forget the judge in the oliver north trial was able to seat a 
jury that claimed to not have seen heard or read about norths 
televised testimony in congress 
q will the manner of bringing him to this country cause 
problems 
a this is a matter of controversy one expert said whatever 
international law problems are raised once the government has 
custody of someone it doesnt matter how it obtained custody so 
long as he gets due process from now on 
q what are the biggest problems in bringing noriega to trial 
a another expert questioned the legality of noriegas 
apprehension under federal law there will be the issue of whether 
or not noriegas property was reasonably seized and searched under 
international law the problem will be whether the terms of the 1904 
extradition treaty between the united states and panama were 
properly adhered to and whether the panama constitution itself was 
violated other problems under international law go to the issue of 
whether the us armed forces have the right to apprehend a 
fugitive from american justice in another country without the 
express consent of the foreign government without detailed 
information lawyers presume the endara government consented 
q if you were his defense lawyer what would be your tactic 
a you would want to attack the credibility of government 
witnesses as hard as possible based on what we know all or many 
of them appear to be drug dealers or people with long criminal 
records you want to pound away as much as possible on the idea 
that you cant convict anyone on testimony from such shaky and 
shabby people 
q will the military activities that brought about noriegas 
surrender be a continuing factor 
a this is an area that is a mine field where the united states 
is really flirting with serious violations of international law and 
risking being branded an international lawbreaker and exposing 
americans in the future to be targets of kidnappings but he 
volunteered to come out of the vatican embassy and surrender 
himself to drug enforcement administration agents and put himself 
voluntarily into the hands of the american law enforcement and 
criminal justice system 
q what are the biggest issues facing prosecutors 
a the indictment is a year old and reflects events that 
happened a long time ago there may be some problems with evidence 
and with witnesses another possible major roadblock will be 
maneuvering by noriegas lawyers to subpoena documents government 
officials including possibly even the president of the united 
states 
q wont the way evidence was obtained in panama breaking into 
noriegas residence be a problem for prosecutors 
a the us attorney in florida claims he has enough evidence in 
florida to successfully prosecute noriega and does not need the 
documentary evidence seized in panama he presumably would not have 
brought the indictments in the first place unless he had already 
compiled sufficient evidence 
q what happens to noriega if he is acquitted 
a the issue will be raised shall he be extradited to panama or 
deported as an undesirable alien in which case he would have to 
find a country that will take him possibly cuba or nicaragua he 
could also face charges in panama regardless of whether he is 
convicted in the united states

a new peace group formed in the euphoria over 
democratic movements in eastern europe is being warned by an 
oldtimer in its ranks that upheaval in the communist bloc does not 
mean the cold war is over 
there will be very very tough times ahead for a peace 
movement and for all americans said james mcgregor burns the 
historian who won the pulitzer prize nearly two decades ago for a 
biography of franklin delano roosevelt 
the cold war in my view is not over burns a fellow of 
the humanities center of williams college said at a news 
conference thursday announcing formation of the committee on common 
security 
there is a residue in the soviet union of bitter feeling 
against this country and there is a residue in this country of 
people who feel equally bitterly toward the soviet union the 
71yearold historian cautioned 
i lived through a period namely world war ii when we were 
equally euphoric about the future of sovietamerican 
relationships burns said within one year of the ending of 
world war ii that partnership was dissolved 
once there are setbacks and there will be many setbacks 
there will be recrimination there will be defeatism there will be 
a falling away from the peace movement people will give up the 
fight he said 
burns told reporters however that the new committee plans to 
persist and will be there during the bleak times as well as 
the very euphoric moments 
a principal objective of the committee a project of the 
institute for peace and international security of cambridge mass 
will be directing spending from military to civilian purposes 
in contrast to burns view george rathjens a professor of 
political science at the massachusetts institute of technology who 
wrote the first study paper issued by the new committee said i 
start with the thesis that the cold war really is over 
the rathjens paper calls for establishment of a joint panel by 
the house and senate committees on armed services and foreign 
affairs to study us military commitments it says congress should 
begin at zero and build upward within the context of findings 
made by the special joint committee 
rathjens argued that the united states should scrap attempts to 
improve delivery of nuclear weapons against the soviet union put 
them on ice and get rid of a lot of those weapons put them in 
mothballs if you like 
we can reject all efforts at strategic modernization at this 
time he said none of that is required 
rathjens said the international situation also justifies 
withdrawal of substantial numbers of troops from europe 
marion anderson director of employment research associates of 
lansing mich said her group which studies defense spending 
estimates the budget cuts suggested by defense secretary at 17 
billion a year and we think the military budget can go down a 
great deal more 
just for starters about 170 billion a year is being spent on 
nato she said why shouldnt that be pulled down by about 75 
per cent were talking about real real big money like cuts of 
around 100 billion 
gerald w mcentee president of the american federation of 
state county and municipal employesl said the union will mobilize 
its lobbyists to provide some education to provide some 
political heat to provide some political clout to the members of 
congress 
feminist author betty friedan predicted there will be in the 
next months and within the year an eruption of this political 
movement in this country just as underneath the surface of 
stagnant communism nobody could have predicted the formation of 
democratic movements in eastern european countries 
paul f walker codirector of the institute for peace and 
international security said the group plans to hold seminars 
around the country

in the end we were his captives lt col douglass colbert 
a chaplain said thursday of little eloy alberto diaz 
eloy was sleeping at his home in the residential section of fort 
amador a military installation shared by panamanian and us 
military forces when us army soldiers broke in a few minutes 
after the invasion began early in the morning of dec 20 
about 300 yards away army units were fighting with a panamanian 
military police company and american tanks had opened up on the 
nearby panamanian defense forces headquarters 
eloys father capt ramon diaz was commander of a special 
panamanian antiterrorist unit at fort amador as well as head of a 
detachmentin veraguas 150 miles west of panama city he 
surrendered

colbert said that the morning after the assault i saw this 
american soldier in full battle gear walking down the street with a 
baby bottle sterilizer under his arm behind him was this young 
woman with a baby 
later on the soldiers came by the house with the baby and 
told me they did not know what to do with the baby i told him we 
would take care of him they brought him to the house said 
colbert whose home is also in fort amador

centers mrs diaz managed to contact colbert and shortly afterward 
a military jeep took her to the chaplains home

bacteria that are harmless to humans but 
deadly to salmonella are being tested as a way for food processors 
and packagers to eliminate a common cause of foodpoisoning the 
agriculture department says 
it will take at least a year to grow the bacteria and test 
their performance as a natural control mechanism said richard 
whiting a research food technologist with the departments 
agricultural research service 
but he said this is the first time anyone has tried to use a 
predatory bacterium to ensure food safety 
the bacteria are named b bacteriovorous b starrii and b 
stolpii all are rodshaped bacteria known as bdellovibrio 
they are common in soil and water and often swallowed by humans 
swimming in rivers lakes or the ocean 
whiting said that under a microscope the predatory bacteria 
squeeze through the cell wall of salmonella and begin feeding 
causing the salmonella to die in about 30 minutes 
studies will determine whether they can be commercially adapted 
as a spray to stop salmonella and other bacterial growth in meats 
eggs and powdered milk during processing said whiting 
they might also be added to packaged meats sold at grocery 
stores he suggested 
were interested in how broad the bdellovibrios appetites 
are said whiting 
but even if adapted for commercial use bdellovibrio should not 
be considered a replacement for current salmonella preventions such 
as good refrigeration and thoroughly cooking meat 
i look at this as a form of insurance he said of the 
discovery 
the agriculture department estimates that illnesses caused by 
salmonella and other foodborne bacteria have a 1 billion to 10 
billion economic impact through lost wages decreased worker 
productivity medical expenses industry production losses and 
destruction of products

a major soybean organization is pushing for a 
change in federal policy it says will make american farmers more 
competitive on the world soybean market 
world markets are growing 3 percent to 5 percent yearly but 
the united states is losing both soybean income export volume and 
market share marlyn jorgensen president of the american soybean 
association said thursday 
the united states is still the single largest producer of 
soybeans but its lead is slipping foreign growers as a group now 
produce more than half the world crop said jorgensens 
organization in a statement 
if current trends continue south america alone will 
outproduce and outsell the united states by the year 2000 said 
the asa 
jorgensen blamed federal government soybean policies and 
suggested a change he said should be made part of the 1990 farm 
bill 
he said his organization did not yet have a congressional 
sponsor for its proposal but has been talking to rep dan 
glickman dkan chairman of the house agriculture soybean 
subcommittee 
an aide to glickman said the proposal is one of several 
options being considered for the 1990 farm bill but that it is 
too early to say whether it or any other will be adopted 
the plan calls for 
a voluntary loan program with rates set by a formula based on 
cotton and corn target prices acreage reduction programs and 
traditional price ratios of soybeans and corn and cotton 
an equity payment equal to the difference between the adjusted 
county soybean loan rate and the posted county price for soybeans 
a graduated income support based on the level of soybean stocks 
the selling of crops rather than forfeiting them to the 
governmentn 
jorgensen said that under the plan farmers would make planting 
decisions based on market prices not government support programs 
but would also have government backup if prices are too low 
he said it also would prevent government stockpiling by 
encouraging farmers to go to market with their soybeans rather than 
forfeiting them to the government for benefits

manuel antonio noriegas status as a deposed head of state 
probably wont do him any good in us courts legal specialists 
say 
although international lawyers disagree about whether noriega 
could be prosecuted for his official acts most say he cant claim 
immunity for common crimes such as drugrunning that werent 
part of his official duties 
its going to be hard for noriega to say if it is true that 
i was trafficking drugs i did that pursuant to my 
responsibilities as head of state said bruce zagaris a 
washington lawyer who cochairs the american bar associations 
committee on international criminal law 
noriegas lawyers have suggested that he should be entitled to 
immunity because of his office earlier this week one of his 
former attorneys neal sonnett said noriega is entitled to head 
of state immunity 
but early last year after noriega was indicted us district 
judge william hoeveler ruled that the panamanian leader had no 
grounds for such a claim because the state department had never 
recognized his political legitimacy 
and even if noriega were considered a legitimate head of state 
experts say he probably couldnt claim head of state immunity 
first of all its not clear that there is such a thing 
columbia law school professor lori fisler damrosch said 
although as you might expect several recently deposed heads of 
state did make such an argument 
one was deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos whose 
case may offer the closest parallels to noriegas 
after he sought exile in hawaii marcos claimed that the act 
of state doctrine gave him immunity to both civil lawsuits and 
criminal prosecution in the united states the courts ruled against 
him 
the doctrine the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
is meant to facilitate the foreign relations of the united 
states not to furnish the equivalent of sovereign immunity to a 
deposed leader 
in other words a deposed ruler might be granted immunity but 
only if the us government considers it advantageous in noriegas 
case as ms damrosch said the views of president bush and the 
executive branch are quite clear 
the marcos case differs somewhat from noriegas because marcos 
was living in the united states when he was indicted and his 
alleged crimes were more closely related to his official duties 
legal experts were hard pressed to recall another case of a 
foreign leader being prosecuted outside his country 
most cited the war crimes trials after world warii in which 
high german officials and japans prime minister hideki tojo were 
tried and convicted but they stressed that such trials were 
extraordinary and provide no precedent for ordinary criminal 
prosecutions 
one scholar alfred rubin a professor of international law at 
the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university said 
the noriega case reminds him of british prosecutions of malay 
sultans in southeast asia in the 19th century 
in the first such case he said a claimant to a sultans throne 
was charged with piracy in 1840 after he intercepted british 
shipping in an effort to seize control of a malay state a jury 
ruled that the act was political not criminal and acquitted him 
and so the british sulking and mad exiled him to the 
seychelles said rubin a strong critic of the noriega 
prosecution british history is full of all sorts of attempts at 
imperial domination and were just going through all their 
mistakes now 
but even rubin offers little comfort to noriega when it comes to 
the head of state defense as far as i know there is no such 
doctrine he said i think its been made up by the defense 
attorneys

soviet president mikhail gorbachev was reported 
thursday night to have postponed all contacts with foreign leaders 
to concentrate on growing unrest in the soviet union 
a spokesman for britains opposition labor party said the soviet 
ambassador in london leonid zamyatin had told party leader neil 
kinnock that gorbachev was postponing all such meetings for the 
rest of the month 
the news sent the tokyo stock exchange tumbling 500 points or 
about 15 percent off the nikkei average in early trading friday 
the labor party spokesman said zamyatin delivered a personal 
message from gorbachev to kinnock who had been scheduled to meet 
with the soviet leader in moscow for talks on jan 16 
the message said the meeting had to be postponed because 
political events in the soviet union required gorbachevs 
personal attention and participation said the labor spokesman 
who in accordance with british practice declined to be identified 
the latest unrest in the soviet union has involved azerbaijani 
demonstrators on the sovietiranian border trying to force open the 
frontier and reunite with their brethren in iran 
the kgb sent border troop reinforcements to the area wednesday 
to stop protesters from smashing guard towers and security alarms 
also lithuanian communist leaders met with gorbachev on 
thursday and said later that the kremlin leader failed to sway them 
from their decision to split from the soviet communist party and 
pursue local independence 
gorbachev has vigorously opposed the lithuanians decision but 
the no 2 party official in the baltic republic said the president 
promised thursday not to interfere

with the principle goal of operation just 
cause met the capture of manuel antonio noriega the us focus 
is on repairing panamas basic services and utilities destroyed or 
disrupted in the invasion 
call the troops landing in panama nationbuilding forces 
the pentagon says 
civil affairs personnel people who provide police service 
and assistance to utilities and that kind of thing pentagon 
spokesman pete williams told reporters thursday in describing the 
specialists sent to panama 
the number of us servicemen in panama stands at about 25500 
the same as it was shortly after the invasion as combat troops are 
withdrawn and replaced by military police and civil affairs 
specialists williams said 
so what you have is a change even though in some cases the 
numbers may stay roughly the same you have a change in the 
complexion of the force williams said 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
arrived in panama on thursday to meet with gen maxwell thurman of 
the us southern command and work out a timetable for withdrawal 
of the troops 
prior to the invasion on dec 20 about 12000 us troops were 
stationed in panama to guard the canal under the terms of a treaty 
underwhich the united states is to turn the waterway over to 
panama in the year 1999 
the civil affairs specialists include active and reserve 
officers and enlisted men bankers and garbage collectors to date 
about 140 reserves from around the country and about 110 
activeduty specialists from the 96th battalion at fort bragg 
nc have been sent to panama about 25 of them arrived during the 
first 48 hours after the invasion 
their purpose according to the pentagon is to help the 
panamanians repair and restore basic public services such as 
telephone water and electricity a group of combat engineers is 
expected later with bulldozers to destroy what is left of the 
commandancia the headquarters of the panamanian defense forces 
said pentagon spokesman col miguel e monteverde 
the specialists are similar to those who were sent to japan and 
germany following world war ii 
they are experts in government and municipal services 
monteverde said 
during the briefing williams said fighting had all but ceased 
in panama 
in other developments the pentagon spokesman said one of 
noriegas bodyguards overheard us servicemen discussing the 
invasion hours before it occurred but it was unclear whether the 
incident enabled the ousted panamanian leader to evade the 
americans 
there is some evidence that some officials may have had some 
advance thought that this operation was about to happen but there 
isnt a lotof evidence that actions were taken as a result of 
that williams said 
a bodyguard during a debriefing interviewl said that two us 
soldiers had been overheard discussing their positions for hhour 
and that supposedly happened at 10 pm three hours before the 
attack was to begin said williams i have no other details 
noriega is believed to have escaped from one of his residences 
minutesbefore a us commando unit arrived just after midnight 
dec 20 and fled from house to house in panama city in the days 
thereafter according to military officials noriega found refuge 
in the vatican embassy on dec 24 and turned himself over to us 
officials wednesday

overweight people fighting the battle of the 
bulge can diet themselves to death in improperly supervised 
verylowcalorie programs that are used by more than a million 
americans doctors warned today 
such liquid diets require management by a specially trained 
physician and by a behavioral psychologist and dietician the 
doctors wrote in the journal of the american medical association 
although the diets are unquestionably safer than their 
liquidprotein predecessors which were blamed for at least 58 
deaths during the 1970s they still have dangers said the 
articles authors 
the recent and zealous marketing of various formula products 
to physicians as well as the publics appetite for such diets 
could lead to yet another round of complications and fatalities 
wrote the doctors who are from the university of pennsylvania 
columbia university and harvard medical school 
verylowcalorie diets provide 400 to 800 calories daily through 
a highprotein powder the dieter adds water or milk and drinks the 
liquid three to five times daily instead of eating food after 12 
to 16 weeks on the regimen the dieter gradually resumes eating 
normal food 
such diets like the optifast program used by talk show host 
oprah winfrey in her celebrated 67pound weight loss should be 
avoided by people who need to lose less than 40 pounds or 30 
percent of their body weight said the authors two of whom are 
consultants for the maker of optifast 
people with certain heart problems also shouldnt go on the 
diets they said 
shortterm health problems from the diets can include 
dehydration an imbalance of electrolytes the chemicals that carry 
electrical impulses sparking the heart to pump inadequate blood 
pressure after standing or sitting up rapidly which can cause 
fainting and increased uric acid concentrations which promote 
gout the authors said 
longterm complications could include severe abnormalities in 
heartbeat the culprit in the liquidproteindiet deaths 
especially by dieters who lose control and go on eating sprees 
during refeeding the authors said 
such problems can be headed off early or prevented entirely with 
proper supervision the authors said 
in november ms winfrey announced on her show that she had 
regained 17 of the 67 pounds she lost a year earlier 
but she has maintained 75 percent of her weight loss which we 
consider to be consistent with an average patient going through the 
program said jim parsons a spokesman for sandoznutrition corp 
which marketsthe optifast program 
intensive supervision is a requirement of the program parsons 
said thursday in a telephone interview from minneapolis 
optifast which costs about 3000 and requires at least a 
years commitment by the patient has been available since the 
mid1970s and has been used by more than 600000 patients parsons 
said 
it contrasts sharply with products marketed directly to private 
physicians with the promise of greatly increasing theirincome 
said thomas a wadden associate professor of psychiatry at the 
university of pennsylvania school of medicine and coauthor of the 
journal article 
wadden said as many as 12000 doctors are now providing 
verylowcalorie diets as part of their outpatient practice 
the problem is thatthese persons are going to help their 
patients lose weight but the patients are destined to regain the 
weight because they have not learned to modify their eating 
exercise and dietary habits wadden said 
liquidprotein diets of the 1970s used a poorquality protein 
while the newer diets use highquality protein plus vitamins and 
other nutrients said wadden 
similar programs have come under fire before one program 
medifast was called the outrage of the month in july by public 
citizen health research groupn 
the washingtonbased consumer watchdog group blasted medifasts 
marketing company jason pharmaceuticals inc of timonium md and 
its subsidiaryresearch institute of maryland for telling 
physicians that enrolling 15 new patients a month could increase 
their profits by 62000 annually 
patricia kail a spokeswoman for medifast said that was blown 
way out of proportion we dont go and say the physician can make 
x amount of dollars she said the program has been used bym 
400000 patients during the past 10 years without any reports of 
deaths or serious complications

most demonstrators outside miamis federal 
courthouse cheered the united states for bringing manuel antonio 
noriega to florida and those offering contraryopinions were 
targets of angry shouting 
as the fallen panamanian dictator awaited his arraignment 
thursday on a 1988 drug indictment about 40 policemen and us 
marshals watched over two groups of about 50 panamanian exiles 
demonstrating outside and more than 100 journalists 
no one will go until this thing is fixed said carlos 
villarino a spokesman for the panamanian refugee center in miami 
he said he wanted noriega to spend all of his possible sentence 
in a maximumsecurity jail adding i want him to have to ask 
permission to breathe i want his dignity destroyed like he tried 
to destroy ours 
a shouting match began when a group of about five exiles said 
the us invasion violated panamas sovereignty the group called 
for newly installed president guillermo endara to hold free 
elections 
we regret that noriega was taken to the us to face justice 
here said silvio cordoba quinonez what happened to panamanian 
justice are we nobody endara has to preserve our sovereignty 
jose cepero a cubanamerican who held a sign saying us 
handsoff panama was surrounded by a mob of panamanian exiles 
who tore the sign and shouted insults 
panama is a free country the panamanians should decide what 
should happen to noriega cepero said as police escorted him to 
safety 
federal marshals secured the 10story courthouse using twoway 
radios metal detectors binoculars and weapons officers were 
stationed throughout the building at all doors and in the streets 
outside while noriega occupied a basement cell before his 
arraignment 
obviously theyve increased security said a receptionist 
for daniel horgan chief us marshal in miami but he wont make 
any comment the receptionist refused to give her name 
about 20 marshals about double the usual number guarded 
barricades at the prisoner entrance to the courthouse and 
pedestrians were forced to walk on the other side of the street 
plainclothes marshals equipped with binoculars scanned the 
surrounding neighborhood from the roof throughout the day instead 
of the normal twicedaily practice when prisoners are being moved 
in and out of the building 
hours before noriega was to reach a ninthfloor courtroom two 
airplanes flew overhead with banners saying bye bye tony and 
rent this ad when fidel falls showing cubanamerican 
solidarity with panamanians 
private security officers supplemented the radioequipped 
marshals in the courthouse and a halfdozen miami police officers 
kept an eye on a growing array of news crews with satellite dishes 
and towers sprouting from their vans 
two miami officers patrolled the front courthouse plaza where a 
few panamanian exiles expressed support for the prosecution of 
noriega one woman wore a tshirt with the words noriega enemy 
no 1 of panama and a mans shirt read democracy for panama

the senate ethics committee is widening its 
investigation of sen dave durenberger to examine a deal in which 
he made a profit by renting his minneapolis condominium to himself 
the minnesota republican disclosed the new area of investigation 
thursday and also said he has asked the panel to determine whether 
it was proper for him and other senators to run nonprofit 
organizations that raise money from special interest groups he 
said 
a thinktank durenberger helped found is embroiled in 
allegations that the senator used the organization for political 
purposes 
the ethics committee already was investigating allegations that 
durenberger laundered speaking fees and used special interest 
groups to underwrite trips to boston to visit his marriage 
counselor 
durenberger said in a telephone interview thursday from 
minneapolis that the committee decided at a meeting dec 21 to 
investigate real estate transactions he used from 1983 to 1987 to 
get reimbursed for stays in a condo in which he owned an interest 
thats fine with me durenbergersaid of the expanded 
investigation i think its logical that the ethics committee 
take on any issue in which there may not be a specific rule and 
help the rules committee give specific definition 
the house bars its members from being reimbursed for staying in 
a home in which they own an interest but the senate does not 
the ethics committees staff director wilson abney declined to 
discuss its investigation 
durenberger sold his downtown minneapolis condominium to a 
partnership in which he was a member and later to a company owned 
by his former campaign manager 
in both instances he continued to live there but used senate 
funds to pay his rent durenberger collected at least 9947 in 
living expense payments from the senate from july 1983 to june 1987 
documents the senator provided to the rules committee on dec 22 
disclosed that durenberger signed backdated real estate 
partnership documents to justify reimbursements for 1983 
durenberger signed the documents in mid1984 and dated them july 
1983 to reflect an oral agreement made in 1983 to form the 
partnership with a friend roger scherer durenberger aides say the 
backdating was proper since durenberger and scherer did make the 
agreement 
minnesota state sen william luther a democrat charged in his 
dec 28 complaint that durenbergermay have committed serious 
violations of law including violations of the internal revenue 
code and senate rules through the real estate transactions 
luther charged that durenberger failed to disclose the 
partnership and income from scherer to the senate and that the 
partnership may have been a phony attempt to claim tax deductions 
available to landlords 
the ethics committee hired a special counsel last fall to 
investigate accusations that durenberger earned 100000 in 
violation of senate honoraria limits through a contract with a 
minneapolis publisher 
durenberger on thursday denied allegations that he used his 
thinktank americans for generational equity for political 
purposes he resigned as chairman of the oncecontroversial 
organization last month 
age contended that workingage adults were being shortchanged by 
government help to the elderly 
paul hewitt a board member whom durenberger ousted as executive 
director two years ago claims durenberger muzzled the 
organizations staff to avoid hurting his reelection campaign in 
1988 
durenberger who raised money for age from many of the same 
organizations that contributed to his campaign denies the 
allegation

romanias provisional government is 
developing closer ties with moscow than the communist regime it 
replaced welcoming soviet offers of aid and expecting a productive 
visit by a top soviet official 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is to arrive in 
bucharest on saturday for the first consultations between the new 
government and the kremlin since dictator nicolae ceausescu was 
toppled dec 22 and executed with his wife elena on christmas day 
silviu brucan a top foreign policy official said thursday the 
new leadership had assurances from the kremlin that romania will 
get extensive assistance including plentiful energy supplies for 
the harsh winter 
unlike other east european revolutions which have pulled former 
satellite nations furtherfrom moscow romanias uprising appears 
to have strengthened what had been deteriorating relations between 
moscow and bucharest 
ceausescu had long pursued maverick foreign and trade policies 
his refusal to follow the reforms of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev estranged romania and the soviet union even more in 
recent years 
from the soviet union we expect massive assistance said 
brucan a former ambassador to the united states we have been 
promised from the top in moscow that we will receive aid in oil and 
natural gas to help us overcome this difficult winter 
brucan did not say whether this would mean additions to the 
traditionally large energy supplies from the soviet union paid for 
in latter years by ceausescuwith food exports 
ceausescu used the energy largely for industry imposing drastic 
curbs on heat and light consumption in freezing dark homes and 
offices 
romania now is led by the national salvation front and one of 
its first acts was to lift the harsh decrees on energy saving 
soviet embassy sources said another issue that is likely to come 
up during shevardnadzes visit is the soviet republic moldavia 
which consists largely of territory annexed in 1940 from romania 
under a secret protocol to the hitlerstalin pact 
moldavians who speak the same language as romanians but were 
forced to use the cyrillic alphabet under josef stalin want more 
independence from the kremlin raising speculation they may seek 
eventual reunification with romania 
brucan glossed over questions on the issue indicating the new 
leadership wants to avoid strains with moscow now that the soviets 
have expressed support for their revolution 
while seeking aid from the soviets the new romanian leaders are 
also cultivating ties with the west severely damaged in recent 
years by ceausescus human rights policies and selfimposed 
isolation in international affairs 
otto lambsdorff former westgerman economics minister and 
influential head of the free democrats the junior partner in the 
bonn government visited bucharest thursday to discuss economic 
aid 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and french 
premier roland dumas are expected next week foreign ministry 
spokesman constantin girbea said 
romanias new government has pledged to move the country toward 
democracy and to hold free elections in april meantime it has 
overturned many of ceausescus most hated decrees legalizing 
abortion street demonstrations and free travel private property 
has been reinstated for peasants and the death penalty abolished 
but many romanians still are wary that the new leadershave too 
many links with the old communist party 
men like provisional president ion iliescu and brucan rose under 
communism to high positions only to fall from ceausescus favor 
and spend years in political isolation 
brucan said the provisional government plans to present a new 
election law by the end of january 
in a reversal of earlier declarations by the national salvation 
front brucan said the front intends to field candidates in the 
planned april elections and will take part with all its might 
the halfdozen parties that would also run say they lack the 
resources and the time for a fair contest against the front which 
controls the mass media 
in another development thursday news reports said families 
whose homes were destroyed in fierce fighting in bucharest after 
ceausescu was overthrown will move into spacious apartments built 
for the late dictators associates 
the daily newspaper truth which replaced the communist party 
daily after the revolution said 110 of the apartments built along 
the boulevard of the victory of socialism the dictators pet 
project will be turned over to homeless familiesn

first lady barbara bush has undergone the 
second of 10 radiation treatments for eye irritation caused by her 
immune system disease 
the 64yearold first lady received the 10minute radiation dose 
early thursday at walter reed army medical center she suffered no 
aftereffects and returned to the white house for her normal daily 
activities said her press secretary anna perez 
mrs bush is undergoing 10 consecutive days of radiation 
treatments in an effort to eliminate swelling behind her eyes that 
has caused her double vision and tearing for months 
the eye problem results from graves disease a condition in 
which the thyroid gland becomes overactive the condition was 
diagnosed last winter and an earlier radioactive treatment and 
drugs rendered the thyroid inactive 
treatment with a powerful steroid prednisone has failed to 
correct the eye disorder so doctors are using lowintensity 
radiation aimed at swelling in the small muscles that control the 
eyes as the next therapy

the bush administration considered but 
rejected the idea of proposing new taxes on various materials in an 
effort to encourage recycling an administration official says 
the official who spoke on condition he not be named said 
thursday that the proposal had been given a good chance of becoming 
part of the presidents fiscal 1991 budget request to congress but 
that it was finally rejected by the office of management and budget 
omb director richard darman stripped the proposed tax along 
with other socalled user fees to avoid charges from 
congressional democrats that president bush was violating his 
nonewtaxes pledge the official said 
the proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper glass

a federal agency says it began a record number 
of investigations of possible automobile safety defects in 1989 
but a consumer advocacy group charges that the phony numbers 
are a smoke screen 
the national highway traffic safety administration said thursday 
that it launched 213 defect investigations last year the highest 
number in its 20year history 
additionally the agency said it influenced a record 7 percent 
of the recalls ordered in 1989 when 67 million vehicles were 
recalled for safety problems 
but the center for auto safety a watchdog group accused the 
agency of reporting meaningless statistics to mask a poor 
performance 
those are phony numbers said clarence ditlow the centers 
executive director what theyre doing is creating a smoke screen 
to conceal from the public that theyre not enforcing the mandatory 
recall law 
the center repeatedly has complained that under the reagan 
administration the agency abandoned investigations that should 
have produced recalls the agency said it pursued recalls when 
needed but discontinued probes when it was plain there was no 
widespread safety problem 
the agency should not boast of influencing the highest 
percentage of recalls ever when the number of recalls was well 
below those of the late 1970s ditlow said 
jeffrey miller deputy administrator of the national highway 
transportation safety administration acknowledged that recalls 
rose in the late 1970s and fell in the early 1980s but said both 
trends resulted largely from tire problems that were corrected 
there was a steady upward trend in recalls in the late 1980s he 
said

two candidates who ran against each other in 1978 
for state attorney general again are vying for the same office 
this time for governor 
democrat francis x bellotti and republican william weld made 
separate announcements thursday with both taking swipes at gov 
michael s dukakis the democratic governor who is not seeking 
reelection and with both positioning themselves as outsiders who 
could solve the states fiscal problems 
bellotti 66 served 12 years as attorney general before 
stepping down in 1986 he was elected lieutenant governor in 1962 
and ran for governor unsucessfully in 1964 
weld 44 went on to become us attorney for massachusetts and 
assistant us attorney general after his defeat by bellotti 
both men said they would offer voters a change from the dukakis 
style bellotti in particular said he would take back the state 
from technocrats and team players 
massachusetts has become like the auto industry of a 
generation gone by we cannot solve our problems by adding chrome 
fins and more fuel to an already unwieldy machine bellotti said 
he said the most important issue facing the next governor will 
be to turn around a state economy clearly in a decline 
bellotti has opposed new taxes but has not gone as far as weld 
who took a nonewtaxes pledge after delivering his announcement 
speech 
absolutely four years no new taxes weld said when asked 
if he would oppose any tax increases as governor 
while outlining the serious fiscal problems he said the state 
must face weld said the state still has its greatest economic 
strenth a welleducated work force 
the same brainpower energy and determination that made us the 
center of the hightech revolution can also place us at the center 
of the global economic revolution that lies ahead in the 90s 
weld said 
bellotti faces lt gov evelyn murphy and house taxation 
committee chairman john flood of canton in the democratic primary 
election in addition boston university president john silber is 
gearing up to run and boston mayor raymond flynn has not ruled out 
a bid 
weld faces house minority leader steven pierce of westfield

six main prodemocracy groups said they are 
forming a coalition for elections in may but the groups are 
divided over economic and foreign policy issues that will be 
central to the campaign 
also thursday a parliamentary commission investigating 
corruption charges against ousted communist officials reported that 
doctors were checking erich honecker to determine if the countrys 
disgraced former leader could be imprisoned 
honecker 77 suffers from complications from gall bladder 
surgery last august he will have to be moved from the exclusive 
residential compound where he was under house arrest after his 
ouster on oct 18 because the complex is being converted to a 
facility for the handicapped 
adn the official news agency said the police cordon around 
honeckers home had been lifted weeks ago and that the government 
was looking for a suitable place to move him while the corruption 
investigation continues 
the government also said it wants to revive some intelligence 
activities following last months decision to disband the state 
security agency 
prodemocracy opposition forces have demanded that no secret 
police activities be carried out until a new government is seated 
after the may 6 elections 
in announcing the formation of a prodemocracy coalition social 
democratic party leader steffen reiche said a united front against 
the communists was needed because reform groups were being wrongly 
cast as sympathetic with rightist causes 
some of the opposition groups have shown more interest than the 
communists in joining in a confederation with west germany 
although most have carefully avoided discussion of formal 
reunification 
the new coalition called election alliance 90 includes new 
forum social democratic party democratic awakening democracy 
now the initiative for peace and human rights and the united left 
detlef poge of new forum the largest opposition group conceded 
that the groups are so divided on how the economy should be 
restored that he doubted they could agree on a single position to 
push in the elections 
everyone is so preoccupied with political problems that the 
economic crisis is being ignored and thats dangerous poge told 
the associated press 
as the opposition stumbles the communists advantage of 40 
years in power and strong political organization becomes more 
apparent 
the communists still draw more voter support than any other 
single political party and they have been stirring voter concern 
over the issue of a rightist resurgence 
the communists were stripped of their constitutional mandate to 
rule on dec 1 reducing them to the status of other political 
forces and transferring the leadership role to the premier instead 
of the party chief 
unlike the reform movement in neighboring czechoslovakia east 
german activists are disorganized and in some cases at odds with 
their own members 
more than a dozen groups representing social interests from the 
environment to womens issues are taking part in weekly 
negotiations with the communists and other established political 
parties to draft reforms and advise the interim government 
but the talks have been mired in bureaucratic infighting from 
their dec 7 start 
leaders of the democracy now group have advocated a gradual 
reunification with west germany while new forum and the social 
democrats contend east german must remain a sovereign nation 
the opposition forces also disagree about how much western 
investment should be permitted to ease the nations economic 
crisis another divisive issue is whether east germany should rely 
on nuclear energy instead of the polluting brown coal that fires 
much of the nations industry 
new forum suffers a rift within its membership with one 
breakaway branch planning to form a political party on jan 27 the 
main group rejects formal organization as a political force 
new forum on thursday proposed that reform supporters start an 
independent newspaper and begin publishing weekly by the end of the 
month 
adn said printing facilities editorial offices and money for 
operating the newspaper would have to be raised through donations 
nine leading reform activists issued an appeal for support theu 
promised the weekly to be called the others would address an 
array of political and economic issues

president saddam hussein today proposed a 
threepoint plan for reviving stalled peace negotiations with iran 
including direct meetings and an unconditional release of ailing 
and disabled prisoners 
saddam also praised his countrys advanced arms industry and 
warned israel against attacking iraqi scientific or military 
installations after the recent launch of longrange missiles and a 
rocket reportedly capable of putting a satellite in space 
the iraqi president spoke in a 30minute address aired live by 
radio and television to mark the 69th anniversary of the creation 
of the iraqi army 
we are seeking to open a new door for a dignified peace with 
iran he said 
fighting in the eightyear iraniraq war was halted by a 
ceasefire that went into effect aug 20 1988 us and european 
military analysts have estimated that 1 million people were killed 
and 17 million wounded twothirds of them iranians 
the war grew out of border skirmishes between iran and iraq 
after the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini took power in iran in 
1979 
but iran and iraq had been in dispute for years over the 
120mile shattalarab waterway the confluence of the tigris and 
euphrates rivers that flows into the persian gulf and forms the 
southern boundary between the two countries 
to revive the peace talks saddam suggested that direct 
meetings between representatives of both leaderships be held 
alternately in tehran and baghdad under the auspices of the 
secretariatgeneral of the united nations 
the direct dialogue will aim at reaching a common 
understanding of the clauses of un security council resolution 
598 and fix a timetable for its implementation provided that 
the talks are completed within a period not exceeding three 
months 
the security council adopted the resolution in july 1987 a year 
later both countries agreed to it and stopped the fighting but 
peace talks launched under un sponsorship after the truce were 
quickly deadlocked 
tehran refused to discuss a settlement before iraq withdraw from 
lands it occupied before the ceasefire and baghdad insisted on 
working out a new border demarcation accord that gives it total 
sovereignty over shattalarab waterway 
under a prewar accord the border between the two countries ran 
down the middle of the waterway which forms iraqs sole outlet to 
the gulf 
iran claims iraq holds 1065 square miles of its territory but 
un experts say the iraqis occupy only 260 square miles 
as a second step toward renewing the peace talks saddam 
proposed an immediate exchange of all wounded and sick prisoners 
of war under the supervision of the international committee of the 
red cross 
that he said would be followed by the release of the 
longestheld pows mainly those captured in the early stages of the 
war which broke out in september 1980 
he also called for registering thousands of prisoners who have 
not been included in lists provided to the red cross 
the red cross has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 
19284 in iraqi camps but un officials and diplomats say both 
sides together hold at least 100000 pows 
the red cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and 
crippled pows immediately after the ceasefire but the accord 
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with iran and 
iraq accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who 
were seeking asylum 
the red cross estimates 1000 ailing or disabled pows are still 
held by both sides

yellowstone national park 
officials are warning visitors to keep their distance from coyotes 
in the park following the attack of a skier by one of the animals 
park rangers have been searching for the coyote that may have 
attacked brian dean 27 on wednesday sending him to a montana 
hospital where doctors were deciding whether to begin rabies 
treatments on the man 
dean an employee of the parks concessionaire was attacked 
while he was crosscountry skiing alone near the biscuit basin 
park spokeswoman joan anzelmo said the oak lawn ill man 
spotted the animal while coming down a hill but had no chance to 
stop or go around it the coyote then knocked dean to the ground 
and attacked him while dean beat the animal with one of his skis 
dean suffered lacerations and puncture wounds to his head neck 
and arms he was able to ski to a nearby road where a snowmobiler 
gave him a ride to old faithful from there he was taken to west 
yellowstone mont he was reported in good condition at deaconess 
hospital in bozeman mont 
the attack the most severe in the park involving a coyote since 
at least the early 1970s was one of several recent incidents in 
which coyotes acted bold or aggressive toward humans anzelmo said 
the message is clearly please dont approach the wildlife 
dont feed the wildlife and be especially cautious around coyotes 
you may happen to see she said the extent of this attack is 
extremely rare but when coyotes become habituated to people they 
will get bold 
a week ago a mother used a ski pole to fend off a coyote that 
charged her young son near biscuit basin and in another incident 
one of the animals jumped over the lap of a woman sitting on a 
bench near the old faithful geyser said anzelmo 
officials believe the animals have become used to humans because 
of visitors who have been giving the coyotes handouts she added 
they become habituated to people and conditioned to 
handouts she said they expect handouts and get bolder and 
bolder most of the time you can scare them away but some animals 
at old faithful can get quite bold 
she added that reports of beggar coyotes have been common in 
the park in past years and officials often heard reports of the 
animals approaching or running into people

after many years of internment and 
waiting the first group of former vietnamese reeducation camp 
inmates allowed to resettle in the united states arrived in the 
thai capital today 
a total of 156 inmates and their families arrived on morning and 
afternoon charter flights from ho chi minh city a us embassy 
spokesman said many will go to california after a week in a thai 
immigration facility 
their arrival began the first major resettlement of the former 
inmates some of whom were interned for more than a decade because 
they served the usbacked south vietnam government that communist 
forces toppled in april 1975 
i cannot say how happy i am after all these years said 
nguyen cao son who taught at a south vietnam military academy 
during the war 
he said he was held for nearly three years of reeducation then 
jailed for three years for trying to flee the country by boat in 
the late 1970s 
i have come to the free world said nguyen thuong hiep who 
sat with his wife and two children at bangkok airport everyone 
loves their country but our country suffers 
ho van phuoc a former army helicopter pilot said he saw about 
25 people shot for trying to flee one of the camps and many others 
died of disease 
two daughters of one former inmate wore white lace dresses and 
red ribbons in their hair to celebrate the occasion 
but nguyen hoang bich van the 18yearold daughter of one 
former inmate was not as happy she left behind a boyfriend and 
other friends 
hundreds of thousands of people were put into camps for manual 
labor and political study because of their ties with the former 
government 
vietnam has released large numbers of people from the camps in 
recent years and foreign minister nguyen co thach said in june that 
only about 120 people remained in custody 
like others nguyen cao son said he hoped for democratic changes 
in vietnam that would allow him to return home one day he said 
there were a few demonstrations there last year and that he hoped 
the government would accommodate the peoples wishes 
we dont want a situation like that in romania to happen in 
vietnam he said 
nearly 2000 former inmates and their families will leave 
vietnam by the end of march said richard kocher head of the 
office in thailand of the international organization for migration 
officials had no overall figure on the number of former 
prisoners to be resettled under an agreement reached last july the 
us negotiator senior state department official robert l 
funseth said then that it would help heal the last big wound 
remaining from the war 
kocher said us officials began interviewing the former 
detainees and conducting medical examinations in late october 
the united states has resettled hundreds of thousands of 
vietnamese since the war but political bickering and other 
problems barred progress on the former reeducation inmates 
a us source in bangkok has said washington estimated there 
were about 100000 vietnamese with reeducation connections among 
the 600000 who have applied to emigrate to the united states the 
vietnamese government estimated former inmates and their families 
total 550000 people he said

a crippled iranian tanker that spilled 
millions of gallons of oil off the moroccan coast was turned away 
today by portugal 
iran said the 100squaremile spill occurred when the tanker 
the khark 5 exploded last month after one of its storage tanks was 
damaged in a storm 
there has been no leakage from the tankers two ruptured storage 
tanks since monday according to the dutch salvage company smit 
tak the 283632ton ships original cargo was 72 million gallons 
of crude oil 
but nearby countries were turning the ship away from ports where 
it could transfer its remaining cargo of crude to a second vessel 
a portuguese navy patrol boat was escorting the khark 5 away 
from the portuguese island of madeira north of the canaries after 
the tanker entered its territorial waters there the national news 
agency lusa said today 
morocco also has refused the tanker safe haven and the spanish 
merchant marine denied a request by the ships owners to tow the 
1837foot vessel to calm waters off the southern coast of tenerife 
in the canary islands a government official said 
smit tak which is commanding the three tugs towing the khark 5 
said an empty national iranian oil co tanker the shir khooh was 
headed to meet the khark 5 
if the khark 5 is unable to go to a nearby island smit tak said 
it planned to tow the tanker to the cape verde archipelago through 
more than 1200 miles of open seas south of the ships current 
position the country is a former portuguese colony off the west 
african coast 
the tanker was 400 miles north of las palmas in the canary 
islands on dec 19 when an explosion ripped open its hull 
creating an oil slick that crept toward the moroccan coastline 
oil from the tanker could still reach the moroccan coast but 
the 19 milliongallon spill has dissipated and no longer poses the 
major environmental threat it had in recent days experts said 
thursday 
they said more than 90 percent of the spill had either 
evaporated dissolved in the sea broken up in high waves or been 
dispersed by chemicals sprayed on the water to fight the slick 
darko domovic a technical expert with the center said only 
remnants of oil could wash ashore over the next two months 
there is very very little oil left on the sea surface he 
said it would only be a question of normal cleanup with buckets 
and spades 
hundreds of sailors laid floating barriers to stop the oils 
advance toward the moroccan oyster farming town of oualidyia where 
the leading edge of the oil was 20 miles off the coast thursday 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said a storm ripped a 
hole in one of the tankers storage tanks causing the explosion 
that started the leak 
aqazadeh said reports of environmental damage caused by the 
spill were exaggerated and that the ship met all safety 
specifications 
the vessel built in 1975 was damaged at least three times in 
iraqi air strikes in the persian gulf during the iraniraq war the 
normal life span of a tanker of its size is 15 to 20 years

the government has quietly released three beijing 
college students jailed for taking part in the spring democracy 
movement and chinese sources said today that other activists also 
have been released recently 
however they said the releases do not indicate a softening of 
chinese leaders opposition to democratic reform 
they said additional soldiers were brought into beijing after 
the romanian revolution last month prompted protest attempts here 
and illegal posters at several beijing campuses 
most soldiers are inside walled compounds in the city and 
military bases in the suburbs and the increased presence could not 
be detected 
it is widely believed however that troops and police have been 
on alert for the past two weeks with all leaves canceled and that 
plans to lift martial law were called off martial law was imposed 
in beijing in may during massive prodemocracy protests that were 
crushed by the army june 34 
college students said three students from the beijing college of 
aeronautics who were arrested during the summer returned to their 
dormitories thursday night they were pale from their incarceration 
but said they had been treated well in jail fellow students said 
the school refused to say if the three would be allowed to 
return to class 
other sources said some older intellectuals who supported the 
protests also have been released in the past few weeks but no 
figures were available none of those released was prominent in the 
protests 
a school official at the beijing college of aeronautics was 
quoted as telling students there that some students not only at 
this school but seven others wanted to demonstrate in support of 
the romanian rebellion which led to the ouster of stalinist leader 
nicolae ceausescu the official warned the chinese students not to 
protest saying it would affect their lives 
more than 100 students at the aeronautics college tried last 
week to bicycle in a group off campus without any posters in a 
silent show of support for romanias uprising but they were 
stopped at the gate sources there said 
similar efforts also were reported previously at two other 
schools but the officials comments were the first indication that 
protest efforts were so widespread one source said security forces 
have been authorized to shoot if necessary to stop students from 
marching off campuses 
four illegal protest posters also were reported at beijing 
university beijing normal university and qinghua university during 
the romanian street fighting 
there have been scattered unofficial reports of worker unrest in 
beijing shanghai and chifeng in inner mongolia however 
authorities refuse to answer questions about unrest or protests 
creating a climate in which rumors flourish and confirmation is 
almost impossible to obtain 
under martial law regulations all questions and requests for 
interviews must be submitted to the beijing city foreign affairs 
office which generally does not respond

he would wake up before dawn put on 
baggy shorts and do calisthenics on the patio later he would don 
a white robe and a crucifix and try to persuade manuel antonio 
noriega to get out of his house 
as the vaticans ambassador in panama monsignor sebastian laboa 
became the reluctant host to the fugitive military dictator on 
christmas eve four days after 26000 us troops descended on 
panama city to topple noriega 
for 10 days the papal mission was a building under siege 
surrounded by barbed wire soldiers in battle array tanks and 
helicopters 
the 67yearold laboa short a bit plump his gray hair 
receding is both a priest and a lawyer and is considered savvy 
open and street smart 
he needed all those qualities in the stalemate that followed 
in the end embassy officials told noriega that if he didnt 
give up the panamanian government would be invited in to take him 
out said the rev javier villanueva assistant to the papal nunio 
a senior bush administration official said laboa gave noriega a 
noon thursday deadline to get out 
noriega walked out of the embassy wednesday night surrendered 
to us forces and was flown to florida to face federal 
drugtrafficking charges 
it was not the first time laboa found himself at the center of a 
panamanian political firestorm 
he sheltered guillermo endara after a coup attempt failed to 
overthrow noriega in october endara led the opposition to noriega 
and now is president 
laboa also mediated between the basque separatist organization 
eta and the spanish government of prime minister felipe gonzalez 
besides noriega and a handful of his henchmen four eta members 
sought refuge at the embassy 
laboa said little publicly as he labored through sticky 
negotiations with us military officials who made their 
headquarters at the st agustin church school across from the 
vatican mission 
the papal nuncio was their exclusive conduit to noriega and when 
the former dictator surrendered wednesday night laboa was given 
most of the credit 
father laboa was the most instrumental person in making this 
happen said maj gen marc cisneros commander of us army 
south 
noriega did not find life comfortable inside the twostory 
compound he slept in a small room with a submachine gun under his 
bed 
just in case noriega got ideas laboa told the troops outside 
they could storm the mission if the former strongman took hostages 
laboa kept noriega in strict isolation forbade the embassy 
staff to talk with him let noriegas faulty television set stay on 
the blink and refused to feed him vegetarian meals noriega does 
not eat meat 
on new years eve the priest served noriega pasta one of 
laboas favorite foods 
born in the northern basque town of san juan guipuzcoa in spain 
laboa became a priest at the age of 26 and a lawyer in italy six 
years later he became pope john paul iis representative in panama 
in 1982 
he was visiting salamanca in spain when the us troops invaded 
and hurried back to panama 
noriega wasnt the only one laboa kept under control 
he also had to deal with hundreds of us soldiers who ringed 
the embassy around the clock 
the soldiers set up an outdoor system with four powerful 
speakers and blasted the building with rock heavy metal rap and 
country music 
laboa was not amused word went out that steps would be 
taken if the racket didnt stop it did 
during the first confusing days of noriegas sanctuary troops 
searched laboas car on at least one occasion and he was detained 
while soldiers rummaged in the car for weapons and nondiplomatic 
personnel noriega they hoped 
from a nearby hotel hundreds of reporters and photographers with 
zoom and special night lenses kept vigil 
at dawn laboa would emerge wearing a sweatshirt bearing with 
the word gago a local supermarket he would bend stretch and 
walk at a fast pace on the embassys palmshrouded patio 
in the afternoon he darted in and out of the black iron embassy 
gates in a long white robe spending hours with us officials 
in the end laboas patience wore thin and he was losing some 
of his popularity 
hours before noriegas surrender 20000 demonstrators marched 
to the embassy demanding the unwanted guest be kicked out 
we respect the catholic church read one sign but excuse 
us we dont respect you monsignor laboa 
vatican embassy officials said laboa told noriega bluntly that 
the buildings diplomatic immunity would be lifted at some point 
gen maxwell thurman commander of the southern command in 
charge of the panama invasion said the united states owed laboa 
special thanks 
he said the priest showed extraordinary competence and 
statesmanlike conduct

foreign minister pik botha 
back from his first trip to eastern europe said today his 
government hopes to establish diplomatic relations with hungary and 
possibly other longhostile warsaw pact countries 
botha also said his government sought to attract eastern 
europeans to south africa to ease a manpower shortage in skilled 
jobs antiapartheid groups have denounced the recruitment 
campaign saying the government should be training blacks rather 
than wooing white immigrants 
in budapest botha met thursday with hungarian foreign minister 
guyla horn hungarys national mti news agency reported afterward 
both sides expressed their intention to gradually establish 
official relations 
the african national congress which for decades has received 
soviet bloc backing for its guerrilla campaign against 
whiteminority rule accused hungary of betraying south africas 
black majority and forming a racist partnership with apartheid 
however botha told reporters before leaving budapest that no 
agreements were concluded with hungary and horn reminded botha 
that hungary opposes any kind of racial national or ethnic 
discrimination and condemns all manifestations of apartheid mti 
said 
at a news conference today at johannesburgs airport botha said 
the two countries would investigate possible cooperation in trade 
industrial development and tourism he said south africans could 
now travel to hungary without any problem 
asked about the prospect of formal ties with other eastern 
european countries botha replied there is already contact and 
we are talking 
before eastern europes recent political upheavals warsaw pact 
nations were aligned closely with most third world countries in 
vehement opposition to south africas whitecontrolled government 
this alliance advocated isolation of south africa as a means of 
forcing an end to its racial segregation policies and bringing 
about blackmajority rule 
hungary was one of the first east bloc countries to accept 
reform in october its ruling communist party was disbanded in 
favor of a party that swore allegiance to democratic ideals on 
march 25 hungary is scheduled to hold its first multiparty 
elections since 1948 
alfred nzo secretarygeneral of the african national congress 
said hungarys decision to receive botha demonstrated bad faith 
and a cynical disregard for international agreements 
only 10 days ago representatives of the hungarian government 
assured the anc that they have no contact with the apartheid 
regime he said accusing the hungarians of trying to betray 
the majority of the people of south africa by forming a racist 
partnership with apartheid 
hungary cannot expect to maintain normal relations with the 
peoples of africa while it befriends the enemy of our continent 
he said 
botha said he and horn discussed the possibility of a gradually 
broadening relationship that would include interest offices 
consular offices and eventually embassies 
but this will depend on what happens in south africa and 
hungary over the next few months he said 
bothas twoday stay was the first known visit by a senior south 
african official to a warsaw pact country while there he said his 
government is committed to forging a new constitution that would 
end white domination 
mti said hungary is prepared to hold dialogue with south 
africa parallel to maintaining its position against apartheid 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp in a commentary 
today on bothas trip said the hostility shown by the united 
states congress and others through sanctions makes it imperative 
that new friendships and partnerships be formed it suggested the 
east bloc might seek to tap south africans mining expertise 
there is real hope that south africa is poised to start 
breaking out of her international isolation the network said

the story behind a grim innercity shooting that 
stirred racial fears turned out to be a lie as the storyteller 
committed suicide after his brother implicated him authorities 
said 
the body of charles stuart who became a sympathetic figure as 
the suburban victim of a boston shooting that killed his pregnant 
wife and left him wounded was pulled from the boston harbor 
stuarts tale to police was that he and his 30yearold wife 
carol were robbed and shot by a black man after they left a 
childbirth class oct 23 stuart a fur store manager also 
reportedly identified a black man in a police lineup as the killer 
the story suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan 
said is not true 
mrs stuart a lawyer died hours after the shooting the 
stuarts son delivered by caesarean section died 17 days later 
hospitalized at the time his wife was buried a letter from 
stuart was read at the funeral 
now you sleep away from me he wrote ill never know the 
feeling of your hand in mine but i will always feel you i miss 
you and i love you 
gov michael dukakis and mayor raymond flynn were among those 
who attended the funeral flynn had called stuart a hero for 
directing police to his wife by their car phone despite being 
wounded himself 
the whole case did the entire city an injustice flynn said 
thursday ive been on this earth 50 years and ive read a lot 
of suspense stories but ive not heard anything as bizarre and 
troubling as this 
blacks also reacted angrily because the story touched the 
worst fears among white america about black innercity violence 
when it exploded in headlines and on news reports nationwide 
black people in particular have to look at it and wonder what 
hope we have for justice in a country that took this mans lie and 
made him and his family a symbol of national mourning said chuck 
turner director of the center for community action of the 
episcopal city mission in bostons largely black roxbury section 
authorities were theorizing that stuarts motive in the slaying 
was to collect life insurance policies taken out on his wife the 
boston globe and boston herald reported today both newspapers 
quoted unidentified sources 
stuart recently collected 83000 from a 100000 policy on his 
wife the globe reported citing a source within an unidentified 
insurance company the newspaper said the policies on his wife 
totaled at least 500000 
police said there were reports that charles stuart had tested 
positive for cocaine after the shooting the herald reported today 
prosecutors who spoke on the record said there was no evidence of 
an insurance motive or drug involvement 
stuart 29 jumped off the 300foot tobin bridge hours after his 
brothers disclosures to authorities he left a suicide note in his 
car 
flanagan said the case remained active but he refused to 
disclose details or the contents of the suicide note 
basically its fair to say he could not handle the 
allegations or statements made about him the prosecutor said 
flanagan said he ordered police to arrest stuart in his wifes 
killing but police could not find him late wednesday or early 
thursday officials said stuart apparently knew he was a suspect 
but they did not say how he knew 
a black man william bennett had been identified in news 
accounts as a suspect he was never charged in the stuart case and 
the prosecutor has now cleared him 
bennett said that was not enough 
my life and my familys lives have been ruined and no one is 
willing to take responsibility he said 
stuarts 23yearold brother matthew a paint factory employee 
who was a pallbearer at mrs stuarts funeral had long suspected 
that his brothers account of the shooting was false according to 
his attorney john perenyi 
he stepped forward with his fears on wednesday because he was 
afraid an innocent man might be charged perenyi said adding that 
his client offered no explanation for why his brother might have 
committed the crime 
he was really at a loss to give me a motive he said he 
didnt think his brother was into gambling drinking or other 
women 
on the night of the shooting matthew stuart said his brother 
had asked him to meet him near the hospital where the stuarts had 
attended the childbirth class according to perenyi 
matthew stuart said his brother told him he would pass a bag to 
him through the car window he said he took the bag which included 
a nickelplated snubnosed revolver according to perenyi the 
lawyer said matthew stuart did not see mrs stuart in the front 
seat 
a search thursday of the pines river in stuarts hometown of 
revere turned up evidence mentioned by matthew stuart including a 
gucci bag wallet makeup and other personal belongings of mrs 
stuart the gun was not found

solidarity leader lech walesa has donated 
the 200000 he received for winning the nobel peace prize to a 
fund created to rebuild the country 
walesa made the announcement in a statement released at the 
solidarity trade union headquarters in gdansk on thursday 
the nobel prize i received in 1983 was at the same time a 
prize for the whole movement of reforms called solidarity the 
desire to give the prize money for a most worthy purpose held me 
back against a hasty decision walesa said 
today the fact that solidarity has taken over responsibility 
for the country in such a difficult period for society makes me 
donate the sum of 200000 to the national gift fund he said 
reviving a prewar tradition of appealing to the nation for 
help the national assembly approved the creation of a national 
gift fund in early december 
people may donate anything from cash to jewelry to the fund 
which will be used to help the country and citizens who face 
financial problems as the country moves toward a marketoriented 
economy 
last year was one of triumph for solidarity the independent 
trade union movement founded more than nine years ago in gdansk 
solidarity swept to victory in prarliamentary elections in june 
walesas adviser tadeusz mazowiecki was elected in august to be 
the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister 
despite its political victories the solidarityled government 
faces a major challenge in introducing marketoriented economic 
reforms that are almost sure to leave poles worse off in the short 
run

thousands of bulgarias majority slavs 
walked off their jobs today in at least five cities to protest a 
new policy restoring moslem names and religious rights to ethnic 
turks 
bulgarian radio said the protests paralyzed the southern city of 
kardzhali and caused disruptions in the other cities bulgarian 
radio reported 
the radio said thousands of workers from all enterprises went on 
strike in kardzhali and public transportation was halted strikes 
and mass protests also took place today in plovdiv bulgarias 
second largest city as well as in the northern cities of ruse 
razgrad and silistra 
the report described the situation as particularly tense in 
kardzhali in which nearly half of the 50000 residents are ethnic 
turks 
petar mladenov the communist party chief and president was 
expected to arrive in kardzhali to assess the nationalistic 
protests 
the bulgarian communist leadership adopted a policy on dec 29 
that allows bulgarian turks to use their moslem names the policy 
reversed measures in effect under the ousted hardline communist 
leader todor zhivkov in which moslems were given slav names and 
their religious rites were restricted 
addressing thousands of demonstrators in plovdiv pantalei 
pachov a member of the politburo and the citys first party 
secretary said the central committee decision allowing free choice 
of names had been premature assured the protesters that the 
measure would be reconsidered 
the turkishspeaking citizens demand their own schools they 
do not raise bulgarian flags at their demonstrations they have 
rejected our stretchedout hand pachov said 
thousands of people demonstrated in front of parliament in sofia 
on thursday demanding a national referendum on the ethnic 
question protests also took place in kardzhali and several other 
cities 
bulgarian newspapers today carried a joint statement issued by 
the ruling communist party and the opposition expressing full 
support for the dec 29 decision regarding ethnic rights 
the state news agency bta reported spokesmen for the communist 
party and the democratic opposition as rejecting a proposed 
referendum on the ethnic decision saying the validity of human 
rights in bulgaria cannot be submitted to any referendum 
about 320000 turks fled this summer when zhivkov permitted them 
to get passports nearly all of them complained about persecution 
and the denial of essential religious and ethnic rights the exodus 
ended when turkey unable to take more immigrants closed their 
borders 
about 15 million of bulgarias 9 million people are moslem 
nationalists have doubted the loyalties of the bulgarian turks 
since bulgaria declared independence from the ottoman empire which 
had ruled it for 500 years 
zhivkov was ousted nov 10 amid a wave of democratic reforms 
that have swept eastern europe mladenov considered more moderate 
took over and promised free elections and dismantled secret police 
units 
parliament is expected to pave the way for a pluralistic 
political system jan 15 when it votes on removing a constitutional 
clause guaranteeing the communist partys hold on power bulgaria

the vatican embassy pressured manuel 
noriega to surrender to us troops by threatening to ask 
panamanian authorities to come in after the highly dangerous 
criminal a spokesman said 
we would have lifted the diplomatic immunity said the rev 
javier villanueva assisant to the papal nuncio 
he made the disclosure thursday as panamanians assessed the cost 
of the twoyear struggle over noriegas ouster which was completed 
wednesday when he left the vatican embassy and was whisked off by 
us troops to florida to face federal drugtrafficking charges 
noriegas arrest led to festive street celebrations but 
panamanians must now face an economy battered in large part by the 
invasion and by us sanctions aimed at toppling noriega 
maj gen marc cisneros commander of us army south said 
there was no remaining fighting or guerrilla activity on thursday 
the whole country is pretty well pacified cisneros said he 
said all 16000 members of noriegas defense forces had been 
accounted for but he did not say where they were 
villanueva said embassy officials didnt give noriega a deadline 
to leave but made his choices clear 
if he would not have given himself up the panamanian 
government not the us government would have been invited to 
send in forces to take him out villanueva said in a telephone 
interview 
in washington however a senior bush adminstration official 
said the papal nuncio monsignor sebastian laboa gave noriega a 
thursday noon deadline to get out meaning he would no longer be 
a welcome guest 
us troops had ringed the mission since noriega took refuge 
there on christmas eve four days after the american invasion 
crushed his military regime and installed a civilian government 
cisneros said noriega kept a machine gun under his bed during 
his entire 10day stay at the mission which would have made it 
difficult for embassy staff to remove him forcibly 
villanueva said the lifting of diplomatic immunity would not 
have been considered if noriega had been a political prisoner 
but this man is a highly dangerous criminal he said 
noriega claimed he was a political prisoner in refusing to enter 
a plea to drugtrafficking charges in miami the judge entered an 
innocent plea for him and he was held without bond 
cisneros said noriega showed no emotion when he left the vatican 
mission 
when he walked out of the nunciatura he was normal in other 
words he wasnt strutting or defeated he was just walking 
expressionless he said 
todays editions of the washington times said that once he was 
aboard the floridabound military transport plane noriega began to 
cry and told us drug agents he had really put my foot in it 
this time 
he carried a bible in one hand and three catholic rosaries in 
another when they brought him to the plane the times quoted a 
source familiar with the flight as saying he was very depressed 
although tranquil one agent read him sriptures from the bible in 
spanish during the flight 
the source who was not identified said noriega told the agents 
he had chosen to surrender but now believed he may have made a 
mistake 
a top noriega adviser and head of his secret police lt col 
nivaldo madrinan walked out of the mission on thursday and 
surrendered to us troops 
the new government of president guillermo endara preferred to 
have noriega go directly into us hands 
endara has said panama has no prison secure enough to hold him 
and the judicial system was inadequate to prosecute him also 
several panamanian officials have said there was no law that would 
allow his extradition 
endara said his governments priorities are 
reconstruction of chorrillo the lowincome neighborhood 
around the defense forces headquarters that was destroyed in the 
us invasion 
organization of a security force 
to make sure the military occupation is as brief as 
possible 
reconstruction of the economy which has suffered so much 
panamas economy once flourished on international banking and 
trade but it skidded to a nearhalt after the united states began 
imposing sanctions nearly two years ago to press for noriegas 
ouster as chief of the defense forces

light trucks and vans would have the same 
crash protection devices as those required for passenger cars under 
a proposed federal regulation 
the installation of air bags or automatic safety belts in the 
front seat of these vehicles could save as many as 2000 lives a 
year said jerry r curry administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration 
the agency said thursday that it would phase in the new 
requirement over three years as it did with the rule on crash 
protection for cars 
under the regulation 20 percent of the vans light trucks 
multipurpose passenger vehicles and small buses manufactured in the 
1994 model year would be required to provide the bags or automatic 
safety belts 
the safety features would be required on 50 percent of the 1995 
model vehicles and on all of those manufactured in 1996 
under the rule vehicles that offer a drivers side air bag 
could have a manual safety belt on the passenger side and still 
comply with the agencys standard through the 1997 model year but 
manufacturers that dont provide a drivers side air bag would have 
to install automatic belts for the driver and on the frontseat 
passenger side 
we are encouraging air bags as the technology of choice 
because air bags in combination with existing lap and shoulder 
belts offer the best protection available curry said 
all new passenger cars sold in the united states now must have 
air bags or automatic belts 
they are saving thousands of lives and preventing tens of 
thousands of serious injuries each year curry said the same 
protection should be given to those who choose to buy todays 
popular minivans and light trucks 
deaths and injuries to light truck riders increased from 6500 
in 1984 to 8300 in 1988 he said number of the vehicles sold also 
have increased 
the agencys move drew praise from sen jack danforth rmo 
ranking republican on the senate commerce committee and a longtime 
air bag proponent 
air bag technology has been around since the early 1960s but 
only this year did we see large numbers of cars with air bags 
danforth said we should not go through another long struggle to 
get air bags into the vehicles now used frequently by families 
the rule would apply to all vans trucks buses and multipurpose 
vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8500 pounds and an 
unloaded vehicle weight of 5500 pounds or less 
included would be motor homes convertibles openbodytype 
vehicles walkin vantype trucks and vehicles carrying 
chassismounted campers 
also under the rule light trucks and passenger cars with only 
two seating positions would have to be equipped to support a child 
safety seat on the passenger side 
the announcement opens a 60day period for public comment on the 
proposed rule afterward the agency will write a final version and 
set a date for implementing it

trend of substantially increasing spending on education the census

states spent nearly 160 billion or 33 percent of their 
revenues on education in 1988 the bureau reported thursday most 
of the money went to local governments or higher education 
institutions the report said 
that spending was 64 percent more than what the states gave to 
education in 1987 the report said since 1978 states education 
spending has increased at an average annual rate of 86 percent 
the bureau said while overall state spending has increased by an 
average of 91 percent 
healthy education increases are probably due in part to a 
trend by states to funnel funds to education reforms said 
education department budget chief charlie kolb 
theres been a sense for the last seven or eight years that 
were not doing as well as we could have kolb said were 
outspending the rest of the world but were not outperforming 
kolb said education spending at all levels federal state and 
local increased from 331 billion in fiscal 1989 to 353 billion 
in fiscal 1990 
the census bureaus report said about 17 percent or 84 
billion of state funds in 1988 went toward public welfare 
programs a 74 percent increase over the previous year 
private vendors received 44 billion for services they provided 
to the needy while direct cash payments to welfare recipients 
totaled 11 billion the report said 
bigticket expenditures by states included 44 billion on 
insurance funds such as workers compensation 41 billion on 
highways and 35 billion on health and hospitals 
in all states spent 485 billion on programs while revenues 
climbed 48 percent to 542 billion taxes accounted for 264 
billion or 49 percent of all revenue while federal payments

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods rose 24 percent in november pumped up by durable goods to 
the second highest level ever the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2397 
billion after edging down 01 percent in october 
it was the highest level of orders since a record 2399 billion 
were posted last april and the fastest rate of increase since a 28 
percent advance in august 
the department said all of the november improvement was in 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last more 
than three years 
all of the major durable categories recorded increased sales 
the report was one of several recently portraying a mixed 
picture of the extent of sluggishness in the economy particularly 
in housing and the durablegoods manufacturing sector 
improvements have been reported in november for instance in 
sales of new and existing houses and of durable goods and 
industrial production advanced 01 percent 
but the labor department reported today that the manufacturing 
sector lost 25000 jobs in december bringing job losses in this 
area to 195000 since last march 
todays reports follow falling interest rates which the federal 
reserve had earlier boosted to slow the economy and restrain 
inflation as inflation moderated and concerns grew that the 
economy might fall into a recession the central bank has gradually 
eased its grip on credit 
many analysts continue to express concern over the economy 
however and want the fed to permit interest rates to fall further 
to stimulate economic activity 
in addition to new orders the commerce department said 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 05 percent to 2331 billion 
while inventories rose 03 percent to 3730 billion 
if inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new 
orders it could signal production cutbacks in the future as 
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots 
orders for durable goods gained 48 percent to 1302 billion 
transportation equipment increased 106 percent to 367 
billion this included increases of 26 billion for aircraft and 
15 billion for automobiles 
excluding the transportation sector orders would have posted 
only a 11 percent gain 
electrical machinery orders were up 77 percent to 217 
billion while nonelectrical machinery gained 57 percent to 227 
billion primary metals advanced 22 percent to 113 billion 
orders for nondurable goods declined 03 percent to 1095 
billion 
defense orders fell 10 percent to 169 billion excluding this 
category orders would have risen 18 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders jumped 77 percent

manuel noriegas tumble from dictator to defendant 
ended in the tight security of a us courtroom as the oncefiery 
panamanian ruler quietly faced a federal judge 
in a soft voice a humbled noriega answered us district judge 
william hoevelers initial inquiries but he declined to reply to 
drug trafficking charges at the brief hearing thursday less than a 
month after saying he would never surrender to the united states 
the judge entered an innocent plea for noriega who appeared in 
court in a panamanian defense force uniform 
noriega federal prisoner no 41586 was being held early today 
in an undisclosed miamiarea location his attorneys said 
defense attorneys say it could be nine months before they can go 
to trial on charges that noriega took 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way 
station for the cocaine trade 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said he thought the trial would 
take only two months defense attorneys said it could go on for six 
months 
defense attorney frank rubino said noriega appeared to be 
strong he appeared to be confident we went over the facts he 
was extremely confident in assisting us 
us drug agents who accompanied noriega on his flight from 
panama to miami gave a markedly different description saying he 
was in tears aboard the transport plane and regretted leaving the 
papal nunciature the washington times reported today 
i really put my foot in it this time noriega was quoted as 
saying i should not have left the nunciature 
a source familiar with the flight said noriega carried a bible 
in one hand and three rosaries in another when he was brought to 
the plane 
he was very depressed although tranquil one agent read him 
scriptures from the bible in spanish during the flight the 
unidentified source told the newspaper 
if convicted of all charges noriega 51 could be sentenced to 
145 years in prison and fined 11 million 
rubino said he planned to file motions to dismiss the case 
claiming the charges are politically motivated and questioning the 
methods used late wednesday to remove noriega from the vatican 
embassy in panama city where he was sheltered in a room for 10 
days under diplomatic protection 
general noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this 
court because he is a political prisoner brought to this 
country illegally rubino told hoeveler 
other defense claims will say the us invasion violated 
panamas sovereignty and international treaties and that noriega 
is a chief of state and subject to immunity rubino said 
but last year hoeveler ruled that the united states has 
jurisdiction in the case because the state department never 
recognized noriegas political legitimacy 
rubino said the panamanian general surrendered following 
statements that panama would revoke the diplomatic status of the 
papal nuncio and because the embassy was surrounded by angry 
crowds and us soldiers 
vatican officials however said noriega left voluntarily in 
washington a senior bush administration official said the vatican 
planned to order noriega to leave by noon thursday 
rubino said he will likely request a bond hearing within 30 
days the judge ordered noriega held without bond 
tom cash head of the drug enforcement administration in miami 
said noriegas capture was only one benchmark in the nations drug 
war 
were not going to open cases of champagne well take it one 
glass at a time he said 
noriega walked into the downtown courtroom without handcuffs or 
shackles each time hoeveler asked a question he rose and removed 
his headphones used for translation he answered softly in spanish 
and stared at the judge showing no emotion 
noriega and 15 others were indicted in february 1988 by a 
federal grand jury in miami noriega also faces charges in tampa 
bush administration sources said noriega was assured he would 
not be tried under a statute that carries the death penalty for 
drugrelated killings 
five other defendants in the indictment have appeared in court 
in miami noriegas whereabouts today were a losely guarded secret 
we will only say that he is in a secure facility said 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian in washington 
although officials refused to divulge details of security 
measures they acknowleged precautions were stepped up 
the security taken is in line for such a highvisibility 
defendant said us marshals agent darrell william 
noriega landed early thursday at homestead air force base south 
of miami and immediately was taken to a basement holding cell at 
the federal courthouse 
outside panamanian exiles celebrated noriegas capture and 
scuffled briefly with a protester opposing the us invasion 
two airplanes flew overhead with banners saying bye bye 
tony and rent this ad when fidel falls showing 
cubanamerican solidarity with panamanians 
among the witnesses expected to testify against noriega are jose 
blandon the former panamanian consul in new york and several 
codefendants 
the informants will fall like pineapples from a tree now that 
noriega is in custody said richard sharpstein attorney for 
codefendant brian alden davidow

tradition won over womens rights today as japans 
chief government spokeswoman abandoned her challenge to an ancient 
taboo that bans women from entering the sumo ring 
the battle began in december when chief cabinet secretary 
mayumi moriyama informed the japan sumo association that she 
intended to present the prime ministers cup to the winner of the 
new year grand sumo tournament from inside the ring 
the prime ministers cup since 1978 has been presented by the 
deputy chief cabinet secretary to the winner of the annual 15day 
new years tournament which begins sunday 
but mrs moriyama who last year became the first woman to hold 
the important cabinet post asked to present the award herself to 
challenge a tradition that forbids women from entering the ring a 
raised mound of clay about 14 feet in diameter 
what mrs moriyama meant to do was to raise the issue to 
improve womens social position the deputy cabinet secretary 
nobuo ishihara told reporters friday but after sumo officials 
stated their opposition she decided not to push the issue further 
ishihara said 
futagoyama the chairman of the sumo association told reporters 
today that i dont know how things will change in the future but 
i appreciate her understanding on thursday the former 
wrestler had said the ring is sacred and we must preserve our 
traditions 
it was not until 1778 that women were allowed to watch bouts 
but only on the final day of tournaments 
a century later women were allowed to watch throughout 
tournaments but not permitted to go up on the ring a tradition 
which remains the same to this day even though the 2000yearold 
sport has gained many female fans 
at ryogoku national gymnasium in tokyo which opened in 1909 
women were banned from the first five rows around the ring until 
after world war ii said lora sharnoff in her recently published 
book grand sumo 
although her challenge didnt work this time things have 
changed and i believe they will also change in the future said 
ryoichi maki a secretary to mrs moriyama 
sumo symbolizes the maledominated structure of our society 
said yoko morosawa a researcher on womens issues im glad mrs 
moriyama did this although she wont be able to climb into the 
ring her action definitely contributed to making more people 
realize the problem

the regional american red cross is asking 
hospitals in southeastern pennsylvania and southern new jersey to 
cancel all elective surgery because of a critically low supply of 
blood 
the request was to go to 93 hospitals in the region said susan 
snyder a spokeswoman for the pennjersey region of american red 
cross blood services 
the hospitals will all be advised that we cant support 
elective surgeries she said thursday 
in georgia four atlantaarea hospitals also canceled elective 
surgeries because of low blood supplies 
elective surgery includes operations that may be necessary to a 
patients health but not those needed to save a life 
ms snyder said surgeries have been canceled previously because 
of blood shortages but there havent been cancellations this 
severe such extensive and planned cancellation of elective surgery 
in at least 10 years 
the request came on the second day of an emergency appeal for 
blood donors as the red cross said it fell 4500 units short during 
december and had virtually no blood available of types o negative 
and b negative 
donation levels typically drop during the holiday season but 
they were reduced even further when the unusually cold december 
kept people from going to donation centers the red cross said 
the red cross which provides 94 percent of the blood used in 
the 93 hospitals needs about 1750 donors a day and was down to 
about 1000 last month 
donors increased to 1347 wednesday and more callers were 
seeking information thursday the red cross said 
the initial response we are seeing is very gratifying said 
dr william c sherwood director of the pennjersey region 
in atlanta surgeries were delayed for a pregnant woman needing 
abdominal surgery a man awaiting openheart surgery a patient 
waiting for a liver transplant and a patient with a bleeding 
ulcer anne willcox a red cross representative said thursday 
after an appeal for donations about 1300 people donated blood 
wednesday red cross officials said but that response was not 
matched thursday 
the red cross normally needs 900 units of blood a day to meet 
the demands of the more than 100 hospitals in the 82county atlanta 
region but donations dropped as low as 300 units a day over the 
holidays said beth v greenberg administrative director of red

rival shiite moslem militias battled with 
machine guns mortars and rocketpropelled grenades today in south 
lebanon killing four people and wounding 12 including three plo 
guerrillas sent in to quell the violence police said 
president elias hrawi meanwhile planned to set up his office 
and residence in a west beirut building to avoid the risks of 
commuting in the moslem area where his predecessor was killed by a 
car bomb 
fighters of the syrianbacked amal and proiranian hezbollah 
militias fought in south lebanons apple province as they continued 
their more than 2yearold war for mastery of lebanons 12 million 
shiites 
a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity in line 
with regulations said the wounded palestinians were caught in 
crossfire as amal repulsed two thrusts by hezbollah fighters in 
the village of kfar hatta 
the palestinians from the mainline fatah faction of the plo 
are based between the amalheld kfar hatta and the neighboring 
village of kfar milki which is controlled by hezbollah they were 
part of a 300member force deployed over the weekend to quell the 
militia fighting the police spokesman said 
the casualties today raised the overall toll to 77 killed and 
275 wounded since the latest militia fighting began dec 23 
hrawi had been staying at an army barracks in east lebanons 
bekaa valley since his election nov 24 the police spokesman said 
he was expected to move to west beirut as soon as security 
arrangements were made 
hrawi planned to set up a residence and office in a seaside 
apartment building where his predeccesor rene mouawad lived 
mouawads office was a 10minute drive away and he was killed by a 
car bomb nov 22 as he drove home from the office 
the president will not leave the building unless on foreign 
trips a government sources said of hrawi he spoke on condition 
of anonymity we want to avoid risks 
the presidential palace in beiruts suburb of baabda is the 
traditional seat of a head of state but the christian leader gen 
michel aoun refuses to leave the compound 
aoun rejected hrawis election which came about as a result of 
an arab leaguesponsored plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil 
war aoun opposed the plan because it did not include a deadline 
for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from lebanon and he 
denounced hrawi as a syrian puppet 
hrawi dismissed aoun as the army leader but aoun continues to 
command 20000 loyal troops controlling lebanons christian enclave 
france said today it had received a request from lebanese prime 
minister selim hoss to freeze all french bank accounts belonging to 
aoun 
a french foreign ministry spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity refused to discuss what the government might do in 
response 
the french satirical and investigative weekly le canard enchaine 
published a reproduction of a bank statement showing two accounts 
in aouns name at the banque nationale de paris one with 500000 
and the other with 147 million 
in a radio interview thursday aoun said the money came from 
donations by lebanese supporters and was used to support his 
military effort 
syrias chief ally in lebanon druse warlord walid jumblatt 
alleged in an interview published today in lebanon that plo chief 
yasser arafat donated the money in hopes of regaining the plos 
foothold in beirut 
the plo was driven out of beirut during israels 1982 invasion 
of lebanon

the japanese government is considering an aid 
package to help panama recover from the ravages caused by the us 
military invasion japans ambassador said in a meeting with vice 
president dan quayle today 
quayle at the start of the meeting with ambassador ryohei 
murata also announced that japan has decided to formally recognize 
the usinstalled government of guillermo endara in panama 
japan joins a handful of other nations that officially 
recognized the new government in the wake of the us invasion that 
drove dictator manuel antonio noriega from power last month 
bush administration officials have said they would like japan 
and other nations to help boost panamas economy and provide aid to 
compensate for the invasionrelated destruction as well as the 
economic damage resulting from us economic sanctions against the 
noriega regime 
asked if japan would provide such aid murata said he planned to 
discuss some of those things in the meeting with quayle 
estimates range as high as 2 billion in damage to panamas 
economy from the invasion entire neighborhoods were destroyed by 
bombing and fighting and the central business district suffered 
heavy damage and looting 
when the united states was exerting pressure on its friends 
around the world to break with noriega in 1988 japan was slow to 
respond making its action now significant for the administration 
asked if japan supported president bushs decision to invade 
panama murata declined to answer directly 
we understand the background against which the us decided to 
take that action he said 
quayle said he hoped japans early recognition of the endara 
government would encourage other nations to follow suit 
this is another positive development in the endara government 
establishing its credibility not just in this hemisphere but 
around the world quayle said

president mikhail s gorbachev has put off 
appointments with foreign visitors for the time being to deal with 
domestic unrest and a political crisis in lithuania a source said 
today 
its right said one senior communist party official when 
asked about news reports that gorbachev had postponed planned 
meetings with britains opposition leader and other foreign 
dignataries we have many problems right now 
the reports sent share prices on the tokyo stock exchange into 
their worst plunge since oct 16 
in new york stock prices declined slightly in an atmosphere of 
uneasiness over the economic outlook and political developments in 
the soviet union the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 
about 17 points at its earlymorning low was off 43 at 279565 
by 11 am on wall street 
the reaction demonstrated how closely gorbachev is linked by 
many in the west to the success of the economic and political 
reforms and reductions in eastwest tensions he has pursued since 
becoming kremlin leader in march 1985 
the party official speaking on condition of anonymity cited 
disturbances along the iranian border and the lithuanian communist 
partys decision to break away from the ruling national party 
headed by gorbachev 
soviet azerbaijanis have tried for four days to force open the 
frontier and reunite with their ethnic brethren in iran tearing 
down guard towers and prompting the kgb to reinforce security along 
the frontier a protest organizer said thursday the demonstrators 
were in retreat 
gorbachev met for more than five hours thursday with lithuanian 
party leaders who said afterward he failed to sway them from their 
decision to split from the 20 millionmember ruling party and 
pursue local independence 
the policymaking central committee of the national party has 
directed gorbachev to go to lithuania to try to mend the split the 
no 2 party leader in lithuania vladimir beriozov said the visit 
would begin wednesday and last through friday 
meanwhile the estonian communist party threw its support to the 
lithuanians in the dispute with moscow local journalist tarmu 
tammerk said today the estonian partys central committee meeting 
on thursday also set march 23 for its own full congress which is 
expected to vote on a similar proposal to split from the soviet 
party he said 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
would neither confirm nor deny the report that gorbachev was 
putting aside foreign questions to concentrate on the domestic 
situation 
asked about a report from london that the soviet ambassador to 
britain leonid zamyatin had told labor party leader neil kinnock 
that gorbachev was postponing a meeting with kinnock and all 
contacts with foreign politicians this month gerasimov replied 
has this meeting been planned let the associated press 
compose its own commentary for me this is all clear let them 
comment on that as they wish 
a spokesman for britains opposition labor party said zamyatin 
delivered a personal message from gorbachev to kinnock who had 
been scheduled to visit moscow for talks on jan 16 
the message said the meeting had to be postponed because 
political events in the soviet union required gorbachevs 
personal attention and participation the labor spokesman said 
the spokesman who in accordance with british practice declined 
to be named said gorbachevs message stated that the soviet leader 
was postponing contact with foreign politicians scheduled for 
january 
gorbachevs calendar is rarely made public and foreign visitors 
sometimes come to moscow expecting to gain an audience with him but 
failing to do so whenever he disappears from the public eye 
speculation about his activities and even his health becomes rife 
the kremlin leader was last seen on staterun television 
delivering a taped new years eve address to the nation dec 31 
moscowbased official media did not report on his closeddoor 
meeting thursday with the lithuanians 
news of gorbachevs plans to cancel appointments with visitors 
sent the tokyo stock exchanges 225issue nikkei average into a 
tailspin the leading market indicator closed down 43812 points 
or 11 percent from wednesday 
it was the largest singleday loss on the exchange since a 
647point plunge on oct 16 
to japan the worst thing that could happen to the world 
scenario would be for gorbachev to drop from sight said chris 
schreiber an investment analyst with new japan securities 
gorbachev is regarded in japan as the key to global stability 
he said 
the presidents efforts to reform soviet society and politics 
have created troubles at home however 
more than 300 people have died nationwide in ethnic unrest in 
two years 
and in an atmosphere of growing restiveness among the soviet 
unions many ethnic groups the dec 21 vote by a congress of 
lithuanian communists to break with moscow could trigger a stampede 
from central party control elsewhere 
beriozov the lithuanian party leader reported after the 
meeting with gorbachev that the president said he would not 
interfere 
we determined our positions from which we will not be 
moved romualdas ozolas a member of the lithuanian partys 
19member ruling bureau told staterun tv in vilnius the 
republics capital 
previously gorbachev opposed the lithuanian decision to split 
from the national party but he and other officials have also 
indicated the kremlin would not use force to keep the secessionist 
baltic republics in line 
lithuanias actions ran counter to more than seven decades of 
recognized local party subservience to the kremlin 
the soviet partys 250member central committee which sets 
policy and can change the partys leader now gorbachev 
reportedly includes members who advocate taking strong measures 
against the separatists

offices and as they were talking to the first son he told them we 
are christians and believers pyotr said

the bush administration after months of 
condemning panamas manuel antonio noriega as a thug and a 
criminal is toning down its rhetoric to avoid prejudicing the 
deposed dictators drugtrafficking trial 
meanwhile a pentagon spokesman said today that an additional 
900 american troops have returned to the united states raising the 
total of servicemen who have left panama since the dec 20 invasion 
to 2900 
the remaining forces in the country stood at 24500 including 
the approximately 12000 troops who were stationed in panama before 
the invasion 
the return of the 900 troops was due to the availability of 
transport aircraft and the release of individuals from their 
mission said the spokesman lt col keith schneider there were 
no details on the return of specific units 
the defense department also released revised figures on the 
number of panamanians detained since the invasion the original 
total of 5600 was revised to 4230 during the more than twoweek 
period of the us presence 3555 of the 4230 detainees have been 
released 
an administration official disclosed thursday that noriega 
surrendered to the us military in panama city only after the 
vatican embassy gave him a deadline to leave 
as defense officials were replacing us combat troops in panama 
with rebuilding forces a senior official said noriegas longtime 
cia ties have been reviewed and that any potentially damaging 
disclosures noriega might use in his trial defense will be 
manageable 
president bush kept a low profile on the day after he announced 
noriegas wednesday night surrender to us forces in panama only 
days earlier he had called noriega a thug 
bush telephoned pope john paul ii to thank him for any efforts 
in persuading noriega to leave the vatican embassy in panama city 
and surrender said the presidents spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater was lowkey in describing noriegas surrender and 
flight to florida he declined to answer questions about prospects 
for noriegas prosecution saying we feel the court system can 
handle this case based on the evidence that is presented and the 
indictments 
fitzwaters comments and the later briefing by the senior 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity contrasted with the 
inflammatory words the administration has used for months to 
describe noriega 
bush himself set that tone accusing noriega of corruption 
intimidation coercion and fraud and calling him an outlaw in the 
world community 
but with noriega in custody in miami the focus shifted thursday 
to the judicial system and his arraignment on charges of accepting 
a 46 million bribe from colombian drug lords and related crimes 
toning down the rhetoric now is a commonsense approach 
officials decided to honor said one administration official 
fitzwater said bush and his aides would be very careful in the 
days ahead not to offer any comments on the case that might 
prejudice it in any way 
fitzwater acknowledged the 1991 budget includes no aid money to 
repair invasionrelated damage to panama estimates range to more 
than 2 billion in losses due to bomb and combat damage looting 
losses and the longerrange losses left by us economic sanctions 
against the noriega regime 
undoubtedly there will be some international funds some bank 
loans and that sort of thing that would be involved and at this 
point we just cant say how any aid might be financed fitzwater 
said 
as bush dispatched gen colin powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff to panama on thursday to arrange troop 
withdrawals several democratic members of congress called for a 
quick pullout 
meanwhile the senior official who spoke anonymously gave 
reporters new details about noriegas surrender 
bush had stressed that the leader surrendered voluntarily but 
the official said the vatican gave noriega a noon thursday deadline 
to leave the embassy 
the papal nuncio had said that his asylum or what have you 
would expire by noon today meaning he noriega would no longer be 
a welcome guest the official said 
in panama city rev javier villanueva assistant to the papal 
nuncio said it was made clear to noriega that if he had not given 
himself up the panamanian government not the us government 
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out 
however he said noriega was not given a specific deadline 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said a noriega bodyguard 
overheard two us servicemen discussing the invasion of panama 
hours before it occurred it was unclear however whether the 
guard relayed that information to noriega williams said 
a us drug enforcement administration official said noriega 
might eventually be returned to panama for trial on other charges 
including murder that could happen after his us trial said 
david westrate assistant dea administrator 
panamanian vice president guillermo ford earlier said noriega 
would be returned to panama for trial on a long list of charges 
after his us trial ends

president saddam hussein on friday proposed 
resuming peace talks with iran that have been stalled more than a 
year and he suggested the longhostile nations reestablish air 
links 
we are seeking to open a new door for a dignified peace with 
iran saddam said in a speech marking the 69th anniversary of the 
founding of the iraqi army 
he hailed advances by the iraqi arms industry including the 
recent launching of longrange missiles and of a rocket reportedly 
capable of putting a satellite in space 
saddam suggested that direct meetings between representatives of 
iran and iraq be held alternately in tehran and baghdad under the 
auspices of the un secretarygeneral 
fighting in the eightyear iraniraq war ended aug 20 1988 
when both sides accepted a ceasefire based on un security 
council resolution 598 peace talks stalled immediately over 
interpretation of the terms of the resolution and priority in 
implementing its various clauses 
saddam said his proposed dialogue will aim at reaching a 
common understanding of the clauses of resolution 598 and fix a 
timetable for its implementation provided that the talks are 
completed within a period not exceeding three months 
there was no immediate response from iran 
iran has insisted that resumption of talks be preceded by the 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from 1065 square miles of iranian 
territory it claims are still under occupation 
iraq meanwhile wants iran to accept a new border giving iraq 
total control of the shattalarab waterway under a 1975 accord 
the border was drawn down the middle of the waterway which is 
iraqs main outlet to the sea 
saddam proposed an immediate exchange of all wounded and sick 
prisoners of war as the first step in reviving negotiations that 
would be followed by the release of the longestheld pows mainly 
those captured in the early stages of the war he said 
he also called for registering thousands of prisoners who have 
not been included in lists provided to the red cross the agency 
has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 19284 by iraq 
but un officials and diplomats say there are at least 100000 
pows held by both sides 
the red cross mediated an agreement to repatriate ailing and 
crippled pows immediately after the ceasefire the agreement 
collapsed after the release of only 400 prisoners as the sides 
accused each other of falsifying the number of captives 
the president said establishing air links between iran and iraq 
would secure an atmosphere of peace and security among the people 
of iran and iraq 
air links between the countries were cut off shortly before the 
war broke out in september 1980 
dealing with the advances in iraqs arms industry saddam 
attacked the united states for expressing concern over new iraqi 
missiles without saying anything about israels nuclear capability 
iraq announced last month it had launched a 48ton threestage 
rocket capable of placing a satellite in space it also said it had 
testfired two surfacetosurface missiles with a range of 1243 
miles long enough to reach israel 
washington confirmed the testfirings 
israel complained the iraqi advances coupled with its 
stockpiling of chemical weapons and reported efforts to acquire a 
nuclear capability posed a serious threat 
citing a similar excuse in 1981 israel launched a longrange 
air raid that destroyed a frenchbuilt nuclear reactor near baghdad 
saddam said iraq will retaliate firmly and with precision to 
any attempt by the zionist entity israel to strike at iraqs 
scientific or military installations 
if israel undertakes any aggression the united states will 
not be able to absolve itself from the responsibility of 
encouraging such an act he said

drug traffickers in medellin have 
abducted at least 20 people including members of colombias 
richest families as part of their terrorist war against the 
government police said friday 
most of the victims were kidnapped in the last two months in 
medellin the center of the countrys cocaine trade said a police 
spokesman in medellin 
the spokesman reached by telephone refused to identify himself 
a statement sent by the medellin cartel said traffickers had 
ordered the leaders of workingclass neighborhoods to take 
members of the traditional oligarchy hostage 
half of the ransom paid by family members for the release of the 
hostages will be used to finance the war against the government of 
president virgilio barco said the communique published friday in 
local newspapers 
the cartel said it would use the other half of the money to 
finance the construction of housing for the needy the communique 
did not mention the amount of ransom demanded by traffickers 
the cartel offered no explanation as to why it would need money 
at a time when its reputed leader pablo escobar has a personal 
fortune estimated at 2 billion 
government officials have suggested that escobars cocaine 
smuggling business has been hurt by the governments war on drugs 
but it appeared the wave of kidnappings was the medellin cartels 
latest attempt to pressure the government into abandoning its war 
on drugs 
barco launched the offensive in august after traffickers killed 
sen luis carlos galan a leading presidential candidate 
authorities have confiscated hundreds of properties allegedly 
belonging to the traffickers extradited 11 drug suspects to the 
united states and killed one leader of the medellin cartel gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha in a gunfight 
traffickers have responded with a wave of bombings and 
assassinations that have left 261 people dead and more than 1200 
injured 
in the last few days medellin authorities have distributed 
handbills offering 450000 reward for information leading to 
escobars capture 
yesterday it was rodriguez gacha tommorow it will be pablo 
escobar the handbills read 
a spokeswoman for the investigative unit of the national police 
said that evidence indicates that escobar ordered the dec 20 
kidnapping of the son of barcos closest adviser 
a group of men apparently working for escobar forced alvaro 
diego montoya into a car as he was walking out of the northern 
bogota offices of his financial services firm 
the victim is the son of german montoya barcos 
secretarygeneral 
a senior government official asking not to be identified said 
anonymous callers to the presidents office announced that montoya 
would be held until barco agreed to negotiate with traffickers 
in fridays communique traffickers reiterated their willingness 
to talk but added they would never surrender to the government 
we will not drop the flag but will redouble our fight to 
surprise an imperialistic and unpatriotic government that has seen 
fit to declare itself victorious the communique said 
barcos government has refused negotiation

delta air lines is beefing up security following 
a threat against the airlines transatlantic flights even though 
airline officials say they think it is a hoax 
delta spokesman jim lundy said thursday the general threat 
did not name a particular flight city or day he would not discuss 
the nature of the threat or say when it was received 
we really do believe its a hoax but we cant treat it that 
way said neil monroe another delta spokesman 
federal aviation administration spokesman richard stafford said 
the agency was aware of the situation but refused to say what 
action if any was being taken 
deltas transatlantic operations include flights to and from 
germany ireland england and france lundy said passengers were 
being notified of the threat upon checkin and were given the 
option of canceling or delaying their trips 
delta officials said thursday evening that roughly only 20 to 30 
of 700 ticket holders on its four international flights scheduled 
out of atlanta during the night had switched airlines 
lundy said the intensified security would remain in effect until 
officials are sure the threat has ended or it is confirmed as a 
hoax 
last week northwest airlines received a bomb threat against its 
flight from paris to detroit after passengers were told they could 
cancel their tickets a northwest dc10 which can carry 284 
passengers made a safe flight saturday carrying 28 passengers and 
14 crew members 
there has been so much attention on the northwest situation 
it generates additional activity monroe said

people who play contact sports can be held 
liable for the injuries they inflict on others if their conduct is 
willful or recklessly disregards others safety the state supreme 
court said today 
the high court used a case stemming from a pickup basketball 
game in omaha to spell out when people who participate in contact 
sports can be held responsible for injuries they cause to others 
the judges also provided a definition of reckless behavior 
the case involved a suit brought by joseph dotzler against bruce 
tuttle dotzler suffered two fractured wrists in 1984 when tuttle 
allegedly pushed him during a basketball game at an omaha ymca 
a jury decided the case in favor of tuttle 
the supreme court reversed that decision and ordered a new 
trial saying district judge theordore l carlson didnt properly 
instruct the jury 
the trial court shouldnt have allowed the issue of contributory 
negligence whether dotzlers conduct was partly responsible for 
his own injuries to be considered the supreme court said 
dotzler testified that he was standing still when he was 
allegedly pushed by tuttle tuttle said he wasnt particularly 
aware of dotzlers position on the basketball court 
that was all of the evidence in the record and it was not 
sufficient to permit a finding by the jury of absence of lookout or 
lack of control on dotzlers part chief justice william hastings 
wrote 
jury instructions should be confined to the issues found in 
the pleadings and which find support in the evidence the opinion 
said 
judge c thomas white did not participate in the 60 decision 
the judges said the case raised the issue of what constitutes 
recklessness under nebraska law and what standard of liability 
applies to someone who injures another during a contact sport 
the judges held that a participant in a game involving a 
contact sport such as basketball is liable for injuries only if 
his or her conduct is such that it is either willful or with a 
reckless disregard for the safety of the other player but is not 
liable for ordinary negligence 
the high court defined recklessness in part as the disregard 
for or indifference to the safety of another or for the 
consequences of ones act 
recklessness differs from intentional wrongdoing in that while 
the act must be intended by the actor in order to be considered 
reckless the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results 
from the act the court wrote

airline officials are angry that portions of bruce 
willis die hard ii will be shot at stapleton international 
airport contending that the film is an endorsement of 
terrorism 
it involves terrorism violence against airports destruction 
of an aircraft and a crash jack ekey general manager of united 
airlines denver operations said thursday 
as a matter or principle we dont believe that kind of thing 
represents either airports or airlines in a way which we see 
ourselves or want the public to see us he said 
twentieth centuryfox plans to start shooting the film at 
stapleton and in weld county jan 15 
representatives of all airlines that use stapleton lodged a 
complaint last week with airport officials 
greg lazzaro location manager of the film said the airlines 
position is total unadulterated bull and preposterous and 
stupid 
ekey said the film script which has not been shown to the 
airlines is the story of a police officers battle against 
terrorists who try to take over dulles international airport in 
suburban washington 
the plot of the sequel to die hard is heavy on wisecracks 
and liberal in the use of automatic weapons and plastic explosives 
in the abuse of private property he said 
to say its an airportbashing movie is unfair lazzaro 
said its not a movie about airlines its a movie about a new 
york cop whos in a cartoon 
in response to the protests stapleton officials placed added 
restrictions on the filmmakers including prohibiting the filming 
of real airline logos and aircraft 
it really paints a bad picture of aviation and of all people 
who work at airports said george doughty denver aviation 
director i dont like it either but our position is that its 
going to be filmed somewhere and there are some major benefits to 
letting it be filmed here

the warming trend between east and west has 
had a positive sideeffect for foreigners with visitors no longer 
required to hand over a minimum of 14 for each day of their stay 
in east germany 
under an aid agreement with bonn east germany has ended its 
ageold zwangsumtausch or the forced exchange that aimed 
to increase the socialist states hardcurrency coffers 
officials from the two nations announced in december that west 
germans would no longer be required to make the minimum conversion 
after jan 1 the extension of the benefit to other foreigners has 
come as a surprise 
weve heard that was the case but we have nothing official on 
it yet us embassy spokesman jaroslav verner commented when 
asked if us authorities had been informed of the change 
tourists from the united states france great britain and other 
nations required to enter east germany through checkpoint charlie 
have found empty money exchange booths at that border crossing 
no public announcement of the policy change has been made but 
east german officials confirmed friday that all visitors can enter 
free of charge 
franz koeckerbauer spokesman for the finance ministry said 
border authorities stopped demanding the exchange minimum on dec 
23 when the berlin wall which was built in 1961 was opened at the 
historic brandenburg gate hundreds of thousands poured through the 
new opening in the wall to make the towering gate accessible to 
pedestrians from east and west berlin 
east germanys adn news agency reported that 37 million people 
passed between east and west berlin over the new years holiday 
weekend although it did not indicate if that figure included an 
estimate of the thousands who simply scaled the graffitisplattered 
wall rather than using designated border crossings 
bernd schroeter a spokesman for east germanys state bank said 
the decision to suspend minimum currency exchange requirements for 
all visitors was connected with the agreement reached with west 
germany in early december 
under the deal agreed to by communist premier hans modrow and 
rudolf seiters the chief of staff for chancellor helmut kohl bonn 
is financing a special hardcurrency fund for east germans in 
exchange for ending the conversion minimum for west germans 
schroeter said the west german measures compensating east 
germany for the lost revenue extended to the entire fund not just 
the revenue from west germans 
western diplomats estimate that east germany earned between 294 
million and 441 million annually from forced conversion 
schroeter said he could not estimate what percentage of the 
total came from foreigners other than west germans 
visitors are forbidden to take east german marks with them when 
they leave the country so in the past much of the currency was 
left behind with friends or relatives or squandered at overpriced 
restaurants 
under the new currency exchange rules foreigners can change 
their hard currencies at a rate that gives them three times as many 
east german marks as under the old system but only if they want 
to

two distant cousins of the aids virus that 
usually are carried by drug users are also fairly common among 
female prostitutes say researchers who interviewed and tested more 
than 1300 prostitutes 
the study released thursday done by researchers at the federal 
centers for disease control in atlanta expands the groups 
considered at risk for the viruses and further underscores the 
importance of publichealth efforts to prevent their spread said 
irvin chen an outside expert who also has done research on the 
viruses 
the viruses called htlvi and htlvii are transmitted much 
like the aids virus through shared hypodermic needles sexual 
intercourse and from infected mothers to their babies 
htlvi has been linked to a type of leukemia and a serious 
neurological disorder as many as 5 percent of those who test 
positive for the virus eventually contract leukemia the cdc 
researchers said 
the second virus htlvii has not been clearly associated with 
disease it is however so closely related to htlvi that tests 
sophisticated enough to differentiate between the two are not yet 
available the researchers said 
for that reason researchers used a test for both viruses on the 
1305 prostitutes examined between 1986 and 1988 the women all 
were older than 18 and had had a median of 2900 sexual encounters 
of those tested 67 percent were found positive for the 
viruses said dr rima khabbaz lead researcher of the study 
reported in fridays journal of the american medical association 
while the single most important risk factor for carrying the 
virus was drug abuse 24 percent of the women who reported no 
history of intravenous drug abuse and had no needle marks also 
tested positive according to the study 
its clear that both of these viruses are found in intravenous 
drug abusers in this country said chen a researcher at the 
university of californialos angeles who specializes in the viruses 
its interesting that theyre finding it in another group 
among female prostitutes it just extends the range of the 
viruses 
the researchers studied women in atlanta miami los angeles 
san francisco southern nevada colorado springs colo newark 
nj and four other new jersey cities 
prostitutes in newark were most likely to carry the viruses 
with 254 percent testing positive while none of the prostitutes 
tested in southern nevada was found to carry the viruses 
khabbaz and chen agreed that the findings carry important 
publichealth implications 
its clear now that all of these viruses are transmitted 
in the same way chen said in the publichealth point of view 
anything that can be done to prevent the spread of these viruses is 
essential 
control measures such as the use of condoms to prevent other 
sexually transmitted diseases should be encouraged khabbaz 
and her colleagues wrote 
finally control measures aimed at intravenous drug use and 
the sharing of needles and other bloodcontaminated injection 
paraphernalia are urgently needed

thirteen people have been charged with 
murder or conspiracy after five family members were found buried at 
an ohio farm rented by the leader of a religious splinter group 
federal authorities said today 
five of those charged were arrested late thursday and early 
today in kansas city and nearby independence said george rodriguez 
of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in kansas 
city 
two of those arrested have confessed to their participation in 
the mass murders rodriguez said at a news conference he said 
authorities have a motive but would not release it 
the cleveland plain dealer quoting police sources the newspaper 
did not name said the five may have been killed as part of a 
religious sacrifice 
rodriguez said federal authorities would not comment on that 
report for fear of prejudicing juries he said it was accurate to 
characterize lundgren as the leader of a cult 
the bodies of the dennis avery family were found wednesday night 
and thursday at a kirtland ohio farm 
rodriguez said they were members of a splinter religious group 
led by jeffrey lundgren a former lay minister of the reorganized 
church of jesus christ of latter day saints which is headquartered 
in independence 
the dead were identified tentatively as dennis avery 49 his 
wife cheryl 42 and their three daughters trina 13 rebecca 9 
and karen 5 rodriguez said the family originally from 
independence apparently had lived off and on at lundgrens farm in 
ohio and were killed around april 1618 
lundgren 39 and his wife alice 38 were among those charged 
and were being sought today lundren was charged with five counts 
of aggravated murder his wife was charged with five counts of 
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
authorities were led to the bodies on farm about 25 miles 
northeast of cleveland by an anonymous tip said kirtland fire 
chief richard martincic 
the plain dealer quoted a police source as saying cult members 
had to perform the sacrifice before traveling west where they 
would be cleansed and could search for a golden sword which 
was not further characterized 
a kirtland police spokesman said officers who had worked on the 
investigation almost nonstop for 48 hours were resting early today 
and were unavailable for comment on the report of human sacrifice 
authorities would not say how the five died authorities sent 
the bodies to cleveland for autopsies 
a neighbor of the commune in ohio said the group appeared to 
leave the area last april 
deputy sheriff rick ring of johnson county mo said lundgren 
and a group of people had been living in a barn near chilhowee a 
rural area about 45 miles southeast of kansas city and were last 
seen in the area in late october or early november 
rodriguez said it was not known whether lundgren was in the 
kansas city area but authorities were in contact with his wifes 
parents in the area 
the group led by lundgren apparently disbanded late in december 
after members became disgruntled rodriguez said 
rodriguez said the group following lundgren consisted of 29 men 
women and children but some members including the avery family 
came and went 
ron luff 29 of independence was arrested and charged with 
murder those arrested and charged with five counts each of 
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder were identified as susan 
luff 31 of springfield and dennis patrick 35 tonya patrick

revelations that the suspect in a pregnant womans 
killing was her husband not an innercity mugger as reported 
stirred angry demands for amends from residents of the neighborhood 
where the slaying occurred 
were looking for an apology and we want it to go 
nationwide cried adline stallings who lives in the citys 
mission hill area 
the mostly black neighborhood became the backdrop for the 
sensational case of carol and charles stuart middleclass white 
suburban professionals in what was cast as a fatal encounter with 
innercity violence 
stuart 29 told police that a mugger had fatally shot his 
30yearold wife in the head and shot him in the abdomen after they 
left a childbirth class at a hospital the night of oct 23 
the story touched the worst fears among white america of black 
innercity violence when it exploded in headlines and on news 
reports nationwide 
at the first of two news conferences today to express concern 
over the case sadiki kambon director of thee black community 
information center in roxbury called on the mayor to fire police 
commissioner francis roache 
he accused the police of arresting a black man in the case 
because of his skin color and the boston polices need for a 
victim to satisfy the hunger of white racism in boston and 
america 
kambon cited allegedly abusive behavior by police in searches of 
black residents of the mission hill area during the investigation 
i demand an apology from the mayor of boston not just to 
mission hill but to every black person in the city of boston who 
was traumatized and victimized by political hysteria said louis 
elisa president of the ncaap boston chapter every white person 
was looking at members of the black community as a possible 
killer 
police said stuart committed suicide thursday morning by jumping 
off a boston bridge after apparently learning that police were 
about to arrest him for the slayings of his wife and infant son 
christopher the baby was born prematurely after the shooting and 
died 17 days later 
stuart claimed a black man was the assailant and police 
descended on the area going house to house seeking anyone who fit 
the description he provided 
it wasnt fair said stallings a member of the mission main 
task force board of directors the slant of the publicity ms 
stallings said was as if we the people who live here in this 
development were involved in a crime 
but words alone might not satisfy people like sara flintelsey 
executive director of tenants united for public housing progress a 
group representing the 60000 public housing tenants in boston 
i got phone calls from relatives as far away as california 
they said what is going on in boston its really pathetic ms 
flintelsey said 
ms flintelsey who is black and lives in the largely black 
roxbury section of boston said publicity around the stuart case 
inflamed racial tensions not felt since the school busing crisis a 
decade ago 
i felt this city was ready to explode on the implications that 
a black man had done this to a white woman ms flintelsey said 
mission hill where rescuers found the stuarts is part of the 
city already under siege from violence police blame largely on 
drugs and gang warfare 
city councilor bruce bolling a black whose district includes 
part of mission hill said the struggle of the poorer neighborhoods 
was irrevocably damaged by the way the story was presented and 
spread 
it has left permanent shame on bostons black community and 
has had a chilling effect on development bolling charged 
thursday 
this case has stirred the racial fears not only in boston 
but nationally in neighborhoods in urban america bolling said 
a whole race of people have been maligned 
in addtition to the reaction by blacks residents throughout 
boston and its suburbs were stunned and confused by the news 
i would say the whole town is shocked they were portrayed as 
a model couple said wally arsenault a restaurant manager in 
reading 15 miles north of boston where the stuarts lived

salute the heroic fearless romanian people 
reads one postcard mailed to the romanian embassy in beijing it is 
signed a chinese 
the dictator is ousted welcome a new era begins another 
signed a chinese citizen 
the embassy has received several dozen messages of 
congratulations from official chinese institutes workers and even 
a soldier in the two weeks since romanian citizens rose up against 
hardline communist leader nicolae ceausescu 
all expressed solidarity with the romanian people and 
satisfaction with what happened in our country but said nothing 
about their own problems a romanian diplomat said friday 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
many chinese were elated because the romanian rebels defeated an 
armed attack of the kind that chinas hardline leaders mounted to 
crush chinese prodemocracy protesters on june 34 ceausescu 
applauded chinas crackdown 
the diplomat was amazed that chinese mail workers delivered the 
postcards with daring references to the reactionary ruler and 
the dictator 
they must have seen the messages they are open he said 
the postcards were anonymous but one letter came from workers 
at the no 2 automobile factory in central china a leading 
stateowned facility and two chinese who telephoned from beijing 
factories said they spoke for their coworkers 
even a unit of the governmentrun chinese academy of social 
sciences and several other state institutions sent signed letters 
the diplomat said before chinese premier li peng and president 
yang shangkun recognized the new romanian government dec 27 
everyone expressed concern everyone was very warm even 
warmer than before said a second diplomat it was very 
touching 
the embassy itself which has just seven diplomats held a 
meeting on dec 23 while fighting still raged between pro and 
anticeausescu forces and decided to support the rebels they 
hauled down their romanian flag and raised one without the hated 
communist party emblem 
someone stitched together swatches of red blue and yellow silk 
to make a tiny new flag for the ambassadors car 
more than a dozen portraits of ceausescu were taken down from 
embassy walls leaving empty hooks and faint white outlines 
we were so happy we were all so relieved the second 
diplomat said 
the diplomats said that like the chinese they received 
information about the fighting in romania mainly from foreign news 
reports but many chinese assuming the embassy had uptodate 
information called and asked for the latest news 
they told us they were listening to the voice of america and 
british broadcasting corp they said they were keeping their 
radios on just like in june one said 
chinas governmentcontrolled media said nothing about the 
romanian uprising for several days and then gave only sketchy 
reports without explaining its motives nonetheless the news 
spread rapidly and posters mocking ceausescu and chinese leaders 
went up quickly at three beijing colleges 
students at seven colleges gathered on campus in silent protests 
or made plans to do so but were stopped the chinese government 
responded by canceling plans to lift 7monthold martial law in 
beijing and instead putting the army and police on alert 
according to unofficial sources 
the diplomats said no chinese have come in person to the embassy 
to offer congratulations contacts with the chinese government have 
continued normally they said 
from the chinese communist party however there has been only 
silence

a man paroled in 1987 in the killing of 
an 8yearold girl was arraigned today on charges of murdering 
eight of the women involved in serial slayings in the rochester 
area since march 1988 
arthur shawcross 44 a food service worker pleaded innocent to 
eight murder counts before rochester city judge john manning regan 
and was sent to the monroe county jail without bail 
state police superintendent thomas constantine said in albany 
that charges will be brought against shawcross in at least three 
more rochester murders and that he is a suspect in other deaths 
the bodies of at least 14 slain women have been found in the 
area in the past 22 months deputy rochester police chief terrence 
rickard said there may have been as many as 17 serial victims and 
that shawcross may have told authorities where to find three 
bodies not two as earlier reported 
the rochester democrat amp chronicle newspaper said one body was 
recovered late thursday in clarkson 
rochester police chief gordon urlacher said today that police 
think he was responsible for 11 of the murders 
weve said all along that we dont believe all these cases 
were related and thats the way it turned out constantine said 
according to police shawcross was arrested wednesday after 
officers in a police helicopter saw a car speeding away from the 
culvert where a womans body was found in sweden about 12 miles 
west of rochester 
the person derives some type of satisfaction from the murder 
and its very possible that they go back and look at the results 
constantine said 
the syracuse poststandard quoted sources as saying the suspect 
told police several women were killed for mocking him when he was 
unable to engage in sex another was killed when she broke the gear 
shift knob in his girlfriends car another because he thought she 
lied about being a virgin and yet another because she pushed him 
into he genesee river while they were swimming 
according to the state department of correctional services 
shawcross served 15 years of a 25year sentence after a 1972 
firstdegree manslaughter conviction in watertown ny shawcross 
was convicted of killing karen ann hill 8 of rochester who was 
strangled and sexually molested while visiting watertown 
shawcross also confessed to strangling 10yearold john blake 
of watertown according to retired watertown police detective 
charles kubinski who interrogated shawcross about the killings 
shawcross was paroled from green haven state prison in june 1987 
and appeared to be adapting well to life outside prison edward 
elwin executive director of the state division of parole said 
today 
superficially he was making a good adjustment elwin said 
shawcross had tried to settle in delhi in rural delaware 
county following his parole but was moved by parole officials to 
rochester after about two weeks when residents complained about his 
presence 
investigators first questioned shawcross wednesday while they 
were searching for a missing woman west of rochester according to 
news reports searchers found one womans body in the area 
wednesday afternoon and a second womans body thursday 
when the suspect was brought in again for questioning thursday 
he confessed to 10 of the killings according to rochester 
television station wokr which quoted unidentified police sources 
about 60 state troopers forest rangers from the state 
department of environmental conservation and town of ogden police 
searched the monroe county towns of ogden riga and sweden for 
clues into the latest deaths 
most of the women including june cicero 34 of rochester 
whose body was found frozen in a creek wednesday in ogden were 
involved in prostitution or drugs police said 
the first body found thursday believed to be that of a female 
was discovered at about 815 am in sweden by a local resident 
according to capt david l christler of the state police police 
were unable to immediately identify that body 
investigators began looking in the northampton park area sunday 
after a park worker found a pair of pants and boots in the snow 
inside the pants was a social security card belonging to felicia 
stephens 20 who was last seen by her boyfriend raymond 
pendergrass in rochester on dec 26 police said the park is 
about 13 miles west of rochester

a former chemist for the food and drug 
administration was sentenced friday to 30 days in prison for taking 
4300 in bribes to influence the governments approval of generic 
drugs made by two companies 
us district judge john hargrove sentenced david brancato to 
three twoyear prison terms but suspended all but 30 days 
brancoto was also fined 3000 ordered to serve 500 hours of 
community service and put on probation for three years 
he was accused of accepting bribes from ashok patel former 
senior vice president of par pharmaceuticals of spring valley 
ny and dilip shah former president of quad pharmaceuticals of 
indianapolis 
patel and shah were convicted earlier 
prosecutors said brancato who worked in the fdas rockville 
office took the money in exchange for favorable fda treatment of 
applications for approval of generic drugs produced by the 
companies 
generic drugs are the chemical equivalents of brandname drugs 
whose exclusive marketing patents have expired the rush by generic 
drug companies to win fda approval for their cheaper products has 
created a lucrative market susceptible to corruption investigators 
say 
in all the generic drug probe has resulted in guilty pleas from 
three officials of generic drug companies three fda chemists and 
two pharmaceutical companies 
brancato who pleaded guilty earlier to three counts of 
receiving illegal gratuities actually took 16000 in bribes from 
four drug manufacturers said prosecutor gary jordan brancato was 
charged only with taking 4300 in bribes

bush administration policymakers faced with a 
foreign aid squeeze because of the need to reward emerging 
democracies in panama and eastern europe are looking primarily to 
the pentagon budget for possible relief say congressional and 
private sources 
one growing school of thought argues that changes in the worlds 
security balance now mean that us interests abroad are better 
maintained by diplomacy than by threat of force and that at least 
a small amount of the military money saved through arms treaties 
and lessened tensions should go for foreign aid 
others in the administration and on capitol hill are talking 
about nicking the largest current aid recipients countries such 
as israel egypt pakistan turkey and greece to pay for 
assistance to the new democracies that option however is seen as 
more politically difficult and therefore less likely than others 
the administration this week sent a delegation to panama to 
evaluate the need for us assistance in reviving a oncerobust 
economy crippled by american trade sanctions early estimates of 
needed aid are running upwards of 1 billion over several years 
bush also has pledged that eastern european countries that adopt 
democracy and reform their economies can expect help of the sort 
that congress voted last year for poland and hungary which 
together are getting 840 million over the next three years 
but the new aid will have to be found in a foreign assistance 
budget that already is strained beyond its limits leaving some 
friendly countries to do without about a dozen nations that 
normally could expect some us economic aid this year will end up 
with nothing said mark edelman acting administrator of the state 
departments agency for international development 
we have a hell of a problem and its getting tighter and 
tighter and tighter edelman said in an interview 
of the 146 billion in this years foreign aid package israel 
has received 3 billion and egypt 21 billion those two along 
with pakistan greece and turkey get the lions share of us 
economic and military aid and are protected by congressional 
earmarks whats left is parceled out in far smaller amounts to 
several dozen other countries 
as the year wears on and congress begins deliberations on a 1991 
aid bill matters are bound to get worse officials say foreign 
aid is among the least popular programs on capitol hill meaning 
the growing us commitments must somehow be shoehorned into a 
budget that will remain essentially unchanged 
we only have so much said sen bob dole rkan it may 
not be possible for some countries to do quite as well as they 
have in the past the american people understand that we are 
going to have to help in countries like romania and 
czechoslovakia 
theres a bottom line if you want to do more here youve got 
to do less there said edelman 
there is going to be a squeeze predicted william hellert 
an analyst with the overseas development council a 
washingtonbased advocacy group for development in poorer countries 
he noted that not only are panama and eastern europe likely to 
expect new aid from the united states but other countries may make 
claims as well namibia which is gaining its independence from 
south africa and mozambique and angola where settlements of civil 
wars are hoped for 
in addition the united states is faced with taking care of late 
payments to the un peacekeeping force money that comes out of 
the foreign aid bill and with new payments to the international 
development association an arm of the world bank additional money 
will be needed to cope with increased flows of refugees around the 
world 
as new and more politically popular recipients line up at the 
aid window some of the worlds most needy countries fear they will 
get pushed even further back in the queue noted rep lee hamilton 
dind a senior foreign affairs committee member weve been 
squeezing africa for about as long as you can squeeze it 
throughout latin america the growing scarcity of us aid is a 
top concern they have just gone through a lost decade as far as 
development is concerned said hellert are they going to go 
through another one

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods reached their second highest level in november the 
government said friday in a report that analysts saw as further 
evidence the longest peacetime economic expansion is continuing 
this confirms our expectations that the economy wont drop 
into a recession said thomas runiewicz an economist with the 
wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting organization were 
going to see a slowdown but no recession 
it pretty much conclusively demonstrates that were not 
heading into a recession agreed gordon richards economic policy 
director for the national association of manufacturers 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods jumped 24 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 2397 billion after edging down 01 percent in october 
they had gained 1 percent in september 
it was the highest level of orders since a record 2399 billion 
was posted in april and the fastest rate of increase since a 28 
percent advance in august 
the report was a bright spot in what has become a mixed picture 
of the manufacturing economy 
the labor department reported friday that the manufacturing 
sector lost another 25000 jobs in december raising to 195000 the 
number of factory jobs lost since march 
however orders for durable goods where much of the 
manufacturing weakness has been concentrated posted a 48 percent 
increase to 1302 billion after a slip of 08 percent in 
october increases were widespread within all the major categories 
runiewicz said that portends good news because factory orders 
are a leading indicator and thus suggest future economic growth 
transportation orders jumped 106 percent to 367 billion 
after a 19 percent gain in october while aircraft orders totaled 
26 billion or 62 percent of the advance the slumping auto 
industry posted a 15 billion gain 
excluding the transportation category orders would have risen 
11 percent 
other major durable goods categories recording gains included 
electrical machinery up 77 percent most of it in defense 
communication equipment nonelectrical machinery including 
computers and a wide variety of industrial equipment up 57 
percent and primary metals up 22 percent 
on the other hand orders for nondurable goods that had been 
the mainstay of the economy in recent months dropped 03 percent 
to 1095 billion after rising 06 percent in october 
richards described the turnaround as a statistical correction 
its pretty typical of economic statistics that when you see 
deviations in one direction chances are its going to be a 
fallback in the other direction at some point he said 
defense orders rose 169 percent to 112 billion after 
falling 10 percent in october excluding defense orders would have 
risen 18 percent 
analysts agreed that nondefense capital goods orders were 
another positive in the november report because they are a 
barometer of business investment plans they were up 77 percent 
after a 18 percent gain in october

here is the transcript of president bushs 
news conference friday 
president bush well this morning i met with the attorney 
general dick thornburgh to discuss the legal process related to 
the prosecution of general noriega we are committed to a fair 
trial and to providing all the protections guaranteed by the united 
states constitution and laws 
the attorney general assures me that our case is strong our 
resolve is firm and our legal representations are sound our 
government is not seeking a deal with noriega our policy remains 
that we have brought him to this country for prosecution 
i will be ever mindful of this legal process in the days ahead 
and will not comment on any aspect of this prosecution or any 
matters that could even inadvertently affect the outcome of this 
case and im going to ask others in this administration to do the 
same 
deputy secretary of state eagleburger and deputy secretary at 
treasury robson have just given me a report on the economic 
reconstruction efforts in panama the first action that the united 
states took after general noriega was removed from power was to 
release some 400 million in money that was withheld by virtue of 
our economic sanctions sanctions which are now being lifted 140 
million i believe is already in panama 
the revitalization of the panamanian economy is a major priority 
in the months ahead as our efforts as are our efforts for 
humanitarian assistance and i would say here ive been very 
grateful for the medical supplies that have gone to panama 
i can report today that considerable progress has been made so 
far in returning panama to a normal state of affairs the new 
government has taken charge and president endara is working 
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people 
both undersecretary robson and eagleburger were very high in 
their praise of mr calderon mr ford and of course president 
endara they are discussing housing programs business development 
bank loans that will help spur economic growth we are committed to 
be a part of that process 
i want to assure all of the countries of latin america that 
united states policy remains one of a friendly supportive and 
respectful neighbor we have worked hard and intensively to consult 
bilaterally and multilaterally with latin america and we will 
continue to do that 
i personally will be involved in that at the latin american 
summit in costa rica i pledged that we would work with the 
countries of this hemisphere to build a better life for its 
citizens our policy of cooperation is firm 
yesterday i had a lengthy discussion with prime minister felipe 
gonzalez of spain who is so well respected in this hemisphere as 
well and i share his deep personal interest in seeing that the 
countries of this hemisphere pull together on behalf of democracy 
and economic freedom 
i know the yearnings of my fellow leaders in this hemisphere 
leaders in latin america and i believe they will support the new 
government of panama and they will support the united states as we 
work together in this hemisphere 
and ive asked the vice president dan quayle to visit a number 
of these latin american countries within the next several weeks to 
personally deliver this message i view this as very very 
important diplomacy and i am determined not to neglect the 
democracies in this hemisphere 
some have felt that we were so infatuated with the change in 
eastern europe that we were in a process of neglecting this 
hemisphere and that is not the case and the quayle trip in my 
view will help i have been undertaking consultations directly 
with leaders since ive been president 
i will resume that as i said and the vice president will be in 
a position to explain very clearly not only us policy but our 
aspirations for panama and indeed for this entire hemisphere 
so thats where we are and ill be glad to take a few questions

an investigation on whether to reopen the 
cases of three civil rights workers who were slain in rural 
mississippi in 1964 is nearly complete the state attorney general 
said 
attorney general mike moore declined however to discuss what 
the probe has concluded state officials encouraged by the naacp 
and other groups have sought to determine whether the case should 
be reopened 
the inquiry is continuing moore said thursday weve made 
some pretty good progress 
the state legal official said the first question to be answered 
would be whether the case could be retried and if that action would 
be in the best interests of mississippians 
on june 21 1964 civil rights workers james earl chaney 21 
who was black and andrew goodman 20 and michael schwerner 24 
who were white disappeared after they were released from the 
neshoba county jail in philadelphia miss they had been stopped 
for speeding after investigating the burning of a black church by 
the ku klux klan 
their bodies were found 44 days later in a soggy earthen dam in 
rural neshoba county all three had been shot to death 
the mens deaths were the basis of the 1988 film mississippi 
burning 
a us district court jury convicted seven ku klux klan members 
in 1967 of conspiring to deprive the workers of their civil rights 
their sentences on the federal charges ranged from three to 10 
years in prison none was indicted or tried for murder in state 
courts 
moore said the investigation by his office thus far reveals that 
some of the alibi witnesses for those who were tried in 1967 have 
died that could allow defendants to raise a question of due 
process in the courts becase of the passage of time he said 
theres been a lot of research done moore said were 
working with the fbi 
moore had originally hoped to make an announcement by the end of 
1989 but he said he now plans to release the investigations 
findings sometime early this year

president bush said today that some americans 
got the wrong impression that he didnt give a damn about us 
losses in panama because television had shown him in a 
frivolous mood while splitscreen tv carried pictures of gis 
bodies being taken from a plane 
at todays news conference bush took the unusual step of 
appealing to the television networks to give him warning when they 
use the split screen technique while he was conducting a news 
conference he said if a competing news event were so urgent as to 
justify the use of that technique he would stop the news 
conference 
i could understand why the viewers were concerned about 
this bush said they thought that their president at a solemn 
moment like that didnt give a damn and i do i do i feel it so 
strongly 
toward the end of his dec 21 news conference a relaxed bush 
was seen on television bantering with reporters while one by one 
the flagdraped coffins of americans killed in the panama operation 
also were shown as they were carried from a justarrived transport 
plane at dover air force base del 
it was evident to viewers that bush was unaware of the image 
that was going out to the country the news conference was held in 
late afternoon just one day after the panama operation started in 
all 23 american servicemen died during the us intervention 
i read a lot of mail after the last press conference and i had 
some calls because when i was speaking here in this room 
juxtaposed against my frivilous comments at the time was some 
splitscreen technique which showed the bodies of dead soldiers in 
caskets coming home bush said at the conclusion of todays

tacky and glitzy or chic and ritzy neon 
lights up a new exhibit here in a state thats been called the neon 
capital of the world with its blazing casino displays 
there definitely was a time when neon was considered tacky 
kind of low life but now its tres chic and its everywhere 
said erik lauritzen curator of the nevada historical society 
exhibit 
people arent just using it to advertise but theyre using it 
in art as decoration and in architecture he said friday its 
back in style look at just about any downtown area or shopping 
mall 
the exhibit which opens jan 19 at the reno museum includes 
seven neon signs and art works and 50 photographs of glowing 
displays from the states first neon sign documented in 1928 on a 
grocery store in northeastern nevadas elko to the modern 
hotelcasino extravaganzas several stories high 
neon signage has gone through several periods according to 
lauritzen 
the first stage was from the early 30s to the early 50s when 
use of neon was very innovative he said then the 50s to 70s 
when neon was becoming just a way to advertise and kind of got a 
bad rap then through the 70s and until now when neon is coming 
back as art and decoration

candidates for general elections in may 
include a popular prodemocracy leader now under house arrest and a 
phalanx of veterans from the party that wielded authoritarian power 
for 26 years 
according to incomplete reports received friday from the 
election commission 2066 candidates from 96 political parties and 
70 independents will vie for 492 parliamentary seats 
although burmas military rulers ordered house arrest for aung 
san suu kyi the charismatic prodemocracy leader has been allowed 
to file a nomination to run in a constituency in rangoon the 
capital 
ms suu kyi the daughter of independence hero aung san rose to 
prominence in the fall of 1988 as millions of burmese rose up 
against a militaryled government that suppressed political 
freedoms and ruined the countrys economy during its 26year rule 
the uprising was crushed violently by the military and a 
military council has ruled with martial law since then but it 
promised elections in may 1990 no date has been set 
many western diplomats in rangoon and bangkok doubt the polling 
will be fair and free noting widespread arrests of political 
opponents and human rights abuses in the past year 
the only party capable of fielding candidates in all 492 
constituencies is the national unity party which under another 
name was the sole political party in the country from 1962 until 
1988 
the party will field virtually all the prominent leaders of the 
former ruling party the burma socialist program party 
perhaps the most popular of the six national parties is ms suu 
kyis national league for democracy it built up a rapid base of 
support but has been weakened by the arrests of toplevel members 
including party chairman tin oo he was sentenced to three years in 
prison last month for allegedly inciting arrest and attempting to 
divide the army 
similar accusations were made against ms suu kyi but the 
military rulers have not taken legal action against her although 
she remains under house arrest in rangoon 
others who filed nominations are popular leader aung gyi of the 
union nationals democracy party and chit maung chairman of the 
largest leftist party the democratic front for national 
reconstruction 
burmas last multiparty elections were in 1960 the elected 
government of prime minister u nu was overthrown in a 1962 coup led 
by gen ne win 
ne win and the military crushed dissent and pursued rigid 
socialist policies that made resourcerich burma one of the worlds 
poorest nations 
those economic woes and repression fueled the nationwide 
protests in 1988 that forced the resignation of ne win and later 
his successor sein lwin 
maung maung took power aug 19 as the countrys first civilian 
leader since 1962 and promised the elections

q mr president 
a is it helen first 
q you said that the government is not seeking any kind of a 
deal 
a yeah 
q concerning noriega does that mean that you are irrevocably 
ruling out any reducing of charges increasing of charges and 
also since the indictment runs from 81 to 86 and you had many 
contacts apparently with panama during that period were you ever 
aware of any drug activities on the part of noriega 
a on the first part of the question theres no such plan the 
mans entitled to do whatever is granted him under our law so 
there isnt any such plan secondly i have made some statements 
along in reply to your second question so punch it in the 
computer and ill have nothing more to say about it because i do 
not want even inadvertently to prejudice this case but it my 
actions are in my view totally unrelated 
yeah tom 
q mr president with general noriega out of panama and safely 
in custody in this country it seems like you may have a difficult 
choice in deciding how to maintain order in panama do you envision 
keeping a us military peacekeeping force there beyond the usual 
contingent of 12000 troops or would you like to see the 
panamanian defense forces reconstituted 
a one id like to see their police forces whatever emerges 
reconstituted two we will get our forces that went in out as soon 
as possible three i will just say this because your question 
obviously understands this but to those listeners out there 
southcom southern command has had a force there and that force 
under the treaty will remain there 
but the answer is we want to get those additional augmented 
forces out as soon as possible and we will 
q mr president id like to try to follow up a question you 
were asked when you were here last about secrecy and the two 
missions by general scowcroft to china as im sure you may be 
aware secretary of state baker was asked about the first what we 
then thought was the first china mission on one of the weekend talk 
shows he indicated that it was indeed it turned out to be the 
second 
he has since acknowledged quite openly that his answer was 
false and that he felt constrained to give that answer to protect 
the secrecy of the mission and i wondered first sir whether you 
felt it was worth it for him to have to do that and second 
whether that sort of thing is acceptable in your administration 
a well let me simply say that some things will be conducted in 
secrecy and i know you dont like it your business is to get 
everything out in the open and my business is to conduct the 
foreign affairs of this country in the way i think i was elected 
to and for the most part thatll be in the open 
but this move into panama was held in secrecy and i think the 
american people understand that my move to send people to china 
was controversial some think that the best way to make change for 
human rights in china is isolation dont talk to them try to 
punish them by excommunication i dont feel that way and so i 
asked these people to go forward and i dont think jim baker would 
ever deliberately mislead somebody and so i will stand stand 
with him 
q well he sir i believe he indicated that he felt he had to 
do that and that he knew what he was doing and he had to do it 
and i just wondered how you feel about 
a well ask him about it i support my secretary of state 
yeah lesley

a prosecutor known for accompanying 
detectives on drug raids resigned after he was caught fabricating a 
story that two men tried to assassinate him the state attorney 
general said today 
camden county prosecutor samuel asbell who shot out the windows 
of his car new years day and presented it as evidence of an 
attack has checked into a psychiatric facility attorney general 
peter n perretti said 
the event was staged by prosecutor asbell apparently acting 
alone perretti said at a news conference 
asbell resigned thursday night after he was confronted with 
details of a state police investigation perretti said 
he said there is no evidence that asbells sudden and 
aberrational behavior has affected his work as prosecutor 
perretti said it appears several criminal laws were violated 
but a decision on filing charges against asbell would depend upon 
his psychiatric evaluation 
asbell held a news conference tuesday to tell reporters he 
barely escaped death when two man chased him for about four miles 
through camdens streets when the gunmen opened fire asbell said 
he fired a 12gauge sawedoff shotgun and a handgun that he kept in 
his car striking the passenger in the assailants car 
thank god im alive asbell said i guess it just wasnt 
my day or my time 
efforts to reach asbell were unsuccessful today his spokesman 
george kerns said he was not expected in the office today 
asbell had said his car was ambushed by two men in a station 
wagon after he left his office about 5 pm monday he said he was 
in his office on new years day to catch up on paperwork and 
collect his check after a vacation 
he said the gunmen opened fire and he was sprayed with glass 
from his windows but was not seriously injured he said he believed 
the attack was drugrelated 
camden a rundown mostly black city across the delaware river 
from southern philadelphia has a high rate of drugrelated crime 
word of asbells apparent fabrication came on the same day 
blacks in boston were expressing outrage over news that innercity 
violence and a black man were unjustly blamed for the shooting of a 
pregnant woman the womans husband a welloff white businessman 
became the murder suspect and committed suicide thursday 
new jersey authorities said they were confounded by a lack of 
leads when they tried to investigate asbells story no body was 
found and the alleged victim did not turned up at local hospitals 
asbell and his family were placed under 24hour state police 
protection 
at a thursday news conference asbell stood by his story 
i have met with the attorney general and he made it 
explicitly clear to me that i am a victim of a violent crime 
he very kindly said i have to get in my mind the fact that i am 
not a prosecutor in this matter but i am a victim asbell said 
asbell while in private practice was shot in the chest in 1970 
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriffs 
sale the bullet is still lodged in his chest 
perretti appointed assistant attorney general james f mulvihil 
as acting prosecutor in camden county

q you talk about your concern about prejudicing the case but 
as you well know you have called noriega a thug and other 
people in the administration have gone further 
a yeah 
q you said hes poisoning our children havent you already 
done that 
a well i dont i think ive heard all kinds of 
characterizations of him in the press columnists even 
commentators presidents members of the united states congress 
he is now in custody the time for rhetoric is over the time for 
answering hypothetical questions that might prejudice the trial is 
over 
i would go back lesley to help you on that to watergate where 
there were hearings hearings held charges made over and over 
again editorials written and voiced and yet the people received a 
fair trial 
so i am convinced that our system of justice is so fair that the 
person will will get a fair trial but i can tell you from my 
standpoint i am going to bend over backwards and not answer 
hypothetical questions or not do anything that might prejudice that 
yeah 
q can i have a followup please on i want to actually 
follow up on helen on a no thats a separate question 
laughter 
q but its a followup reducing of charges are you saying 
that if he wants to go for that he if wants to try to go for 
reducing of charges that we will entertain it you said 
a no im not saying that im saying he has a right to do what 
he wants and then let the legal process determine how that should 
work out 
q then youre not ruling it out 
a well im not ruling it in 
yeah 
q mr president 
a im just saying hes got his rights and he ought we ought 
not to stand up here and try to define narrowly what they are 
calling on reporters yeah and then john and then well start 
moving into the back 
q mr president based on your opening remarks and your 
comments about the vice presidents trip it would indicate that 
youre concerned about relations with latin america has the action 
that youve taken set it back 
a to some degree i am concerned because i am well aware of 
how our friends south of our border including my friend president 
salinas of mexico look at the use of american force anywhere so 
im concerned about it i think its something thats correctable 
because i think they know that i have tried a lot of consultation 
that we have exhausted the remedies in this particular case of 
multilateral diplomacy 
but given the history of the use of us force i would be 
remiss if i didnt face up to the problem that we must go forward 
diplomatically now to explain how this president looks at the 
protection of american life that we acted in our view well 
within our rights but that we will continue consultation 
but look i feel strongly about the protection of american 
life so weve got to get them to understand that this isnt a 
shift away from what some had termed excessively timid 
diplomacy 
q what about 
q but mr president wouldnt that indicate that actually 
youre were continuing old american policies that have upset the 
people of latin america 
a well to the degree if there is that perception then its 
up to me and the secretary and in this instance the vice 
presidents trip takes on enormous importance to convince the 
people of the truth and that is that we are not reverting to just 
you know a willful whats the word im groping for here use 
of force that has no rationale 
but when it comes to the protection of american life please 
our friends south of the border understand that this president is 
going to protect it 
ill tell you one thing thats helped on this to the degree 
there is a problem at all and that is the way the panamanian 
democracy is now starting to move forward the certification of the 
three people who had been deprived of their right to hold office by 
the previous regime thats been of enormous help and then i 
think the other thing is the reception the public reception in 
panama for our action it has been overwhelming overwhelming

carhenge the junk car sculpture that 
spoofs englands prehistoric stonehenge has a better chance of 
survival because of a city council vote 
the tourist attraction was threatened because its creator never 
fully complied with a special use permit granted when he built it 
outside this northwestern nebraska town in 1987 officials said 
the city council voted thursday to exempt the 106acre site 
from the city zoning boundaries councilman mike dafney said by 
adjusting the boundary the city dissociates itself from carhenge 
built by james reinders of houston 
it can get on with itself and try to survive by itself he 
said but the city has no liability i can see or anything else 
we more or less are washing our hands with it as far as trying to 
regulate it 
however the city planning commission still has to approve the 
change 
the sculpture consists of old car bodies arranged in a likeness 
of the famed stonehenge in england 
reinders reportedly never fully complied with the permit which 
included requirements for liability insurance a paved access an 
escrow account for maintenance and a parking area for visitors at 
carhenge 
a group called friends of carhenge has been working to bring the 
growing tourist attraction into compliance with the permit

socialism is not to blame for chinas poverty 
and the nation will eventually triumph over its capitalist rivals 
the communist party daily newspaper said friday 
the lengthy commentary in the peoples daily came less than a 
month after a small group of university students in a bold gesture 
of dissent unfurled a banner in front of the state television 
station reading motherland why are you so poor 
it is also part of a government propaganda campaign to convince 
the populace that china must stick to the socialist road suppress 
political dissent and reject the reforms now sweeping east europe 
the dec 9 rally by beijing university of aeronautics students 
the first in the capital since the military crushed the 
prodemocracy movement last spring was not reported in the 
official press 
but chinese sources said 10 seniors were arrested including 
three who were only indirectly involved in the demonstration they 
said one chinese reporter who tried to stop police from hitting the 
protesters was also detained 
one source said a relative of one of the students was told he 
was taken to qincheng a highsecurity prison where student 
activists from the democracy movement are being held 
the commentary while not mentioning the protest said many 
young people are asking if the socialist system is superior why 
is socialist china now so poor 
it acknowledged that a per capita income of about 300 a year 
makes china one of the worlds poor countries with a rank below 
100th in the world 
but it attributed that to the nations huge population of 11 
billion and noted that china ranks eighth in the world in gross 
national product and is one of the worlds leading political 
economic and military powers 
it said the cost of goods is low distribution of income is 
equitable calorie intake approaches world averages and the 
average lifespan is 69 years compared to 63 in the world as a 
whole 
the daily said it was unfair to compare china to japan or 
taiwan saying the rapid postwar development of those capitalist 
economies shows the inferiority of socialism 
both japan and taiwan it said started with more solid economic 
bases and received substantial assistance from the united states 
chiang kaisheks nationalists also carried off great quantities of 
gold when they fled to taiwan in 1949 it said 
the commentary said chinas economy grew 94 percent a year from 
1967 to 1984 compared with 49 percent for the worlds developing 
countries and that the gap with developed nations was shrinking 
it also emphasized the moral superiority of socialism 
whatever happens it said quoting senior leader deng xiaoping 
capitalism cannot cast off the super profits of the millionaires 
cannot break away from exploitation and plunder cannot shake off 
economic crises cannot form a common ideal and morality and cannot 
avoid every type of extreme and serious crime degeneracy and 
despair 
china is backward it concluded but there will be the day 
when we approach catch up with and surpass those developed 
capitalist countries time belongs to us and the final victory 
belongs to us

both the prosecution and defense teams have 
undergone major changes since the indictments of panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega were handed up in miami and tampa 
richard gregorie who wrote the feb 4 1988 miami indictment 
left the us attorneys office last year he expressed concern 
that he hasnt been asked for help from the current team which has 
no one who played a major role in the case 
gregorie a 17year prosecutor now in private practice says he 
left a very detailed memo about the noriega case but has other 
files and some in my head id be happy to share im more 
than happy to help the government in any way to make sure that the 
prosecution is successful 
us attorney dexter lehtinen declined to comment on gregories 
statements his executive assistant diane cossin said a 
sevenmember prosecution team with a total of 40 years experience 
would handle the complex case in which noriega is charged with 
allowing panama to be used as a way station for cocaine chemical 
and money shipments 
she said there were no plans to bring in gregorie former us 
attorney leon kellner or mark schnapp another assistant us 
attorney who helped with the indictment as consultants 
charles senatore another former assistant us attorney now in 
private practice said turnover makes it common for new prosecutors 
to take over cases 
its a problem that happens a lot because a small percentage 
of the people employed as assistant us attorneys remain there 
their entire careers senatore said theres certainly enough 
of a database remaining for the current team 
lehtinen and myles malman an assistant us attorney with 
experience in drugrelated trials are the lead prosecutors for now 
and represented the government at noriegas court appearance 
thursday 
thenpresident reagan named lehtinen on june 17 1988 to 
replace kellner who left for private practice in washington he 
said thursday he wouldnt comment on the noriega case 
in tampa where noriega was indicted on drug bribery charges 
robert genzman has become the us attorney succeeding robert 
merkle who resigned after successfully prosecuting colombian 
cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas merkle lost a us senate bid 
in 1988 and is in private practice in clearwater 
lehtinen 43 is a former state senator with federal prosecution 
experience in los angeles and miami 
he has been a highprofile us attorney and last year raised 
eyebrows by suing state water managers for allegedly failing to 
protect the everglades from polluted water flowing from lake 
okeechobee that suit is pending 
lehtinens wife ileana roslehtinen won a special election 
last august for the us house seat left vacant by rep claude 
peppers death she became the first cubanborn us representative 
while lehtinen hasnt tried a case in a decade malman has 15 
years of prosecuting experience in new york and miami 
one of noriegas original defense attorneys nationally 
prominent lawyer neal sonnett withdrew last week citing conflicts 
with the other attorneys ray takiff another of noreigas miami 
attorneys asked this week to withdraw because of health problems 
noriegas remaining attorneys are frank rubino and steven kollin 
rubino 44 is a former secret service agent exprivate eye and 
a race car driver kollin 41 was once a us treasury agent and 
worked in the dade county state attorneys office 
both have experience in drugrelated trials but some miami 
defense attorneys have said the complexity of noriegas case and 
its high profile may bring other betterknown attorneys 
sonnett president of the national association of criminal 
defense lawyers didnt rule out returning to noriegas defense 
the attorneys didnt answer questions about how theyre being 
paid the united states has seized noriega assets it has been able

the albanian ambasador on friday denied 
reports that four greeks were tortured to death for trying to flee 
the isolated country and he said the prodemocracy movement in 
eastern europe has not affected albania 
ambassador izedin haidini showed a film that he said proved the 
four greek prassas brothers were alive contrary to allegations of 
the orthodox church of greece 
however no independent observer could verify that the four 
young men shown exchanging new years greetings were the brothers 
a greek foreign ministry official said greek diplomats based in 
tirana the albanian capital were not permitted to leave the city 
to verify that the prassas brothers were alive in their village of 
pepel 
church officials have said the men were caught trying to flee 
albania for neighboring greece in october and were tortured to 
death 
albania is the last bastion of stalinist communism the orthodox 
church claims the countrys 400000 ethnic greeks are denied human 
rights since they are banned from practicing their religion or 
speaking greek in public 
the government of albania which incorporated greeces northern 
province of northern epirus in 1916 claims the greek minority 
enjoys special treatment 
haidini denied that diplomats or tourists with valid visas were 
prevented from traveling throughout the heavily guarded country 
albania sandwiched between yugoslavia and greece on the 
adriatic sea is one of the most isolated countries in the world 
with foreign visitors strictly limited and access to foreign 
broadcasts and books tightly controlled 
the ambassador also said that no unrest had occurred in albania 
as a result of the political upheaval that has toppled hardline 
communist regimes across the east bloc 
a man who claims to be albanias true ruler was quoted as saying 
friday that leaflets calling for a revolution in albania will be 
attached to balloons and dropped into the country 
we will broadcast messages by radio and drop leaflets by 
balloon something we have done before said the man who calls 
himself king leka i his comments appeared in the johannesburg 
newspaper business day 
leka is the son of selfsyled king zog i who ruled albania from 
1925 to 1939 leka who lives in south africa was taken from his 
homeland when he was 3 days old and has never returned

a tongan man was sentenced today to a year 
in prison the maximum sentence for his conviction of misdemeanor 
homicide in the death of the black son of a hollywood actress in a 
trial that sparked racial tension 
john leota also was ordered to pay restitution of more than 
40000 for the death of malik smith the 18yearold son of 
actress beverly todd and producer kris keiser 
third district judge homer wilkinsons sentence was the maximum 
for the charge of negligent homicide leota 19 also was sentenced 
to one years probation and 150 hours of community service for an 
assault charge involving another man 
i just want to express how sorry i am to the family leota 
said before sentencing i know that what i did was wrong i 
didnt know it was going to happen 
the emotionally charged sentencing hearing drew an outburst from 
todd when defense attorney phil hansen told wilkinson she had 
pulled the plug on the lifesaving machine that kept her sons 
body alive 
thats a lie todd said why would he say that she then 
wept 
keiser emphasized that life support equipment was not removed 
from smith of los angeles until after two tests showed his son 
was braindead 
on thursday members of the polynesian community here charged 
that wealthy hollywood blacks were trying to deny leota justice 
entertainers such as whoopi goldberg and jennifer warren wrote 
letters to wilkinson to protest the misdemeanor conviction of a 
defendant who was tried for seconddegree murder 
smith was fatally injured when he struck his head after being 
punched by leota at a west valley disco march 20 leota testified 
smith had embarrassed him but he did not mean to kill him when he 
hit him once and kicked him in the face 
surrounded by about 20 members of the polynesian community 
attorneys paul schwenke filia uipi and victor lawrence a samoan 
tongan and hawaiian respectively blasted wealthy hollywood 
blacks for trying to trample the civil rights of a john leota 
these black entertainers who live in one of the most violent 
areas of the world outside of beirut la county have the 
arrogance to point their wealthy fingers at utah and scream about 
injustice schwenke said at a news conference thursday 
we the polynesian community and citizens ofutah say to these 
celebrities utah is a lawabiding state we demand you let the 
judicial process go forward we do not want the legal process to be 
influenced in any way he said 
a letter to the editor by goldberg said she would spread the 
word of the dangers that lurk in your beautiful state 
schwenke did not feel there were racial issues surrounding the 
crime but that racial issues were generated by comments from the 
victims family 
upon sentencing wilkinson ordered leota incarcerated in salt 
lake county jail

george mitchell can ever accuse you of having a timid foreign 
policy 
a knowing george hell find a reason hell find a way and 
thats his job i mean look were going into an election year 
but this i want to try if i can to separate the responsive end 
hes been supportive of this lets give the man credit 
q thats my point 
a but i dont think its laid to rest put off bounds any 
criticism of the president by a democratic opposition if thats 
the question no absolutely not 
q what about 
a yeah frank and then 
q mr president 
a and then youre third 
go ahead 
q mr president do you anticipate that the combat troops the 
bulk of the additional combat troops sent into panama will indeed 
be out by the end of this month as some administration officials 
have said 
and secondly and more broadly do you now see an expanded role 
for the american military in small regional issues like this one 
or more particularly in the war against drugs since there was a 
strong drug connection to this operation 
a no i see no well i see no parallel between the situation 
here where american lives were at stake and you had an indicted 
person whod usurped power and declared war against the united 
states i dont think you can draw a parallel between that unique 
situation and then other countries 
and what was the other part of it 
q the bit about when you see america these additional combat 
troops able to come home all of them 
a as soon as possible and ive made clear to the secretary of 
defense to the chairman of the joint chiefs who is down in panama 
right now i believe that this is what we should do this is what 
they themselves want to do some us forces that went in are 
already out so i would look for an early return 
q general timeframe 
a cant help you but as soon as general powell gets back 
well have a more 
dave 
q what about the international law 
a is your name dave laughing 
q implications 
a go ahead 
q what about the international law implications is this 
something that you are also going to talk to the latin american 
countries 
a absolutely 
q off mike a precedent what is the explanation 
behind it 
a the right to protect american lives granted under the un 
charter and we will protect lives of citizens and we will go 
forward with that the state department as i understand it has 
already spelled that out but i think you raise a good point yes 
we should make very clear why we acted and under what authority we 
acted as we did 
david 
q mr president you just described panama as a unique case 
and id just like to ask you sort of a philosophical question if 
the criteria you listed here protecting american lives having 
exhausted all the other diplomatic options presented themselves 
again should we look in a bush presidency for more such 
deployments of military force if your criteria were met 
a well yeah if you can spell out what the criteria is and 
then if you can if you can if you can look to the future to see 
the situation surrounding it i cant visualize another situation 
quite this unique 
but let me just say when american life is threatened we we 
were concerned in el salvador for example a civilian hotel could 
well have been occupied by a guerrilla force that would have 
threatened the american use of threatened american life that 
concerned me 
and indeed we moved forces not in some macho way but to try to 
protect the lives of american citizens but i think most people 
understood that but i dont see david i dont see another real 
parallel here looming on the horizon at all

western politicians said friday the 
plan to hold elections in only three months could give the interim 
leadership an unfair advantage and they recommended international 
supervision of the vote 
us rep frank r wolf rva said romanias new political 
parties lack the tools of democracy and proposed a referendum 
on the election date new parties have asked that elections be 
delayed beyond april so they will have time to organize 
wolf and otto lambsdorff both of whom were visiting bucharest 
recommended international monitoring of the elections lambsdorff 
is a former west german economics minister 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze was scheduled to 
visit bucharest on saturday for the first meeting between the new 
leaders and a ranking soviet official 
silviu brucan a member of the national salvation front said 
thursday the soviets had promised extensive aid including fuel for 
the hard winter the front has governed romania since the downfall 
of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who was deposed dec 22 
and executed dec 25 
lt gen victor stanculescu who is in charge of the economy for 
the front said in an interview published friday some trading 
partners had agreed to accept exports of industrial products 
instead of food he did not name the countries but food has been 
one of romanias exports to the soviet union 
the interim leadership has stopped food exports and redirected 
supplies to the nations 23 million people who endured rationing 
for years as part of ceausescus successful plan to repay the 
foreign debt 
its revolution appears to have brought romania closer to the 
soviet union despite the collapse of the communist party 
ceausescu often was at odds with the kremlin on trade and foreign 
policy and rejected mikhail s gorbachevs plans for economic and 
social reform 
shevardnadze and romanian leaders are expected discuss the 
sensitive issue of soviet moldavia one of several restive soviet 
regions most of the republic is former romanian territory annexed 
in 1940 under a secret protocol of the hitlerstalin pact of 1939 
moldavians whose language is virtually identical to romanian 
have demanded increased autonomy and romanias revolution has 
prompted speculation they may seek reunification 
the national salvation front initially said it would not run 
candidates in the april elections but later reversed itself the 
halfdozen parties founded since the revolution have said they need 
time to organize 
wolf said the fronts control of radio and television could be 
a real concern in a campaign and parties outside the front 
should be allowed access to the media 
without media access and scarce equipment such as typewriters 
and copiers the independent parties would be at a serious 
disadvantage wolf said 
lambsdorff also expressed concern that the interim leadership 
would have an edge and said at a news conference it would 
perhaps be necessary to assure international supervision for the 
results of the elections to be completely fair 
wolf has visited romania before and had pressed congress 
because of human rights violatons to revoke the most favored 
nation trade status granted ceausescus government 
he suggested some form of international supervision and 
recommended a national referendum in april to have a decision on 
when the elections should be held 
a verifiable free election was very important to the us 
congress he said and there needs to be a guarantee that 
free elections and other promises of democratic change will be 
carried out 
wolf said he expected the united states to have a warm and 
close relationship with romania and a highranking official 
would visit bucharest he gave no details 
people have asked me can i get a copy of the us 
constitution another group asked me for paper tools of democracy 
that maybe thomas jefferson would have asked for he said 
the congressman proposed that the us chamber of commerce and 
national association of independent businessmen organize a program 
to teach management skills and free enterprise to romanians 
stanculescu the general managing the economy said in an 
interview with the daily romania libera that ceausescus regime 
inflated production figures and said the value of production and 
exports were lower than reported 
exports last year were worth 392 million less than the official 
total the report said 
rompress the national news agency said stanculescus deputy 
constantin bostina had been dismissed because of his association 
with the ceausescu regime

presidentelect patricio aylwin met 
friday with the commanders of the air force and national police and 
asked them to stay on when the military ends its 16year rule in 
march 
gen fernando matthei the air force chief and gen rodolfo 
stange national police director are considered politically 
moderate both advocate a return to the barracks and an exclusively 
professional role for the military 
the two are expected to mitigate the influence within the armed 
forces of hardline rightist gen augusto pinochet who gives up 
the presidency to aylwin on march 11 but plans to retain command of 
the powerful army he has rejected a request from aylwin that he 
retire 
matthei and stange along with top aides visited aylwin 
separately friday at the presidentelects home in santiago upon 
leaving each disclosed to reporters that aylwin had asked him to 
stay on 
matthei said he would postpone his planned retirement for a 
year he said aylwin told him it would be good for the stability 
of the country and to strengthen the beginnings of the new 
government 
stange previously had said he would stay on briefly but on 
friday said he would remain as national police chief for up to four 
years which is the length of aylwins term i told him that id 
be pleased to stay on stange said 
pinochet seized power in a september 1973 coup that toppled 
civilian president salvador allende a clause in the countrys 1980 
constitution crafted by his own administration allows him to stay 
on as army commander for eight more years 
the same clause also shelters matthei stange and navy chief 
adm jose merino but merino a hardline rightist has said he 
plans to retire when the change in government takes place 
pinochet was obliged to call elections when voters rejected a 
referendum proposal in october 1988 that would have extended his 
rule to 1997 
matthei was the first to recognize pinochets loss in the 
referendum and according to local news reports was instrumental 
in persuading pinochet to accept the votes outcome and call the 
elections 
matthei and stange also are believed to have had a moderating 
influence in the fourman military junta that has served as a 
legislature under pinochet the junta is made up of the navy air 
force and police commanders and an army general designated by 
pinochet 
aylwin 71 the leader of a 17party centerleft coalition 
defeated hernan buchi a former pinochet finance minister in the 
election dec 14 
on thursday the government and representatives of a proaylwin 
political coalition announced agreement on a new law establishing 
the armed forces authority under democracy pinochet had proposed 
virtual autonomy for the military but the agreement extended 
civilian authority and trimmed the powers of a joint command

position is total unadulterated bull and preposterous and 
stupid

airlines is the story of police officers battle against 
terrorists who try to take over dulles international airport in 
suburban washington dc 
the plot of the sequel to die hard is heavy on wisecracks 
and liberal in the use of automatic weapons and plastic explosives

q mr president 
q mr president back to the issue of china your decision to 
send emissaries to china has carried some cost for you have you 
seen any payoff yet have you had any response from the regime 
there that is productive or encouraging for you 
a well it does carry some and i think some who are familiar 
with the situation have been quite supportive and some quite 
critical i will admit that as i indicated some favor isolation 
dont talk and let them come to us 
i think one of the great things that happened to us is you 
know under the shanghai communique and prior to that is the fact 
that we had a kind of contact and they began to see began to 
facilitate our contact help facilitate the changes and the reforms 
that have taken place so i want to see those go forward again but 
i is that responsive i cant remember 
q well let me ask you specifically are we close to a 
resolution on the issue of the dissidents or 
a i dont know the answer to that i dont know the answer to 
that they know my position and it is one of adherence to human 
rights i might add the thing i object to about this whole one is 
the assigning of motives to the other person 
you can question the tactics but i refuse to let my political 
critics get me down in terms of they understand human rights and i 
dont i want to see through the contacts that weve made change 
that can be manifested in several ways 
now there has been some the voice of america for example now 
permitted somebody to go is now you know they have a person 
permitted to go there theres been a reiteration of sale of 
missiles which we are very much in our i think in interest of 
peace in the world so theres been progress and hopefully i 
would like to hope that there would be more 
yeah gerry and then two two go ahead gerry and then you 
q mr president as you know mikhail gorbachev has been 
visiting the baltics in his country to deal with the growing 
independence or autonomy movement there have you encouraged him to 
allow those movements to continue or do you consider that 
essentially an internal affair for the soviets 
a well hes got his own internal affairs but he knows of our 
our advocacy of peaceful change and to the mans credit he has 
been the big advocate of peaceful change he has been the advocate 
of reform i mean i youve got to link it gerry to eastern 
europe to some degree 
and i realize and we can discuss this that the problems are 
different but give the credit that i dont think any of us a year 
ago from this day would have given in terms of soviet adherence to 
gorbachev adherence to change given the dynamic upheaval in 
eastern europe 
now hes facing problems inside the problems inside the borders 
of the soviet union the baltics more recently this other one 
and he is keeps reiterating his conviction about peaceful change 
so i support that but we did have an opportunity to discuss in 
broad philosophical terms this question in at malta 
q are you confident as a result of that theres not going to 
be a crackdown 
a well im certainly not buying into the hypothesis that there 
will and i hope that he will that this approach that he has 
taken for which we give credit will prevail 
yes 
q yes mr president several times today you made reference to 
the us right to and indeed your obligation to protect american 
lives today an american nun is being buried here in the united 
states even the catholic order she represented there in nicaragua 
claims that she was killed by contra forces what 
a they did say that id heard there was 
q representatives of that group say that contra forces have 
been known to operate in that area using those tactics that 
perhaps they didnt recognize the pickup truck that they were 
driving in what do we know about who may have killed those nuns 
a yeah 
q and what are you doing to communicate to the contra are you 
trying to call them off 
a well were not calling them off because we dont know they 
were called on and im interested in what you your hypothesis 
because youre telling me that some have concluded that it was the 
contras the contras have denied that some have suggested it might 
be the other side 
the answer is i deplore the loss of that nuns life and 
similarly there were another that i believe was killed that was a 
nicaraguan there and i deplore that loss of life 
but it is murky it is extraordinarily murky similarly 
similar to the situation in el salvador but i want to take this 
opportunity to speak out against it but we dont know the answer 
to it and in el salvador we said find out well give you 
whatever technical assistance we can and we want to find the 
answer to this question 
yeah ann 
q well but youre not confident then that the contras didnt 
commit 
a i dont know the answer to your question theyve said they 
didnt others are accusing them and i dont know and i dont 
think our government knows id share it with you if they did 
ann 
q mr president in panama we saw women leading troops in 
combat for the first time are you comfortable with women in that 
role and would you support changes in the restrictions on women in 
combat

ousted east german leader erich honecker has 
a malignant kidney tumor and a decision on surgery will be made 
soon the official news agency adn said friday 
honecker 77 was examined by doctors and found to be too ill to 
be jailed while being investigated for alleged government 
corruption 
he was forced out of office on oct 18 under increasing pressure 
from east german prodemocracy reform groups and a flood of young 
skilled workers fleeing to west germany 
in december officials announced that honecker was under 
investigation for corruption and had been placed under house arrest 
because of his health 
seven former communist party politburo members were jailed at 
the same time and investigations against them for suspected 
corruption also continue 
honecker underwent gallbladder surgery in august adn and other 
east german media have said he has never fully recovered 
reform groups including the 200000strong new forum allege 
honecker and other government leaders had lived in luxury in the 
wandlitz government housing area outside east berlin while normal 
citizens were forced do make do with bare necessities 
on thursday adn said he had been released from house arrest 
several weeks ago because no grounds were found to justify it the

a no i think this is a matter ill willingly accept listen 
to recommendations from the defense department but these were not 
combat assignments but any time you have a highly trained gungho 
volunteer force and theyre caught up in some of the firefights 
that went on a person man or woman can be inflicted into a 
put into a combat situation 
but its my understanding and i think secretary of defense 
dick cheney took a question on that today that these were not 
combat roles and so i would let the let the heroic performance 
of these people be weighed and measured and then see if the 
defense department wanted to recommend to the president any 
additional changes 
yeah 
q do you have assurances from moscow 
a three more one and then two way in the back just in the 
spirit of equity 
q do you have assurances from moscow that the operation in 
panama wont hurt ussoviet relations 
a not equitable excuse me 
q do you have assurances from moscow that the operation in 
panama wont hurt ussoviet relations 
a well im confident they didnt seem overly enthused about 
it by mr gerasimovs statement but on the other hand we i 
dont agree with him at all but i dont think its going to 
fundamentally flaw the relationships between ourselves and the 
united states sic 
craig 
q do you think that the latin leaders have been hypersensitive 
to the given the fact that in back channels apparently theyve 
been supportive of the invasion can you say if that is correct 
and then also because of that do you think theyve been 
hypersensitive in their public statements about us forces 
a i like to feel that given the way the situation has 
resolved there is more support than has manifested itself in votes 
at the united nations or in public statements the vice presidents 
trip will help on this my own consultations will help decide you 
know give me a clearer answer to your question 
but i i am absolutely convinced given what happened and the 
reason why it happened that if there is damage i can repair it 
we can repair it state department and whoever else is involved can 
repair it 
q but is it hypersensitive their reaction so far 
a well i think predictably so 
q mr president 
q mr president 
a heres the last one way in the back 
q mr president some countries with the precedent now of 
panama feel that their sovereignty might be violated if the united 
states pursues drug dealers in their countries and there has been 
some change in laws can you know can it be reasonable that they 
are worried about this in the sense of the cia the fbi going 
being able to apprehend people outside the united states territory 
a and so the question is what 
q do these countries have reason to be worried that the 
precedent of panama might serve as 
a oh panama was more than that panama had clearly other 
ingredients that caused american action it wasnt a simple case of 
going after a person who had been indicted for narcotics you know 
we had the abortion of democracy but you also had this threat to 
the lives of americans 
let me do something in conclusion that may be a little risky 
and its a housekeeping detail and it relates mainly to television 
i got a lot of mail after the last press conference i had some 
calls because when i was speaking here in this room juxtaposed 
against my frivolous comments at the time were some a 
splitscreen technique that showed american lives the bodies of 
dead soldiers in the caskets dead soldiers coming home and all 
i would respectfully request that if the urgency of the moment is 
such that that technique is going to be used if i could be told 
about it and will stop the proceedings or if its something less 
traumatic but that one i could understand why the viewers were 
concerned about this they thought their president at a solemn 
moment like that didnt give a damn and i do i do i feel it so 
strongly so please help me with that if you would 
thank you all very much

an engine that dropped off a northwest 
airlines jetliner was found this afternoon on a wooded cattle farm 
near this north florida town federal officials said 
the 3500pound pratt amp whitney engine was spotted by a madison 
county sheriffs helicopter pilot and immediately secured until a 
federal air safety investigator makes it to the site 
it was roped off and we were told not to mess with it said 
madison county sheriffs dispatcher fred register 
ted lopatkiewicz spokesman for the national transportation 
safety board in washington said the nearest inspector was 
traveling more than 200 miles from tampa and would not make it to 
the site until close to nightfall 
he said the engine would be inspected and then moved to the 
nearest maintenance facility for further examination 
sheriffs deputies said the engine was found on the property of 
a rancher who reported hearing a loud crash thursday deputies were 
not able to follow up on the tip until after heavy fog cleared late 
this morning 
the engine one of three from a boeing 727 fell off thursdays 
flight 5 from miami to minneapolis the flight diverted to tampa 
and landed safely with 139 passengers and six crew members on board 
officials believe the engine will provide the best evidence on 
what caused the mishap 
investigators found the forward right lavatory had leaked 
bluetinted water over the outside of the aircraft at the 
35000foot altitude where the right tailmounted engine fell off 
the fluid could have frozen and entered the intake of the engine 
an official said 
that is a possibility said andrew alston a national 
transportation safety board investigator 
but boeing spokesman tom cole in seattle noted that engines on a 
727 are designed to break off if sudden vibrations threaten to tear 
a plane apart and the socalled blue ice could cause such 
vibrations 
blue ice is a definite possibility he said twice before 
when engines fell off boeing 727s on a dallastosan diego flight 
in 1985 and on a flight over sierra blanca texas in 1975 
lavatory ice was raised as a possible cause he said 
it can do serious damage cole said chunks have been 
found that weighed 10 to 15 pounds 
the flight crew initially believed the no 3 engine had shut off 
and they made several attempts to restart it flying for several 
minutes without realizing the engine had fallen off alston said 
the crew all stated that they heard a loud noise and that the 
plane yawed to the right alston said they felt since there 
was no massive pitching of the aircraft that the engine had just 
shut down 
investigators said the plane dropped about 100 feet in altitude 
after losing the engine but there were no major problems with 
control cabin pressure or hydraulics 
passengers said the flight was surprisingly smooth 
we were amazed when we got out and saw an engine fell off 
said passenger mark lawrence of leseur minn except for a bump 
and a little dip you couldnt feel a thing some passengers even 
slept through it

the united states is not pushing israel to talk 
to the plo but is unwilling to meet israels demand for rigid 
guarantees in advance of middle east peace talks a newspaper 
reported friday 
the daily yediot aharanot quoted from a document it said was a 
draft letter from us secretary of state james a baker iii to 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens israeli officials did not 
confirm the existence of the letter 
baker has been working to get israel to accept an egyptian 
invitation to open a dialogue with palestinians as a step toward 
israels plan for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
in november the israeli government accepted a fivepoint baker 
plan to facilitate the egyptian meeting but it demanded us 
side assurances that the palestine liberation organziation will 
have no role and that the dialogue will be limited to israels 
elections plan 
baker has urged that arens and egypts foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid join him in preliminary talks in washington and 
israeli officials say the washington meeting could come next month 
according to yediot the baker letter said the goal of the 
united states in the present effort is not bringing israel to a 
dialogue with the plo 
it continued however that the united states was not willing to 
give assurances on what palestinians would say at the meeting and 
that delegates in their opening statements would be free to 
raise other issues and not limit themselves to elections 
these are the assurances that we plan to provide yediot 
quoted the letter as saying the president and myself are 
convinced that these are enough to dispel israels worries and 
allow progress in the peace process 
the draft letter reportedly was carried to israel by cabinet 
secretary eliakim rubinstein who talked with state department 
officials in washington last month 
yediot said that in addition to arens the draft letter was 
given to prime minister yitzhak shamir defense minister yitzhak 
rabin and finance minister shimon peres the newspaper did not say 
how it obtained a copy 
avi pazner a shamir adviser said of the newspaper report 
many things there are not new many things there are not 
accurate 
he added we are still engaged in a discussion with the united 
states on the question of guarantees that the plo will not be part 
of the negotiating process until we have reached an agreement with 
the americans we would prefer not to relate to all kinds of press 
speculation 
yediot said that rubinstein in a summary of his talks advised 
the cabinet ministers that baker wants to include two palestinian 
deportees in the delegation for the cairo meeting despite israels 
demand that the delegates must come from the occupied lands 
egypt has suggested that including people deported from the 
occupied territories would make the talks more acceptable to the 
plo which has demanded it name the palestinian delegates 
in an interview on israel radio friday yossi benaharon 
directorgeneral of the prime ministers office indicated that 
israel was holding firm to its earlier conditions 
since the palestinian uprising against occupation began two 
years ago at least 642 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians and 43 israelis have been slain by 
palestinians 
israels elections plan is aimed at choosing palestinians to 
hold talks with israel on limited autonomy in the occupied lands 
palestinian leaders here have rejected the call saying their goal 
is an independent palestinian state

in the hilly orchards of south lebanons apple country has driven 
15000 villagers to refuge in the mosques and schools of nearby 
towns police said friday 
while fighting raged in south lebanon president elias hrawi 
prepared to establish headquarters in moslem west beirut where his 
predecessor was assassinated six weeks ago 
amal and hezbollah miltiamen traded grenade and mortar fire for 
the 14th day friday in a struggle for supremacy among the 12 
million shiites lebanons largest sect 
police said four people were killed and 12 wounded raising the 
toll to 77 killed and 275 wounded since the battle began dec 23 
just south of sidon the provincial capital of south lebanon and 
about 30 miles south of beirut 
the refugees sought shelter in sidon and in nabatiyeh a market 
town police reported 
three members of a palestinian guerrilla force that had tried to 
disengage the combatants were reported among the wounded police 
said they were caught in cross fire between hezbollah which is 
loyal to iran and militiamen of the mainstream amal which syria 
supports 
they were the first palestinian casualties since 300 guerrillas 
were deployed last weekend on a hill overlooking contested villages 
in iqlim altuffah the apple province 
a police spokesman said the guerrillas yasser arafats fatah 
faction of the palestine liberation organization did not shoot 
back when they came under fire on hamade hill which overlooks kfar 
hatta 
amal militiamen who control the village repulsed two hezbollah 
assaults from nearby kfar milki said the spokesman who cannot be 
named under police regulations 
the two militias have fought intermittently since may 1987 and 
by police count total casualties are 648 dead and 1854 injured 
hezbollah renewed an offer friday of an immediate and complete 
ceasefire to be swiftly followed by negotiations a hezbollah 
statement said fighting among shiites was senseless and neither 
side could win 
there was no response from amal its leader nabih berri has 
said he would accept a ceasefire only when hezbollah withdraw from 
captured territory 
hrawi has been staying at an army barracks in the 
syriancontrolled bekaa valley of east lebanon since parliament 
elected him nov 24 as part of a peace plan intended to end the 
sectarian civil war now nearly 15 years old 
he plans to live and work in a seaside apartment building to 
avoid commuting in west beirut where his predecessor rene 
mouawad was killed by remotecontrolled bomb nov 22 hrawi is a 
maronite catholic as was mouawad 
the police spokesman said friday that hrawi would move to west 
beirut by the weekend but the army and police havent finished 
security arrangements to protect the president during the trip 
mouawad lived in the same seaside duplex provided by saudi 
arabian businessman rafik hariri but had offices at the prime 
ministry a 10minute drive away 
he was being driven home from an independence day ceremony when 
the car bomb exploded killing him and 23 other people 
a government official said privately that hrawi will not leave 
the building except for foreign trips he wants to avoid risks 
the presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb east of 
beirut is occupied by gen michel aoun the rebel christian 
commander refuses to recognize hrawi and calls him a syrian puppet 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
mandate issued in 1976 the year after the civil war began 
aoun calls them an occupation army and the 20000 christian 
troops he commands fought a sixmonth artillery war with the 
syrians last year 
at least 929 people were killed and 2744 wounded before the 
arab league arranged a ceasefire in september nearly all the 
casualties were civilians

prime minister nikolai i ryzhkovs mother has 
died tass reported friday in an unusual mention of a ruling 
politburo members family affairs 
the staterun news agency released a oneparagraph statement 
saying the politburo expresses deep sympathy for ni ryzhkov on 
the passing away of his mother alexandra pavlovna ryzhkova 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
earlier this week that ryzhkovs mothers illness might prevent him 
from attending the comecon meeting in bulgaria on jan 9 there was 
no word friday on whether he would be present 
the comecon meeting promises to be a crucial one with members 
clamoring for an overhaul and czechoslovakia reportedly planning to 
propose that the east bloc economic alliance be disbanded 
czechoslovakia finance minister vaclav klaus said thursday there 
was no reason for comecon to exist anymore and he said his nation 
would pull out unless the bloc is totally overhauled 
polish foreign trade minister marcin swiecicki echoed klaus 
views friday saying the alliance is outdated and should be 
replaced by a lessrigid organization 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn also said friday that 
comecon needed radical reform 
the report of the death of ryzhkovs mother went against the 
soviet custom of keeping leaders personal affairs strictly 
private president mikhail s gorbachevs more relaxed style has 
led to the lowering of the veil around leaders lives somewhat 
politburo conservative yegor k ligachev discussed his hobbies 
with a soviet weekly and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
admitted at a news conference that he wrote love poems in his youth

executed romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu 
once drafted an elaborate plan to flee to china and direct a 
guerrilla war from there against anyone who tried to oust him his 
former head of security says 
my job would have been to take ceausescu out of romania ion 
pacepa said in a telephone interview with the associated press 
the flight to china was part of what ceausescu called plan 
m which also called for the securitate secret police to adopt 
civilian disguises retreat to hidden bunkers and wage guerrilla 
war pacepa said in one of the few interviews he has given since 
defecting in 1978 
ceausescus refuge at that time was china where he was to 
live there as long as need be said pacepa he declined to 
disclose his current address where he lives under an assumed name 
ceausescu the last of the hardline warsaw pact bosses to fall 
from power kept close ties with officials in other conservative 
communist countries such as china and north korea as well as with 
islamic leaders in iran 
at the time of his defection pacepa was a twostar general and 
acting head of romanian external intelligence in his book red 
horizons he detailed ceausescus efforts to obtain western 
technology on behalf of moscow 
the book also chronicled the extravagant use of power and wealth 
by ceausescu and his wife elena who were executed after a secret 
trial on christmas day 
pacepa said he agreed to speak to the ap because his daughter 
dana damaceanu her husband and two other relatives were being 
escorted to safety from romania by us rep frank a wolf rva 
his daughter had been under virtual house arrest for a decade and 
was arrested by the securitate during the upheaval he said 
the group was arriving at dulles international airport near 
washington on saturday a day earlier than expected said charles 
lyons a spokesman for wolf 
the contingency plan for ceausescu to survive a rebellion as 
described by pacepa resembled what was occurring in romania until 
the fugitive leader was captured on dec 23 
officials of the provisional romanian government said they 
executed the ceausescus because they feared the securitate might 
rescue them and because they wished to encourage proceausescu 
forces to give up romanian television repeatedly broadcast footage 
of the secret trial and the bodies of the executed ceausescus to 
prove they were dead 
by the time pacepa defected ceausescu had built miles of secret 
tunnels linking his downtown palace to other buildings and to two 
airports on the outskirts of bucharest the romanian capital 
romanian radio reported during the uprising that the securitate 
retreated into a maze of secret tunnels from which it was 
launching attacks 
as part of plan m said pacepa romanian intelligence 
established safe houses in west germany and two neutral countries 
austria and switzerland to give ceausescu the means to wage a 
guerrilla war from abroad 
the safe houses were occupied by romanian illegals 
romanianborn agents who had documents saying they were natives of 
the countries in which they were living they used burst 
transmitters to broadcast coded messages in brief transmissions 
that are hard for intelligence agencies to detect he said 
there were a dozen radio stations to illegally communicate 
with the securitate in romania and ceausescu in china he said 
pacepa cooperated with western intelligence after he defected 
and said most of the illegals had disappeared or were taken 
into custody 
ceausescus agents tried several times to kill pacepa after his 
defection and they harassed and repeatedly arrested and beat his 
daughter in bucharest he said the threats and harassment worsened 
after radio free europe broadcast pacepas book over its 
romanianlanguage service he said 
the usfunded radio station deserves a lot of the credit 
for toppling ceausescu said pacepa in romania people were not 
able to watch west german or austrian television as reformers 
could in east germany hungary and czechoslovakia the only 
source of information was radio free europe and they did a 
marvelous job 
the securitate numbered 10000 agents when ceausescu took power 
in 1965 said pacepa and reportedly reached 180000 by the time of 
his ouster about the same size as the regular army 
because he did not have confidence in the army he built his 
own army said pacepa in the end the romanian army revolted and 
defeated the securitate

the nations unemployment rate held steady at 
53 percent last month as gains in service industries offset the 
ninth consecutive monthly drop in manufacturing jobs the labor 
department said friday 
the steady civilian jobless rate which ended 1989 just under 
the level where it began gave private analysts hope that the 
economys current sluggish growth will not worsen into a recession 
thats a good number and it certainly suggests that the 
economy isnt falling out of bed said robert dederick chief 
economist for the northern trust co of chicago 
in other good economic news the commerce department said friday 
that orders to us factories for manufactured goods which have 
been lackluster in recent months shot up 24 percent in november 
to a seasonally adjusted 2397 billion their best showing since 
april 
the increased demand was widespread across most industries led 
by another big jump in orders for aircraft economists said the 
rise in orders if it continues in coming months should halt the 
slide in manufacturing employment probably by the middle of next 
year 
analysts were still concerned that the slowdown in the overall 
economy which many feared would last until the spring would 
translate into higher jobless rates in the months ahead 
there definitely is some weakness out there in the land 
the steady growth of the service industry is whats keeping us from 
slipping into a recession said economist cynthia latta of 
drimcgraw hill 
during all of last year the unemployment rate fluctuated in a 
narrow range within a tenth of a percentage point of 53 percent 
except for march when it dipped to a 15year low of 5 percent the 
average for the year was 53 percent 
based on a workplace survey manufacturing industries lost 
another 25000 jobs in december bringing factory job losses since 
march to 195000 us manufacturing suffered in 1989 with 
widespread layoffs in auto plants and other factories producing 
bigticket consumer goods 
this job loss has not been enough to pull the country into a 
recession because of a continued boom in the service sector where 
most americans are employed 
in december the service sector added 206000 jobs bringing 
total job growth for the year to 24 million 
theres a kind of tug of war going on to see whether service 
industry increases will pull ahead of the manufacturing losses 
said pierre ellis an economist at the boston co 
the addition of 142000 nonfarm jobs in december was not 
considered a particularly strong advance given that it was 
artificially inflated with the return of about 55000 striking 
telephone workers in new york 
some analysts were concerned by a 06 percent rise in average 
hourly earnings in december which would translate into wage gains 
above 7 percent if it persisted for a year 
however other analysts dismissed the jump as a onemonth 
aberration and not a signal that wage pressures were threatening to 
set off an inflationary spiral they noted that the 41 percent 
increase in hourly wages over the past year was still under 
consumer price inflation which has been increasing by 45 percent 
the labor department on friday revised the november unemployment 
rate to 53 percent which it had earlier reported as 54 percent 
according to a household survey by the department the economy 
produced 17 million new jobs during 1989 bringing the civilian 
work force to 1179 million that was down from job gains of 23 
million in 1988 
construction jobs fell by 38000 in december with analysts 
attributing the drop to the deep freeze that gripped most of the 
nation last month 
transportation employers added 73000 jobs on a seasonally 
adjusted basis last month business services added 14000 health 
services 47000 government 34000 and finance insurance and 
real estate 13000 retail employment grew by 12000 fewer jobs 
than the normally expected seasonal gain 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the december 
jobless rate was unchanged at 53 percent the same as the civilian 
rate

to residents of this city on the soviet 
border romanias new leader ion iliescu is a caring man capable of 
ending their nations quartercentury of despair 
iliescu had clashed with dictator nicolae ceausescu before his 
posting as the citys communist party chief in 197476 the job was 
one of several demotions for iliescu who emerged as leader of the 
revolution that last month toppled and executed ceausescu 
through a filter of suffering and revolution the people of iasi 
see in iliescu not only a talented economist but a man who cares 
about people and culture 
he was the only local party secretary who didnt treat 
ceausescu like a king said adi cristi a poet and member of the 
national salvation front committee that now runs the city of 
300000 people 
i think mr iliescu will restore liberty and the possibility 
to say anything you think said pavel zaharia who waited on 
iliescus table 15 years ago and now manages a hotel in the city 
there is also praise from those on the soviet side of the border 
who worked with iliescu 
mikhail s platon a deputy premier of the soviet republic of 
moldavia across the prut river was a local party official in the 
border region when iliescu was in charge in iasi 
among soviets platon said in an interview iliescu had a 
reputation as an energetic businesslike thoughtful and 
progressive person 
as a hydrologist he concentrated on land improvements in an 
area where a lack of rainfall inhibits otherwise favorable growing 
conditions platon said 
iliescu studied at moscow state university and much has been 
made of the fact that he was a student there at the same time as 
president mikhail s gorbachev it is unclear however whether he 
actually knew gorbachev 
but platon said that by temperament and conviction the 
59yearold iliescu is close to gorbachev 
by nature he is a good mixer he likes to be with the 
people he said he saw the difficulties and the hardships of 
their lives 
iliescu reached his peak under ceausescu as a member of the 
central committee and the minister of youth affairs in 196772 but 
then progressively fell into disfavor until he was named the head 
of a technical publishing house the job he held until he announced 
the arrest of ceausescu on national tv on dec 23 
it is not known whether iliescu took part in organizing the 
revolt before he appeared on television 
despite his demotion observers in bucharest say he was one of 
the few romanians who had the stature and experience to rally the 
country against the dictator 
he is president of the revolutionary council of the national 
salvation front and has pledged to guide the country toward free 
elections in april 
he has announced the reintroduction of private property 
abolished the death penalty and signed a decree establishing the 
basis of a multiparty system 
with the fall of ceausescu the romanian communist party 
virtually has ceased to exist other top officials of the national 
salvation front have said they no longer consider themselves 
communists 
iliescu showed his economic prowess with documents and numbers 
rather than ideological bluster the new iasi officials said 
the president of the local salvation front doru tigau recalled 
a speech on sugar production in which iliescu compared the 
efficiency of a local factory with that of factories in italy 
france and other countries he never appeared before people 
without documents tigau said 
another time in iasi in what was then a feat of daring iliescu 
made an official speech that lasted several hours and only 
mentioned ceausescu once tigau recalled 
he referred to him as comrade ceausescu instead of preceding 
ceausescus name with all of the former leaders titles as was 
customary at the time 
iliescus unorthodox style was evident in his approach to the 
arts as well iasis new officials said 
he protected the arts without taking political nuances into 
account tigau said 
cristi said iliescu built a library and a childrens and youth 
theater that is the only one of its kind in romania 
iasi residents said what they saw of him in the 1970s convinces 
them that iliescu should be given a chance to be elected president 
theres no other choice said marius frangiliu a 
25yearold student

the justice department said friday that it 
spent 224000 on a futile attempt to identify the source of an 
unauthorized disclosure of a preliminary criminal investigation 
involving rep william h gray iii 
the department conducted a fivemonth investigation to determine 
who leaked information that the fbi was investigating alleged 
financial irregularities in grays congressional office 
an initial cbstv story that gray was the subject of the 
preliminary investigation prompted a storm of accusations from 
democrats on capitol hill that the republicanrun justice 
department was trying to smear the pennsylvania democrat with news 
leaks 
the department quickly took the unusual step of issuing a 
statement that gray was not a target and was cooperating with fbi 
agents 
the cbs story was particularly embarrassing for attorney general 
dick thornburgh because it was aired as gray was seeking election 
as house majority whip a job he later won thornburgh ordered an 
investigation of the unauthorized leak 
the 224000 included the salaries and travel expenses of 11 fbi 
agents as well as prosecutors and support personnel runkel said 
agents took sworn statements from 109 justice department and fbi 
employees and 10 were asked to take polygraph tests the department 
said 
the investigation was conducted with money already available for 
that purpose runkel said 
during the investigation the justice department told congress 
that it had changed its longstanding policy barring prosecution of 
government officials for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive 
information 
under the new policy officials could be prosecuted for 
conversion or theft of government property by making an 
unauthorized disclosure of information about a criminal 
investigation the charge carries a maximum 10year sentence 
but thornburgh said last week in a letter to congress that there 
would be no prosecutions or disciplinary action because the 
investigation of the gray leak was unable to identify with 
certainty the original source of the disclosure

officials from both german nations announced 
a multibilliondollar project friday to renovate crumbling cities 
in east germany and provide more and better housing for people on 
both sides of the border 
also friday east germans official news agency reported that 
ousted communist leader erich honecker who faces corruption 
charges is too ill to be jailed and needs surgery to remove a 
kidney tumor 
the first beneficiaries of the joint renovation project will be 
the east german cities of meissen weimar brandenburg and 
stralsund 
those cities and many other urban areas of east germany require 
major restoration following damage during world war ii 
general neglect under a socialist system that gave priority to 
industry over living conditions and the devastating effects of the 
browncoal haze choking major cities have contributed to their 
deterioration 
west germanys construction minister gerda hasselfeldt said 
bonn will contribute 4 billion to the project in the next two 
years 
ms hasselfeldt and east germanys minister for construction and 
housing gerhard baumgaertel said the reconstruction of the four 
cities will be the pilot project for cooperation between the german 
states 
it is my hope that by pursuing all means of improving housing 
and construction in this country that our housing market can be 
eased as well ms hasselfeldt said 
east germany suffers a serious housing shortage because many 
residential buildings are unfit for habitation 
west germanys housing problem is due more to a lack of space 
and the high cost of construction 
tens of thousands of apartments in east berlin are empty because 
of last falls exodus to the west of disgruntled east germans 
if the apartments were upgraded to western standards 
arrangements could be made to rent some of the space to west 
berliners who are short at least 50000 homes in their crowded 
city of 21 million people 
ms hasselfeldt said more incentive for private ownership and 
individual responsibility was needed to ensure the joint projects 
succeed 
she said west germany was not putting any conditions on the 
financial and technical aid it will give to the renovation but said 
the projects cannot function successfully without structural 
changes in the east german economy 
the new chairman of west germanys deutsche bank visited east 
berlin on friday but no details of the talks were disclosed 
deutsche bank is expected to play an important role in turning 
around east germanys stagnant economy after 40 years of socialist 
mismanagement 
communist premier hans modrow has called for limited steps to 
attract foreign investment and encourage some private enterprise 
his plan for guiding the nation out of its economic morass is to be 
disclosed next week 
modrow became premier during the prodemocracy movement that 
resulted in honeckers ouster oct 18 
honecker 77 has been in seclusion at a former communist party 
estate since oct 18 but he must be moved from the compound by the 
end of the month as it is to be converted to a state home for the 
handicapped 
the official adn news agency said thursday that doctors had 
asked to examine him to determine if he could be imprisoned pending 
investigation of corruption charges on friday adn said honecker 
was too ill to be jailed 
another new opposition group announced its formation friday the 
prowestern party calls itself the social citizens union of germany 
and advocates reunification with west germany and transition to a 
full market economy 
most other prodemocracy groups are pressing for closer ties 
with west germany but retention of east german sovereignty 
national elections are scheduled in may

president bush stood by secretary of state 
james a baker iii on friday in a failed attempt to keep secret a 
july visit to beijing by two senior us officials 
after the trip became known last month baker acknowledged he 
may have been misleading in saying that a trip earlier that month 
to china by brent scowcroft the presidents national security 
assistant and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was 
their first mission to beijing 
baker said his intention had been to protect the president and 
his policy 
the trips for talks with chinese leaders were criticized in 
congress and elsewhere as undercutting us disapproval of chinas 
bloody crackdown of prodemocracy forces and bushs own policy of 
moderate punitive sanctions against the chinese government 
bush responding to a question at a white house news conference 
began by saying some things will be conducted in secrecy then 
told reporters 
i know you dont like it your business is to get everything 
out in the open and my business is to conduct the foreign affairs 
of this country in the way i think i was elected to 
he acknowledged that the missions to china were 
controversial and that some think the best way to make change 
for human rights in china is isolation 
bush said however that he had not chosen the path of 
excommunication of the chinese leaders 
as for the inaccurate statement by baker that the december trip 
by scowcroft and eagleburger to beijing in december had been their 
first bush said 
i dont think jim baker would ever deliberately mislead 
somebody and so i will stand stand with him 
pressed about bakers explanation that his intention had been to 
protect bush the president cut the questioner off 
ask him about it bush said i support my secretary of 
state 
asked what the visits had accomplished the president said the 
voice of america had been permitted to send a new bureau chief to 
beijing her predecessor was ousted during the june 34 crackdown 
in which hundreds of protesters were killed by chinese troops 
in defense of his overtures bush also cited a reported decision 
by china to end missile sales to middle eastern countries

baptists probably the most oppressed 
worshipers under nicolae ceausescu are professing their faith 
openly for the first time since the dictators relentless 
persecution stifled them decades ago 
numerous people from all walks of life including many army 
officers and soldiers have been coming here in the past few days 
to tell us how afraid they had been in the past to say they were 
believers the rev ilie tundrea of bucharests bethany baptist 
church said friday 
as in other countries with rigid communist regimes believers 
were considered unreliable citizens not allowed to hold leading 
positions in an officially atheist system 
no religion was encouraged but tundrea said in an interview 
it was worse for protestants because the authorities could not 
tolerate our evangelical activity 
ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 and the first large baptist 
gathering was held dec 31 in oradea northwestern romania about 
10000 worshipers packed a sports arena with the approval of the 
new authorities 
for the first time since the communist takeover in 1947 state 
radio and tv broadcast a live christmas service from the patriarhie 
cathedral in bucharest 
in recent annual us state department reports on human rights 
the ceausescu regime ranked among the worst offenders it was 
accused of running a police state with no freedom of expression 
and religious tolerance only for such recognized faiths as the 
romanian orthodox or jews 
baptist pastors were denied permission to preach and arrested 
for distributing bibles the communists never recognized the roman 
catholic church because the catholic bishops refused to recognize 
the supremacy of the state 
about 80 percent of romanias 23 million people are believed to 
be nominal followers of the orthodox faith and 6 percent are roman 
catholics 
romania has about 300000 baptists up from 60000 two decades 
ago most of the baptists pentecostals seventhday adventists and 
other protestants are in the western transylvania region and in 
bucharest 
under ceausescu who ruled romania for 24 years the baptist 
church was given special attention because its rapid growth was 
seen as a threat 
the romanian orthodox church was treated more leniently because 
it generally limited itself to such traditional ceremonies as mass 
marriages and funerals 
securitate officers were present at every single service to 
record what was being preached and we were forbidden from 
baptizing tundrea said referring to the ceausescus secret 
police 
he said police cars always were parked outside the church and 
the telephones of leading baptists were tapped 
believers who refused to become informers were harassed at work 
and many were jailed for years after they were accused of being 
servants of western capitalism the pastor said 
official reaction to construction of a church in comanesti 135 
miles north of bucharest illustrated the hardships baptists faced 
under ceausescu 
the building was torn down in 1989 after authorities accused 
local church leaders of stealing construction materials and other 
socialist property and four were imprisoned they were released 
after the revolution 
lack of bibles and other christian books forbidden in romania 
was partially overcome through the efforts of missionaries from 
western europe and the united states who imported the books in 
special hidden compartments in their vans tundrea said 
pastors often were summoned for interrogation by the security 
police and were even forbidden to preach from specific sections of 
the bible 
they could not mention the book of revelations because it 
speaks of the second coming of christ this ceausescu did not 
accept tundrea said while helping unload a dutch truck bringing 
food aid for distribution by his church 
in 1977 a group of pastors wrote a letter to ceausescu 
complaining about persecution in the country tundrea said 
after that every one of us was interrogated each day for six 
weeks he said in a whisper then laughed and said aloud you 
see i am still living in the era before the revolution 
for us the revolution was a miracle we can now be free to 
participate in a christian revival in romania the pastor 
said 
i believe we will have opportunity to print bibles and 
magazines establish new contacts and organize evangelical 
activities because people feel such a big hunger for them now

a judge is not required to warn a 
defendant that he could be making a mistake by serving as his own 
lawyer maines highest court has ruled 
the ruling by the maine supreme judicial court came in the 
appeal of a former policeman with a strongly held dislike for 
attorneys who was convicted of having sex with a child 
former state trooper richard morrison was charged with having 
sex with a 13yearold baby sitter in 1985 he defended himself at 
trial lost the case then hired a lawyer and appealed his 
conviction on grounds that he had inadequate legal representation 
johnson was in jail after surrendering following thursdays 42 
ruling he was sentenced to 10 years 
a popular saying among lawyers is that a person who acts as his 
own attorney has a fool for a client the gist of morrisons 
appeal was that the judge should have warned him how foolish he was 
his lawyer peter b bickerman said he would meet with morrison 
before determining whether to appeal the maine ruling to the us 
supreme court 
its generally believed that the judge should give some kind 
of warning to defendants who act as their own lawyer bickerman 
said but bickerman said guidelines for such warnings have never 
been firmly laid out 
the court majority said morrison had no right to a new trial 
because before his trial he had been warned by family friends 
and even the prosecutor that he should get an attorney morrisons 
wife contacted a lawyer only to have morrison become angry with 
her and refuse the lawyers help said the majority opinion 
written by chief justice vincent l mckusick 
morrison had a strongly held dislike for attorneys and 
despite repeated warnings he never budged from his early decision 
to conduct his own defense at trial mckusick wrote 
the justices said they were refusing to create a rule that would 
throw out convictions of people who represent themselves if the 
trial court failed to give the defendant mirandalike warnings of 
the risks of selfrepresentation and the benefits of counsel on the 
record 
miranda is the landmark us supreme court ruling that requires 
police to read suspects their rights 
the two dissenting justices said morrison should have received 
more than warnings from his wife and fellow troopers 
they noted that the trial judge informed morrison of his 
constitutional right to a lawyer and determined morrison was able 
to afford a lawyer but he did not warn morrison about the dangers 
of selfrepresentation 
the dissenting opinion also quoted from a california case in 
which the us supreme court held that defendants who represent 
themselves should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages 
of selfrepresentation so that the record will establish that he 
knows what he is doing and his choice is made with his eyes open 
morrison was convicted of rape gross sexual misconduct 
unlawful sexual contact and assault thursdays ruling dismissed 
the conviction on the unlawful sexual contact count saying the 
prosecution had inadequate evidence on that charge that did not 
change morrisons 10year prison sentence bickerman said

president of the king center it would be much better if people 
stayed away 
mrs king said she and the center believe in the first 
amendment privileges of all people but we certainly dont agree 
with the philosophy of the klan 
the southern white knights of the kkk plan a morning 
demonstration at the state capitol and an afternoon rally in 
forsyth county the virtually allwhite county north of atlanta

counterdemonstrators to gather in opposition to the klan police 
plan to keep the groups apart and the national guard is on standby 
mrs king told reporters that king week events will go on

kings old church ebenezer baptist and a parade down peachtree

civil rights leaders crypt 
the precautions one should take we always try to take 
them said mrs king adding that she was reluctant to draw 
further attention to those responsible for the bombings 
to talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind 
of violence she said

president bush hailed the heroic 
performance friday of american women who fought in the us 
invasion of panama but said he will reserve judgment on the role 
of females in combat pending pentagon review 
the involvement of approximately 600 women of the nearly 26000 
american troops who took part in the us invasion has renewed the 
debate over women in combat 
army regulations prohibit women from serving in combat and us 
law bars women from combat in the navy and air force 
questioned about the participation of women in the invasion 
bush said their original assignments were noncombat but any 
time you have a highly trained gungho volunteer force and theyre 
caught up in some of the firefights that went on a person can be 
put into a combat situation 
during the invasion army capt linda l bray led male and 
female troops from a military police platoon into combat with 
approximately 40 members of the panamanian defense forces hiding in 
a dog kennel 
three members of the panamanian defense forces were killed 
i would let the heroic performance of these people be weighed 
and measured and then see if the defense department wanted to 
recommend to the president any additional changes bush told 
reporters at a news briefing 
earlier in the day the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said congress will probably take a step 
forward on the role of women in combat in light of their stepped 
up role in panama 
but the senator john warner of virginia said he does not 
foresee full equality for female soldiers 
there are still certain areas where we cannot colocate men 
and women in close confinement warner said in a telephone 
interview with reporters 
the former navy secretary joined by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee traveled to panama 
this past week to review the military operations in the wake of the 
dec 20 invasion that unseated manuel antonio noriega 
warner said he met with a number of the women involved in the 
panamanian invasion and they performed with extraordinary 
professional skills 
we will reexamine in congress based on their experiences and 
determine if we have the right policy said warner who cautioned 
against rushing toward any change 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee said this past week that she is drafting 
legislation that would allow women to serve in army combat as part 
of a fouryear test program 
warner in his telephone interivew from san jose costa rica 
said well probably take a step forward based on the events in 
panama but it will not result in full equality 
warner who plans to travel to el salvador and guatemala and is 
awaiting approval of a visa to nicaragua said the initial 
opposition among the central american nations to the us military 
intervention in panama has subsided 
the mood is beginning to shift as they realize that the 
military part was near perfection warner said

president bush said friday he will dispatch 
vice president dan quayle on a fencemending trip throughout latin 
america in an effort to counter negative reaction to the us 
military invasion of panama 
to some degree i am concerned about that reaction bush 
told a white house news conference because i am well aware of 
how our friends south of our border including my friend president 
carlos salinas of mexico look at the use of american force 
anywhere so i am concerned about it 
quayles agenda and the timing of the trip were still being 
decided said his press secretary david beckwith the only country 
that was definitely on his schedule was honduras where he already 
had planned to attend the jan 27 presidential inauguration at 
least seven latin heads of state are expected to attend and quayle 
could lay the groundwork for the rest of his visits in meetings 
with them 
bush indicated he recognizes latin sensitivity to what 
historically has been seen as a heavyhanded us policy toward 
central and south america including military interventions in 
years past toppling of leaders and installation of governments 
friendly to the united states 
i view this as very very important diplomacy the president 
said of quayles trip 
none of the latin countries voiced support for his dec 20 
invasion of panama and many of them strongly condemned it peru 
went so far as to withdraw in protest from the upcoming drug summit 
with bush in colombia it later reversed course and said it would 
send a representative 
the organization of american states overwhelming passed a 
resolution deploring the invasion with only five absentions from 
countries who wanted a condemnation of noriega as well to be 
included in the resolution 
bush insisted however that the negative feeling that has 
resulted from the invasion is something thats correctable 
because i think they know that i have tried a lot of consultion 
that we have exhausted the remedies in this particular case of 
multilateral diplomacy 
but given the history of the use of us force i would be 
remiss if i didnt face up to the problem that we must go forward 
diplomatically now to explain how this president looks at the 
protection of american life that we acted in our view well within 
our rights but that we will continue consultation 
he said quayle will be in a position to explain very clearly 
not only us policy but our aspirations for panama and indeed 
for this entire hemisphere 
he said the latin nations must understand the invasion was 
motivated by the protection of american life 
asked if he was reverting to old us policies that have upset 
the latin countries for years bush said that quayles trip takes 
on enormous importance to convince the people of the truth 
we are not reverting to just a willful use of force that 
has no rationale he said but when it comes to the protection 
of american life please our friends south of the border 
understand that this president is going to protect it 
bush noted that the us military intervention that drove 
noriega from power was wellreceived by many of the panamanian 
people themselves 
it has been overwhelming he said of the panamanian response 
although no timetable has been set for quayles trip it will 
force postponement of a feb 411 european journey the vice 
president had been planning he was to have visited several 
countries to consult with us allies

president bush said friday he is considering 
housing programs business development and bank loans to help 
panamas shattered economy recover from the us invasion and years 
of economic sanctions 
bush was not more specific on what the united states might do to 
help panama recover from invasionrelated damage estimated at 
perhaps 2 billion and from two years of economic decline that 
flowed partly from the us sanctions against manuel antonio 
noriega 
nor did bush address where his administration will find money to 
help panama in a foreign aid budget already strained past its 
limits foreign assistance is among the least popular programs on 
capitol hill where the president would have to secure approval for 
aid to panama 
it was learned separately that bush administration officials are 
looking into possible aid that includes 
building houses for people left homeless by the bombing and 
combat 
helping panama to pay its 543 million in foreign debt so it 
can get new loans 
getting other nations involved in the recovery effort 
loans to help businesses recover 
while recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to 
bush one administration source said theres a sense of urgency 
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly 
one official who like the others requested anonymity said it 
also is likely the administration will move up from march the date 
on which officials must certify whether panama is cooperating in 
antidrug efforts 
by speeding up the evaluation the administration could enable 
panama to receive us trade benefits and caribbean basin 
initiative benefits and have its sugar quota reinstated that 
official said 
the embryonic usinstalled government of president guillermo 
endara has expressed strong antidrug sentiments and would be 
expected to win certification said the official such 
certification was denied to panama under noriega now in us 
custody on a variety of drug charges 
the revitalization of the panamanian economy is a major 
priority in the months ahead bush told a white house news 
conference as are our efforts for humanitarian assistance 
i can report today that considerable progress has been made so 
far in returning panama to a normal state of affairs the new 
government has taken charge and president endara is working 
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people 
bush said the team led by deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger that visited panama this week had praised the endara 
government 
they are discussing housing programs business development 
bank loans that will help spur economic growth we are committed to 
be a part of that process bush said 
the president noted that he already has released nearly 400 
million in assets in us banks that was frozen under the sanctions 
against the noriega regime 
us officials involved in the discussions with panama said 
endara did not present a laundry list of economic requests but 
rather talked about general needs 
the endara government has to sort out its priorities said 
one official who also requested anonymity 
just how much money the administration might find to help panama 
is an unanswered question bushs press secretary marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged this week that the current 1991 budget to 
be sent to congress on jan 29 includes no money to help panama 
the endara government indicated to the eagleburger team that it 
recognizes that private businesses in panama will play a major role 
in restoring the economy and does not expect the us governement 
to do everything said one source 
it is expected the administration will turn to friends around 
the world to help panama in particular officials have mentioned 
japan 
japanese ambassador ryohei murata discussed the matter friday 
with vice president dan quayle 
afterward quayles press secretary david beckwith said he 
could not disclose the substance of the discussion other than to 
say the vice president complimented japan for considering 
extending aid 
japan retained its ties with the noriega government despite us 
urgings that the tokyo government help isolate the dictator japan 
has had substantial economic interests in panama

the man who summoned police with his car phone and 
said a black robber had abducted and shot him and his pregnant wife 
was only a routine suspect in the case until his own brother gave 
police evidence of an elaborate grisly hoax officials said friday 
charles stuart killed himself thursday after learning his 
brother had revealed evidence against him in the oct 23 killing of 
his wife carol 
stuart had been seriously wounded himself while hospitalized he 
wrote a moving letter to be read at his wifes funeral then he 
made a dramatic appearance at the deathbed of his newborn son who 
was delivered by caesarean section after the shootings and died 17 
days later and he gave a description of a black man as the killer 
he thought he had the perfect crime the eulogy at the 
church that he had a friend read this guy went way out he 
really thought he had a perfect crime said reading police chief 
edward marchand 
paul leary first assistant suffolk county district attorney 
said although there were some apparent discrepancies in stuarts 
account investigators felt they were not significant enough to 
pursue he would not elaborate citing a grand jury investigation 
but leary said stuart was a routine suspect from the beginning 
because investigators always check out husbands when wives are 
killed 
no one was ruled out leary said i am told 
investigators checked out that which was at the crime scene and 
also went back into the personal lives of these individuals and 
found that they were something just short of a storybooktype 
couple according to relatives on both sides of the family 
john dawley who had served as stuarts lawyer said that until 
this weeks developments in the case he had no reason to believe 
this was anything but a random act of violence 
the guy was a remarkable guy and i dont say that lightly i 
say that in light of everything i know i would never have expected 
it in a million years 
jack levin a professor at northeastern university and expert on 
crime said if stuart was his wifes killer the crime was so 
premeditated and elaborate it could only be the work of a sociopath 
the last people you expect were talking about the cream of 
the crop in killing 
the scales tipped when stuarts brother matthew 23 went to 
police wednesday 
the younger stuart told police his brother asked him to meet him 
the evening of oct 23 in the citys mission hill area which is 
where the shooting took place said matthews attorney john 
perenyi 
the stuarts had been at a hospital for birthing classes stuart 
told police a gunman forced them to drive to the mission hill area 
and robbed and shot them when police found them mrs stuart was 
near death in the passengers seat 
perenyi said stuart drove up to the meeting place that evening 
tossed a sack to matthew who was sitting in his car and told his 
younger brother to take it home to revere where matthew lives with 
their parents 
stuart suggested to his brother that the bag might have to be 
disposed of according to the attorney inside the sack matthew 
found a pistol mrs stuarts supposedly stolen pocketbook and 
engagement ring perenyi said matthew took out the ring and 
disposed of the rest of the items in the pines river in revere his 
lawyer said 
after police heard the account from matthew police divers found 
the pocketbook thursday but not the gun matthew gave the 
engagement ring to investigators wednesday night 
it was dark the night of the shooting but perenyi said matthew 
told him he saw something in his brothers car that on reflection 
might have been mrs stuart perenyi said the shootings apparently 
had taken place by that time 
stuart committed suicide thursday by jumping off a bridge 
perenyi said the district attorneys office told him matthew was 
not a suspect in the case investigators refused to comment whether 
there were any other suspects besides charles stuart 
perenyi said matthew could not offer a motive 
a black man with a long criminal record william bennett was 
named in published reports as a suspect although thursdays 
developments cleared him of suspicion in the stuart shootings he 
remained in jail friday on unrelated charges

a federal appeals court friday threw out a 
400000 verdict against a cigarette maker in the death of a smoker 
but gave her family a chance for a new trial on another aspect of 
their case against three tobacco companies 
the damage judgment had been the first in the nation in a 
smokerdeath case rose cipollone of little ferry nj died of 
lung cancer at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 42 years 
in its complex ruling the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
affirmed a us district court ruling that dismissed claims of mrs 
cipollones family that the cigarette companies failed to warn of 
the risks of tobacco smoking after 1965 when a federal labeling 
requirement took effect 
in addition the court reversed a jurys award of 400000 
against liggett group inc to mrs cipollones husband antonio 
cipollone of lakehurst nj on grounds the company had violated 
an express warranty or advertising promise that its products were 
safe 
but the family did win the right to a new trial against the 
three on one aspect of the case 
the court in an opinion written by judge edward r becker said 
cipollone has live claims against liggett and the other two 
companies lorillard inc and philip morris inc on grounds they 
marketed the product knowing the risks of cigarette smoking 
that riskutility theory of liability involves whether the 
average user can easily recognize the risks of using it the 
district court had barred cipollones claim of riskutility 
against all three 
in addition the circuit court ruled cipollone could make 
additional claims against liggett that had been denied in lower 
court 
cipollone had won in district court on his contention that the 
tobacco companies promised through advertising that their products 
were safe which resulted in the 400000 award 
the appeals court said the district court erred on that point 
by preventing liggett from trying to prove that mrs cipollone 
didnt believe the companies advertisements in the first place 
however the court said cipollone could pursue other points that 
had been denied in district court 
plaintiffs attorneys are back to square one after having 
spent nearly six years and nearly 3 million in lawyer and legal 
fees said josiah murray liggetts general counsel 
murray said he was extremely gratified by the portion of the 
decision that reversed the 400000 award

after a threemonth correspondence in which the archbishop wrote 
that grieses conduct often led to embarrassment for the church 
and asked the priest to resign 
the newspaper reported that pilarczyk ordered griese to accept 
retirement saying the decision was based on the priests public 
challenge of my rightful authority as diocesan bishop and 
grieses refusal to follow instructions on maintaining a dress code 
griese criticized the archbishop from the pulpit during mass in 
september after after pilarczyk instructed him to ease enforcement 
of a church dress code banning shorts miniskirts sun dresses and 
jeans griese had twice denied communion to worshiper james garvey 
when he came to church dressed in shorts 
it is people like him across this world that drive catholics 
away from the catholic church garvey said at the time my 
faith was taken away from me by not giving me communion for two 
sundays in a row for wearing shorts that tells me hes judging 
me based on what i wear 
griese will remain a priest in good standing pilarczyk said in 
a letter quoted by the enquirer the churchs mandatory retirement 
age is 75 
three months ago i concluded that you could no longer fulfill 
effectively your office of pastor pilarczyk said in the letter 
since then i have several times encouraged you to resign from 
office or to offer concrete evidence that i should not proceed with 
removal you have responded in the negative to both requests 
however in statement from griese released through a 
spokeswoman the priest accused the media of character 
assassination 
a spokesman for griese said he plans an appeal to the vatican 
which is a priests right under the churchs canon law

president bush said friday he is not seeking 
a deal on a reduced charge for manuel antonio noriega and vowed 
to bend over backwards to avoid saying anything that would 
interfere with the deposed panamanian rulers trial 
our case is strong our resolve is firm and our legal 
representations are sound bush told a nationally televised news 
conference after discussing noriegas prosecution on 
drugtrafficking charges with attorney general dick thornburgh 
bush also announced he is dispatching vice president dan quayle 
on a fencemending tour of latin america within the next several 
days to explain the us military action and muster support for 
the new panamanian government of guillermo endara 
conceding the dec 20 us invasion of panama had upset us 
allies in central and south america the president said i am 
concerned because i am well aware of how our friends south of our 
border look at the use of american force anywhere 
but he added i think its something thats correctable 
bush said he had no immediate plans to visit panama 
however an administration official who declined to be identified 
said a presidential visit is under consideration and that panama 
might also be included on quayles itinerary 
the president called revitalizing panamas economy a major 
priority to help it recover from the us military invasion and 
economic sanctions he did not put a price tag on the us aid but 
some estimates for the damage have run as high as 2 billion 
even as he savored noriegas capture bush said he would be 
ever mindful of the legal process from now on suggesting he 
would refrain from his previous characterizations of noriega as a 
thug and criminal 
he is now in custody time for rhetoric is over he said 
bush said he was convinced noriega would get a fair trial and 
i am going to bend over backwards and not answer hypothetical 
questions or not do anything that might prejudice that 
with noriega securely in us custody in florida bush said he 
hoped to bring us combat troops home from panama as soon as 
possible but he declined to give a timetable 
still he ruled out a longterm peacekeeping role for us 
troops id like to see their police forces whatever emerges 
reconstituted bush said noriegas panamanian defense forces 
were decimated in the us military action 
bush said the some 12000 troops stationed at us bases in 
panama before the invasion would be left there but would not serve 
a police role 
some 2900 combat troops were brought home this week leaving 
about 24500 military personnel according to the pentagon 
in an opening statement at his news conference bush said our 
government is not seeking a deal with noriega our policy remains 
that we have brought him to this country for prosecution 
we are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the 
protections guaranteed by the us constitution and laws bush 
added 
asked if he would rule out a plea bargain with noriega perhaps 
offering reduced charges to noriega in exchange for his information 
on drugtrafficking bush said im not ruling it in 
he added im just saying hes got his rights and he ought 
we ought not to stand up here and try to define narrowly what they 
are 
in miami noriega attorney steven kollin said noriega wasnt 
interested in a plea bargain a man who is innocent is not 
receptive to any plea bargain general noriega is not guilty of any 
of these charges 
noriega refused to answer the charges against him at a brief 
hearing wednesday and the federal judge in his case entered an 
innocent plea on his behalf the general remained in custody at an 
undisclosed location thursday 
bush dismissed as ridiculous a question on whether the 
invasion of panama and surrender of noriega had become a 
political jackpot for him a presidents called on to take 
certain actions were not going in to try to furbish a political 
image he said 
even so bush was asked if the action would silence senate 
majority leader george mitchells criticism that bush had a timid 
foreign policy knowing george hell find a way and thats his 
job look were going into an election year 
an aide to the maine democrat diane dewhirst said sen 
mitchell has consistently said that when he agrees with bush on 
foreign policy he will be vigorously supportive and that when he 
disagrees he will offer constructive alternatives that has not 
changed 
bush took the unusual step of ending his news conference with a 
complaint to television networks about coverage of his last news 
conference on dec 21 he protested that some networks juxtaposed 
his lighthearted banter with reporters with pictures of bodies of 
us servicemen killed in panama being unloaded from a transport 
plane 
i could understand why the viewers were concerned about 
this bush said they thought that their president at a solemn 
moment like that didnt give a damn 
his voice choking bush said and i do i do i feel it so 
strongly 
in other comments the president 
said he did not envision a change in us policy against 
intentionally sending military women into combat although he would 
weigh such a recommendation if presented to him by the pentagon he 
praised the heroic performance of a highly trained gungho 
group of women who did engage in combat in the panama action 
deplored the death of an american nun in nicaragua but 
refused to fix blame on the usbacked contra rebels he noted 
that the contras had denied a role but he added it is 
extraordinarily murky 
defended anew two secret missions to china by national 
security adviser brent scowcroft saying there has been 
progress toward reform as a result of the visits

east germany on friday lifted a ban on 
singing in public of the original version of its national hymn 
germany united fatherland declaring the anthem written in 1949 
to be part of its cultural heritage 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer said the hymn would once 
again be sung on official radio and television broadcasts 
the hymn was banned by the communist government 20 years ago 
because it implied support for reunification of germany a theme 
long resisted by the east german government 
meyer dismissed concerns that restoration of the hymn could be 
seen as encouragement of rightist elements or support for a formal 
union with west germany 
he said officials decided the song should again be sung because 
it was a part of east germanys cultural identity 
singing the song again means dealing with our own history and 
acknowledgement of the time of those historical conditions and 
thoughts that inspired the hymn meyer said 
germany united fatherland was written by east germanys 
first culture minister johannes r becher 
east germany dropped the national hymn from public gatherings in 
1969 because of its inferences to reunifying east and west germany 
resurrected and facing the future out of ruins let us serve 
you well germany united fatherland the hymn runs in part old 
wants compel us and united we compel it because we must succeed 
so that the sun shines more beautiful than ever before over 
germany

the united states is prepared to provide up to 
3 million to an international commission to begin planning the 
voluntary relocation of nicaraguan contras to their homeland if 
democratic conditions exist it was announced friday 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the funds 
would be given to a commission comprised of united nations and 
organization of american states officials the commission known by 
its spanish initials ciav was set up partly to oversee the 
dismantling of the contras most of whom are based in honduras 
we have explained our intentions to the government of honduras 
and the nicaraguan resistance boucher said both have reacted 
favorably the un and oas secretaries general have also been 
informed 
the commission boucher said will be asked to submit proposals 
for use of the funds 
the disclosure was part of what appears to be an increase in 
diplomatic activity concerning the fate of the rebels as nicaraguan 
elections draw closer the feb 25 election in nicaragua will match 
president daniel ortega against an opposition coalition led by 
presidential candidate violeta chamorro 
sources close to the sandinista government said nicaraguan 
officials would meet saturday with contra representatives in 
tegucigalpa ciav officials also will attend 
amnesty for rebels willing to return in peace to nicaragua will 
be discussed sources said 
in addition state department officials are expected to confer 
with ciav officials at an undetermined location next week on the 
peace process 
most of the contras are at camps in southern honduras the five 
central american presidents have called for the demobilization of 
the contras but the rebels with us support have said they 
should remain intact until after next months elections 
bouchers announcement of a conditional us commitment to fund 
the demobilization of the contras was in response to a communique 
approved by the five central american presidents last month 
according to some interpretations the communique required the 
immediate transfer of all us aid funds for the contras to the 
ciav however the state department disputes that interpretation 
and says it has gone beyond the requirements of the communique 
us aid to the rebels consists of food clothing shelter and 
medical services and is due to run out at the end of february 
the sandinistas have given high priority to promoting the 
dismantling of the contras but the rebels have insisted that must 
be voluntary and in the context of a free and fair electoral 
process in nicaragua 
the biggest setback occurred in early november when the 
sandinistas contending that the rebels engaged in terrorist 
activities suspended a ceasefire that had been in effect 
informally with the contras for the preceding 19 months 
nine days of talks between the sandinistas and the contras aimed 
at restoring the ceasefire ended in failure nov 21

president bush said friday that former 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson registered his 
disagreement with the us military invasion of panama in a 
telephone call to the presidents wife barbara 
asked at a news conference if the dec 20 invasion was a 
political jackpot bush said well jesse jackson doesnt 
think so he talked to my wife and so theres differences of 
opinion on that 
he did not elaborate on jacksons call presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said jackson called mrs bush on 
thursday to inquire about her health he also raised the issue of 
panama i guess he said the same things hes been saying in the 
press the spokesman added 
mrs bushs press secretary anna perez confirmed that jackson 
called to talk about mrs bushs health the subject of recent news 
accounts because she is undergoing radiation treatment for a 
persistent eye ailment 
but perez declined to give further details of the call it was 
a private conversation she said 
asked if jackson and mrs bush conversed often she said i 
dont think theyre phone pals 
jackson has said the invasion caused a loss of the us moral 
authority 
he said in comments published in the los angeles times that the 
action dealt a setback to the war on drugs jeopardized the 
upcoming drug summit in colombia undermined the global movement 
toward peaceful democratic change and respect for the rule of law 
and revived a long history of imperial interference in central 
america 
one wonders if we have damaged our national soul to feed our 
national ego he wrote in a world rapidly turning away from 
military solutions the american action looks morally untenable and 
obsolete

one of the thorniest issues facing manuel noriegas 
prosecutors is graymail the threat that his trial might 
expose embarrassing details about the ousted panamanian leaders 
longtime connections with us intelligence agencies 
the former chief assistant us attorney who forged the february 
1988 drugtrafficking indictment against noriega said friday that 
during his investigation he was thwarted in his efforts to see cia 
material bearing on the case 
i went to look at what they had but it was worthless it 
couldnt be all there was said richard gregorie now in private 
practice here 
viewing any tapes photos or documents bearing on the case is 
essential for prosecutors he said 
it could be exculpatory if noriega had ever told anybody about 
narcotics activity which he could use to say he was acting as an 
agent in his dealings with colombias medellin cocaine cartel 
said gregorie 
noriega defense attorney steven kollin has said he will seek 
noriegas cia files 
were looking for the truth and the only way to get to the 
truth is to get to those documents kollin said friday 
there is ample evidence that noriega had some relationship with 
the cia and other us agencies but the exact extent is disputed 
or still secret 
in august 1988 the white house halted a general accounting 
office probe into those connections refusing to turn over material 
requested because it was beyond the congressional agencys 
authority and dealt with sensitive intelligence material 
according to presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the cia used noriega as an asset from the 1970s on 
according to congressional testimony with some witnesses saying he 
eventually was paid as much as 200000 a year for information when 
he became head of his nations intelligence service and then 
commander of the armed forces in 1983 
that period included george bushs term as cia director in the 
mid1970s under president ford bush has since said that although 
there were reports of noriegas drug dealing at that time he had 
no proof then 
one of the principal witnesses cited in the indictment was jose 
blandon a former top member of panamas intelligence apparatus who 
fell out with noriega and fled to the united states 
his grand jury testimony is secret but blandon told a senate 
subcommittee just after the indictment that noriega had met twice 
with thennational security council representative lt col oliver 
north in 1985 to find ways around the congressional ban on aid to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
blandon also told senators that bush then vice president 
called noriega before the 1983 invasion of grenada to ask him to 
intercede with cuban president fidel castro blandon said bush 
wanted castro to tell his troops on the caribbean island not to 
fire on us forces 
bush at the time of the hearing called blandons account a 
total fabrication 
blandon also said the cia sent noriega files on the private 
lives of us senators with an interest in panama 
the cia issued a statement saying it categorically denied 
blandons assertion but blandon stuck by his testimony 
noriega often traveled to washington to meet with thencia 
director william casey to discuss the contras and other issues 
according to testimony 
noriegas cozy relationship with the united states began to sour 
in 1985 when he was linked to the brutal slaying of his foe hugo 
spadafora and the firing of the nations president 
adm john poindexter then national security adviser to reagan 
went to panama in december 1985 to demand noriegas resignation 
according to the miami herald noriega immediately flew to 
washington to meet with casey who told the administration that 
noriega was too valuable an intelligence source to lose 
last week the justice department acknowledged that in its 
haste to indict noriega guidelines in the handling of cia material 
may not have been completely followed according to spokesman 
david runkel 
but both bush and attorney general dick thornburgh continue to 
insist that there are no smoking guns that would embarrass the 
president or the cia or cause the case to unravel in court

attorney general dick thornburgh has urged 
us attorneys around the country to choose experienced prosecutors 
to fill vacancies on the organized crime strike forces being 
transferred to their offices a spokesman said friday 
the strike forces which operated for 22 years as field offices 
of the justice department have lost 33 attorneys nearly a quarter 
of their force since thornburgh announced plans in february to put 
them under the control of us attorneys 
some who have left said more experienced mob prosecutors are 
likely to depart now that a year of controversy and objections from 
congress have failed to block the merger 
departing strike force attorneys and former justice officials 
said the merger was unattractive to many mob prosecutors because 
the us attorneys appointed by the president tend to concentrate 
on shorterterm cases with quick impact and publicity rather than 
the complex longterm investigations used during the last two 
decades to imprison the mob leadership in more than 11 eleven major 
cities 
thornburgh imposed the change which he has sought since he was 
us attorney in pittsburgh 15 years ago on new years day 
justice spokesman dave runkel said thornburgh spoke at an 
allday meeting in a suburban motel with the strike force chiefs 
affected us attorneys and members of the criminal divisions 
organized crime and racketeering section 
the meeting thursday was closed to the public 
the attorney general stressed the need for the us attorneys 
to put experienced prosecutors in vacant spots on the strike forces 
prosecutors who previously worked on sensitive and complex 
cases runkel said and the us attorneys reported that that 
is exactly what they are doing where there are vacancies 
some 115 strike force positions are being turned into assistant 
us attorney posts committed to working on organized crime 
another 20 attorneys are being recruited to join a squad in 
washington available to handle emergency assignments around the 
country 
runkel said that of the 135 slots 116 are filled and five more 
attorneys are in the process of being hired 
runkel said thursdays meeting went well 
everybodys committed to making this system work he said 
there may be some who felt there wasnt a need for this change 
now but all recognize that the change has occurred 
he said thornburgh and other top officials who addressed the 
planning session stressed that they want organized crime 
investigations carried out as vigorously in the future as in the 
past 
thornburgh has said the move was needed to end turf battles 
between strike force chiefs and us attorneys and to address to 
forms of organized crime such as colombian drug lords and street 
gangs 
the only hot point came when i spoke and gave them advice on 
how to handle the press runkel said declining to elaborate 
the strike forces operated in 14 headquarters cities and 11 
suboffice cities they are being merged with 23 us attorney 
offices that cover the same areas

the government on friday approved a type of 
food poisoning bacteria for use as a treatment for crosseye and 
another eye disorder that renders its victims legally blind 
the food and drug administration said a sterile purified 
botulism toxin was approved as an injection therapy to treat 
strabismus or crosseye and blepharospasm a muscle disorder that 
makes the eyes close involuntarily 
this is seen as the first successful treatment for both 
conditions said eva kemper an fda spokeswoman 
when eaten in improperly handled food the toxin can cause 
botulism or food poisoning an ailment that can lead to paralysis 
or death 
however in clinical studies the injected form was used 
safely in thousands of men and women to weaken muscles that pulled 
an eye in or out or to reduce spasms in muscles that pull the 
eyelid closed the agency said in a written statement 
with the blepharospasm patients are legally blind because 
they cant hold their eyelids open said kemper 
strabismus can be the commonly known crosseye in which the 
eyes look inward at each other or walleye in which they look out 
doctors would inject the drug botulinum toxin type a into 
muscles near the eye not the eye itself to aid in turning off 
the muscle the fda said 
the injection would take effect in a day or two and would last 
for about three months according to the agency 
fda approval requires product labeling that indicates it is not 
recommended for use for children under 12 and an advisory to 
physicians that sedentary patients treated with the drug resume 
activity slowly 
at least two patients who had been incapacitated and sedentary 
because of their previous condition apparently overexerted too 
quickly and died of cardiac collapse the agency said 
the most common side effects are that some patients eyelids 
may droop or their eyes may feel irritated it said 
the product which will be sold as oculinum will be available 
in approximately 30 days once the fdamandated label changes have 
been completed according to carolyn henderson spokeswoman for the 
californiabased distributor allergan pharmaceuticals division of 
allergan inc 
there are about 100000 new cases of strabismus diagnosed each 
year but most of those cases can be treated with more traditional 
therapies like eyeglasses surgery on the muscles or exercises the 
fda said 
however the agency said about 15000 severe cases dont respond 
to those therapies and they would likely be aided by the new drug 
blepharospasm affects between 3000 and 5000 americans who are 
rendered legally blind by the condition

states rights and the intent of congress in 
outlawing age discrimination were the focus of oral arguments 
friday in vermonts appeal of a ruling that bars the state from 
forcing a 71yearold judge to retire 
vermont supreme court justice louis peck is challenging a 
provision in his states constitution that requires judges to 
retire at age 70 
william gray the attorney for the state urged three judges of 
the us 2nd circuit court of appeals to overturn a lower court 
ruling that struck down the mandatory retirement rule 
gray said the ruling upset the balance of power between state 
and federal governments by taking away vermonts right to make 
decisions about its judiciary 
the states of massachusetts connecticut and new mexico have 
filed briefs backing vermont massachusetts and connecticut have 
mandatory retirement provisions for judges new mexico does not 
but filed the brief through the lincoln legal foundation on the 
issue of states rights 
peck who continues to sit on vermonts highest court filed an 
age discrimination complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission in may five months after he turned 70 his 
retirement had been scheduled to go into effect june 30 
the eeoc picked up pecks case and filed a complaint in federal 
court in vermont where us district judge lee gagliardi ruled 
that peck and other appointed state judges in vermont could not be 
forced to retire because of their age 
gagliardi said state judges were protected by the federal age 
discrimination and employment act which prohibits age 
discrimination against most employees 
gray argued that that act could not be applied in this case 
because it did not specifically name state judges he said there 
had to be a clear congressional intent to preempt a state 
constitution 
that argument found favor with the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals in boston in an earlier ruling on massachusetts mandatory 
retirement provision the 1st circuit ruled it could not find a 
sufficiently clear statement by congress that it intended to 
overrule the clear intent of the people of a state in an area 
intimately and fundamentally related to that states 
selfgovernance 
the 1st circuit ruling has meant judges in massachusetts must 
retire at age 70 
eeoc attorney paul bogas cited a similar case in wyoming in 
which the supreme court found that the states interests were not 
seriously threatened by the federal age discrimination law 
bogas spent most of his arguments countering another position 
forwarded by gray that state judges were covered by an exemption 
to the age discrimination and employment act for elected officials 
and policymaking appointees who work for elected officials 
the constitutional and legal duties of state judges are 
completely independent from the governor who appoints them bogas 
said he said judges clearly were not policy makers 
the appeals court will issue a written ruling at a later date 
peck was not in court for the arguments but two other judges who 
are fighting similar battles were present they were robert satter 
a senior superior court judge from connecticut and justice isaac 
rubin of the appellate division of new yorks supreme court

a county prosecutor resigned and checked 
into a psychiatric hospital friday after state police determined he 
had fabricated a story that two men tried to assassinate him on new 
years day 
camden county prosecutor samuel asbell who routinely 
accompanied police on drug busts may face criminal charges pending 
the outcome of the investigation and a psychiatric evaluation 
attorney general peter n perretti said 
asbell said tuesday that gunmen opened fire on him during a 
highspeed car chase through the streets of camden and that he was 
sprayed with glass from his car windows but not seriously injured 
he also said he shot one of his assailants in the head asbell said 
he believed the attack was related to his tough stance on illegal 
drugs 
thank god im alive the 46yearold asbell had said i 
guess it just wasnt my day or my time 
but perretti said at a news conference friday that the event 
was staged by prosecutor asbell apparently acting alone 
perretti said asbell was questioned for several hours thursday 
night into friday morning at the state police barracks in bellmawr 
where he was confronted with details of the state police 
investigation police found he had shot out his own car windows 
perretti would not comment on why asbell might have staged the 
shooting 
asbells fiveyear term as prosecutor had expired and he was 
serving as a holdover it was unclear if he was going to be 
reappointed by gov thomas kean or govelect james florio who 
takes office jan 16 
gloucester county prosecutor richard hickey iii said he 
considered asbell a close friend and that he loved what he was 
doing i really feel for his family right now 
asbell had said his lincoln town car was ambushed by two men in 
a green toyota station wagon about 5 pm monday after he left his 
office where he had gone to catch up on paperwork and get his 
paycheck following a vacation 
when the gunmen opened fire asbell said he fired one round 
from a 12gauge sawedoff shotgun that he kept in his car and 
unloaded seven rounds from a semiautomatic handgun 
i had my shotgun on my lap and i just let go asbell said 
tuesday i saw his head explode 
word of the alleged attack sparked increased security at other 
county prosecutors offices across the state 
asbell entered the carrier foundation in somerset county for 
psychiatric evualation perretti said adding that if asbell 
decided to check out authorities could move to have him held 
involuntarily the hospital said it would neither conform nor deny 
asbells presence citing privacy laws 
perretti who appointed assistant attorney general james f 
mulvihil as acting prosecutor said there is no evidence that 
asbells psychiatric problems affected his work as prosecutor 
we are very satisfied this is a sudden and aberrational turn 
of behavior by prosecutor asbell perretti said 
kean said he was shocked by the events of the past week and 
added that if asbell is found mentally incompetent prosecution 
would not serve any purpose 
asbell maintained his story as late as thursday 
i have met with the attorney general and he made it 
explicitly clear to me that i am a victim of a violent crime 
he very kindly said i have to get in my mind the fact that i am 
not a prosecutor in this matter but i am a victim asbell said 
at a news conference 
asbell and his family were placed under 24hour state police 
protection after he told authorities of the attack 
but authorities said they were somewhat confounded by the lack 
of leads in the case no body was found and a victim did not 
turned up at hospitals 
asbell while in private practice was shot in the chest in 1970 
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriffs 
sale the bullet remains lodged in his chest

a 3500pound engine that sheared off a 
northwest airlines jet in flight was found friday at a wooded 
cattle ranch officials said 
the engine was spotted by a madison county sheriffs helicopter 
and the area was secured by deputies as a federal air safety 
inspector made his way to the site 
they have been instructed not to do anything with the engine 
until he gets there said ted lopatkiewicz spokesman for the 
national transportation safety board in washington dc 
the inspection would probably begin saturday lopatkiewicz said 
the engine was found on the ranch of a man who reported hearing 
a loud noise thursday said sheriffs dispatcher fred register 
deputies were unable to check the tip until late friday morning 
because of heavy fog 
the engine fell thursday from the right tailwing of a 
14yearold boeing 727 on a flight from miami to minneapolis with 
139 passengers and a crew of six on board the plane diverted to 
tampa and landed safely 
radar showed the engine separating from the plane and 
investigators believed its sixmile plunge landed it near madison 
officials believe the engine will provide the best evidence on the 
cause of the separation 
boeing spokesman tom cole in seattle noted the 727s three 
engines are each designed to break off if sudden vibrations 
threaten to tear a plane apart and the plane can continue with two 
engines or even with one 
the incident caused little disturbance to passengers and the 
aircraft lost only 100 feet of altitude immediately following the 
engine loss before the incident engines had broken off boeing 
jets three times since 1985 
in each case the pilots landed the planes safely and without 
injuries to passengers but after the last two incidents the 
federal aviation administration ordered emergency inspections of 
the bolts holding the engines in place

president bush on friday granted poland more 
dutyfree access to us markets saying the move will open the 
door for investment trade and the interaction of two free 
peoples 
in a white house ceremony bush signed a proclamation which 
should provide typical savings of between 3 and 10 percent for the 
producers of polish exports into the united states 
the presidents action qualified poland for concessionary trade 
rules known as the generalized system of preferences under which 
duties are lifted on about half of the products on the us tariff 
schedule in polands case the benefit would apply to about 
onefourth of the goods subject to duties it now sends to the 
united states 
this means that polish exports will enjoy the most liberal 
access possible to the american market bush said and it will 
pave the way for increases in polish exports to the united states 
a vital contribution to polands economic recovery 
the past year has been one of outstanding change in eastern 
europe the president said but it was the brave people of 
poland under the banner of solidarity that led the way poland 
has blazed the trail the freedom trail 
bush addressed a small audience that included secretary of state 
james a baker iii trade ambassador carla hills and polands 
ambassador jan kinast 
in addition to the new trade concessions bush noted the us 
government is committed to a threeyear economic assistance program 
to poland totaling 1 billion and has already contributed 200 
million in aid since last spring the western alliance has promised 
more than 8 billion in economic aid to poland over the threeyear 
period 
poland previously was granted mostfavorednation trading status 
by the united states meaning its products qualified for the lower 
tariffs accorded us allies the new designation allows many of 
those same goods to enter the country without paying the tariffs 
charged developed countries on the mostfavorednation list 
the concession does not guarantee sales in the united states 
but is designed to provide a savings margin that could prove 
decisive on the american market and thus spur increased trading 
activity about 50 million in polish goods already enter the 
united states dutyfree 
administration officials said that by volume the polish 
products likely to benefit the most include tractors and parts 
furniture cutting tools machine tools titanium dioxide and 
copper wire duties for those goods now range from 22 percent to 
72 percent 
the concession also would benefit several polish products on 
which high duties ranging between 17 percent to 45 percent now 
are charged vodka and other alcoholic beverages cork products 
brussels sprouts preserved vegetables and clincial thermometers 
based on 1988 trade data dutiable polish products worth 733 
million were imported into the united states in categories for 
which tariffs now will be lifted that would amount to a potential 
savings based on that years volume of 35 million 
if poland fully utilized its latest eligibility its trading 
volume under the concession would be estimated to rank with that of 
turkey zaire and costa rica

fighting has flared in western ethiopia 
where an obscure rebel group claims to have killed captured or 
wounded more than 1200 government troops and seized a town along 
the sudanese border 
the fighting has disrupted a un refugee operation in the 
region according to relief officials and comes at a time when the 
government is engaged in heavy battles with northern insurgents 
the oromo liberation front a loosely grouped insurgency that 
draws its strength from the oromo tribespeople across western 
central and southern ethiopia claims to have taken the town of 
asosa in fighting tuesday 
in a clandestine rebel broadcast monitored in nairobi the oromo 
rebels said they killed 957 government troops wounded more than 
200 and captured 117 
asosa is completely under control and the inhabitants have 
been totally liberated from foreign oppression said the 
broadcast 
diplomats and other sources in ethiopias capital addis ababa 
could not confirm the rebel claims 
however a spokeswoman for the un high commissioner for 
refugees said an unknown number of refugees had fled a unhcr camp 
about 18 miles from asosa because of fighting and that the agency 
had evacuated three employees from the area 
the spokeswoman meryam amar said the agency had been unable to 
get any details about the fighting or the refugees flight because 
the government was refusing to allow anyone to travel to the region 
she said there had not been any disturbances in the region prior 
to tuesdays fighting 
it was sudden and brand new for us she said 
asosa 300 miles west of addis ababa is the field office for 
four unhcr camps that house about 385000 refugees who have fled 
drought and war in southern sudan 
the camp near asosa tsore houses 41219 refugees a quarter of 
whom have arrived in the last two months fleeing renewed fighting 
in sudans civil war said amar 
with the oromo rebellion the refugees are being caught 
between the crossfire for a second time she said 
the oromo rebels who advocate selfdetermination for the oromo 
people have been fighting sporadically since the early 1970s 
diplomats say their battles have more resembled tribal warfare than 
organized dissidence and have tended to flare in patches and 
pockets in western and central ethiopia 
sources say the oromo have been more of an irritant than a 
threat however the recent battle comes at a time when the 
government is concentrating its attention and troops on fighting 
with tigrean rebels who since august have made significant advances 
from their northern province toward the capital 
president mengistu haile mariams government also is facing food 
emergencies in tigre and its northern neighbor eritrea where the 
united nations said crop failures threaten as many as 4 million 
people with starvation

claimed friday it scored a major victory over government troops in 
western equatoria by dispersing an army brigade of more than 3000 
soldiers 
an spla radio broadcast monitored in london said the victory 
came on thursday near the border of uganda and climaxed six days of 
fighting in south sudan it said brigade commander brig gen

dec 29 and overran the northwestern border town of oraba 
the spla engaged the brigade at kirwa four miles from the 
ugandan border as the government soldiers crossed back into sudan 
on dec 30 the radio said it said the brigade had advanced eight 
miles when it was destroyed by the spla 
uganda said on wednesday its troops retook oraba last week after 
three days of occupation by the sudanese army 
the spla launched its rebellion in early 1983 demanding greater 
autonomy and economic reforms in the three southern provinces of 
bahr elghazal upper nile and equatoria

the 1 million reward offered by president 
bush for information leading to the capture of deposed dictator 
manuel antonio noriega will apparently go unclaimed admimistration 
officials said on friday 
the administration had offered the bounty on dec 21 a day 
after the us invasion of panama and while noriega was still at 
large 
deputy presidential spokesman roman popadiuk said that the 
decision on what to do with the reward remains with the justice and 
state departments and not the white house however he said he 
believed that the bounty would probably go unclaimed 
rep william broomfield rmich said friday in a letter to 
bush that the papal nuncio in panama monsignor jose sebastian 
laboa deserved the reward because he persuaded noriega to 
surrender 
i am sure monsignor laboa has many worthy projects that could 
use some infusions of cash broomfieldl said 
a senior administration official who briefed reporters at the 
white house on thursday on the condition of anonymity shrugged off 
a question on whether the vatican might qualify for the reward 
i dont know ill tell you monday when the collection plate 
comes around he said 
administration officials who asked not to be identified said 
the vatican probably wouldnt qualify for the reward because its 
role in noriegas surrender was an indirect one 
noriega was 
holed up in the vatican embassy from christmas eve until this 
past wednesday when he surrendered to us forces 
in addition to the asyet unclaimed 1 million the 
administration also has been paying 150 perweapon to panamanians 
who turn in their firearms

murdered while trying to negotiate the return of his kidnapped 
12yearold brother whose severed finger accompanied a ransom 
demand police sources said friday 
the body of richard thomas porter 25 was found in the bronx 
early thursday he had been shot several times but investigators 
who found identification and 223978 on the body discounted 
robbery as a motive 
there is a possibility that this guy was trying to 
renegotiate the return of his brother without the police said 
a source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
porter reputedly a midlevel drug dealer who controlled several 
street dealers in harlem had refused to cooperate with police 
investigating his brothers kidnapping the sources said 
porters brother william was abducted dec 5 on his way school 
and is still missing police said theres no indication that we 
have that this kid was anything more than a schoolboy a source 
said 
the family learned of the abduction later that day when when 
william called home around 5 pm and tearfully told his mother he 
had been kidnapped 
four hours later a male caller warned the family not to call 
police but made no ransom demand 
the following day the family received a call demanding 
500000 later the same day a caller asked to speak with richard 
porter and told porter he would settle for 350000 for the boys 
return 
at 4 pm on dec 6 the kidnapper told the family to go to a 
mcdonalds restaurant at 125th street and broadway and look under

president carlos salinas de gortari completed 
an overhaul of his cabinet friday aimed at further developing 
tourism and boosting agricultural production two of mexicos 
principal moneyearners 
a surprise announcement thursday evening said agriculture 
secretary jorge de la vega dominguez was named a special adviser to 
salinas and tourism secretary carlos hank gonzalez 63 would take 
over agriculture 
former gov pedro joaquin coldwell 40 of quintana roo state in 
the yucatan was named tourism secretary on friday 
hanks appointment was hailed by business leaders who have been 
fretting that rising food prices and lagging production from 
mexicos antiquated farms and ranches was fueling inflation and 
eroding export income 
president eduardo garcia suarez of the national chamber of 
commerce urged hank to lift existing prices controls and pave the 
way to attract new investments in agriculture so as to raise 
productivity 
one major problem which every government has ducked in the 60 
years the institutional revolutionary party has been in power is 
the socalled ejido system under which entire villages own 
land that the villagers work in small parcels but by law cannot be 
sold or merged 
the system was revived by the 191020 revolution which called 
for land for everyone who works it land expropriations and 
agrarian reform continued until the early 1980s but now the 
government says there is no more land to expropriate 
mexico once a net exporter of agricultural products has been 
increasingly relying on purchases of wheat corn and other 
foodstuffs abroad to feed its growing population and make up for 
shortfalls in domestic production 
it now spends close to 3 billion a year on these imports 
salinas pledged to modernize mexico from top to bottom when he 
was inaugurated dec 1 1988 for a sixyear term 
word has circulated around government halls that the agrarian 
reform and the agriculture departments will soon be merged under 
hank 
in his one year as tourism secretary hank lined up japanese 
western european and canadian investors helped privatize and 
deregulate the airline industry and laid out plans to build new 
hotels and resorts in a program to double the number of tourists 
coming to mexico by 1994 
about 6 million foreign tourists now visiting mexico annually 
spend an estimated 3 billion a year 
coldwell a businessman and former congressman moved up from 
being chairman of the national tourism fund a government 
organization that helps finance development of tourism facilities 
he helped turn cancun off the yucatan into one of the 
caribbeans leading luxury beach resorts

defense attorneys met for two hours friday with 
deposed panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega and later denied 
reports that a deal was in the works with the us government 
as military helicopters circled above the federal courthouse in 
downtown miami defense attorneys frank rubino and steven kollin 
met inside with noriega and discussed legal options 
his demeanor is fine rubino said of the 51yearold 
noriega hes cheerful and very relaxed most of the time we 
spent discussing the case and its ramifications 
he has no complaints added kollin 
the attorneys declined to discuss the details of their legal 
discussions but kollin said there were no plans to make a deal 
with the government on the drug trafficking charges faced by 
noriega 
a man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain 
general noriega is not guilty of any of these charges kollin 
said 
in washington president bush said friday the governments case 
is strong and he is also not seeking a deal on a reduced charge 
for noriega 
we are preparing for trial said justice department 
spokesman david runkel he wouldnt rule out any discussion of a 
deal if noriega came forward but stressed there is no 
indication of anything along those lines 
the new york times citing a senior administration official 
reported friday that the government would be prepared to discuss 
a negotiated settlement if general noriega provided detailed 
information about international drug trafficking activities 
noriega reportedly spent thursday night inside the courthouse 
officials have been extraordinarily quiet about security 
precautions taken in the noriega case 
the miami herald quoted government sources as saying noriega was 
housed in in a room so secret that the marshals service will not 
confirm its existence a 10by12 room called the submarine 
under the old courthouse 
tunnels connect the old section with the new building where 
noriega faced us district judge william m hoeveler on thursday 
in a ninthfloor courtroom 
the isolated room has a bed a television and a toilet the 
herald said the door is not visible to occupants who usually are 
participants under the federal witness protection program 
noriega who surrendered to us troops in panama city on 
wednesday night is charged with taking 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way 
station for the cocaine trade 
noriega is also charged on a separate indictment in tampa for 
alleged marijuanasmuggling activities 
kollin said thursday he had heard some talk about about moving 
him to tampa to deal with court proceedings awaiting him there 
but later kollin said hed found nothing to support the tampa 
rumors 
we dont think theyre going to move him in the immediate 
future kollin said the marshals are being very nice and 
cooperative and they have assured us he will be available whenever 
we want to talk to him 
federal officials in tampa said they knew of no plans to bring 
noriega there to deal with the marijuana indictment 
no decision will be made regarding the tampa case until the 
miami case is disposed of said doug tillett spokesman for the 
justice department 
both attorneys also met with the prosecutors and with 
representatives of the us marshals office 
in another development a federal magistrate friday ordered an 
alleged noriega pilot named in the indictment to be held without 
bond in pretrial detention despite his attorneys claim that he is 
not a risk of flight 
michael okane a fort lauderdale attorney representing 
36yearold daniel miranda argued that the charge against miranda 
of flying 800000 in drug proceeds from fort lauderdale to panama 
in 1983 carried a maximum sentence of only five years 
okane said he would appeal the magistrates ruling to hoeveler 
the trial judge

president mikhail s gorbachev put off meetings 
with foreign guests friday to concentrate on domestic crises and 
news of it unsettled wall street and caused a steep decline in the 
tokyo stock market 
among the foreign visitors affected was neil kinnock leader of 
the opposition socialist labor party in britain a senior communist 
party official said privately gorbachev was dealing with border 
riots in azerbaijan and the breakaway communist party of lithuania 
soviet media did not report the schedule change but it was felt 
abroad 
the tokyo stock exchange recorded its sharpest drop since oct 
16 plummeting 43812 points 
analysts blamed concern about gorbachevs fate a slight decline 
in stock prices on wall street and a steep drop on the hong kong 
exchange were attributed to the same cause 
to japan the worst thing that could happen to the world 
scenario would be for gorbachev to drop from sight chris 
schreiber an investment analyst with new japan securities said in 
tokyo 
the market reactions illustrated how closely the capitalist 
world links gorbachev to the success of the reforms and improved 
eastwest relations he has pursued since gaining power in march 
1985 
in london foreign office minister william waldegrave said on 
channel 4 news it is in our interests that current soviet 
foreign policy should be maintained and we should therefore 
respond imaginatively and positively to what he is trying to do 
he is going in the right direction and we want him to survive 
he still dominates the political scene he has shown himself 
willing to be open to new ideas 
the party official in moscow asked about western news reports 
that gorbachev had postponed meetings with kinnock and other 
foreign dignitaries replied its right we have many problems 
right now 
he mentioned disturbances in azerbaijan along the iranian border 
and the lithuanian communist partys decision to break away from 
the ruling national party led by gorbachev 
soviet azerbaijanis tried over the new years holiday to force 
open the frontier and reunite with their ethnic brethren in iran 
tearing down guard towers and prompting the kgb to reinforce 
security along the frontier fences remain flattened and other 
barriers out of commission along the border soviet tv reported 
friday night 
gorbachev is expected to travel to lithuania next week on a 
mission from the national partys central committee to try to mend 
the rift with the lithuanian communists they voted two weeks ago 
to split off from the 20 millionmember ruling party and pursue 
local independence and lithuanian party leaders who met with 
gorbachev for five hours thursday said he failed to sway them from 
their decision 
a dissenting faction of lithuanian communists who voted to 
remain loyal to moscow were on their way to the capital friday to 
meet with party leaders said eduardas potashinskas a lithuanian 
tv journalist 
meanwhile the estonian communist party threw its support to the 
lithuanians in the dispute with moscow reports said friday the 
estonian partys central committee meeting thursday set march 23 
for a session of its own full congress which is expected to vote 
on a similar proposal to split from the soviet party estonian 
journalist tarmu tammerk said 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov in a telephone 
interview would neither confirm nor deny that gorbachev was 
putting aside foreign questions to concentrate on domestic problems 
asked about a report from london that the soviet ambassador to 
britain leonid zamyatin had told kinnock that gorbachev was 
postponing a jan 16 meeting with kinnock and all other contacts 
with foreign politicians this month gerasimov replied has this 
meeting been planned let the associated press compose its own 
commentary for me this is all clear let them comment on that as 
they wish 
gorbachevs calendar is rarely made public and whenever he 
disappears from the public eye speculation about his activities 
and even his health becomes rife he scoffed at such 
rumormongering this summer at the first session of the congress of 
peoples deputies 
lets end these rumors he said in four years i have 
already died seven times and my family was killed three times 
gorbachev 58 was last seen on staterun tv on dec 31 
delivering a taped address to the nation moscowbased official 
media did not report on his closeddoor meeting thursday with the 
lithuanians 
in london a labor party spokesman said zamyatin had delivered a 
personal message from gorbachev to kinnock who had been scheduled 
to visit moscow for talks with the soviet leader the message said 
the meeting had to be postponed because political events in the 
soviet union required gorbachevs personal attention and 
participation and that he was postponing contact with foreign 
politicians scheduled for january

death toll from politically inspired violence at 3198 a steep 
rise from the 1988 figure of 1986 
peru is definitely a sick country said sen enrique 
bernales chairman of the commission whose reports are considered 
one of the most reliable sources of information on perus civil 
unrest 
shining path rebels have been fighting to topple peruvian 
governments since 1980 other antigovernment groups include the 
procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement and the rodrigo franco 
command a paramilitary death squad believed linked to radicals in 
the governing centerleft aprista party 
bernales said 1989 was costliest year since the violence began 
he estimated damage to the country last year at 32 billion 
including a halfbillion dollars because of attacks on perus 
hydroelectric power grid 
economic damage to the country since 1980 were put at more than 
15 billion

the decisionmaking process 
koeszeg said they also had documents allegedly concerning other 
opposition groups and that he had already been in touch with jozsef 
antall the head of the hungarian democratic forum 
the free democrats and fidesz said they had requested the state 
prosecutors office began an investigation and criminal proceedings 
against persons unknown for violating the constitution and the 
penal code 
premier miklos nemeth later urged prosecutors to investigate the 
charges 
through the state news agency mti nemeth issued a statement 
condemning all illegal activities including the methods formerly 
employed by the state security organization 
hungarys security organs regularly monitored dissident 
activities during four decades of communist rule but the reforms in 
hungary and throughout the east bloc since last year have caused 
many of those operations to cease 
earlier the free democrats and fidesz had demanded in an open 
letter to nemeth that interior minister istvan horvath resign and 
two top security officials be suspended 
one of the officials whose suspension was demanded deputy 
interior minister ferenc pallagi who is in charge of the state 
security said in an interview with a budapest daily last november 
that his department was not concerned with the legitimate 
alternative organizations 
the letter called on the premier to make public what 
organizations and which people were privy to the information and 
to impound immediately all such documents

a proposed group home for mentally 
retarded adults that prompted discrimination lawsuits against this 
chicago suburb will likely be given the goahead officials said 
the justice department and the developer sued charging the city 
disciminated when turning down a permit request for the home 
the developer residential facilities management services and 
the suburb are close to a settlement that will resolve the case 
and allow construction of the home city attorney james creswell 
said 
attorneys for the two sides expect to submit a written agreement 
jan 16 they told us district judge william hart on thursday 
our hope is we may have reached some accommodation by next 
week said attorney richard friedman for the developer in 
galesburg in western illinois 
the justice department filed a lawsuit against the city june 20 
seeking an injunction to allow the project to proceed it was the 
first case brought by the government under the fair housing 
amendments act enacted march 12 to bar housing discrimination 
against the handicapped 
the developer filed its own federal lawsuit june 21 
cresswell who is not directly involved in the negotiations 
said thursday he did not know whether the home would be built on 
the original site in a residential neighborhood in this community 
of about 32000 people 
but friedman said there are no other residential sites available 
that are large enough for the home company officials said they 
face a june 30 deadline for exercising their option to buy the 
property 
creswell and mayor charles panici were not in their offices 
friday afternoon and could not be reached for comment on the 
proposed settlement 
city council last may denied a specialuse permit for the home 
which is to house 15 mentally retarded adults an attorney 
representing the city later said the permit was denied because the 
developers application was deficient 
group homes for the handicapped usually established in 
residential neighborhoods are designed to encourage independence 
residents live under supervision but are given greater 
responsibility for everyday decisions 
the lawsuits contend the council denied the permit because of 
opposition from residents based on fear and prejudice against the 
mentally retarded 
the mayors office in a release last june noted there are two 
daycare and specialeducation centers for the developmentally 
disabled in the city 
the record of the city of chicago heights and its citizens in 
the area of assisting the mentally handicapped is outstanding 
the release saidwe are not an insensitive community unfeeling 
and uncaring when it comes to those less fortunate than we

leaders of the black community friday harshly 
criticized the investigation of a white couples shootings in an 
innercity neighborhood saying police were too willing to believe 
a black man was to blame 
they accused police and the media of giving less attention to 
black crime victims and charged police abused residents of the 
misson hill neighborhood where charles and carol stuart were found 
shot in their car last october 
stuart told police a black assailant fired the shots killing 
his pregnant wife and critically wounding him stuart committed 
suicide thursday after his brother implicated him in the shootings 
people wanted to believe that africanamericans and the 
africanamerican community are maddog killers and this is not 
true said rep gloria fox who spoke at the first of two news 
conferences held friday by community leaders 
at the second meeting the rev grayland ellishagler said 
police have a lynch mob mentality toward black suspects 
we can not forget a police department and a commissioner who 
so readily used gestapo tactics against the black community he 
said 
on friday mayor raymond l flynn reiterated that he regretted 
the negative publicity surrounding the stuart incident and that 
believe it or not im sad for the city of boston 
no one was ever charged in the stuart case but a black man held 
on an unrelated charge had been repeatedly mentioned in news 
accounts as the likely suspect police cleared him in the case on 
thursday 
sadiki kambon director of the black community information 
center in the roxbury neighborhood said the man was jailed 
because of his skin color and the boston polices need for a 
victim to satisfy the hunger of white racism in boston and 
america 
asked later to comment on the allegation police spokeman scott 
gillis said the police commissioner had no immediate comment friday 
paul leary suffolk county assistant district attorney denied 
police ignored evidence implicating stuart saying there was no 
corrobative evidence or any forensic evidence or anything at that 
time that would have led the police to believe that his story was 
other than what he had stated it to be 
kambon also complained of allegedly abusive behavior by police 
in searches of black residents during the investigation he said 
police must learn to respect us as human beings if im walking 
down the street with my daughter dont come up to me and ask me 
who i am 
at mohammads mosque black politicians and religious leaders 
delivered impassioned speeches punctuated by frequent applause and 
shouts from the audience of about 60 people 
the rev don muhammad a minister at the church said he 
rejected any apologies from city officials 
an apology is nothing thats like stabbing me in the back 
pulling the knife out and saying youre sorry he said over a 
wave of applause 
pastor mickarl thomas compared the situation in boston with the 
racial tensions in alabama during the civil rights era 
thirtyfive years ago my people were walking the streets of 
montgomery alabama today in boston were not much better as we go 
into the next decade he said when black men are afraid to put 
on their jogging suits and go out and jog because they might be 
arrested or accused something is wrong

the man identified by us officials as a top 
aide to deposed panamanian leader manuel noriega appeared on 
israeli television friday night to deny he had served as security 
adviser to the dictator 
mike harari a former israeli spymaster also denied he had been 
detained by us troops in panama during the american invasion 
some us officials reported dec 28 that harari had been 
arrested in panama by american troops and a us diplomat in 
panama described harari as a close adviser to noriega and an 
instructor to panamas defense forces which noriega headed 
the reports of hararis arrest later proved to be incorrect 
as you can see im here i did not arrive disguised as a 
blonde girl and did not come in a suitcase my name is mike harari 
michael harari he said in a taped interview recorded in an 
israel television studio and broadcast friday night 
the television did not say when the interview was filmed but it 
first reported that harari was in the country on dec 30 it was an 
extremely rare appearance by harari and the first since the dec 20 
invasion of panama by us troops 
i was not hiding and was not imprisoned by the americans on 
any occasion i was in panama when the war started and i avoided it 
without any help by my own means and as you can see im 
here in my country at home among my family and friends harari 
said 
he spoke of israeli media reports that said the israeli embassy 
in panama helped arrange his escape 
even before i came to israel on the way i saw all the system 
of disinformation about me that i was detained that there were 
talks about me that i was being transferred and released harari 
said 
besides us officials foreign and israeli media reports have 
widely identified harari as noriegas personal security chief 
israeli reports said he had considerable influence in panama and 
was once appointed by noriega as panamas honorary consul in israel 
but harari insisted this was only disinformation that proves 
what has happened in the last three years 
what havent they said about me in which way havent they 
smeared me they said i was noriegas adviser 
i want to tell you im not noriegas adviser and have not 
been in the past im not no 1 or no 2 noriega is not my 
partner i have not been in charge of his business affairs i have 
not been in charge or instructed his forces i have not organized 
his personal security im just a private man who deals in trade 
harari stated 
hararis exploits have been widely described in newspapers and 
books 
according to the daily yediot ahronot harari 62 was chief of 
operations at israels mossad secret agency when he headed the unit 
trying to kill the leader of the palestinian black september group 
that massacred 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics 
the case is also described in the book the quest for the red 
prince by israeli authors michael barzohar and eitan haber in 
the book the team leader is referred to as mike 
according to the accounts the israeli squad traced a man they 
believed was ali hassan salameh alias the red prince to the 
resort of lillehammer norway the suspect was killed may 23 1973 
but turned out to be a moroccanborn waiter living in lillehammer 
with his norwegian wife 
six of the israeli agents involved in the mission were arrested 
by norwegian police to further mossad embarrassment salameh was 
killed in a beirut car bomb blast on jan 22 1979 believed to be 
organized by israeli agents 
according to israeli newspaper reports harari helped noriega 
recruit israeli mercenaries as his personal bodyguards the last 
year

finance chiefs late friday lowered the 
value of the italian lira in the european monetary system but left 
untouched the currencies of other nations in the exchange 
arrangement 
it was the first realignment of any currency in the system in 
nearly three years 
analysts had widely predicted the finance officials would bump 
up the value of the german mark which has been gaining increasing 
strength in recent weeks against other european currencies and the 
us dollar 
the move to readjust the lira was unlikely to have any effect on 
the dollar 
in a statement the european community announced the italian 
government agreed to narrow the band in which the lira is allowed 
to fluctuate in the exchange rate mechanism of the european 
monetary system 
the arrangement seeks to prevent wide fluctuations in exchange 
rates the currencies of nine of the 12 nations of the european 
community trading bloc are linked in the exchange rate mechanism 
only the currencies of britain portugal and greece remain outside 
the italian government decided to reduce the liras range from 6 
percent to 225 percent which means the currency will be able to 
move up or down by that much from a central rate all the other 
currencies except the spanish peseta have a 225 percent band the 
peseta trades in the 6 percent range 
once the italian authorities agreed on the narrower band the 
other finance officials set the new central rate for the lira at 
15297 to the european currency unit an accounting unit created 
by the community the liras midpoint had been 148358 
the new rates will begin monday 
because the united states is not part of the european monetary 
system or ems the dollars value is not directly affected by the 
shift 
a senior european monetary official who demanded anonymity 
predicted the currency shift would be remembered as one of the 
smoothest in the history of the 10yearold monetary system 
he said telephone discussions among the finance officials began 
friday afternoon and ended nine hours later 
the finance officials also welcomed the change as a sign 
community nations were getting ready for the first phase of their 
campaign for an economic and monetary union the initial phase 
which will go into effect on july 1 calls for closer cooperation 
on economic and monetary policies 
they urged italy to work harder to pare its federal budget 
deficit this will also foster greater economic convergence in 
the community they said 
as word spread that the monetary officials were working on a 
realignment analysts expected they would rejigger the value of 
most of the currencies lowering many of them but lifting the 
german mark 
german authorities have been pressing for a realignment to 
bolster their currencys value but french officials have opposed 
any move to clip the franc 
the value of the mark has soared with the opening of borders 
between east and west germany and the economic reforms in other 
eastern european countries expectations are high that germany will 
take advantage of the openings in the east and strengthen its 
already powerful economy 
before the communitys announcement earl johnson a vice 
president at harris trust and savings bank in chicago said a 
change in only the lira would increase pressure to realign the 
other currencies 
zlatko glamuzina chief dealer at banco di sicilia in new york 
said the ems needed finetuning from time to time

a paroled killer charged in the slayings 
of eight women was ordered held without bail friday and authorities 
say they have linked the man to a total of 11 killings over the 
last two years 
the break in the serial slayings was just a matter of luck 
said one of the police officers who spotted the suspects car from 
a helicopter 
after his arrest arthur shawcross 44 of rochester made 
statements about the slayings and told police where to find three 
bodies said police chief gordon f urlacher who refused to say if 
the suspect confessed 
a state police source who spoke on condition on anonymity said 
shawcross had confessed to 11 slayings 
authorities had been investigating the deaths and disappearances 
of 16 women in the rochester area since march 1988 and as recently 
as dec 26 urlacher and monroe county district attorney howard r 
relin said five of the slayings are not related to the others 
the number that we believe that hes responsible for was 11 
urlacher said weve said all along that we dont believe all 
these cases were related and thats the way it turned out 
most of the women shawcross is accused of killing were involved 
in prostitution and drugs police said 
he went to them posing as a john customer was able to get 
them in the car then took control of them took them to various 
locations wherever it might have been state police 
superintendent thomas constantine said in albany in most cases 
the death was strangulation 
constantine also said some victims were mutilated 
shawcross pleaded innocent to eight counts of seconddegree 
murder in rochester city court on friday judge john manning regan 
ordered him held without bail a preliminary hearing was scheduled 
for wednesday 
shawcross was also charged with one count of patronizing a 
prostitute 
in addition to the eight cases in which charges were filed the 
district attorney said evidence linking shawcross to three other 
deaths will be presented to grand juries in monroe and neighboring 
wayne counties 
relin said shawcross moved to rochester in 1987 when he was 
paroled from prison he had serving 15 years for the 1972 
strangling of 8yearold karen ann hill of rochester while she was 
visiting watertown 150 miles to the northeast 
police said the break in the serial slayings came wednesday 
while officers in a helicopter were searching a park 12 miles east 
of rochester where clothing of a missing woman had been found the 
officers spotted shawcross car then the body of another missing 
woman 
it was kind of like we saw the vehicle first and then the 
second time around we both saw the body said state police sgt 
ken r hundt a helicopter pilot as far as im concerned it was 
just a matter of luck 
the two pilots and the investigator may have been flying that 
plane but the hand of god was also at the controls said deputy 
rochester police chief terrence rickard 
police on the ground followed shawcross to a nursing home he 
was questioned there wednesday and taken into custody thursday 
said state police maj salvatore f valvo police refused to say 
why shawcross was at the home 
the person derives some type of satisfaction from the murder 
and its very possible that they go back and look at the results 
constantine said 
two of the bodies whose location shawcross revealed were found 
thursday night and the third was found friday as shawcross was 
being arraigned the third was that of a 22yearold missing since 
nov 6 
police refused to comment on an motive for the slayings 
its very difficult to get inside the head of a person like 
this urlacher said 
shawcross had appeared to be adapting well to life outside 
prison said edward elwin executive director of the state division 
of parole shawcross worked as as a saladmaker at a restaurant 
elwin said 
superficially he was making a good adjustment elwin said 
shawcross had tried to settle elsewhere in new york state but 
was moved by parole officials from both places because of 
complaints of local residents 
according to state records shawcross a watertown native was 
imprisoned from 1969 to 1971 for a burglary conviction and was 
married three times he earned a high school equivalency degree 
while serving time on the manslaughter conviction prison records 
showed 
shawcross was charged in the slayings of darlene trippi 32 
felicia stephens 20 june stotts 29 frances brown 22 patricia 
ives 25 anne marie steffen 27 dorothy blackburn 27 and 
dorothy keller 
clem brown of rochester grandfather of frances brown said 
shawcross should be put to death for the slayings 
what the hell did they let him out for if he does that 
brown told the syracuse heraldjournal if he killed kids he 
sure as hell would do it to someone else

a state commission on the exxon valdez oil 
spill called friday for an overhaul of the nations 
oiltransportation system and blamed the disaster partly on the 
coast guards unduly friendly relationship with industry 
the commissions report also blames the nations worst oil spill 
on a reckless rush to profits by the oil industry and criticizes 
government agencies and the public for not insisting on stringent 
environmental safeguards 
better monitoring of tanker traffic increased use of 
doublehull tankers larger tanker crews and a stronger commitment 
by industry and government to environmental protection are among 
the reports recommendations 
obviously the present system providing minimum penalites 
for creating massive environmental damage has not deterred the 
industry from putting the coasts and oceans of the world at 
constant hazard it says 
the preliminary report by the alaska oil spill commission makes 
59 recommendations that the state and federal governments and oil 
industry can adopt to prevent oil spills and improve their spill 
response 
the report is especially critical of the coast guard for its 
confusion of mission and an unduly friendly relationship with 
industry 
the coast guard has failed the american people in providing 
oversight of the countrys oiltransportation system the report 
says enforcement must be strengthened and the penalty structure 
raised 
the report blames the coast guards lax safety enforcement and 
reduced state oversight on the national mood under president 
reagan toward less government regulation 
safety does not do well in a laissezfaire environment it 
says 
lt ray massey a coast guard spokesman in juneau said the 
agency had not received a copy of the report and would have no 
comment les rogers a spokesman for exxon co usa in houston also 
declined to comment 
the alaska legislature formed the investigatory commission in 
the weeks after the exxon valdez spill last spring in which nearly 
11 million gallons of alaska crude gushed into prince william 
sound its seven members were appointed by gov steve cowper 
this disaster could have been prevented not by tanker 
captains and crews who are only fallible human beings but by an 
advanced oiltransportation system designed to minimize human 
error commission chairman walt parker said in the reports 
foreward 
the captain of the tanker joseph hazelwood was fired amid 
charges he had been drunk at the time of the accident his trial is 
scheduled to begin jan 22 
parker was on a task force that helped set tanker standards for 
the port valdez trade in the late 1970s he said that when tankers 
began moving oil from the transalaska pipeline at valdez in 1977 
a good system to prevent spills was in place but the system fell 
apart because of legal action by the oil industry that preempted 
the state from enforcing many of its rules 
the shippers simply stopped following the rules and the coast 
guard stopped enforcing them parker said 
tankers originally were to remain inside tanker lanes at all 
times in the sound and slow down to minimum speed when ice was 
present he said the exxon valdez was allowed to go outside the 
lanes at full speed when it neared ice which led to it running 
aground on bligh reef 
the original rules were consistently violated primarily to 
ensure that tankers passing through prince william sound did not 
lose time by slowing down for ice or waiting for winds to to 
abate the report says concern for profits in the 1980s 
obliterated the concern for safe operations that existed in 1977 
the report also cites the state legislatures failure to provide 
enough money for the department of environmental conservation 
which is responsible for spill prevention and cleanup plans 
the departments small staff was overwhelmed by technical 
licensing and permitting activities leaving no opportunity for the 
agency to perform its role as overall environmental policy 
watchdog it says 
cowper described the report as a cold and sober assessment of 
what happened in the exxon valdez disaster 
a key event here was the striking down of alaskas laws that 
would have controlled tanker movements and the degree of 
preparation for oil spills cowper said at a news conference 
the commission came to the conclusion that our oilspill response 
capability is still primitive 
cowper and state house speaker sam cotten said legislation to 
adopt some of the reports recommendations may be considered during 
the 1990 legislative session which begins monday 
its a little bit too early to specifically respond to the 
spill reports findings right now but i think we will probably do 
whatever is recommended here cowper said 
cotten said he was unsure if the legislature has the will to get 
any new spill laws passed this session some legislators have said 
they first want to take a second look at the package of spill 
bills they quickly passed last spring after the exxon valdez 
spill 
among the reports other recommendations 
the party responsible for the spill not be in charge of the 
cleanup a spiller should be obligated to respond with the 
resources it can summon but government should command the 
response the report says 
a formal command system with a predesignated coordinator be 
established to handle the cleanup a lesson from the exxon valdez 
spill is that such a system is needed to avoid confusion and 
disagreements between the agencies and companies involved the 
report says 
congress either strengthen the coast guards ability to respond 
to spills or transfer its cleanup duties to the army corps of 
engineers the report says congress also needs to provide more 
money for the environmental protection agency for spill prevention 
and response

the release of a record album ended friday when a judge ordered the 
former beatle to pay more than 74000 to the records producer 
superior court judge clarence cooper who issued a permanent 
injunction in november preventing produer chips momans company 
from releasing the 1987 album ruled that starr must pay moman 
74354 to cover costs of the recording sessions and 7 percent

appearance on one song 
an attorney for starr robert fleming jr said friday he had 
not seen the ruling but indicated he was satisfied with it as he 
understood it 
this amount is right in line with what the expenses were and 
what we were ready to pay he said the judge must have agreed 
that the agreement was what we said it was and enforced it 
accordingly 
moman had contended that starr owed him 146239 
momans attorney did not immediately return a telephone call 
starr testified in november that he went to memphis tenn to 
work with moman in february 1987 after a brief meeting with the 
producer the previous year attorneys for moman said starr came to 
the producer in an attempt to revive his career 
starr who had a successful us tour last year testified he 
was not desperate when he talked to moman 
it was just a move for your career he said he said his 
business agent had told him that he and moman would be a winning 
combination

zoo officials celebrated on friday the birth of 
a baby black rhinoceros boosting the captive population of the 
endangered species 
its a female weighing 66 pounds said zoo director charles 
hoessle were always very cautious for the first 24 hours with 
any newborn animal but she seems strong and normal 
hoessle said the baby is the result of a reeding program in 
cooperation with other zoos in north america 
the mother betsy belongs to the detroit zoo hoessle said 
the father toto is ours all the zoos manage the north american 
black rhino population as one population moving the animals around 
to avoid inbreeding 
hoessle said there are 70 or 75 black rhinos in captivity in 
this country more than half of them born in zoos 
in contrast hoessle said in the wild the population of 
the animals has crashed from more than 100000 to less than 3500 
in a little over 10 years drastic efforts are being made to save 
the few that are left by putting them in heavily protected parks 
hoessle said poachers were rapidly destroying the animals in the 
wild killing the large beasts just for their horns 
the horns are really nothing more than tightly compacted 
hair hoessle said they are used for dagger handles in yemen 
and for folk medicines and sex potionts in the orient theres no 
real medicinal value in them of course 
hoessle said no photographs of the newborn rhino were 
immediately available the mother is very aggressive he said 
and we have to be cautious we plan to try to sneak in our staff 
photographer as soon as we think its safe

the noncommunist government on friday 
acknowledged widespread shortages after a radical economic plan 
took effect but it urged patience to allow for the transformation 
of polands economy to capitalism 
the first few days are behind us so there is a lot of 
confusion anxiety and panic understandable in a situation of deep 
and radical changes which also are being introduced quickly said 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska 
shoppers wiped out supplies of flour sugar and meat in many 
stores after the announcement of sharp increases for many goods and 
services monday and tuesday 
we have to give time so the medicine can work we have to show 
patience and calm so the new economic mechanisms can start 
working she said 
deputy finance minister marek dabrowski said problems in food 
deliveries led to shortages especially for meat and butter and 
that some enterprises were having trouble paying their bills 
the solidarityled government was encouraged by the 
stabilization of the zloty following a 32 percent devaluation on 
monday an increase in bank deposits and an improvement in export 
figures in december dabrowski said 
one of the central elements of the plan which aims to halt 
polands 900 percent annual inflation and transform an economy 
directly managed by communists for four decades is to make the 
zloty a convertible currency 
poland until now has had two rates of exchange an official 
rate set by the government and a higher black market rate 
this week for the first time in memory the average official 
rate of 9500 zlotys to the dollar was higher than the unofficial 
rate 
the government hopes that a convertible currency will help 
attract foreign investors who until now have hesitated to develop 
projects in poland without a guarantee of being able to expatriate 
their profits 
but dabrowski said individual consumers have suffered partially 
because producers have withheld reverves of meat from the market 
while they waited to see if the new plan would work 
we found ourselves in a new reality a shock took place after 
the prices of energy and fuels went up he said 
also friday the government announced the reversal of a decision 
by previous communist authorities to close the lenin shipyard in 
gdansk where the solidarity trade union was born in 1980 
niezabitowska told a news conference that the ministry of 
finance the ministry of industry and the shipyard had decided to 
tranform the firm into a joint stock company during talks wednesday 
the former communistled government announced the decision to 
close the historic shipyard on oct 31 1988 
the move was immediately denounced by solidarity leader lech 
walesa an electrician at the plant as a provocation walesa 
vowed to fight to save the shipyard and began a search for 
potential investors 
barbarapiasecka johnson a polishamerican businesswoman and 
heir of the johnson amp johnson pharmaceutical fortune in june said 
she would spent up to 100 million on the plant if she received 
ownership of 55 percent of the stock but her letter of intent 
expired monday 
it was unclear whether she would make another offer for plant 
in washington bazyli samojlik economic counselor at the polish 
embassy said friday night mrs johnsons agreement was a 
business agreement so the government is not involved in it asked 
about the dec 31 limit for completing discussions he said 
its not a deadline as i understand it 
john peach an adviser to mrs johnson at her estate in 
princeton nj was on vacation and could not be reached for 
comment according to a woman who answered the telephone at peachs 
office 
my understanding is that negotiations will continue the 
woman said refusing to identify herself or her function 
niezabitowska said shipyard workers will be able to purchase 
shares on a preferential basis and other shares will be made 
available to foreign investors

spring the chinese government ordered university students to write 
selfcriticism reports on their involvement they have now turned 
them in more as grudgingly done homework than soulsearching 
reflections 
students say they passed around a few master reports before 
the december deadline or plagiarized government propaganda to 
satisfy authorities overseeing the political education exercise 
my report was nonsense i just said silly things all lies 
said a student at beijing university which was at the forefront of 
the movement i said i didnt agree with the hunger strike and 
posters and that i didnt participate in anything 
in fact the student took part in the hunger strike and 
occupation of tiananmen square printed and handed out leaflets 
and broadcast promovement messages over school loudspeakers 
yet the students report echoed with numbing mimicry the 
government line drummed into the populace since the june 34 
crackdown that left hundreds if not thousands dead 
soldiers rushed in to beijing to enforce martial law as the 
city suffered a serious counterrebellion the students 11page 
report said 
the soldiers who were brothers and sons of the people gave 
their blood to save the country and protect the peoples peace the 
masterminds of the turmoil used every means possible to achieve 
their despicable political aims manipulating the hungerstriking 
students treating students lives like betting chips disrupting 
the martial law order and uniting social forces to beat smash 
steal burn and kill and try to use violence to overthrow our 
legitimate government 
such parroting of the official line was reflected in other 
students similarly written reports which were reprinted for 
several weeks in beijings two local newspapers the communist 
partys beijing daily and the tabloid beijing evening news 
the written testimonies have been the price the government has 
asked for not punishing the tens of thousands of students who took 
part in the spring demonstrations dozens of student leaders have 
been arrested and face long years in prison 
students say the key was to write the proper view about the 
movement and how their attitudes have changed since june or the 
reports will be returned for rewriting 
mainly they wanted to know precisely what we did we just said 
we were used by a small handful of people because we were too 
young too childish said one student who took a report that had 
been submitted to her father a teacher and shared it with several 
classmates 
we didnt copy it completely just changed things around 
she said some of us turned them in to the same teachers so we 
had to be careful 
ideological education is being stressed at beijing university 
more than any other school its entire freshman class is spending a 
year at an army academy for political study and military training 
a lot of people didnt want to waste time writing these 
things the beijing university student said it was pretty easy 
to find the proper things to say we have so many references news 
reports books to copy from some of my friends copied whole 
paragraphs from newspapers 
at one of beijings technical universities numerous master 
copies of essays were floating around 
we had to change details of the reports to match ourselves so 
people couldnt tell they were from the same model a management 
student at the university said 
the student wrote a report by copying from newspapers and a 
roommate copied that report in turn 
i think the reports should be written a student at beijing 
normal university another activist hotbed said resignedly 
it keeps things quiet and then people wont bother you 
he did note he did not take part in any marches or rallies 
nothings going to change anyway he added well still 
have the same leaders and the same society 
students were not the only ones required to produce reports 
professors and some party members intellectuals and workers were 
also obliged 
i only wrote three pages said a worker in the publishing 
business i said truthfully that i kept on working throughout 
the turmoil and had no part of it 
the worker added however that none of his colleagues wrote 
reports sympathetic to the protesters 
these are all given to our superiors you know he said 
a professor at a prestigious professional university in beijing 
who had to give his report on the turmoil orally to colleagues says 
students were wrong to neglect their studies 
i gave a little speech and said the problem is with 
education he recalled 
i said young people arent interested in studying these days 
my school is the best in its field but so many students at my 
school are from the tfaction all they think about is taking 
the toefl exam 
the toefl or test of english as a foreign language is required 
by all schools in the united states of foreign students 
supervision of the students essays was not uniformly rigorous 
of course our leaders know a lot of us arent serious the 
management major said 
writing the essays was nevertheless a necessary exercise for 
staying on track for this student who took part in many of the 
activities around tiananmen square but still plans to join the 
communist party 
if i want to go abroad id better join the student said 
it will be very useful for my future for me to get a good job

israeli soldiers have 
been seen in disguise civilian clothes masks or even traditional 
embroidered dresses of arab women in their effort to capture 
leaders of the palestinian uprising 
the tactic along with the commandeering of cars with west bank 
or gaza strip license plates is designed to fool lookouts who 
often guard entrances to palestinian villages and camps 
in november two 20yearold men who had been shot came to a 
hospital in the west bank town of jenin and told doctors they were 
in a car fired on by jewish settlers or other israelis in civilian 
clothes 
the israeli army later confirmed two men were shot near jenin 
but said it was soldiers who opened fire when the cars driver 
ignored orders to stop a spokesman refused comment when asked if 
the soldiers were wearing civilian clothes 
the pattern of disguise has been emerging over the past four or 
five months arab reporters say eight people have been killed by 
men in civilian cars or in disguise who shot at wanted 
palestinians stone throwers or people painting antiisraeli 
graffiti 
on dec 1 according to arab witnesses soldiers wearing arab 
robes and kaffiyeh scarves killed four members of a radical group 
called the black panthers on a narrow street in nablus the west 
banks largest town 
in that case officials insisted the troops were in uniform 
generally the army has refused official comment on reports of 
disguised soldiers 
when asked about the disguises an army spokesman col nachman 
shai said the army does not reveal details of its operational 
activities 
in kafr kaddum residents told of israelis in civilian clothes 
arriving in the village in a minibus with blue west bank license 
plates sept 10 then opening fire and killing zaher obeid 28 and 
fahed ishtawi 14 
obeids brother jawad a retired school principal said this is 
what happened when the minibus entered the village 
some 100 people gathered around a boy recognized a man 
inside the car as an army officer who questioned him two days 
before zaher shouted these are spies 
half an hour later obeid was dead reportedly chased and shot 
by one of a dozen soldiers who stormed out of the vehicle which 
had cardboardcovered windows firing pistols and m16 assault 
rifles six others were reported wounded in the army action 
the army confirmed the raid on kafr kaddum 31 miles north of 
jerusalem it said soldiers opened fire after being attacked with 
stones and metal bars no references to disguises were made 
although the army does not officially acknowledge it uses 
disguises one military source speaking anonymously told the 
associated press that security forces resort to disguise to capture 
palestinians wanted for attacks on fellow arabs accused of 
collaborating with israel 
at least 155 suspected collaborators have been slain in the 
twoyear uprising and 626 other palestinians have died from 
israeli gunfire fortythree israelis have been killed 
the israeli newspaper hadashot quoted a senior military source 
as saying soldiers would keep using disguises until the wanted 
men wont know where the army is coming from and will be afraid 
of everybody and everything around them 
during the uprising police have acknowledged they posed as 
journalists and israeli newspapers have repeatedly reported 
soldiers commandeering vehicles with license plates from the 
occupied lands 
in november two palestinians were sentenced to 25 months in 
prison after documents were submitted to an israeli military court 
in the gaza strip saying they stoned a local civilian vehicle and 
then were arrested by soldiers who got out of the car 
in gaza and the west bank city of nablus arab reporters say 
soldiers have been seen with arab kaffiyehs over their faces in 
imitation of uprising activists or in womens scarves and 
colorfully embroidered dresses 
in an august incident a crowd in gazas shati refugee camp 
chased away seven masked men painting antiisraeli graffiti on 
walls when onlookers became suspicious the artists actually were 
soldiers a gazan source said 
they painted a palestinian flag with wrong colors he added 
in the west bank city of bethlehem mayor elias freij quoted 
witnesses as saying security agents dressed up like tourists with 
backpacks and cameras opened fire aug 19 on arab demonstrators 
killing one 
the army said the men were soldiers and again did not mention 
disguises

worried about a labor shortage and the 
migration of its skilled professionals singapore is wooing people 
from hong kong who fear for their future after the british colony 
reverts to china in seven years 
they are in demand here because they are thought to be a natural 
fit for singapores chinesedominated society where language would 
not be an insurmountable barrier 
many have come already to stay or to just to look around real 
estate brokers say hong kong people like singapores lush greenery 
and relative quiet both are in short supply where they come from 
they also like the prices of condominiums and houses usually far 
cheaper than in hong kong 
some of the hong kong visitors are taken on carefully conducted 
emigration tours to meet government officials bankers and 
others who could be helpful if it becomes necessary to find homes 
in a new land 
confidence in hong kongs future under chinese control after 
1997 after shrinking slowly since the joint declaration was signed 
by china and britain in 1984 dropped dramatically following the 
violent crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijings 
tiananman square in june 
earlier attempts by singapore to lure business people with the 
equivalent of 510000 in capital college graduates and 
professionals met with little success prime minister lee kuan yew 
said in 1987 that singapore came a poor third after canada and 
australia in enticing people from hong kong 
that changed within weeks of the tianaman square bloodshed when 
lees government relaxed the rules for as many as 25000 skilled 
workers and their families the quota applies to those with a high 
school education five years of onthejob experience and an income 
of at least 770 a month 
some 10000 hopefuls swarmed singapores consulate in hong kong 
within hours of the announcement a key attraction is that 
successful applicants can wait for as long as five years to take up 
residence and get an option to extend for another five giving 
them a chance to experience post1997 hong kong before deciding 
canada australia and other destinations require them to move in 
promptly 
but as nurses teachers and others aggravated an already serious 
brain drain by taking jobs in singapore newspapers and others in 
hong kong hit at what they saw as opportunism on singapores part 
in taking advantage of the colonys troubles 
hong kong and singapore a citystate of 26 million people at 
the tip of the malay peninsula have long been rivals as hubs for 
regional trade finance and communications although they are about 
1600 miles apart both are freetrade ports have limited space 
and no natural resources except strategic locations and the skill 
of their peoples 
george yeo singapores minister of state for foreign affairs 
denied that his government acted to make things more difficult for 
hong kong or china if those in hong kong intended to leave anyway 
he said it would be better to keep them in the region so their 
talent would not be lost to north america or australia 
one analyst said the wave of migration might allow singapore to 
reprise one reason for hong kongs economic boom thousands of 
entrepreneurs left cosmopolitan shanghai before it fell to the 
chinese communists 41 years ago to find refuge in hong kong and 
helped it prosper 
singapore expects a valueadded to the economy per worker of 
about 42000 to 52000 a year said mah bow tan the minister of 
state for trade and industry using the lower figure mah said 
25000 skilled migrants would add 105 billion about 4 percent of 
the countrys gross domestic product 
not everyone awaits the newcomers with open arms however 
our workers certainly do not want a flood of foreigners to 
come here and steal their jobs said chaim see tong 
secretarygeneral of the singapore democratic party and one of two 
opposition members of parliament 
the straits times newspaper reported that dentists in private 
practice an already crowded field in singapore are concerned 
about potential competitors from hong kong 
meantime while trying to lure likely prospects from hong kong 
affluent singapore faces its own drain of talented people more 
than 4700 families from what prime minister lee called our top 
25 percent left in 1988 most bound for australia new zealand 
canada and the united states 
exit interviews indicate they left mainly for better job 
opportunities less stressful work and school conditions or to join 
relatives 
they want less regulations more freedom mah told 
parliament they complain ours is a onemistake society with 
no tolerance for failure no second chance they dont want their 
children to be pressured in school they dont want to be told to 
excel in short they want to opt out of the rat race

gen manuel antonio noriega called them 
dignity battalions nbcs tom brokaw said noregas goons 
should antiabortion replace prolife is it crippled 
or physically challenged 
and what about black why not african american 
in the quickdraw world of media buzzwords its far simpler to 
spot a prodemocracy movement than to find easy answers to 
these linguistic dilemmas after all one persons freedom 
fighter might be anothers terrorist 
even what some consider the most straightforward labels now are 
being challenged the rev pat robertson has objected to being 
called a televangelist special olympics holds that hearing 
impaired is preferable to deaf 
why the attention to detail publicrelations consultants and 
specialinterest groups are convinced journalistic shorthand 
affects public opinion one word can shift sympathies in subtle 
but lasting ways 
if youre fighting for citizenship its better to be called an 
undocumented worker than an illegal alien and since 
liberal has taken on negative connotations some leftofcenter 
organizations now say theyre progressive 
the fight over language politics and the media was examined at 
length by george orwell in 1946 but with the advent of news 
compression give us 22 minutes and well give you the world 
the semantic scrap has intensified 
the terminology is extremely important said douglas gould 
vice president of communications for planned parenthood federation 
of america 
it helps form an impression in peoples minds about what the 
different groups are really all about it is the first step in 
framing the debate 
nowhere is the fight over buzzwords more intense than in the 
abortion battle after calling the opposing sides proabortion 
and prolife for several years the media now often refer to 
the rival sides as prochoice and antiabortion 
even that description some journalists and media critics agree 
is biased in favor of abortionrights advocates the implication is 
that anyone whos not prochoice is antichoice 
the other side wants to be for something and they want us to 
be against something said dan donehey director of public 
relations for the national right to life committee which opposes 
abortion the public tends to lean toward a group that is in 
favor of something 
yet if reporters were to reverse course and describe doneheys 
constituents as prolife the implication would be that the 
other camp is antilife so whats to be done 
the closest that i could come up with as neutral terms and 
im not satisfied with this either is abortionrights advocates 
and abortion opponents said jeff greenfield a reporter for 
abc news 
some organizations send language guidelines to news outlets 
people with aids should be called just that not aids victims 
the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation says in its style 
guidelines victim the activists say is better used to 
describe the target of a criminal act 
similarly children born with aids should not be called 
innocent victims of the disease as that implies other people 
with aids are guilty of something the alliance says 
in its language guidelines special olympics asks that people 
with handicaps not be labeled by their disabilities a person 
uses a wheelchair rather than is confined or restricted to a 
wheelchair the guidelines say a person has a seizure disorder 
or epilepsy rather than is epileptic 
pat krebs director of education for outreach projects for 
special olympics acknowledged that some of the guidelines border 
on euphemism physically challenged she said may not be an 
appropriate substitute for physically disabled the latter 
replacing crippled 
all the same even accepted shorthand quickly can become 
outdated and offensive at the turn of the century the labels used 
for degrees of retardation were idiot imbecile and moron krebs 
said 
then those terms took on such negative connotations with 
society krebs said so were constantly changing terminology 
other snappy labels star wars or prodemocracy may 
add little to our understanding of complicated issues 
the genesis for this is really television with its short 
attention span and its desire to compress everything into little 
nuggets of information said media critic mark hertsgaard author 
of on bended knee the press and the reagan presidency 
i think the use of shorthand has becomes at least as much a 
liability as an asset hertsgaard said it discourages any kind 
of nuance or complex understanding of political events 
prodemocracy hertsgaard and others say doesnt spell out 
differences between movements in china east germany 
czechoslovakia poland and the soviet union 
but time is so short for elaboration 
said abcs greenfield if im doing a piece for the network 
news and its supposed to run 1 minute and 45 seconds and i say 
can i please have 20 more seconds to explain the prodemocracy 
movement that might put my piece over thats why people are 
so desperate for those shorthand terms

the 11yearold war in afghanistan has 
destroyed much of the countrys agrarian economy and helped turn 
its small centuriesold tradition of poppy cultivation into a 
multimillion dollar industry 
officials say the colorful flowers sticky yield of opium is 
being refined into heroin powder in remote laboratories along the 
mountainous pakistanafghanistan frontier and shipped to the west 
western narcotics agents estimate that as much as 80 percent of 
the heroin sold in europe and 25 percent sold in the united states 
comes now from the region the remainder is from mexico and the 
golden triangle of southeast asia experts say 
afghan aid a british emergency relief organization began a 
program last june of offering agricultural incentives in hopes of 
weaning farmers away from opium poppies in rebelcontrolled areas 
the united states which has spent billions of dollars as the 
main arms supplier for antigovernment moslem guerrillas plans to 
launch a similar program this year 
no country has felt the effects of the illicit industry more 
than pakistan through which most of the heroin passes on its way 
to the west 
khalim dilkhan chairman of the pakistan narcotics control 
board said local agents in 1988 alone seized 13669 pounds of 
heroin compared with 950 pounds in 1980 
narcotics agents say a kilogram 22 pounds of 97 percent pure 
heroin fetches 1000 at the pakistanafghan border 
multiply that about 100 times for new york city said 
dilkhan 
he said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in pakistan a 
moslem country of 109 million people but now more than a million 
poor mainly urban young pakistanis are hooked 
in 10 years the problem has multiplied a thousand times 
dilkhan said 
no statistics are available on the number of addicts in 
afghanistan and experts do not even hazard a guess 
opium production and to some extent export has existed for 
centuries in afghanistan and what is now pakistan but experts said 
three events in the late 1970s combined to help make heroin a huge 
export industry 
turkeys crackdown on heroin labs operating in eastern 
anatolia which forced production into western iran 
irans islamic revolution which purged corrupt officials who 
had participated in the opium trade 
the war in afghanistan sparked by a marxist coup in 1978 
which has dislocated about half the countrys 15 million people and 
spawned anarchy in the countryside 
soviet combat troops intervened to prop up the marxist 
government in kabul from december of 1979 to last february but the 
ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan controls only the 
countrys major cities 
almost all the poppy cultivation occurs in areas held by the 
usarmed moslem guerrillas the mujahedeen or holy warriors 
where farmers once raised wheat corn and barley 
experts say these are the areas that have been hit hardest by 
artillery shelling and aerial bombing 
the main thing is the destruction of the irrigation systems 
opium poppy takes very little water said peter rees afghan 
aids field director in the frontier city of peshawar 
the major mujahedeen groups which are headquartered in 
pakistan acknowledge that some of their local commanders are 
involved in poppy cultivation however the leaders of those groups 
deny that they condone it 
in some areas there must be some benefit to mujahedeen 
commanders said rees but ive seen no clear evidence to show 
that high commanders are involved 
pakistani and us narcotics experts based in pakistan say they 
agree with that assessment 
afghan aids program offers assistance in the form of advice and 
development projects to farmers mainly in afghanistans eastern 
nangarhar province who sign contracts promising not to grow poppy 
in the spring well go and monitor each and every 
recipient rees said im reasonably confident theyll uphold 
these contracts 
the us congress has approved 125 million for a similar 
threeyear program to be run by the us agency for international 
development in consultation with the us drug enforcement 
administration

like his movie hero svevo bandini 
filmmaker dominique deruddere must wait until spring to see if 
america will fulfill his expectations 
fortunately for the belgian director he stands a better chance 
than bandini the european immigrant in wait until spring 
bandini a bittersweet tale of italian family life in the land of 
broken dreams 
with the offscreen backing of francis ford coppola and writer 
charles bukowski and sparkling onscreen performances by faye 
dunaway and joe mantegna deruddere is confidently awaiting the 
us premiere of his movie in florida at the festival of miami on 
feb 4 national release is set for midmarch 
the movie opened to good reviews in western europe just before 
the holiday season perfect timing for a heartwarming story set in 
the cold and snowedin rockies 
it would help the film if it were released now in the united 
states said deruddere sipping an espresso at his favorite art 
deco bar in brussels but at age 32 he doesnt want to get picky 
over such things as when and where his movies are shown 
he made just one full feature film in belgium crazy love a 
movie on how rejected love can ultimately lead to necrophilia and 
suicide earned him enough laurels to get a shot at a big break 
overseas 
most european directors have the american dream he said 
in the end nonconformists like rainer werner fassbinder also 
wanted an oscar when youre in your bed at night you just see 
yourself standing there on a us movie set 
last february and march he stood on an american set and the 
reality was sobering it is the just the same as working here 
youre only making a movie 
but he had to cut his original plans for shooting bandini in 
11 weeks down to seven after he could only raise 4 million instead 
of 6 million 
as a result the schedule was so tight the hours so long he once 
fell asleep on the set during the last week by then however he 
had already accomplished a tinsel town rarity he stayed within the 
budget and the deadline 
it was a miracle deruddere said crediting the tiny 
european budgets that forced an iron discipline upon him in his 
early days only halfmockingly he was told he could become a star 
in hollywood simply on that merit 
but deruddere wants to be an artist not an employee 
for that reason he rejected a 15 million offer from american 
producers to direct bandini provided he relinquished a final 
say in the production had he accepted he said the films story 
line would have been too sweet i wanted to make an emotional 
film not a tearjerker 
set in rocklin colo in 1925 wait until spring bandini 
tells the story of a poor unemployed italian bricklayer who has to 
feed his large family through the winter 
svevo bandini mantegna loses his money to gambling and his 
heart to the rich widow mrs hildegarde dunaway while his wife 
ornella muti prays for his return in the end svevos son 
arturo lures bandini back into the family fold with a couple of 
lies 
it is not such a wholesome theme deruddere said the 
family comes back together because of the lie the end is very 
ambiguous 
central to the story is an italian immigrants american dream 
and his sons musings about baseball and movie stars not the most 
obvious subject for a european director it is not typically 
american because the dream is seen as something unattainable the 
italian immigrants can only hope to belong 
it also helped that the bandini family closely resembled his own 
coming from belgium where just about anything is allowed on the 
set he faced for the first time the strongly regulated us movie 
industry 
the homely amateurism that can be so stimulating does not 
exist there said deruddere whose first task was to find a 
nonunion state in the rockies to shoot his film otherwise the 
movie could never be made 
he settled on utah and location shots were made near salt lake 
city even so utahs child labor laws forced him to work at a 
diabolical rhythm to ensure the young stars were in bed at 
night 
shooting was marred by a lack of snow in the rockies and 
artificial snow had to be used for countless takes but when 
deruddere himself provided a helping hand in the time consuming 
job some jaws dropped 
when the snow was not spread fast enough i just got on the 
truck to help some people freaked out and pointed look at the 
director you could never do a thing like that in hollywood 
but moving to california is not exactly his dream you dont 
have to work there you have to earn respect there

for the first time ever turkey is 
seeking an academy award nomination for foreign film choosing as 
its entry a stirring drama about the friendship between a female 
political prisoner and a 4yearold boy in prison with his mother 
director tunc basaran says it is a major reversal of government 
policy that will allow his film do not let them to shoot the 
kite to compete 
the history of the turkish movie industry goes back 75 
years the 52yearold filmmaker said in an interview and for 
the first time the government convened a jury to select turkeys 
entry they would always promise in the past but never did this 
more than bureaucratic inertia has been overcome with the choice 
of this movie turkish officials who in the past have censored 
works that exposed social or political ills in the country have 
paved the way to los angeles for a film that takes place in the 
womens wing of a high security prison 
the movie centers around the child baris who enters as a baby 
when his mother gets a jail term for a drug peddling offense he 
literally is growing up in jail the practice is common in turkey 
because there are no institutions to care for children of 
imprisoned parents 
the mother is in a ward with women imprisoned for petty crimes 
most of them are illiterate and unable to deal with the bright and 
curious child who is forever asking questions 
in the next ward are political prisoners all university 
students or graduates who take over the education of baris one of 
them inci becomes a special friend to the boy who is heartbroken 
when she is released 
the film is based on a novel by feride cicekoglu an architect 
imprisoned for four years after the 1980 military takeover for 
belonging to an outlawed leftist organization 
it is a real life story director basaran said the character 
inci is based on the author 
many books and several movies have emerged from the prison 
experiences of turkish artists and intellectuals put behind bars 
during the 198083 martial law crackdown on leftist and rightist 
terrorism 
cicekoglu who also wrote the screenplay and basaran have 
avoided cheap sentimentality and ideological messages nor have 
they attempted to support the thesis of the ruling generals that 
all the leftists incarcerated were bloodthirsty terrorists 
the female political prisoners are more peaceloving than the 
women convicted of petty crimes and often break up their fights 
the political prisoners show a strongly human and maternal side in 
their concern for baris who acts as a bridge between the two 
wards his innocent questions force adults to think over their own 
beliefs and ways of expressing them 
why are you carrying a gun he asks the soldier escorting 
his mother during a hospital visit what is a communist he 
asks inci using a word that would have been censored out of a 
movie in the past 
basaran said cicekoglus story could not be filmed without the 
right child actor ozan bilen who was actually 4 years old when 
the movie was shot 
the five nominations to be chosen from among 44 entries for the 
1990 best foreign film oscar will be announced feb 17 
basarans movie has already won a golden orange turkeys 
national equivalent of the oscar and is a boxoffice smash in 
istanbul against heavy competition from such foreign films as who 
framed roger rabbit

close your eyes and imagine a band like this on 
stage 
on the right stands cheerful heavyset al anderson a pink 
guitar is strapped around his neck but he could just as easily be 
carrying a clipboard and sending in plays to his quarterback or 
wearing an apron and weighing a package of fresh ground beef 
on the left is keyboard player terry adams attacking his 
instrument like a toddler making mudpies elbows legs and 
shoulders fly his eyes roll to the ceiling his face frozen in a 
silly grin the ivories seem in danger of coming loose and spilling 
over the floor 
joey spampinato the bassist is centerstage hes the romantic 
of the group a longhaired balladeer with a lazy smile and faraway 
stare the kind of guy who gets away with such corn as i love 
her she loves me people even ask for sheet music to play at 
weddings 
behind them sits drummer tom ardolino dark curly hair and beard 
to match the beat is steady but his head bobs and jerks as if 
attached to a spring like the souvenir dolls sold at baseball 
parks 
the music is clean fast loud and everyone shares vocals the 
songs recall the beatles the beach boys tv shows jazz blues and 
just about everything else the band members look like theyve 
never had more fun in all their lives 
meet the new rhythm and blues quartet known to qheads and 
others as nrbq 
adams who founded the group after meeting spampinato in miami 
in 1967 sums up their message dont roll the dice if you cant 
pay the price everythings possible everythings impossible 
aint no horse that cant be rode aint no man that cant be 
thowd 
for nonqheads adams meant this is a band that does what it 
wants no matter what the cost or lack of cost thats after more 
than 20 years in rock n roll hundreds of songs and millions of 
laughs all thats missing is a touch of gold 
a long very strange trip its been their devoted fans divided 
between stars keith richards elvis costello ray davies and 
plain old qheads one memorable stop came at new yorks fillmore 
east back in the early days 
they had this light show adams recalled and it went on 
top of the bands at the fillmore all the time we asked them to 
turn it off for our set and they got really upset and made it worse 
they were showing films over us which didnt fit with what we 
were doing i didnt think they had any respect for the music so 
while they were showing the films we stopped playing one at a 
time and sat down and watched the films 
that was a kind of turning point in the businees people said 
we were never going to make it because we did that 
but what does making it mean to nrbq making it means 
making music when theyre not playing or recording theyre 
thinking about it if they were worried about hit records could 
they possibly be having as much fun after all this time 
i remember friends starting when they hit 30 to say im 
turning 30 and im not making any money and im getting out 
adams said i thought how did you survive this long you 
werent making any money before either 
success for nrbq means no band member has ever had a regular 
job the only resume these guys have is a lengthy discography 
notably the 1978 release at yankee stadium and the current 
wild weekend their first studio record in six years 
the songs range from agonizing covers of gordon lightfoots 
the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald and the village peoples 
ymca to spampinatos beatleesque this love is true and 
adams little floater a love song about mans best friend his 
car 
the band plays in true rock n roll spirit that means have as 
much fun as you want but keep the rhythm going anything goes as 
long as you can dance to it you dont need sheet music to read 
between the lines 
you study the music get good at the instrument learn 
eveything you can and then youve got to throw that all out 
adams said you got to drop the academics you got to be able to 
get that part out of the way you got to start playing music for 
the musics sake rather than what youre going to get 
financially 
this is good music thats actually good for you adams insisted 
doubters are urged to try a simple test 
you ever see reports where they try music on plant life they 
played classical music for these plants and they did very well and 
they did rock music and some of them started shriveling adams 
said 
i always said what rock music play our music to the plants 
and they wont shrivel

at various times and to different degrees jim 
little was a good cop a bad cop a loving husband a marital 
louse a war hero and a harddrinking potsmoking religious 
fanatic 
he was a loner who often craved companionship usually female 
as a crack helicopter pilot he was a coldly efficient killer 
skimming across the jungles of vietnam or a brazen bandit swooping 
down on target banks in texas louisiana and nevada 
the quarry in a yearlong fbi manhunt jim little today is a 
convict 
in his book once a hero texas monthly press 1795 
authorjournalist howard swindle launches the saga of jim little 
with these lines 
before the sun would hit its zenith on february 15 1984 an 
icycold helicopter pilot and four uniformed men carrying automatic 
weapons would scare absolute hell out of the system 
bullseye 
what follows is a psychodrama that texas monthly press calls 
the true story of one mans tragic odyssey from vietnam to 
leavenworth 
it is the story of a heavily decorated but mentally confused war 
hero who returns from two tours in vietnam and serves with honor 
distinction and considerable controversy as an alaska state trooper 
little is fired rehired nd quits but not before winning 
alaskas medal of honor for risking his life to save his partner 
he then becomes one of historys most innovative bank robbers the 
first to use helicopters for the assault and getaway 
the decline and fall of a genuine american hero ends with little 
in a notoriously oppressive federal prison and locked away with a 
multiple copkiller in between the reader is introduced to a 
parade of weirdos including but not limited to littles airborne 
bank robbing buddies 
according to swindle the villain in this gripping story is not 
little nor is it drugs drink scarlet women religious fanaticism 
or even the mastermind of the daring and dazzling bank heists 
it is posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd a mental affliction 
only recently diagnosed and most often linked to vietnam combat 
an estimated 500000 vietnam veterans suffer from some form of 
the disorder which can be triggered by isolated sounds and sights 
many of the sufferers still live in the nightmares of scenes 
witnessed in the jungles of vietnam said swindle an assistant 
managing editor at the dallas morning news and himself a vietnam 
combat veteran 
it is the authors extensive research and reporting of this grim 
phenomenon that makes once a hero more than a compelling true 
crime story 
there also is an undercurrent of cruel irony in once a hero 
the author went to great lengths to examine and explain 
posttraumatic stress disorder and to demonstrate often painfully 
its timebomb effect on jim little 
yet after he was captured little refused to use posttraumatic 
stress disorder as a defense he pleaded guilty to bank robbery 
and a federal judge in texas sentenced him to 25 years in prison 
swindle points out that a government which little once served so 
vigorously seemed disinclined to recognize and respond to his 
plight or the plight of others like him 
prisons punish the manifestation of the act he observed 
they do not probe the mental process that motivated it 
despite his guilty plea little remains despondent and 
disillusioned 
am i bitter he wrote in one of many letters critical of a 
government he calls the beast wouldnt you be i went to vietnam 
twice and enforced the law in alaska the best i could and the 
beast betrayed me both times i fought back in the only way i knew 
how and the beast put me in prison 
yeah i guess you could say im bitter theres nothing left 
the beast has it all 
near the end of his book swindle writes 
until age 37 jim little was a starched creased example of 
public service and staunch defender of traditional american values 
for 12 years he had worn army green for four years he had worn 
trooper blue in both uniforms his colleagues held him as an 
example of excellence 
little has been incarcerated more than three years and no one 
has asked him why he inexplicably robbed a bank on a february 
morning in 1984

maureen lipman plays joyce grenfell 
who you ask if the play works says its star it shouldnt 
matter if these names mean anything or not 
you dont have to know either to enjoy both lipman said of 
her solo turn as british actress and revue artist joyce grenfell 
whom she plays in rejoyce at the long wharf theater in new 
haven conn through march 4 
thats going to be the issue really whether the show stands 
or falls on its own merits without preknowledge of the lady 
herself she said it doesnt matter whether audiences know 
me 
in britain they certainly do lipman is as much a household 
name as was the gawky angular grenfell whose films include the 
happiest days of your life 1950 and the belles of st 
trinians 1954 
rejoyce was one of londons most successful west end plays 
of the past few seasons cowritten by lipman and james 
rooseevans it began at a suburban theater south of london in 
february 1988 and opened on the west end that september it was 
brought back twice to meet demand and the 43yearold lipman says 
the show is with her for life 
i dont suppose ill ever stop doing it now the actress 
said over lunch at elstree studios 13 miles north of london where 
she is filming some television commercials for british telecom 
i dont like repeating myself but somehow i feel impassioned 
to take this show on the road said lipman who plans a tour of 
britain and australia following the long wharf run 
i dont think im ever going to get a better vehicle so why 
should i throw it away 
born a tailors daughter to a middleclass jewish family in 
northern england lipman acknowledges that her background could not 
be further removed from her subjects actresscomedian grenfell 
was a christian scientist and as a niece of the viscountess and 
member of parliament nancy astor moved in glittering circles 
but lipman says she and joyce grenfell nonetheless have their 
affinities i did always have a cartoonists eye and so did she 
its almost an inability to hear what people say because im so 
fascinated by the way they say it which is what she had 
she would much rather be the clown of the class as i did 
she had a very pretty and outgoing mother who was much more 
attractive than she was we share that lipman said of grenfell 
who died in 1979 of eye cancer at age 69 
rejoyce combines several of grenfells bestknown sketches 
a nursery school class a girls reunion a womens institute 
meeting with songs and occasional commentary 
but lipman said her show must not be seen as a piece of 
whimsy its very very delicate we have found the shape and 
its right 
the play is one of several activities that have kept the actress 
busy of late she starred on british television this fall in 
about face six original plays one of which was written by her 
husband jack rosenthal 
her british telecom tv commercials have made her britains most 
recognizable jewish mother in them a grayhaired dowdily dressed 
lipman plays the aging beattie whose one wish in life is that her 
son phone more frequently 
her theater credits range from londons best musical revival 
this decade leonard bernsteins wonderful town in 1986 to 
the maid in the 1971 production of long days journey into 
night with laurence olivier and constance cummings 
lipman has often visited the united states but has never before 
performed there and says she has no desire to be the latest briton 
to conquer broadway 
i dont think i have the driving ambition to conquer anything 
except myself she said wryly 
this is why in a way im glad im going there in a small 
theater and quietly and if they wish to come and see the show and 
discover it thats wonderful if they dont then its an 
experience and i come home and carry on doing what im doing

not long ago it looked as if home 
shopping network incs picture tube had gone kaput 
the television retailer was losing money for the first time a 
big lawsuit against gte corp boomeranged into a 100 million libel 
award for the telecommunications giant analysts and investors were 
ready to play taps for the company that had popularized zirconium 
cube jewelry peddled live on tv 
the tune has changed home shopping network is rebounding its 
stock has more than doubled since hitting a low of 3 in mid1989 
sales are setting records the gte issue was settled in november 
for 45 million in insurance 
what had been diagnosed as a fatal cash hemorrhage turned out to 
be just a neardeath experience that led to some serious rethinking 
by oncecocky hsn executives 
the one thing you can say about home shopping network is it 
takes a licking and keeps on ticking said peter grandich a 
securities analyst at affiliated financial management inc in 
howell nj after the gte award everyone thought the party was 
over 
the relatively painless resolution with gte was a fortuitous 
boost for the 4yearold company now leaner after shedding several 
unprofitable ventures to concentrate on tv sales operations 
but hsn no longer is the undisputed titan of the tv marketplace 
following the merger of two rivals it also is engrossed in another 
courtroom brawl this time with junkbond investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
that battle which could determine the value of 100 million 
worth of hsn securities issued in 1986 illustrates the companys 
crash landing after years of heady expansion 
in dispute are bonds that pay interest of 55 percent and are 
convertible to hsn stock they were an immediate hit reflecting 
investor confidence in the clearwater flabased company that had 
dazzled tv viewers with buying opportunities on items ranging from 
ersatz diamond rings to vitamin pills 
the price of hsn shares climbed to 47 making the convertible 
bonds even more attractive 
but rising costs and unprofitable diversification began to erode 
gains and the stock weakened it took a big beating after hsn 
became mired in the 15 billion suit against stamford connbased 
gte claiming an inadequate telephone system cost hsn 500 million 
in business in 1986 and 87 
when the date arrived to reset the bonds conversion rate in 
1987 hsn shares were worth a fraction of their earlier value 
drexel the bonds underwriter negotiated a conversion rate of 
705 a share down from the original 2850 
before the change could take effect however hsn sued in 
federal court in tampa claiming drexel artificially manipulated hsn 
stock down to get the lower conversion price on the bonds 
hsn claimed drexels motive was to reap huge profits by selling 
the bonds later if hsns stock price rose drexel is fighting the 
suit and a hearing is set for jan 17 in tampa federal court 
for its fiscal quarter ending nov 30 hsn reported sales up 27 
percent from a year earlier to a quarterly record 2552 million 
aftertax profit nearly doubled to more than 20 million 
to paraphrase twain reports of our death were greatly 
exaggerated said nando difilippo hsns general counsel 
hsn also plans to discontinue its financial service operations 
and scale down a pharmaceutical unit to include only its line of 
vitamins hsn now reaches about half the nations homes via cable 
or regular channels 
were going to stick with the business we do best video 
retailing said les wandler hsns chief financial officer 
when you have a gold mine you mine gold you dont go looking 
for other business we learned that 
the merger of two competitors cvn cos of minneapolis and qvc 
network of west chester pa could pose a strategic threat to hsn 
which tried unsuccessfully in 1987 to merge with cvn but hsn 
executives say they arent worried 
the more people get used to buying off television the better 
off everyone in the industry is wandler said 
larry gerbrandt a media analyst at paul kagen associates in 
carmel calif said the hsn stock could dip if bondholders 
exercise their stockconversion option once the drexel suit is 
resolved 
but he said assets such as its st petersburgbased studios and 
cable network give hsn intrinsic value 
i see hsn well north of 12 a share he said 
the gte suit was a misadventure that totally distracted home 
shopping network from its core business said gerbrandt 
theyve gotten a second chance

while attention focused on mikhail gorbachevs 
domestic problems and the us handcuffs on manuel noriega the 
business world witnessed its own intrigues which touched two 
troubled tycoons and products ranging from securities to mushroom 
soup 
canadian developer robert campeau lost more control of his 
debtridden retailing network this past week while halfway around 
the globe moneyhungry creditors circled australian entrepreneur 
alan bond like the toothy sharks of the great barrier reef 
at the same time leadership changes hit campbell soup co 
shearson lehman hutton inc and the fisherprice toymaking 
subsidiary of quaker oats co 
none of these developments were related but they showed how 
swiftly corporate crises can lead straight to the top just as the 
soviet unions ethnic unrest has raised speculation about the 
political future of gorbachev and panamas chaos resulted in the 
demise of dictator noriega 
for campeau the body blows have come one after another in the 
past several weeks hitting the toronto businessman at the height 
of the holiday shopping season on which his retailing chains depend 
for survival 
national bank of canada threw the latest punch seizing about 
half his voting shares in the company that bears campeaus name 
after he defaulted on loans for which hed pledged the shares as 
collateral 
the banks move intensifies pressure on campeau to restructure 
or sell the department stores he acquired during the 1980s which 
saddled his operations with nearly 8 billion in debt that the 
businesses are having trouble repaying the latest development also 
raised new doubt about the business future of campeau himself who 
has speculated in property for nearly half his 63 years 
in australia meanwhile the troubled empire of alan bond got 
more bad news when us investors joined the battle against his 
bond corp holdings ltd which owns businesses ranging from 
newspapers to beer breweries and is nearly 6 billion in debt bond 
won a reprieve friday from a move to liquidate his operations but 
he still must fend off angry creditors 
the senior management changes at campbell shearson and 
fisherprice came as little surprise because each companys 
performance has foundered 
but for campbell at least the appointment of new chief 
executive david johnson after a yearlong search could have little 
bearing on the companys future campbells future could depend on 
the outcome of infighting among the controlling dorrance family 
some of whom want to sell the business and have made campbell a 
takeover target 
shearson the wall street giant known for its solemn we 
believe tv commercials about investing raised questions about 
what its top leaders believe themselves jeffrey b lane the chief 
operating officer until he recently was demoted by chairman peter 
a cohen in a restructuring abruptly quit cohen had partly blamed 
shearsons slumping business on lane a longtime friend 
slumping business also felled fisherprices president r bruce 
sampsell who quit after a poor christmas sales performance for the 
toymaker parent company quaker oats named experienced manager paul 
e price to replace him 
in other business and economic news this past week 
while domestic automakers flaunted futuristic cars at auto 
shows in los angeles and detroit more bad news rolled in about 
lousy sales and the growing dominance of foreign rivals sales of 
north americanmade vehicles plunged in late december capping a 
year in which 1 million fewer cars were sold and the first car with 
a foreign name became the bestseller japans honda accord 
major retailers said prechristmas buying boosted sales about 
55 percent but the gains were uneven mainly benefiting apparel 
stores some analysts said the sales gains were eroded by 
aggressive discounting 
oil prices surged to the highest levels in four years because 
of cold weather and rising demand but the longterm outlook for 
the energy market remained unclear and some petroleum experts 
predicted prices would decline again soon lessening the impact on 
consumers 
orders to us factories for manufactured goods rose 24 
percent in november to their secondhighest level ever the 
commerce department reported separately the labor department said 
us unemployment held steady at 53 percent in december

the realestate scare that hit wall street in 
the waning weeks of 1989 now has prompted many analysts to 
reappraise their economic forecasts for the new year 
these observers have set out to look beyond the problems that 
might arise for builders brokers bankers and others whose 
business fortunes are directly linked to the health of the real 
estate market 
rather they are trying to sort out whether weak demand and 
prices for properties might depress consumer spending in general 
and create new difficulties for the federal reserve in its effort 
to avoid a recession 
many analysts maintain that recent talk of a developing 
downtrend in home prices across the country has been excessive if 
not utterly unwarranted 
home prices are down in some areas up in others and in 
general disappointing said john connolly an analyst at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
they are not crashing however despite the tales of woe that 
are frequently cited the notion of a housing market disaster 
doesnt square with the numbers 
richard hoey economist at drexel burnham lambert inc agrees 
that the worst case projections now made in some quarters for 
real estate are unlikely to come true 
but he argues that the mere idea of a letdown in the 
longbuoyant property market could still have an important 
emotional impact on the economy and contribute to a recession 
real estate is the core of middleclass net worth hoey 
observes negative sentiment on real estate prices can help 
depress consumer confidence and spending above and beyond any 
direct wealth effect from actual price changes 
when homeowners worry that their houses have become less readily 
saleable at or near presumed market value hoey says they may 
decide to spend less and save more of their incomes 
in this sense he says the psychic liquidity of housing 
wealth can drop more sharply than average house prices themselves 
and can rebound more rapidly than house prices themselves 
we would note that the weakest housing market the northeast 
is the center not only of the financial community but also of the 
national media thus it is quite possible that the news flow about 
real estate may be more negative than the reality on a nationwide 
basis 
negative media coverage of real estate price trends is likely 
to have only a limited impact on the wealth effect but could have a 
more substantial impact on the psychic liquidity effect 
such concerns about the business outlook made their presence 
felt in the stock markets first trading week of 1990 blunting a 
strong early rally right after new years 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials up 5695 points on 
tuesday showed a net gain for the week of just 2005 at 277325 
by fridays close 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index down 40 at 19464 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 340 at 45822 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 445 at 38245 
big board volume averaged 17248 million shares a day up from 
12133 million the week before 
whether real estate fears are exaggerated or not many analysts 
continue to assert that the situation isnt one to dismiss lightly 
since october 1987 americans have not quite viewed their 
paper wealth in quite the same way as before say the economists 
david a levy and s jay levy in their business advisory letter 
industry forecast 
with the boom in real estate prices over in the northeast and 
ending in the west home equity is no longer the rationale for 
spending freely that it once was 
even an optimist like connolly acknowledges notwithstanding 
the numbers real estate jitters will remain with us until the 
current economic picture clarifies

the national bank of canada said it had seized 
13 million shares of campeau corp after a company controlled by 
robert campeau defaulted on loans from the bank 
national bank president andre berard said thursday that campeau 
the chairman of the struggling retailing and developing firm had 
personally taken out the loan the amount of which was not 
revealed to purchase stock in campeau corp 
the bank said the 13 million shares which had been held by 
robert campeau represented 29 percentof the voting stock in 
campeau corp 
the banks decision to transfer the stock to its name had 
nothing to do with the recent deterioration in campeau corp 
finances berard said 
its a different matter altogetherl he said in a telephone 
interview 
a campeau corp spokeswoman carole sanger said in cincinnati 
it is a personal situation involving the bank and robert campeau 
and it would be inappropriate for the company to comment a 
reporter calling robert campeaus office in toronto was referred to 
ms sanger 
national bank said it had also seized about 60 million in 
debentures that it held as security and has taken steps to have 
transferred to its name another 4 million of campeau corps 
subordinate preference shares 
the bank said in a statement the shares were provided as 
collateral by robert campeau capital inc and a second company the 
latter firm had received the loan from the national bank 
national bank said its action aims at consolidating its 
position pending the outcome of restructuring negotiations for 
campeaus federated department stores inc and allied stores corp 
in the united states berard said the bank wanted the parties 
involved in those talks to be aware that it now owned the stock 
on tuesday a syndicate of banks led by citibank agreed not to 
declare federated and allied in technical default on 234 billion 
in loans 
the syndicate agreed not to press the point before jan 15 
giving campeau more time to show it is making progressin sorting 
out its financial problems the bankers previously said they might 
ask for full repayment of the loan a demand that presumably could 
have forced campeau to file for protection under us bankruptcy 
laws 
in exchange for the delay federated agreed to pay off a 250 
million bridge loan 
campeau corp which owns 258 stores went heavily into debt to 
buy federated for66 billion in 1988 and to take over allied at a 
cost of 34 billion in 1986 
the company announced in september it was having trouble making 
its interest payments besides the bank loans the company must pay 
interest on approximately 7 billion in highyield junk bonds it 
sold to finance the buyouts 
campeau is trying to sell its star bloomingdales department 
store chain 
national bank said the voting rights on the stock will now be 
exercised by national bank representatives the bank said 
berard said in a statement the bank does not intend to dispose 
of the campeau securities or acquire additional ones 
besides bloomingdales federateds divisions include abraham amp 
strauss burdines lazarus and richs allieds divisions are 
jordan marsh sterns maas jordan marsh florida and the bon

profits interest and fines to the securities and exchange 
commission

technology of carlstadt nj where business week is typeset he 
was suspended with pay after the sec charges were filed nov 30

lynch purchased securities of at least 22 companies he knew would 
be mentioned in upcoming editions of business week

price cuts an advertising blitz and special promotions helped 
the nations major retailers ring up moderate holiday sales gains 
but the results reported thursday by the nations major 
retailers confirmed that this past christmas was a time of 
conservative spending compared to christmas 1988 
general merchandise chains department stores and discounters 
posted december results that mostly met their expectations a 
fairly unexciting holiday season 
walter loeb of the investment firm morgan stanley amp co 
estimated that industrywide sales grew about 5 percent in december 
compared with the same month a year earlier down from a 75 
percentincrease in december 1988 
the performances differed depending on the type of retailer 
while various regional factors such as the weather also had an 
impact store executives generally expressed satisfaction with 
their results but some retailers said they didnt get as much as 
they had anticipated for christmas 
retailers sales are considered an indicator of total consumer 
spending which accounts for the bulk of the nations economic 
activity 
the holidays are a crucial time for retailers because half or 
more of their profits come from sales between thanksgiving and 
christmas worried about softness in consumer spending this past 
year retailers poured on the promotions many offering big 
prechristmas bargains 
if the retailer hadnt had the hook out he wouldnt have had 
any customers in the stores said loeb only halfjokingly 
still he said sales were a bit better than he had expected 
unusually cold weather in parts of the country spurred purchases of 
warm clothing and automotive products car batteries and snow tires 
were mentioned as fast sellers by some general merchandise chains 
but the items werent meant for under the christmas tree 
one of the most upbeat assessments came from kenneth a macke 
chairman and chief executive officer of dayton hudson corp who 
said solid gains at all divisions were more encouraging because 
they came on top of a strong december in 1988 dayton hudson 
owner of department stores plus the target discount chain reported 
an overall increase of 151 percent 
contrary to the industry trend macke said dayton hudson was 
slightly less promotional than the year before analysts said 
dayton hudson probably had a more profitable season than many other 
retailers that relied heavily on markdowns to attract customers 
price cutting is assumed to have taken a bite out of profits but 
earnings wont suffer too much thanks to tight inventory and other 
cost controls as well as fairly low inflation analysts said 
stores catering to clothing shoppers fared better than mass 
merchants that have much of their business devoted to expensive 
durable goods such as stereos televisions or home appliances 
the large specialty apparel retailer limited inc reported an 11 
percent gain in december sales but not counting stores opened in 
the past year limiteds sales rose a more moderate 5 percent 
retailers and industry analysts attach greater significance to 
tallies that exclude newly opened stores results at stores open at 
least a year called comparable or samestore sales are 
considered a better guide to a retailers health 
the biggest retailer in the country sears roebuck and co had 
a mediocre showing but it probably wasnt any worse than the 
companys internal forecasts a low pricing policy adopted last 
march to help sears compete with faster growing discount rivals has 
cut into sears results 
sears said its sales rose 36 percent in the five weeks ended 
december 30 to 4696 billion from 453 billion a year earlier 
but on a samestore basis sears eked out only a 16 percent gain 
among other retailers reporting thursday 
k mart corp which ranks second behind sears based on 1988 
annual revenue said its december sales rose 118 percent to 512 
billion from 458 billion a year earlier its samestore sales 
rose 31 percent 
fastgrowing walmart stores inc the third largest us 
retailer posted a 22 percent overall december sales gain to 363 
billion from the yearearliers 297 billion and an 8 percent 
samestore sales increase 
among stores that predominantly sell apparel 
jc penney co inc said its sales rose 97 percent to 272 
billion from 248 billion in december 1988 comparablestore sales 
were up 86 percent 
may department stores co said its sales rose 87 percent to 
180 billion from 165 billion and samestore sales were up 59 
percent 
carter hawley hale stores inc reported sales rose 35 percent 
to 5314 million from 5134 million the samestore gain was 3 
percent 
philip m hawley chairman and chief executive officer of the 
west coast retailer said sales were slightly below the planned 
amount due to unseasonable weather in parts of california and 
elsewhere

latedecembercar and truck sales dropped 105 
percent while for the first time a vehicle with a foreign 
nameplate has become the bestseller of the year in the united 
states 
americans bought more honda accords in 1989 than any other 
automobile according to figures released thursday 
obviously were real pleased about it said american honda 
motor co spokesman bob butorac about 60 percent of hondas 
accords sold in the united states were built at the companys plant 
in marysville ohio the rest were built in japan 
for the year us and foreign automakers said their us sales 
of cars and light trucks fell 55 percent from 1988 to 146 
million from 154 million 
americans bought 362707 accords last year topping the ford 
taurusat 348061 and the ford escort last years sales leader at 
333535 rounding out the top five were the chevrolet corsica and 
beretta which are variations on the same model at 326006 and the 
chevrolet cavalier at 295715 
were not talking about a car that is particularly stylish 
auto analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york said of the accord but its a supremely competent vehicle 
it does everything very well 
the eight major automakerswith us assembly plants said they 
sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 39798 
during dec 2131 compared with a rate of 44477 during the same 
time the year before 
the latedecember skid was softened by strong lighttruck sales 
by ford motor co and chrysler corp both of which placed 
incentives on their popular minivans in the middle of the month 
general motors corp didnt follow suit 
car sales tumbled 202 percent but truck sales bolstered by the 
minivan rebates and lowinterestloan deals soared 10 perent 
in mid and latedecember 1988 automakers loaded their dealers 
with lots of incentive cash to move cars off showroom floors by 
years end the selling rate for late december 1988 was the highest 
for that year 
despite the decline in yeartoyear comparisons between the 
periods phillippi said incentives work on everything the 
selling pace picked up nicely in the last 10 days 
in middecember 1989 chrysler slapped incentives on a variety 
of its vehicles including for the first time rebates on the 
dodge caravan and plymouth voyager minivans ford followed suit 
with incentives on its aerostar minivan 
chryslers light truck sales jumped 198 percent in late 
december while fords rose 161 percent meanwhile truck sales by 
gm which did not have new incentives in december slipped 16 
percent 
overall 1989 appeared to be the automakers seventhbest sales 
year pending release of heavytruck sales figures including 
heavytruck sales the automakers sold 158 million vehicles in 
1988 
final 1989 sales of the big rigs wont be completed until later 
but if past selling patterns hold automakers will wind up selling 
about 1 million fewer vehicles in 1989 than in 1988 the industrys 
best year was in 1986 when 163 million vehicles were sold 
its been two years since the industry peaked and that 
suggests that were closer to the trough said auto analyst doug 
laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york 
during the past several months auto executives and others have 
speculated that the first half of 1990 would be a weak period with 
a rebound coming in the second half of the year 
its already starting to be a rather lengthy downturn in 
autos laughlin said the duration of the industry downturn has 
been about 2 to 2 years 
the current slide in auto sales began in october 
chrysler which used incentives extensively in 1989 reported a 
21 percent decline in latedecember total vehicle sales compared 
with the same period in 1988 car sales at the nations no 3 
automaker were down 241 percent 
for all of 1989 chryslers combined car and truck saleswere 
down 71 percent compared with 1988 
ford said its cars and trucks sold at a pace 95 percent slower 
in late december than during the same period in 1988 car sales 
fell 224 percent fords vehicle sales in 1989 showed a 39 
percent decline compared with 1988 sales 
gm said its combined car and truck sales for latedecember last 
year came in 213 percent behind the swollen period in 1988 car 
sales were down 29 percent for 1989 gms car and light truck 
sales ran 67 percent behind the pace set in 1988

federal regulators have taken the first 
tentative step in what may be a long journey toward barring brokers 
from trading for themselves as well as their customers 
the practice is known as dual trading and while legal it has 
been controversial in the wake of fraud scandals at the nations 
two largest futures exchanges 
officials of those exchanges the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange immediately criticized the move 
thursday by the commodity futures trading commission 
the federal agency voted to consider placing some restrictions 
on dual trading on some contracts at the seven largest futures 
exchanges 
the fivemember cftc which oversees the futures industry voted 
unanimously to submit for public comment a proposed rule that would 
phase in some limits on dual trading over a 12month period 
critics claim dual trading creates the potential for conflicts 
of interest and possible fraud 
supporters however say dual trading helps keep markets liquid 
and thus less volatile when there are few customer orders 
not all futures exchanges would be affected by the proposed 
rules change which may not win final approval for as much as a 
year 
upon approval the initial dual trading restrictions will be 
reviewed and the cftc will consider extending or easing those 
limits said chairwoman wendy gramm 
we do intend to proceed carefully and thoughtfully in that 
process she said 
the cftc also voted unanimously to accept a staff recommendation 
that the agency keep closer tabs on broker associations to 
prevent possible trading abuses such as those undercovered in 
chicago last year 
in november the cftc released a study disputing the economic 
benefits of dual trading 
but commissioner robert davis who reluctantly agreed to submit 
the proposal for public comment as a way of obtaining more data 
expressed reservations about making a decision based on a single 
study 
before tampering with the formula other hypotheses must be 
tested other data must be analyzed and alternative explanations of 
the results must be considered he said 
legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending in 
both the house and senate 
the proposal would bar floor brokers from trading or placing 
futures or options orders for their own accounts while handling a 
customers order on the same day in the same commodity 
the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
which account for about 90 percent of the nations futures trading 
volume would each be required to impose dual trading restrictions 
on just one of their three most actively traded agricultural 
commodities and their singlemost active financial commodityn 
five other exchanges the new york mercantile exchange the 
commodity exchange inc the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange inc 
the midamerica commodity exchange and the new york cotton exchange 
would have to impose restrictions on only one of their two most 
active commodities 
and four smaller exchanges the kansas city board of trade 
minneapolis grain exchange new york futures exchange and the 
chicago rice and cotton exchange would be exempt from 
restrictions during the implementation period 
cbot president and chief executive thomas r donovan said 
there are futures exchanges developing all around the world and 
most allow dual trading if we cannot handle customer business 
because of illfounded restrictions on trading then we will lose 
that business to our foreign competitors 
added cbot chairman karsten mahlmann the cftcs proposal to 
ban dual trading flies in the face of the evidence of its own 
study which shows benefits from dual trading and which provides no 
evidence that dual trading imposes costs or harms customers 
on broker associations the cftc staff recommended adopting a 
rule defining the term and requiring exchanges to register the 
members of such associations 
the commissions division of trading and markets said 
registration of broker association members would allow exchanges to 
monitor their trading activity as a safeguard against abuses 
broker associations are formal or informal groups of futures 
traders formed to provide more capital to finance trades and more 
people to handle them 
supporters of broker associations claim they help service 
customer orders by increasing the capital of individual brokers and 
providing continuous service 
but the cftc staff found that broker associations may increase 
the potential for certain types of trading abuses 
the cftc study was an outgrowth of last years undercover 
investigation of trading at the two chicago exchanges that resulted 
in scores of indictments

an aggressive safetydefects program is essential to our 
safety mission said jerry r curry administrator of the agency 
but the center for auto safety a group founded by consumer 
advocate ralph nader accused the agency of reporting meaningless 
statistics to mask poor performance 
those are phony numbers said clarence ditlow the centers 
executive director what theyre doing is creating a smokescreen 
to conceal from the public that theyre not enforcing the mandatory 
recall law 
the center repeatedly has complained that under the reagan 
administration the agency abandoned investigations that should 
have produced recalls the agency said it pursued recalls when 
needed but discontinued probes when it was plain there was no 
widespread safety problem 
ditlow said the agency should not boast of influencing the 
highest percentage of recalls ever when the number of recalls was 
well below those of the late 1970s 
jeffrey miller deputy administrator of the agency said 
ditlows comments were patent nonsense 
miller acknowledged that recalls rose in the late 1970s and fell 
in the early 1980s but said both trends were largely the result of 
tire problems that were corrected there was a steadyupward trend 
in recalls in the late 1980s he said 
we have an active robust investigation which takes consumer 
complaints very seriously and looks at them and evaluates them all 
fairly miller said 
recalls ordered last year curry said included 17 million 
general motors vehicles to correct sticking throttles 14 million 
ford escortsto fix a problem with the drivers seat and 650000 
chrysler vehicles and 481000 escorts to prevent engine oil leaks 
also recalled were 500000 chrysler vehicles to fix 
frontsuspension corrosion and 408000 toyota camrys to repair 
jamming safety belts

the environmental protection agency has 
proposed regulations to reduce hydrocarbon releases from cars and 
trucks when gasoline evaporates 
proposed changes in how vehicle emission tests are to be run 
would require automakers to modify vehicle emission control 
equipment in a way that atmospheric hydrocarbon levles would fall 
about 5 percent the agency said thursday 
the modifications are said to be minor and should add only about 
10 to the cost of a car an amount that would be more than offset 
by better fuel economy according to the epa 
hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds released from motor 
vehicles react with the sun to form ozone when also combined with 
particulates in the air the result is the smog that plagues many 
of the nations urban centers 
the regulatory proposal announced thursday applies only to 
hydrocarbon releases from the normal evaporation of gasoline 
especiallyin hot weather both when a vehicle is running and when 
it is idle 
the proposal would require emissions testing procedures to be 
changed to assure that such evaporated fuel losses are better 
controlled especially during summer driving and after a vehicle 
has been idle for a day or more 
in some cases automakers are expected to equip vehicles with 
larger charcoal cannisters so emission control systems are not 
overloaded by gasoline vapors or make other changes to improve the 
systems ability to purge such vapors when a car is running 
officials said 
the new requirements when made final later this year will 
apply to all gasolinefueled passenger cars and trucks

the bush administration considered but 
rejected the idea of proposing new taxes on various materials in an 
effort to encourage recycling an administration official said 
the official who spoke thursday on condition that he not be 
named said the proposal had been given a good chance of becoming 
part of the presidents fiscal 1991 budget request to congress but 
that it was finally rejected by the office of management and budget 
omb director richard darman stripped the proposed tax along 
with other socalled user fees to avoid charges from 
congressional democrats that presidentbush was violating his 
nonewtaxes pledge the official said 
the proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper glass 
plastic and metals that were not recycled the environmental 
protection agency which favored the tax concept as a way of 
encouraging greater use of recycled materials by us industry 
wants to reduce the nations output of waste by 25 percentby 1992 
bush as part of his 1988 presidential campaign promised to 
make a national commitment to reduce waste by recycling and 
developing technology that produces less waste 
by making productsmade from virgin materials more expensive 
supporters of the tax had argued it would encourage businesses to 
use more recycled materials 
another revenue raiser rejected by the administration in recent 
days would have imposed a sales tax on offroad vehicles camping 
equipment motor homes and pleasure boats 
supporters of that rejected proposal wanted to have the new 
revenue earmarked for specific recreation and conservation programs 
on federal lands but it too fell victim to darmans concern that 
critics would charge the president with violating his pledge 
against new taxes 
the various decisions on spending and taxes are being made as 
the administration puts the finishing touches on a proposed 123 
trillion budget for the fiscal year beginning next october the 
budget will be sent to congress on jan 29

for mutual fund investors 1989 was a banner 
year for biotechnology and growth companies but a waste of time 
when it came to many bonds 
a tally of the best and worstperforming mutual funds released 
today by lipper analytical services inc says the alger small 
capital fund scored last years biggest gain 6508 percent 
the fund made money through a strategy of picking small 
companies that showed potential for rapid growth 
in the cellar was strategic goldminerals with a 1775 percent 
loss due largely to its investments in coal mines that went sour 
although most funds specializing in gold performed well for the 
year 
many of last years losers were concentrated in fixedincome 
investments particularly in highyield highrisk junk bonds or 
in the world income category which includes funds in overseas 
bonds denominated by fluctuating currencies 
among junk bond funds are the dean witter high yield fund which 
declined 1364 percent alliance bond high fund down 1294 
percent and american capital high yield down 1204 percent 
performance figures in lippers rankings of 1683 continuing 
funds for 1989 assume that investors reinvest all dividendsand 
capital gains distributions paid by the funds 
a michael lipper the firms president said 1989 was a 
surprisingly good year for stock funds even though the economym 
muddled along 
you had a nice recovery in 1988 after the 1987 stock market 
crash but you developed real strength in 1989 that wassomewhat 
surprising lipper said in an interview thursday if the gains 
had been half of what they were a number of people probably would 
have been happy 
equity fund gains averaged nearly 24 percent last year compared 
with 942 percent for fixedincome funds stocks also did well for 
the entire decade with equity funds gaining an average 322 percent 
although a number of individual funds sustained losses in 1989 
all of the 22 fund categories had a positive overall performance 
for the year with an average gain of 1848 percent according to 
lipper 
but the gap between the top and bottom performers was wide 
health and biotechnology funds were the leaders of 1989 with 
average gains of 435 percent while world income funds eked out a 
602 percent average gain 
lipper said the biotechnology and health industry was an area 
that continues to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the 
economy 
weve seen some mergers and new drugs during 1989 its a 
worldwide business he said 
rounding out the top five mutual funds were natural resources 
funds up 3213 percent utility funds 2896 percent growth 
funds 2544 percent and capital appreciation funds 2381 percent 
among the bottom five fixed income funds including junk bond 
funds gained an average 942 percent option income funds 1245 
percent and convertible securities funds and mixed income funds 
each up 1384 percent 
by comparison the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip 
stocks had a rate of return of 3164 percent and the sampp 500 index 
had a rate of return of 3224 percent for the year assuming 
dividend reinvestment

attorneys for admitted inside trader robert 
freeman are seeking to block the government from making public a 
sentencing recommendation that alleges a series of new and unproven 
fraudulent transactions 
the government also names several individualsin the memo who 
allegedly lied during the 2year grand jury investigation of the 
freeman case according to documents filed in manhattan federal 
court 
the dispute hinges on the disclosure of sensitive grand jury 
matters and has delayed sentencing of the former head of arbitrage 
at goldman sachs amp co arrested in 1987 in a highly publicized 
case that later fell flat 
the government contends that releasing the memo showsa broad 
range of questionable conduct by freeman that should be considered 
in sentencing freeman has admitted to one instance of insider 
trading 
in connection with his sentencing freeman loudly contends 
that this was the only occasion in which he engaged in insider 
trading assistant us attorney john mcenany wrote the 
government has evidence to the contrary which it believes the court 
should consider 
the issue marks another twist in a case that began with the 
touted february 1987 arrests of freeman and two others based on 
information linked to jailed inside trader ivan boesky 
government prosecutors boasted that initial charges were the 
tip of the iceberg but the indictments later were dropped and 
prosecutors last year abandoned an investigation of the two other 
wall street traders timothy tabor and richard wigton wigton even 
was handcuffed after his arrest 
the case now is widely viewed as the governments biggest 
embarrassment in the threeyear insider trading investigation begun 
by former us attorney rudolph giuliani 
in a draft of the sentencing memo given to defense lawyers 
prosecutors allege a series of insider trading transactions beyond 
the one freeman admitted attorneys paul curran and robert b fiske 
state in court documents 
the sentencing report has not been filed pending a ruling by 
us district judge pierre leval on whether it should be kept under 
seal or allowed into the public record 
the governments allegations are false and they unfairly 
implicate not only mr freeman but also other persons none of whom 
has been charged with respect to these allegations curran and 
fiske state in a motion seeking to seal the memo 
the government and the wall street journal have filed papers 
arguing that the sentencing document should be released 
freeman pleaded guilty last august to one count of mail fraud 
for using inside information in january 1986 to trade in connection 
with the proposed takeover of beatrice cos by the investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
he admitted receiving the information from former kidder 
peabody amp co investment banker martin a siegel who has pleaded 
guilty to two counts and is awaiting sentencing 
freemans lawyers contend thatonly material dealing with the 
beatrice transaction should be made public 
freeman is someone who cares about his reputation if he is 
seen as someone who has been trading with the abandon of an ivan 
boesky hell be unemployable said john c coffee jr a 
columbia university securities law professor 
in court papers filed last month attorneys for freeman charge 
that the sentencing report will tarnish mrn freemans already 
scarred reputation and cause serious injury to the reputation of 
others 
some individuals are branded as liars still others are 
accused of insider trading the lawyers state the stigma that 
the publication of such accusations would impose is irrevocable 
 
the sentencing memo reportedly cites about a dozen instances of 
uncharged insider trading by freeman including two named in his 
original indictment and includes the names of some who testified 
before the grand jury 
under existing case law grand jury secrecy protects defendants 
from disclosure of accusations that are not contained in an 
indictment returned by the panel which determines whether or what 
criminal charges can be filed 
in the freeman case the government acknowledges that a 
significant portion of the memo relies on grand jury matters 
but that no testimony is directly quoted and the information is 
merely summarized 
mcenany stated the government agreed only not to prosecute 
freeman for other matters uncovered in its investigation the 
supreme court has allowed sentencing judges to consider alleged 
conduct that a defendant has not been convicted of or admitted to 
freeman faces a maximum five years in prison and up to 19 
million in fines

the nations unemployment rate held steady at 
53 percent in december ending 1989 at about where it began 
despite weakerthanaverage job growth in the final month of the 
year the government said today 
the civilian jobless rate as measured by a household survey by 
the labor department was unchanged despite the gain of 142000 jobs 
in december a figure artificially bolstered by the return of 
55000 striking telephone workers in new york 
the survey of employers from which the job growth figure is 
derived is often considered a more reliable indicator of economic 
developments by analysts 
the unemployment rate began 1989 at 54 percent in january and 
since then has fluctuated in a narrow range within a tenth of a 
percentage point of 53 percent except for march when it dipped to 
a 15year low of 5 percent the average for the year was 53 
percent 
in fact the jobless rate remained markedly stable during the 
whole year of 1989 janet l norwood commissioner of labor 
statistics noted 
last month the labor department said the november unemployment 
rate was 54 percent but today it revised that figure down to 53 
percent 
the unemployment stall in 1989 was due primarily to a slowdown 
in the manufacturing sector which lost 25000 jobs in december 
bringing job losses since march to 195000 
overall job growth during the last six months of the year 
averaged around 160000 a month down sharply from the average 
270000 monthly gain during the previous 2 years 
the economy according to the household survey produced 17 
million new jobs during 1989 bringing the civilian workforce to 
1179 million that was down from job gains of 23 million in 1988 
economist michael k evans who heads a consulting firm in 
washington said the unemployment rate has remained stable because 
the total available labor force has been growing more slowly at the 
same time fewer new jobs are becoming available 
things are in balance its a pretty healthy situation he 
said 
more manufacturing layoffs are expected automakers have already 
announced plant shutdowns this month 
the average manufacturing work week held steady in december at 
407 hours as did overtime at 37 hours 
construction employers reported a seasonally adjusted 38000 
fewer jobs in december than a month earlier analysts are 
attributing the drop to the deep freeze that gripped most of the 
nation last month 
in contrast serviceproducing industries continued to 
demonstrate healthy gains adding 206000 jobs to bring growth for 
the year to 24 million 
transportation employers added 73000 jobs on a seasonally 
adjusted basis last month business services added 14000 health 
services 47000 government 34000 and finance insurance and 
real estate 13000 retail employment grew by 12000 fewer jobs 
than the normally expected seasonal gain 
mining industries which includes oil drilling lost 1000 jobs 
average hourly earnings posted a 06 percent rise in december to 
984 bringing the gain for the year to 41 percent that wasnt 
enough to keep up with consumer price inflation which has been 
running at about 45 percent 
the unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month 
were 
adult white men 39 percent the same as in november 
adult white women 41 percent up from 40 percent 
white teenagers 130 percent up from 129 percent 
all blacks 118 percent down from 119 percent 
adult black men 108 percent up from 106 percent 
adult black women 100 percent down from 102 percent 
black teenagers 307 percent down from 325 percent 
hispanics 85 percent up from 80 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the december 
jobless rate was 53 percent the same as november the rates were 
also the same as the civilian rate

a crippled iranian tanker that spilled 19 
million gallons of oil off the moroccan coast was turned away today 
by portugal the third country to refuse entry to the ship 
a portuguese navy patrol boat escorted the khark 5 away from the 
portuguese island of madeira after the tanker entered its 
territorial waters there the national news agency lusa said today 
the salvage company smit tak which is commanding the three tugs 
towing the khark 5 said it planned to take the tanker to the cape 
verde islands through more than 1200 miles of open seas cape 
verde is a former portuguese colony off the west african coast 
smit tak has been trying to find a safe haven for the khark 5 
since an explosion ripped through the ships hull dec 19 when it 
was 400 miles north of las palmas in spains canary islands 
morocco 400 miles west refused to let the tanker dock there 
and a 100squaremile oil slick threatened moroccos coastline 
pollution experts said thursday nearly all the oil had dissipated 
and that there was no danger of an environmental disaster 
at a weekly cabinet meeting today the spanish government 
confirmed an earlier decision to deny a request to tow the 
1837foot tanker to sheltered waters off the southern coast of 
tenerife in the canary islands 
smit tak said the tanker is no longer leaking oil but it wants 
to find a sheltered spot so it can unload the remaining 53 million 
gallons of crude oil and perform emergency repairs 
the essential thing is that the remaining oil be transferred 
in the high seas to another ship said spanish government 
spokeswoman rosa conde after todays cabinet meeting 
the government has offered all help within its power to the 
stricken ship as long as it remains outside spanish waters she 
said 
on thursday environmental experts said more than 90 percent of 
the oil that spilled into the sea had either evaporated dissolved 
in the sea been broken up in high waves or been dispersed by 
chemicals sprayed on the water to fight the slick 
the edge of the oil slick was 20 miles off the moroccan oyster 
farming town of oualidyia on thursday and sailors laid floating 
barriers to stop its advance 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said thursday that a 
storm ripped a hole in one of the tankers storage tanks causing 
the explosion that started the leak 
aqazadeh said reports of environmental damage caused by the 
spill were exaggerated and that the ship met all safety 
specifications 
the vessel built in 1975 was damaged at least three times in 
iraqi air strikes in the persian gulf during the iraniraq war the 
normal life span of a tanker of its size is 15 to 20 years

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange today went 
into their worst plunge since oct 16 on reports soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev canceled all foreign engagements to deal with 
domestic unrest 
the news braked a rapid fall in the value of the us dollar 
against the yen the dollar finished the day at 14415 yen down 
105 yen from thursdays close 
the hong kong stock exchange also closed sharply lower with the 
hang seng index the markets key indicator of blue chips falling 
2801 points to 283994 brokers attributed the losses to the news 
reports and to the drop on the tokyo market 
news reports that gorbachev canceled a meeting with british 
labor party leaders in moscow and postponed all other contacts with 
foreign politicians hit the tokyo market in early afternoon 
trading sending the 225issue nikkei average into a tailspin the 
leading market indicator closed at 3827476 down 43812 points 
or 11 percent from the day before 
it was the largest singleday loss on the tokyo stock exchange 
since a 647point plunge on oct 16 within the last hour of 
trading the decline had approached 600 points but late buying cut 
the loss 
to japan the worst thing that could happen to the world 
scenario would be for gorbachev to drop from sight said chris 
schreiber an investment analyst with new japan securities 
gorbachev is regarded in japan as the key to global stability 
he said 
trading houses were hardhit today because they had been 
recommended by brokers on the detente theme schreiber said 
citing a 5 percent loss for marubeni and an even larger drop for c 
itoh and co 
but he added that the market was already very touchy in view 
of difficulties that may lie ahead for the governing liberal 
democratic party following lower house elections expected on feb 
18 
the current market perception is that the ldp is going to 
just hold on to a majority he said but added that governing 
with a slimmer majority is expected to be difficult for the party

speed correction following several months of rapid gains on the 
tokyo market 
the dollar having opened sharply down at 14340 yen climbed 
during the morning to 14365 yen 
the dollar continued rising in the afternoon despite 
intervention by the bank of japan 
during the days trading the dollar moved between 1433514418 
yen 
naoki kiyohara chief of currency options at fuji bank 
attributed the dollars rise from its morning level to the news 
about gorbachev together with a tradingfloor rumor that prime 
minister toshiki kaifu was canceling his scheduled trip to eastern 
europe the rumor was denied by the foreign ministry but kiyohara 
said its effect was already felt in the market 
kiyohara said the bank of japan intervened several times in the 
afternoon in an attempt to drive the dollar below 144 yen but 
although many dealers were wary of interventionthe news about 
gorbachev was the most influential factor

stockmarket investors have wasted no time 
lately speculating on the potential benefits of growing 
international trade in an increasingly democratic world 
in recent weeks they have scrambled to buy shares of country 
funds investing in corners of the globe ranging from germany to 
chile to thailand 
as wall street closed the books on 1989 these funds clearly 
stamped themselves as the latest in a long line of hot financial 
properties that helped keep the bull market bubbling throughout the 
80s 
among the 42 issues listed on the new york stock exchange that 
doubled or more in price during 1989 no less than eight were 
closedend investment companies specializing in securities of a 
single country or region of the world 
spain fund which almost tripled asia pacific fund thai fund 
and the germany fund all made the top ten 
world events provided several sparks to keep enthusiasm for 
these stocks going the most obvious was the toppling of economic 
and political barriers in eastern europe after decades in the 
shadow of communism 
the apparent end to the cold war raised visions of vast new 
opportunities for the economies of western europe which had 
already begun to gear up for business and financial alliances set 
to take effect in 1992 
heiko thieme investment strategist for deutsche bank capital 
corp in new york projects that the opening up of eastern europe 
will in time raise the worlds total economic output by a full 
percentage point 
meanwhile investors searched frenetically elsewhere in the 
world for upwardly mobile nations that might be ready to follow in 
the footsteps of such modern success stories as japan 
even if that reasoning were as good as it sounded however many 
analysts who have watched the mania develop say buyers of country 
funds seem to be willing to pay almost any price to satisfy their 
appetites 
nearly all the country funds are closedend investment 
companies they operate in much the same manner as mutual funds 
except that their sponsors do not continuously buy and sell shares 
at the prevailing net asset value 
instead the funds have a fixed number of shares that trade on 
stock exchanges or in the overthecounter market just like other 
common stocks so the price they command is determined by market 
forces and can fluctuate above at a premium to or below at 
a discount to the net asset value 
some country funds notably in the far east have traded at 
premiums almost all of the time since their inception in part 
because foreigners have few or no other ways to participate in 
those countries markets 
lately however other country funds in europe and elsewhere 
that once traded at discounts also have soared past the pershare 
value of the investments they own 
in recent months the share prices of single country closedend 
funds have been bid up to unrealistic prices asserts norman 
tepper an analyst at the value line investment survey in the 
advisory services latest appraisal of the group 
however bright the funds longterm prospects most major 
world economies are either experiencing inflation rising interest 
rates or stagflation tepper says most will probably show 
slower economic growth in 1990 several stock markets look rather 
perilous 
as has been demonstrated in the past a popular closedend fund 
can keep trading at lofty premiums for a long time but analysts 
point out that a big premium in a fund is like a high 
priceearnings ratio for an industrial stock suggesting that 
expectations of many good things are already built into the price 
securities in that position are considered vulnerable to any 
disappointment that might arise from say greater weakness than 
expected in the pace of the world economy 
in teppers view the present circumstances certainly suggest 
that investors exercise caution with respect to foreign 
investments and in particular closedend funds with stakes in 
overseasbased companies

shortterm interest rates should drop in the 
coming months as the federal reserve board eases monetary policy 
further to forestall a recession most economists believe 
declining interest rates are good news to bondholders since it 
means the value or price of their fixedreturn investments should 
increase 
the fed has been easing interest rates since the middle of last 
year when it became apparent that the economy was slowing the 
policy is consistent with the feds aim of a soft landing for 
the economy which is in the eighth year of a recordbreaking 
expansion 
david m blitzer chief economist at standard amp poors corp is 
among the more pessimistic observers of the health of the economy 
the us is teetering on the edge of recession he wrote 
last week in a commentary 
he said that unless the fed eases rates further the economy 
will fall over that cliff 
interest rates for 1990 are relatively easy to forecast 
blitzer said either the fed will ease and rates will come down 
now or it will not ease there will be a recession and rates will 
come down later 
barclays de zoete wedd government securities inc predicts the 
government will report in late january a 1 percent decline in 
fourthquarter real gross national product that decline the 
investment house projects will prompt the fed to lower its 
discount rate for the first time since the central bank has been 
headed by alan greenspan who took charge in the summer of 1987 
the discount rate currently 7 percent is the interest the fed 
charges member banks for loans and it provides a floor for other 
interest rates such as bank loan rates 
previously the fed has worked to lower general interest rates 
by easing the federal funds rate the rate banks charge on 
overnight loans to each other however the financial consulting 
firm griggs amp santow inc cautions that while the gnp figure is an 
important gauge of the economy the fourthquarter figure may be 
distorted by the hurricanes the california earthquake and strikes 
during the three months 
moreover a quite weak gnp number can occur even as important 
areas of the economy are doing well the firm says thus even 
though gnp will be weak in the fourth quarter the consumer 
energy export investment and nondefense spending sectors are all 
likely to expand 
other experts are less certain of continued fed easing as long 
as core inflation remains at about 45 percent recent weather and 
accidentrelated increases in the prices of crude oil orange juice 
and other commodities fuel this belief in addition some 
economists say not all signs point to a recession 
barring either a severe financial disruption or the imminence 
of recession we foresee no quick exit from a stilltight monetary 
policy john lonski senior economist for moodys investors 
service inc wrote recently without pressing reasons to do 
otherwise the danger of higher inflation may have to pass before 
the fed relaxes its firm monetary grip 
many analysts say the predicted drop in interest rates will 
occur almost entirely among shortterm bonds yields on longterm 
issues such as the treasurys benchmark 30year bond should 
remain steady 
currently the 30year bond is trading at about 8percent the 
belief is that the yield will not decline due to the need to 
attract overseas investors in the bonds which help finance the 
federal deficit interest rates in west germany and japan have been 
rising increasing the competition for global investors funds 
in addition the rate may remain at its current level due to the 
45 percent core inflation which cuts the actual yield by more 
than half analysts say this factor may limit any drop in 
shortterm yields as well as bond investors continue to demand 
compensation for inflation 
with short term rates dropping more than longterm issues the 
treasury yield curve which plots the yield of treasury securities 
along a line measuring their maturity will steepen further in a 
positive direction this means investors will be rewarded ever more 
for tying up their money in longerterm bonds

bond corp holdings ltd won a reprieve 
friday as the western australian supreme court dismissed a 
government petition to liquidate the media brewing natural 
resources and property empire 
the court ruled against the state government insurance 
commission which had asked the court to appoint a provisional 
liquidator for bond corp on the grounds that the company 
controlled by financier alan bond was insolvent 
a judge ruled that the insurance commission had failed to prove 
its claim 
there is no evidence that the creditors of bond corp arent 
being paid the judge said 
the future of bond corp may be uncertain the judge said but a 
petition should not be filed on speculation that a company may 
possibly at some time in the future experience severe financial 
difficulties 
he also ruled that a nearly 668000 debt that was the basis of 
the petition was disputed by bond corp 
while bond corp succeeded on one front the company whose 
debts total 56 billion was still battling in another court to 
overturn an order to appoint receivers and managers to its 
australian brewing units 
the company is also trying to negotiate with us holders of 
debentures issued by its bond brewing holdings ltd unit who have 
demanded immediate repayment of 510 million of the securities and 
overdue inerest 
lawyers for the debenture holders said in court here friday they 
intend to support continuation of receivers appointed last month to 
operate bonds brewing units 
the court appointed the receivers at the request of a syndicate 
of international banks led by national australia bank ltd 
us noteholders were due to receive a 3219 million interest 
payment from bonds brewing arm but the courts froze that payment 
at the request of the bank syndicate bond brewing has asked the 
court to lift the banks stoppayment notice 
alan bond who controls about 58 percent of bond corp gained 
virtual hero status in australia when he won the 1983 americas cup 
yachting trophy the millionaire industrialist has been selling 
assets in recent months to reduce debt 
in its fiscal year ended june 30 bond corp lost 9802 million 
australian dollars the largest annual loss in australian corporate 
history 
bond corps g heileman brewing co unit in the united states 
so far is not involved in the receivership proceedings 
heileman spokesman bill eiler said in a telephone interview from 
pittsburgh thursday the us brewer has separate financing from 
bond corp and as a matter of policy does not comment on matters 
involving bond 
bond purchased la crosse wisbased heileman in 1987 for about 
13 billion and reportedly still owes about 850 million after 
selling the profitable heileman baking co and other heileman 
subsidiaries 
heileman officials said recently they have been meeting with 
creditors and reviewing alternatives aimed at favorably modifying 
heilemans existing debt structure 
separately adolph coors co the fourthlargest us brewing 
company acknowledged this week it has held talks with heileman for 
over a year about the possible purchase of the wisconsin brewer

cold weather in the united states will pinch 
motorists in britain where gasoline prices are going up by 55 
pence or about 9 cents per imperial gallon

topgrade leaded gasoline and other companies were expected to 
follow suit 
the increase raised the price of gasoline to the equivalent of 
213 per us gallon or 415 pence per liter an imperial gallon 
is the equivalent of about 1 and onefifth us gallons 
esso said one factor in the price increase was the cold weather 
in the united states which has driven up prices of gas oils by 60

phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
the central figure in a 2 billion savings and loan scandal 
acknowledged today that bookkeeping by his thrift institution hid 
the true buyer in a major real estate deal 
but keating chairman of american continental corp parent 
company of lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
said the bookkeeping was a proper part of a land syndication deal 
and that government examiners should not have cared about the 
identity of the true buyer 
us district judge stanley sporkin who is hearing evidence in 
keatings suit to overturn the government seizure of lincoln last 
april reacted skeptically asking how is it you can manage 
billiondollar businesses and have transactions where the paperwork 
did not reflect what took place 
when you run a bank or a savings and loan you have the 
highest responsibility of anyone because youre not dealing just 
with stockholders youre dealing with peoples savings sporkin 
told keating the only way regulators can ensure that an 
institution is being run properly is if the books and records 
accurately reflect transactions 
in 1987 lincoln sold 1000 acres for which it had paid 3 
million to westcontinental mortgage co for 14 million however 
government regulators maintain that westcontinental was just a 
straw buyer for arizona developer and stockbroker ernest c garcia 
they say the land transaction was improperly linked with another 
transaction between lincoln and garcia on the same day 
keating told the judge i cant believe that anyone was 
innocent of the fact that the deal was being made with garcia 
everybody who was there and present at that time including the 
government examiners knew what we were doing 
however in response to a later question from his own attorney 
keating acknowledged that he did not know whether his own auditors 
knew that garcia was the buyer 
and kevin oconnell a supervisory official with the federal 
office of thrift supervision told reporters after keatings 
testimony there is nothing in the record that we were ever 
advised that garcia was the real buyer 
on thursday keating broke his selfimposed silence with more 
than an hour of testimony in which he described how he used lincoln 
to finance massive residential projects in the phoenix area 
keating has had little to say in public since september when 
government regulators filed a 11 billion fraud and racketeering 
civil suit charging he operated lincoln for his own and his 
familys benefit a grand jury in los angeles is examining possible 
criminal charges against keating 
the government seized lincoln in april claiming it was 
operating in an unsafe and unsound manner 
in november keating asserted his constitutional protection 
against selfincrimination and refused to testify before a house 
committee investigating the failure 
but keating sought the court action and in response to the 
judges questions he readily described his disappointment when the 
seizure of lincoln blocked the completion of a large residential 
project west of phoenix 
the saddest thing in my life is that we were brought to this 
pass he said 
keating also is at the center of a senate ethics committee 
investigation examining the actions of five senators who accepted 
more than 13 million in contributions from the financier and 
later met on his behalf with federal regulators 
in thursdays hearing government investigators focused on a 
stock transaction with garcia which denied up to 12 million in 
profits to a lincoln subsidiary and instead benefited american 
continental which provided keating and his family with millions of 
dollars in salaries and benefits 
the lincoln subsidiary sold 1 million of memorex common stock 
to garcia the subsidiary retained an option to repurchase the 
shares for 425 million should their value skyrocket 
four months later in late october 1987 american continental 
repurchased the stock from garcia for 2 million and the 
subsidiary headed by keatings son charles h keating iii waived 
its option 
later in march and april 1988 american continental sold the 
stock for 133 million because it waived its option the lincoln 
subsidiary didnt get any of the profits which would have offset 
taxpayer losses in the sampls later failure 
the memorex transaction is one of four deals the government has 
cited as examples of unsafe and unsound practices that 
justified its takeover of lincoln 
the elder keating testified he approved the decision for 
american continental to buy back the memorex stock from garcia 
but he said i dont believe that i made the decision where to 
put it i dont know who made the decision on waiving the 
lincolns buyback option 
he said he assumed that was done because federal sampl regulators 
were pressing lincoln to get out of stock market investments 
however sporkin said i cant see the regulators objecting 
to retaining the memorex option which could only benefit lincoln

a federal grand jury has added three 
charges against a former usx corp official in an investigation of 
pensions the company awarded to union negotiators in 1983 
james bruce johnston indicted on one felony count last month 
now faces four charges and may stand trial with usx and two 
birmingham union leaders in march 
johnston said in a statement that the new indictment returned 
thursday and made public today is outrageous 
the charges against johnston usx and thermon phillips and eb 
rich of the united steelworkers of america stem from a federal 
investigation of the negotiations leading to a 1983 union contract 
for usxs fairfield works at birmingham 
the indictments alleged that as part of the negotiations the 
company agreed to secretly set up pensions for rich phillips and 
four other union negotiators although the six were not eligible 
for the benefits in return the grand jury alleged rich and 
phillips agreed to make concessions in the fairfield works contract 
johnston then a usx laborrelations executive played a key 
role in usxs change of its pensionplan rules to include the union 
negotiators 
thursdays indictment charged johnston of mcmurray pa with 
conspiracy causing usx to make the pension payments to phillips 
and rich and causing the companys pension fund to fail to inform 
its participants of the rule change the grand jury had indicted 
johnston on the latter charge two weeks ago 
in a court document assistant us attorney michael rasmussen 
reported the government would seek to combine johnstons case with 
that of the company and union leaders who face trial march 5 
johnston if convicted on all four counts could face a maximum 
penalty of 20 years in prison and a 11 million fine said us 
attorney frank w donaldson 
johnston repeated a statement he issued last month in which he 
defended his actions and those of the company in granting the 
pensions he said the union had requested the rule change for 
years other large companies had similar rules and the change was 
based in part on a written legal opinion of the us department of 
labor 
the company rescinded the change in 1987 after learning of 
recent court decisions indicating it was illegal johnston said 
fairfield employees had sued the company and the union leaders 
claiming collusion in the granting of the pensions and seeking the 
voiding of the 1983 agreement which cut wages and benefits in 
return for the reopening of the plant that lawsuit is on hold in 
birmingham federal court pending the resolution of the criminal 
charges 
in the news release johnstons lawyer stanley s arkin of new 
york city said the charges result from the economic frustrations 
of some former unionrepresented employees of usx corporation and 
is no more and no less than a classic example of translating 
dissatisfaction into scapegoating

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower this morning on the chicago board of trade following a weekly 
agriculture department report showing relatively light export sales 
of corn and soybeans 
the early declines also reflected followthrough selling from 
thursdays weaker close in the soybean market which fell sharply 
late in the day when commercial players became heavy sellers 
yesterdays session was really disappointing said analyst 
joel karlin of research department inc in chicago we had a 
perfect environment for these things to rally and they couldnt 
rally 
an overnight increase in farmer sales of corn and soybeans added 
to the selling pressure this morniing 
karlin predicted the losses would be offset by buying later in 
the session as traders even up their positions ahead of the weekend 
in early trading wheat futures prices were cent to 1 cent 
lower with the contract for delivery in march at 408 a bushel 
corn futures were cent to 1 cents lower with march at 237 a

a cleanair bill pending in the senate would 
force virtually every coke plant in the nation to close 
endangering the domestic steel industry a usx corp official said 
if this legislation goes through the way it is now being 
shaped in the senate theres a good chance it will signal the end 
of cokeoven operations in the nation said philip x 
masciantonio vice president of environmental affairs for the uss 
division of usx 
if we cant make coke here we dont have a steel industry 
he told the pittsburgh press on thursday coke is a primary 
ingredient for making steel 
the toxic pollution provisions of senate bill 1630 passed last 
month by the environmental and public works committee would submit 
coke plants to strict new emissions standards and overhaul the 
clean air act in the areas of acid rain and urban smog 
environmentalists give varyng assessments of the bill 
anthony picadio a lawyer for the group against smog and 
pollution a pittsburgh environmental group that has sparred with 
usx for 20 years said he opposes the bill because coke plants 
could not meet its stringent healthprotection standard he said 
the bill would never be enforced 
but lawyers with the natural resources defense council a 
washingtonbased environmental group said the bill provides 
exemptions if pollutioncontrol technology cannot achieve the 
standards as a result theres no reason to worry that wholesale 
plant closings would occur they said 
i think its part of a general campaign by us industry to 
paint this legislation as extreme said richard ayres a senior 
attorney with the defense council 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has said the 
bill will be the first one considered when senators return jan 23 
from their winter recess 
about 40 plants in the united states bake coal in ovens to 
produce coke usxs clairton works a sprawling network of ovens 
and smokestacks along the monongahela river at clairton is the 
largest coke plant in the nation 
the senate bill would require each coke plant to gradually 
reduce air emissions to the point that emissions would pose no more 
than a one in 1 million risk of cancer to a person living downwind 
all his life masciantonio said 
an environmental protection agency analysis shows that coke 
plants pose among the highest cancer risks of all us industrial 
plants for example oven emissions from the clairton plant pose a 
cancer risk of one in 130 in the most extreme hypothetical case 
masciantonio said 
a 10000fold reduction in emissions would be needed to achieve 
the bills goal and thats not possible with todays technology 
he said

by one reckoning the states of new york and 
connecticut dropped into recession in december joining 27 other 
states that earlier had descended to that level 
those 29 states representing 373 percent of the 899 million 
households in america soon could be joined by three or four 
borderline states should that happen it would bring the total 
percentage of households to more than 50 
these are not official government estimates but the result of 
detailed telephone calls to 3948 households during december by 
sindlinger amp co of wallingford penn a pioneer in consumer and 
economic studies 
decades of experience have shown said albert sindlinger 
founder and chairman that the point at which the survey tops 50 
percent of households will later be recognized officially as the 
time when recession began 
that means waiting eight months historically a national 
recession is declared after two consecutive quarters of shrinking 
gross national product then it takes two more months for 
statistical analysis and confirmation 
for this reason it is often said that economists are the last to 
know about a recession that most people sense a recession long 
before it is officially confirmed based on their own economic 
experience 
by sindlingers calculations just two states and 24 percent of 
households were in recession last january by june the figures had 
risen to 18 states and 159 percent of households and by november 
to 27 states and 283 percent 
the percentage of households took a big jump when connecticut 
and new york joined the recession states in december and that 
percentage could take an even bigger jump to more than 50 if 
borderline states slump just slightly 
those four states new jersey texas pennsylvania and north 
carolina plus the district of columbia account for 179 percent 
of households in each of these states less than 51 percent of 
households responded positively 
the greatest strenghth of all was concentrated in what used to 
be called the midwest rust belt in ohio indiana michigan 
illinois and wisconsin but sindlinger says they too could be 
endangered by auto industry layoffs 
utah washington and delaware were among stronger states rated 
just above borderline were minnesota oregon california nevada 
florida virginia and maryland all others alaska and hawaii 
excluded were in recession 
sindlingers definition of recession is based on answers to four 
questions put to the head of each household 
1 in your geographical area will economic conditions be better 
worse or the same next june than they are now 
2 in your place of employment do you expect there will be more 
the same or fewer jobs 
3 in your household do you expect higher combined income 
lower the same 
4 compared to last june is your household income now higher 
the same or lower 
when the respondent reports at least one negative answer the 
household is said to have negative household liquidity 
suggesting a curtailment of consumer spending and postponement of 
discretionary spending or investing 
when a respondent replies positively or neutrally it means the 
household is likely to continue spending and borrowing willingly 
and freely at a level dictated by current income and borrowing 
capacity 
albert sindlinger doesnt claim we are now in a recession but 
he will make that claim if more than 50 percent of respondents give 
at least one negative answer during this month 
it isnt the first time he has been ready to make such a 
declaration his research showed 31 states in recession in 1986 
but the total of households involved amounted to just 495 percent 
or just shy of a majority 
his research at that time did point out conclusively however 
that a nation as large as the united states can go through regional 
or industry recessions that stop short of becoming national 
economic phenomena 
in terms of geographic size most of america was indeed in 
recession in 1986 but the national figures were skewed by 
relatively strong economies in california nevada new mexico and 
in much of the east coast and michigan 
government statistics later confirmed the sindlinger 
measurements and says octogenarian albert sindlinger theyll do 
it again sometime in late summer the grassroots he said know the 
story before the economists

the wheat market got a late boost from news that china was 
bidding for 300000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices

grain exports report issued late thursday which showed relatively 
light shipments of us grains last week

an alaskan telephone company friday received 
final federal approval for what is believed to be the first direct 
telephone link between alaska and the soviet union 
the federal communications commission said alascom may establish 
as many as 12 twoway uhf radiophone circuits between gambell 
alaska and provideniya magadan the soviet union 
the service began in august after federal authorities gave 
alascom verbal approval to proceed pending final authorization 
according to alascoms washington attorney charles naftalin 
he said several circuits were operating smoothly except for 
occasional technical difficulties on the soviet end 
gambell which is on st lawrence island is only about 62 miles 
from magadan across the bering strait but prior to this new 
service telephone calls between alaska and the soviet far east 
were routed through thousands of miles of land and undersea phone 
lines or satellite relays 
naftalin said it was the first terrestrial link ever between 
the us and soviet union but at this point its only for 
alaskans 
the transmitter at gambell is linked to a satellite ground 
station that can relay telephone signals to an alascom receiving 
station near fairbanks 
but naftalin said its not configured yet to allow both 
nations to generally call back and forth 
in seeking federal permission alascom said a direct link is 
important in light of the strong community of interest between 
alaskans and the soviet far east including close family ties among 
native populations the fcc said 
the commission in finding the new service in the public 
interest and convenience noted that alascoms proposal was 
supported by the state department contingent upon a finding that 
there will be no transfer of equipment that may be used militarily 
alascom will own and supply all transmitting and receiving 
equipment including the equipment installed on the soviet end the 
fcc said 
the fcc previously ruled that alascom could use radio 
frequencies generally reserved for cellular phone services 
the new service will include messaging private line and data 
communications

european community officials may meet 
soon to mull additional aid to romania and to seek normal 
diplomatic relations with that country now that dictator nicolae 
ceausescu has fallen ec officials said friday 
a paper by the european commission the communitys executive 
body also urged the community to financially support economic 
reform efforts in the east and reach trade agreements with those 
countries 
there is a common interest on the part of the community its 
neighbors and all states sharing its fundamental values in ensuring 
that reform in east europe does not founder the paper read 
the paper presented thursday at a meeting of top commission 
officials said a meeting could be held soon to examine romanias 
need for additional assistance from the 12nation trading bloc 
also known as the common market 
in the course of these discussions it will be pointed out to 
the romanian side that the time has come to establish normal 
diplomatic relations with the community according to the 
document 
the paper also stated the common market should be prepared to 
restart negotiations which have been stalled since 1987 on a 
trade and economic cooperation agreement with romania 
the two sides arranged a limited trade pact in industrial 
products in 1980 the community agreed in 1986 to discuss extending 
the arrangement to agricultural products and economic cooperation 
but no serious negotiations were held 
the community has negotiated four tradeexpanding agreements 
with eastern european countries since it established formal ties in 
june 1988 with the socialist economic bloc known as the council 
for mutual economic assistance or comecon 
the common market has wideranging trade and economic 
cooperation accords with poland hungary and the soviet union and a 
smaller pact with czechoslovakia 
the commission document also said the community was close to a 
pact with bulgaria it also said new negotiations with east germany 
should end in an agreement within the first half of the year and 
that informal contacts have been made with czechoslovakia to 
discuss extending its arrangement to trade and economic cooperation 
the paper reflected the communitys growing interest in 
developing strong ties with the emerging democracies in eastern 
europe it has led an effort by two dozen western nations to 
fashion an economic aid program to encourage reforms in hungary and 
poland 
the pace of change in east europe the expectations of the 
peoples concerned and of their governments as well as the 
communitys own interests in the political and economic future of 
europe now require the community to take further initiatives the 
paper read 
the paper said ireland which currently holds the communitys 
rotating presidency was considering calling a special meeting this 
month of community foreign ministers to discuss further aid to 
romania and other topics but a spokesman for the presidency later 
issued a statement saying there were no immediate plans for a 
special session the foreign ministers already are scheduled to 
meet in early february 
in a separate document the commission said it will provide a 
total of 77 million in emergency aid including food and medical 
supplies over the next three months to romania it said it has 
sent at least 12 million worth of help since late december

the maine attorney general asked a state 
judge on friday to block georgiapacific corps 38 billion bid 
to take over great northern nekoosa corp on antitrust grounds 
the state said in a lawsuit filed in superior court that a 
successful takeover of great northern by georgiapacific would 
substantially lessen competition in several portions of the 
pulpwood industry in maine particularly hardwood pulpwood 
in response georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said 
in a statement from atlanta that the lawsuit was without merit 
hahn promised a vigorous defense and predicted georgiapacific 
would win 
we do not believe our acquisition of great northern violates 
antitrust laws in maine or anywhere else hahn said 
the suit also said an acquisition by georgiapacific similarly 
could harm the real estate market by reducing competition in the 
sale of remote lakeshore property of significant recreational and 
scenic value 
the primary concern underlying the states case is that 
georgiapacifics acquisition will thwart great northerns ongoing 
development of a major worldclass pulp mill in millinocket 
attorney general james e tierney said in a prepared statement 
great northerns mill will be in operation by 1995 however 
that mill and the increased competitive activity which it will 
bring to northern maines forest products industry will be lost if 
this acquisition is completed tierney said 
by acquiring great northerns mills and land in maine tierney 
said georgiapacific would control too much power in the market 
for the purchase of wood 
georgiapacifics high market share will allow it to suppress 
the price paid to landowners and contractors below competitive 
levels he said 
georgiapacific disputed those claims noting that the federal 
government had already looked into the proposed merger but found no 
potential antitrust problems 
not only are the charges without merit but in large part 
duplicate the exhaustive antitrust examinations already completed 
by the federal trade commission hahn said we are confident 
that georgiapacific will prevail on all counts 
great northern applauded the states challenge to the merger 
attempt 
we feel that the attorney generals action reflects our view 
that it would be illegal great northern spokesman stephen m 
hill said from his office in norwalk conn great northern has a 
separate lawsuit in federal court in connecticut that challenges 
the merger attempt on antitrust grounds 
on thursday great northern asked us district judge gene 
carter in portland to issue a preliminary injunction halting 
georgiapacifics takeover attempt as well as its attempt to have 
great northerns board ousted 
great northern has set march 2 as the date of a special 
shareholders meeting to decide whether the companys present board 
of directors should be ousted 
in a separate meeting on march 20 great northern shareholders 
are scheduled to decide whether to exercise socalled poison 
pill provisions to avoid the takeover

the overheated fuel oil and orange juice futures markets showed 
signs of cooling but commodity bulls quickly found another pasture 
the hog futures pit at the chicago mercantile exchange 
pork futures prices shot up late in the week following a 
government report that showed a smaller hog supply than most 
traders had expected 
the report was the latest in a series of bullish fundamental 
factors that have kept hog futures prices moving mainly upward 
since late summer 
hogs for february delivery settled friday at 5095 cents a pound 
compared with 4870 cents a week earlier and about 43 cents at the 
end of august 
the gains came in reaction to the agriculture departments 
quarterly hogsandpigs inventory which showed a 3 percent drop in 
the national herd size from the end of 1988 to the end of 1989 
the report also indicated that springtime farrowing intentions 
a measure of expected herd expansion were down 6 percent from a 
year ago 
the numbers surprised market analysts whose observations of 
slaughter rates relative to the september inventory report had led 
them to expect little change in the endoftheyear tally 
the new numbers partly reflected a sharp downward revision in 
the september inventory number some market analysts were incensed 
by the change contending the usdas quarterly inventory numbers 
are too frequently out of whack with reality 
but the numbers cant be ignored by the farmers meatpackers 
food processors and traders who plan their livelihoods based in

stock prices in the far east fell sharply friday on the news 
that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev had canceled foreign 
engagements to deal with domestic worries but the jitters were 
less severe in other world markets 
in tokyo the 225share nikkei index tumbled 600 points before 
recovering to finish 43812 points lower at 3827476 the decline 
measured 11 percent decline and was the worst showing since oct 
16 when the key index lost 647 points 
the highflying japanese market which had chalked up several 
record highs in the final days of 1989 was ripe for a big selloff 
according to some experts 
but the sharp reaction to the soviet report underscored japanese 
investors attention to the situation in eastern europe and 
gorbachevs key role in establishing stability in the region 
to japan the worst thing that could happen to the world 
scenario would be for gorbachev to drop from sight said chris 
schreiber an investment analyst with new japan securities in tokyo 
the hong kong stock exchange also closed sharply lower with the 
hang seng index falling 2801 points to 283994 brokers there 
also attributed the losses to reports that gorbachev canceled a 
meeting with british labor party leaders in moscow and postponed 
all other contacts with foreign politicians 
it created a public embarrassment and a setback for him 
said robert brusca chief economist for nikko securities co 
international inc in new york gorbachevs move prompted traders 
to speculate that the problems in the soviet union must be pretty 
bad brusca said 
but the response in other major world markets was more tempered 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials lost 2283 
points to close at 277325 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100 share index 
lost 71 points or 03 percent to close at 24445 in frankfurt 
the dax index fell 1588 points to finish at 182000 but well up 
from the days low of 180435 
analysts said that hardest hit among tokyo stocks were those of 
japanese trading houses which had been recommended by brokers 
based on the detente theme marubeni shares lost 5 percent and 
c itoh and co suffered an even greater decline 
one of the big themes in japan is that the greatest 
opportunites are going to be in russia brusca said as you set 
that back you set all the investment strategies everyone has been

american express co said friday it will receive 
a 200 million cash infusion from nippon life insurance co 
strengthening an alliance between the two financial services giants 
that began more than two years ago 
under terms of their agreement nippon will purchase american 
express exchangeable preferred shares which can be converted at 
any time to american express common stock at a share price of 
4250 
should nippon exercise those rights as well as a warrant issued 
in 1987 allowing it to purchase 2 million american express shares 
at 50 apiece the japanese insurance giant would have a 16 
percent stake in american express according to american express 
spokesman matthew stover 
on the new york stock exchange american express fell 37 cents 
to close at 3450 a share the stocks 52week high is 3937 a 
share 
nippon and american express forged an alliance in may 1987 when 
nippon purchased a 13 percent stake in shearson lehman hutton inc 
the brokerage firm controlled by american express 
shearson wall streets secondlargest brokerage has suffered 
recently from weak profits and is in the process of a 900 million 
recapitalization program spearheaded by american express the 
restructuring unveiled last month followed announcements that 
shearson would lay off hundreds of employees and make deep cuts in 
stockbroker commissions 
american express officials were quick to point out that nippons 
current investment plans have nothing to do with shearson 
the timing was coincidental stover said we have a 
relationship with nippon weve done a lot of things with them 
they have expressed an interest in investing in american express 
and now theyre doing it 
stover called the investment a reflection of the close 
cooperation between the two companies 
japanese firms have had a longstanding interest in investing in 
american financial companies in 1986 sumitomo bank ltd invested 
about 500 million in goldman sachs amp co in return for a 
nonvoting stake in the firm 
little more than a year later yasuda mutual life insurance co 
paid 300 million for an 18 percent voting stake in painewebber 
group inc and in 1988 japans largest brokerage nomura securities 
co acquired a 20 percent stake in the takeover boutique 
wasserstein perella amp co for 100 million 
howard clark jr american expresss chief financial officer 
said the deal adds 200 million to our equity base broadens and 
deepens our existing relationship with nippon life and fits in with 
our goal to expand our strategic global alliances 
american express reported net income of 8998 million or 209 
a share for the nine months ended sept 30 up 114 percent from 
8075 million or 189 a share a year earlier revenue rose 24

the dollar staged a turnaround friday closing 
mostly higher in domestic dealings after taking a sharp hit in 
overseas markets that were focusing on events in eastern europe 
gold prices soared by as much as 9 an ounce on the commodity 
exchange in new york gold bullion for current delivery jumped 
770 to settle at 40630 a troy ounce republic national bank in 
new york quoted a late bid for gold at 40625 an ounce up 750 
from thursdays late bid 
news that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev canceled january 
appointments with foreign officials so he could deal with domestic 
problems sparked the hike in gold prices but sent stock prices 
skidding and frightened currency markets worldwide 
so much depends on him keeping peace in the eastern bloc and 
to give enough room for progress to continue said jack barbanel 
managing director of first global managers in princeton nj 
while foreign markets focused on gorbachevs political health 
domestic traders keyed in on a labor department report that showed 
the unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent last month while 
the addition of 142000 nonfarm jobs was weaker than expected 
the dollar dropped off rather sharply on the weak number 
said stephen flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover 
trust co the report gave further fuel to the argument that the 
us economy is slowing and that the federal reserve might move to 
lower interest rates 
foreign appetite for dollars is dampened when the yields on us 
securities decline 
traders also noted that the fed entered the market to sell 
dollars for yen pushing the dollar lower against the japanese 
currency 
a lower dollar will help ensure we have some advantage in 
continuing the level of exports to japan which in turn aids in 
improving the trade deficit barbanel noted 
despite the negative news technical factors pushed the dollar 
higher at the close of trading 
the volume was high and trading was somewhat chaotic 
flanagan said

scandinavian airlines system has agreed

chilean flag carrier lan president guillermo carey said 
carey told the santiago newspaper el mercurio that the agreement 
will not affect lans present traffic rights which include 
profitable routes to the united states and several latin american 
countries 
lan which was established four decades ago as a stateowned 
airline was sold last year to a private investment group headed by 
carey as part of a farreaching program to privatize government 
companies launched by the military government 
carey told the newspaper that the agreement among other things 
will allow lan to share office space with sas in many cities 
which will mean not only a larger international coverage for us 
but also a considerable money saving 
he said sas also will participate in a planned 30 million 
capital increase he gave no details however

howeyinthehills fla ap europes top agricultural 
official disagreed with major trading partners friday saying a 
summit had done little to resolve major differences over import 
restrictions and export subsidies 
but ray macsharry representing the 12nation european 
community in informal talks with the united states japan canada 
and australia conceded we did see where we need to make 
progress 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and farm ministers 
from canada and australia said the closeddoor sessions had 
smoothed the path toward final negotiations for a trade pact being 
hammered out by the 96 nations of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade 
the european community which plans to dismantle internal trade 
barriers in 1992 is in serious conflict with the us and other 
nations over farm supports and subsidies 
macsharry contends european farming is too diverse and that the 
ecs 10 million farmers need government support import 
restrictions export subsidies and other assistance to continue 
feeding 300 million people 
yeutter australias john kerin and canadas donald mazankowski 
emphasized their discussions were meant to advance the gatt 
negotiations for more liberal trade policies 
yeutter was especially outspoken over what he called subsidies 
that are distortive to world trade 
macsharry told reporters after the 1day meeting at the mission 
inn resort that the ec didnt like us trade representative carla 
hills tarrification proposal and would continue to insist on 
rebalancing 
yeutter explained the concept of tarrification like this at a 
news conference the principal import restrictions around the 
world are nontariff measures the way to deal with that is to 
convert them into tariffs and negotiate those tariffs down 
yeutter called the ecs rebalancing policy to liberalize 
trade restrictions on some products but tighten them in others as 
antithetical to the spirit of the gatt it is a barrier to 
trade i dont see any support for rebalancing outside the ec 
australias kerin agreed saying rebalancing is just another 
denial of market access 
mazankowski told reporters that the leaders of the worlds major 
farmproduction areas had a determined resolve to address the 
issues on international competition the gatt negotiations are 
scheduled for completion at the end of the year 
michihiko kano japans minister of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries was asked whether his countrys farmers would gain 
anything from a strong gatt agreement japan has been harshly 
criticized by yeutter and others for what they call overly tough 
protectionist policies 
speaking through an interpreter kano avoided any direct comment 
on its policy on imports of rice and other farm products 
as for any benefits to japanese farmers kano said the 
meeting was not for negotiation it was to exchange views and 
thats where the significance lies 
the ministers generally agreed to establish what they called a 
crisismanagement plan to deal with situations such as the scares 
over cyanide in chilean grapes and the use of the chemical alar on 
some american apples 
mazankowski canadas deputy prime minister and minister of 
agriculture took the lead on that issue the us is to provide a 
research grant and assist in putting together such a plan 
food safety was a major issue in the talks and the ministers 
called for more research and a consumereducation campaign on such 
things as fertilizers pesticides and other products used to treat 
commodities 
there was probably a greater consensus on the food safety 
issue than on the others said yeutter

president bush said friday he is considering 
housing programs business development and bank loans to help 
panamas shattered economy recover from the us invasion and years 
of economic sanctions 
bush was not more specific on what the united states might do to 
help panama recover from invasionrelated damage estimated at 
perhaps 2 billion and from two years of economic decline that 
flowed partly from the us sanctions against manuel antonio 
noriega 
nor did bush address where his administration will find money to 
help panama in a foreign aid budget already strained past its 
limits foreign assistance is among the least popular programs on 
capitol hill where the president would have to secure approval for 
aid to panama 
it was learned separately that bush administration officials are 
looking into possible aid that includes 
building houses for people left homeless by the bombing and 
combat 
helping panama to pay its 543 million in foreign debt so it 
can get new loans 
getting other nations involved in the recovery effort 
loans to help businesses recover 
while recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to 
bush one administration source said theres a sense of urgency 
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly 
the agency for international development meanwhile announced 
it will reopen its panama city office before it was closed on 
noriegas orders in december 1987 the office had helped panama 
stabilize its economy through development assistance 
the state department agency said it is allocating 700000 in 
emergency assistance to remove rubble in the fireravaged panama 
city neighborhood of el chorrillo care for displaced people and 
distribute food and medical supplies 
the fire damage was widely believed to be caused by noriegas 
paramilitary supporters known as dignity battalions 
one us official who like the others requested anonymity 
said it also is likely the administration will move up from march 
the date on which officials must certify whether panama is 
cooperating in antidrug efforts 
by speeding up the evaluation the administration could enable 
panama to receive us trade benefits and caribbean basin 
initiative benefits and have its sugar quota reinstated that 
official said 
the embryonic usinstalled government of president guillermo 
endara has expressed strong antidrug sentiments and would be 
expected to win certification said the official such 
certification was denied to panama under noriega now in us 
custody on a variety of drug charges 
the revitalization of the panamanian economy is a major 
priority in the months ahead bush told a white house news 
conference as are our efforts for humanitarian assistance 
i can report today that considerable progress has been made so 
far in returning panama to a normal state of affairs the new 
government has taken charge and president endara is working 
tirelessly to meet the needs of his people 
bush said the team led by deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger that visited panama this week had praised the endara 
government 
they are discussing housing programs business development 
bank loans that will help spur economic growth we are committed to 
be a part of that process bush said 
the president noted that he already has released nearly 400 
million in assets in us banks that was frozen under the sanctions 
against the noriega regime 
us officials involved in the discussions with panama said 
endara did not present a laundry list of economic requests but 
rather talked about general needs 
the endara government has to sort out its priorities said 
one official who also requested anonymity 
just how much money the administration might find to help panama 
is an unanswered question bushs press secretary marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged this week that the current 1991 budget to 
be sent to congress on jan 29 includes no money to help panama 
the endara government indicated to the eagleburger team that it 
recognizes that private businesses in panama will play a major role 
in restoring the economy and does not expect the us governement 
to do everything said one source 
it is expected the administration will turn to friends around 
the world to help panama in particular officials have mentioned 
japan 
japanese ambassador ryohei murata discussed the matter friday 
with vice president dan quayle 
afterward quayles press secretary david beckwith said he 
could not disclose the substance of the discussion other than to 
say the vice president complimented japan for considering 
extending aid 
japan retained its ties with the noriega government despite us 
urgings that the tokyo government help isolate the dictator japan 
has had substantial economic interests in panama

a warming trend that roughly coincided with the beginning of the

prices of longterm government bonds sank friday 
on new inflation fears and a government employment report that 
apparently offered no hope of lower interest rates 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell point or 
250 for every 1000 in face value its yield rose to 806 
percent from 803 percent late thursday 
shorterterm treasury yields were mixed 
the credit markets had little initial reaction to a labor 
department report that the unemployment held steady at 53 percent 
in december as gains in service industries offset the ninth 
consecutive monthly drop in manufacturing jobs 
but after receiving no signal from the federal reserve board on 
the future course of monetary policy traders began to sell bonds 
in the long end of the market 
traders have been hopeful that in order to spur economic growth 
the fed would lower interest rates which makes bonds more valuable 
and raises their prices but recent reports have pointed to some 
strength in the economy which could cause inflation and discourage 
the fed from easing credit bad news for bonds 
the employment data indicated clearly the economy is clearly 
slowing but there were some indication that wage inflation is 
beginning to pick up said economist steven a wood at 
bankamerica capital markets in san francisco 
the government said average hourly earnings rose 06 percent 
translating into annual gains more than 7 percent well above the 
41 percent over the past year 
sharp rises in oil prices earlier this week also have renewed 
inflation fears wood said prices of crude and home heating oil 
fell on thursday and friday giving back some of their sharp gains 
from earlier in the week 
in the secondary market for treasury securities shortterm 
government issues were unchanged to up 332 point intermediate 
issues were unchanged to down 116 point and longterm issues were 
down 332 point to 1132 point according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 034 to 118460 
yields on threemonth treasury bills declined to 777 percent as 
the discount fell 3 basis points to 753 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 784 percent as the discount dropped 1 
basis point to 745 percent yields on oneyear bills slipped to 
777 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 727 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 8lsqb percent down from 8 percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively

domestic oil prices driven by falling 
temperatures and rising demand have hit the highest level in four 
years already topping what many petroleum industry analysts had 
expected as a peak for 1990 
many said the wednesday surge to levels approaching 24 a barrel 
for february delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil probably 
couldnt last long nonetheless they were busy revising their 
forecasts for the year 
at the 20 bucks that we saw in november i forecast a trail 
off to 17 or 18 by april and then i expected things to recover 
in the balance of the year said stephen a smith an analyst at 
bear stearns amp co in new york 
now it wont go a lot lower than 19 bucks he said friday 
others were looking for a drop of about 2 to 3 per barrel 
after wednesdays high of 2368 the price fell back 27 cents 
on thursday and 33 cents friday to close the week at 2308 vs 
2150 a week earlier 
the socalled posted price what refiners are willing to pay for 
immediate delivery also jumped 150 during the week to 2250 
before some refiners began pulling back to 22 late friday 
except for a oneday jump last april the levels were the 
highest since 1986 when oil prices began to fall from the high 
20s before bottoming out in the 10 per barrel range 
the runup was caused by a number of things but mainly cold 
weather in the northeast and in europe 
george gaspar analyst at robert w baird amp co in milwaukee 
said the weather coupled with problems at domestic refineries 
reduced finished product stocks by 30 million barrels forcing 
refineries to rush to restock and get ready for the summer gasoline 
season 
generally theres a steady decline in finished product light 
fuel gasoline through march but were far and above ahead of 
the decline he said 
analysts said the demand for crude oil to replenish the stock 
likely will keep the price from falling rapidly although they 
expect a decline before prices climb again toward the end of the 
year perhaps to 24 a barrel 
for consumers the recent jump in oil prices already has made a 
stiff impact especially for users of homeheating oil gasoline 
users havent faced a dramatic rise at the pump yet but airline 
passengers are getting socked with fuel surcharges the first time 
thats happened since the 1970s oil crises 
some industry analysts say the sudden surge in demand for oil 
has revived respect for the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries a key source of supplies only a few months ago when 
opec decided on a combined production level of about 22 million 
barrels a day many analysts thought that was too much and would 
depress prices but now that level seems about right 
the weather may have bailed opec out a bit here said smith 
of bear stearns 
others said increased international demand especially in brazil 
and japan had soaked up any excess supplies 
even if the price retreats the domestic industrys recovery 
from the price collapse a few years ago should continue said david 
lee smith analyst at eppler guerin amp turner inc in dallas 
my sense is that most of the major oil companies test their 
projects at 15 a barrel he said if they become convinced as 
time goes on that weve got stable prices above that it bodes well 
for the continuing recovery 
many of the major oil companies already plan to increase 
spending on exploration this year and new technology is helping 
revive fields once thought to be dry 
the increased prices carry some danger warned lysle brinker 
editor of petroleum outlook in that they could persuade opec to 
increase quotas at its spring meeting more oil would send prices 
back down he said

phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr on 
friday denied with all my heart and soul that he used a 
taxsharing arrangement at his lincoln savings and loan association 
to siphon off 94 million 
the arrangement between the nowcollapsed irvine calif thrift 
and its holding company american continental corp is a 
centerpiece of regulators contention that keating was illegally 
using lincoln as a piggybank for his massive real estate 
ventures 
testifying on his suit seeking to overturn the governments 
takeover of the 6 billion thrift last april as an unsafe and 
unsound institution keating said the tax arrangement was 
intended only to bring stability to the various subsidiaries of his 
empire 
to me it was a housekeeping situation he told us district 
court judge stanley sporkin in his second day of testimony 
a key figure in the sampl crisis and the target of a criminal 
grand jury investigation keating had refused in november to 
testify before the house banking committee about lincoln and its 
alleged loss of up to 2 billion in federally insured deposits 
he also is at the center of a senate ethics investigation after 
raising 13 million for the political causes of five senators who 
intervened with regulators on lincolns behalf in 1987 when 
examiners then were trying to curtail its risky loans and land and 
junk bond investments 
after his court appearance keating told reporters that the 
government failed to justify lincolns takeover in seven days of 
hearings presenting its side to sporkin 
to me its obvious they have not made a case he said now 
our turn starts they took away an association with 55 billion in 
assets and theyre supposed to have had some reason for doing that 
this company made money in my opinion it was well managed and 
would have survived under proper handling by the regulators 
attorneys for keating said it would take them at least eight 
days to present his case to sporkin who held the top legal posts 
at the securities and exchange commission and cia before becoming a 
judge 
in response to skeptical questions from sporkin keating 
acknowledged that that he used part of the deferred taxes american 
continental was holding on behalf of the thrift to make payments on 
the holding companys debt 
but when the judge asked if that was the purpose of the 
arrangement to use lincoln as a piggybank for you and american 
continental keating said no 
with all my heart and soul i want you to know that i 
categorically deny that i had any concept remotely related to 
that he said 
the tax agreement is one of several arrangements in which the 
government contends savers governmentinsured deposits in lincoln 
disappeared 
using the accord regulators contend lincoln would sell land it 
had bought at greatly inflated prices financing the buyers 
entirely to record huge paper profits then using money from 
depositors it would send the future taxes on those profits to 
american continental the government contends 
from 1985 through 1988 the holding company collected 94 
million in such deferred taxes from lincoln although none of it was 
ever paid to the government 
keating also admitted friday that lincolns bookkeeping hid the 
true buyer in one 1000acre soured real estate deal in which 44 
million of allegedly owed taxes was paid by lincoln to american 
continental on a 14 million sale 
however because he knew who the true buyer was and that a 35 
million down payment was made on property that lincoln had bought 
for 3 million regulators had no reason to be concerned about it 
he said 
the essence of the problem is that the regulators didnt like 
land syndications keating said explaining that the use of 
straw buyers as the title holder were common in such deals 
sporkin questioned how you can manage billiondollar 
businesses and have transactions where the paperwork did not 
reflect what took place 
when you run a bank or a savings and loan you have the 
highest responsibility of anyone because youre not dealing just 
with stockholders youre dealing with peoples savings the 
judge told keating the only way regulators can ensure that 
an institution is being run properly is if the books and records 
accurately reflect transactions 
in its takeover and a 11 billion civil racketeering and fraud 
suit the government has filed against keating the government has 
charged the entire deal was a sham 
the true buyer arizona developer ernest c garcia had received 
another 20 million loan from lincoln the same day and regulators 
contend that garcia used some of that money or proceeds from other 
loans and deals with lincoln to make the 25 percent 35 million 
down payment necessary under accounting regulations for the thrift 
to record the profit 
garcia who was a participant in several interwoven deals with 
lincoln and american continental that the government contends 
establishes a pattern of fraud and racketeering refused friday to 
testify as a government witness in keatings suit 
through his attorney garcia claimed a fifth amendment 
protection from selfincrimination and sporkin allowed him to leave 
the courtroom without ever taking the stand

bond corp holdings ltd won a reprieve 
friday as the western australian supreme court dismissed a 
government petition to liquidate the media brewing natural 
resources and property empire 
the court ruled against the state government insurance 
commission which had asked the court to appoint a provisional 
liquidator for bond corp on the grounds that the company 
controlled by financier alan bond was insolvent 
a judge ruled that the insurance commission had failed to prove 
its claim 
there is no evidence that the creditors of bond corp arent 
being paid the judge said 
the future of bond corp may be uncertain the judge said but a 
petition should not be filed on speculation that a company may 
possibly at some time in the future experience severe financial 
difficulties 
he also ruled that a nearly 668000 debt that was the basis of 
the petition was disputed by bond corp 
bond corp executive director peter lucas called the court 
decision a resounding victory for the company 
while bond corp succeeded on one front the company whose 
debts total 56 billion was still battling in another court to 
overturn an order to appoint receivers and managers to its 
australian brewing units 
the company is also trying to negotiate with us holders of 
debentures issued by its bond brewing holdings ltd unit who have 
demanded immediate repayment of 510 million of the securities and 
overdue interest 
lawyers for the debenture holders said in court here friday they 
intend to support continuation of receivers appointed last month to 
operate bonds brewing units 
the court appointed the receivers at the request of a syndicate 
of international banks led by national australia bank ltd 
us noteholders were due to receive a 3219 million interest 
payment from bonds brewing arm but the courts froze that payment 
at the request of the bank syndicate bond brewing has asked the 
court to lift the banks stoppayment notice 
alan bond who controls about 58 percent of bond corp gained 
virtual hero status in australia when he won the 1983 americas cup 
yachting trophy the millionaire industrialist has been selling 
assets in recent months to reduce debt 
in its fiscal year ended june 30 bond corp lost 9802 million 
australian dollars the largest annual loss in australian corporate 
history 
bond corps g heileman brewing co unit in the united states 
so far is not involved in the receivership proceedings 
heileman spokesman bill eiler said in a telephone interview from 
pittsburgh thursday the us brewer has separate financing from 
bond corp and as a matter of policy does not comment on matters 
involving bond 
bond purchased la crosse wisbased heileman in 1987 for about 
13 billion and reportedly still owes about 850 million after 
selling the profitable heileman baking co and other heileman 
subsidiaries 
heileman officials said recently they have been meeting with 
creditors and reviewing alternatives aimed at favorably modifying 
heilemans existing debt structure 
separately adolph coors co the fourthlargest us brewing 
company acknowledged this week it has held talks with heileman for 
over a year about the possible purchase of the wisconsin brewer

flexible work schedules will become more 
commonplace during the 1990s along with job sharing and work at 
home according to a survey released sunday 
the conference board a businesssupported research 
organization said it surveyed 521 of the nations biggest 
companies and found that 93 percent offer at least one kind of 
flexible staffing 
the most common form of flexible staffing was parttime work 
followed by flexible hours job sharing phased retirement and work 
at home the conference board said some companies also offer 
shorter work weeks 
companies expect to make greater use of flexible staffing in the 
next few years the survey said job sharing and work at home are 
most likely to be under consideration 
however while many firms are considering more flexible 
staffing the employees who currently benefit the most from such 
arrangements tend to be women in clerical administrative support 
or sales positions managers professionals and executives 
generally do not have flexible schedules the conference board said 
kathleen christensen a city university of new york professor 
who compiled the study said companies are coming under pressure to 
offer flexible staffing because of the tight labor market 
in the 1990s flexible scheduling will be a critical issue to 
companies that need to keep their most valued employees and retain 
a competitive edge in recruitment she said

travelers corp citing poor financial 
results says it plans to stop selling major medical health 
insurance to individuals and another insurance giant aetna life amp 
casualty is considering a similar move 
travelers spokeswoman rosanne hennessey said thursday the 
company will honor and extend existing individual policies but 
will not sell new major medical policies to individuals after jan 
31 major medical policies pay hospital and doctor costs 
aetna life amp casualty co said thursday it is considering 
withdrawing from the individual health insurance market or reducing 
its individual health insurance business 
neither aetna nor travelers is a major seller of individual 
health insurance both companies concentrate on health insurance 
sold to employers for their workers 
aetna for instance wrote 18 billion worth of insurance 
polices in 1988 of which 1 percent 180 million was for 
individuals 
hennessey said the major medical program for individuals has not 
generated the profits the company expected 
claims and expenses exceeded premiums and exceeded our 
expectations she said 
she stressed that travelers will continue to offer other types 
of individual policies including longterm disability longterm 
care accidental death and business travel and hospital indemnity 
aetna said it has not decided what steps to take regarding its 
individual policies john j martin president of the companys 
personal financial security division said the options include 
making no changes or withdrawing certain lines of individual 
insurance 
martin complained that the individual policy business is very 
unpredictable very volatile and that it has been an 
inconsistent performer 
he said aetna lost about 9 million on individual policies in 
1987 made about 5 million in 1988 and that 1989 is going to be 
a modest loser 
aetna has found that people who buy individual policies tend to 
be more likely to have health problems resulting in claims martin 
said he said insurers prefer group insurance because it covers a 
broad spectrum of employees people of different ages sexes and 
states of health 
in addition he said aetna is worried that insurance 
regulations concerned about the affordability of insurance may 
approve rates that are too low to make such insurance profitable in 
the future
