the us government is going into hock faster 
than the eye can follow a new digital readout unveiled by a real 
estate developer shows the national debt jumping by 8000 a second 
a rate that made the last four numbers a blur 
below the main number that depicted the spiraling 27 trillion 
national debt on a building in midtown manhattan was a second figure 
tracking each american familys share of the indebtedness over 
41000 and growing 
the readout dubbed the national debt clock was unveiled 
wednesday by seymour b durst a real estate developer who has been 
campaigning publicly against governmental debt for a decade 
durst 75 started warning about the debt by sending a new years 
card to government and business leaders in 1980 at that time as 
the card pointed out the debt was 914 billion and each familys 
portion was 11362 
durst said it cost his old york foundation about 120000 to set 
up the debt clock which is at the northwest corner of sixth avenue 
and 42nd street a block east of where the ball drops at midnight on 
new years eve 
just the interest on the national debt is more than the 
federal budget deficit said durst before unveiling the clock 
at about 170 billion the interest is the third largest 
expenditure of the government more than the combined welfare and 
housing cost he said 
the clock is meant to give the alarm to people he said 
durst then threw a switch and workmen four stories up on the side 
of a building uncovered the readout 
the numbers read 2 trillion 726 billion 728 million 540odd 
thousand and a blur few passersby heads ducked or holding 
umbrellas against rain appeared to take notice immediately 
the clock is connected by telephone to dursts office a block to 
the north so that he can adjust it as indebtedness speeds or slows 
its running wild said durst this year in four months it 
has increased the equivalent of six months increase of last year

prime minister margaret thatchers program to 
transform britain into a propertyowning democracy has produced 
an army of new homeowners but many are being squeezed by her 
determination to curb inflation by driving up interest rates 
mortgage costs have risen at their fastest rate in 50 years to 
135 percent from 975 percent last summer confronting many of 
britains 15 million homeowners with heavy debt and even the risk of 
losing their homes homebuyers advocates say 
types of mortgages in the united states vary but their rates 
generally hover around 10 to 105 percent 
stephanie manasche a single mother in harrow says her monthly 
payments have jumped 42 pounds 7350 to 262 pounds 45850 and 
she had to negotiate a temporary agreement with her lender to pay 
interest only that brought the payment down to 253 pounds 443 
and she is still having trouble keeping up 
it makes me feel very very frightened obviously she said 
the crunch could also make britons lose confidence in real estate 
and return to renting undermining mrs thatchers initial aims 
the present government is pulling the rug out from underneath 
their feet said michael brett secretary general of the national 
association of homeowners in shrewsbury 
john doling a professor at the university of birminghams 
department of social policy said many people will be deeply 
depressed deeply suffering from what has happened some he says 
will have to economize on food and they wont eat properly 
but lenders say defaults are more an outcome of unemployment and 
marital breakup than of higher interest rates 
they stress their eagerness to help borrowers in difficulty by 
for example extending the term of a mortgage 
as long as those people come in and let us know there are 
things we can do said mark hemingway a spokesman for the halifax 
building society the countrys biggest mortgage lender 
the monthly payment on a new 40000pound 70000 25year 
adjustable mortgage has risen to 38842 pounds 67974 from about 
30493 pounds 53363 last summer the building societies 
association said 
repayments on only the first 30000 pounds 52000 of a 
mortgage are taxdeductible most rates fluctuate with interest 
rates fixed rates are rarely offered and 40 percent of 
mortgageholders have their monthly payment adjusted once a year 
the squeeze worsened last year when young buyers rushed into the 
market and overcommitted themselves trying to beat the abolition in 
august of double tax relief for unmarried joint mortgageholders 
when people see prices going up rapidly they feel they have to 
be active in the housing market right now before it is too late 
doling said 
in june mrs thatchers conservative government began raising 
interest rates stalling the housing boom so that buyers who came in 
at the top of the market cant get out at a profit 
mrs thatcher has promoted home ownership as part of her campaign 
to roll back socialism allowing occupants of rented public housing 
to buy the property at preferential terms 
sixtyfour percent of britains housing is occupantowned 
compared with 55 percent in 1978 the building societies association 
said 
but now mrs thatcher says that inflation which has jumped to an 
annual rate of 68 percent from 33 percent a year ago is her top 
priority and interest rates are her weapon 
i think many people would find the irony in that doling said 
brett of the homeowners association said we are predicting a 
massive rise in the number of mortgage arrears and repossession 
in 1985 when mortgage rates went up to 14 percent mortgage 
arrears doubled brett said 
today some 300000 people are in arrears while last year 25000 
families saw their homes repossessed brett said 
in addition he said as soon as someone falls behind in 
mortgage payments even if they dont get repossessed they will get 
a bad reputation financially and will in fact be blighted for life 
the building societies association said uptodate statistics 
arent available yet and it expects arrears and repossession to 
show a decline because unemployment is down 
a 36yearold bank employee from liverpool who requested 
anonymity said a couple of years ago the mortgage was 
affordable now it is ridiculous 
sarah rudman a 19yearold advertising saleswoman bought her 
shrewsbury home in september with fiance stephen chaloner a 
23yearold software engineer payments on their 21000pound 
36750 mortgage have risen 57 pounds 100 to 220 pounds 385 
a month 
now ms rudman said they have to postpone the wedding and lower 
their living standard 
we were advised by a lot of people you ought to have your own 
house buy now we panicked relly we just grabbed it she said

in the week since the last soviet 
soldier left afghanistan president najib has been digging in 
defiantly for a long struggle against the moslem guerrillas who 
surround his capital 
as guerrilla leaders meet in neighboring pakistan to forge their 
own rival administration najib and his peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan are tightening their own defenses both militarily and 
politically 
the bullnecked broadshouldered najib seems very much in charge 
thousands of party members including healthy youths and 
middleaged men of dubious physical stamina have been called to 
arms in recent days 
the 43yearold najib former chief of the dreaded khad secret 
police imposed a state of emergency saturday restricting such 
rights as free speech and public assembly 
a few hours later najib purged his cabinet of seven nonparty 
members and replaced them with party men there are still nine 
nonparty ministers among the 28 in the cabinet but none holds key 
posts moreover the cabinets even nominal authority has been 
eroded by this weeks creation of a military council dominated by 
party politburo members 
on monday prime minister mohammad hasan sharq known for his 
long and close ties with moscow despite being a nonparty member 
was replaced by his predecessor sultan ali kishtmand one of the 
most senior party stalwarts 
party sources speaking on condition of anonymity say the 
factionalism and animosity and occasional gun battles that have 
marked the party since its founding in 1965 have been set aside to 
deal with the external threat posed by the usbacked guerrillas 
many of the party men elevated to the revised cabinet or named to 
the newly created supreme military council for the defense of the 
homeland are drawn from najibs own party faction the parcham 
one of najibs strongest foes in the party sayed mohammad 
gulabzhoi leader of the khalq faction was shunted off to moscow in 
november in the timehonored afghan tradition of getting potential 
troublemakers or coup leaders diplomatically out of the country 
the hardline hawk was named kabuls new ambassador to the soviet 
union 
the mobilization of party cadres is well under way according to 
one party official 200000 members who were not already in the 
military have been mobilized 
hundreds of civilians arrived in kabul over the weekend armed 
with new sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault rifles 
kabul is the key to power in afghanistan where rugged mountains 
vast deserts and few highways isolate most of the countryside 
about 30000 party members living in kabul have already been 
armed according to government announcements food and fuel have 
been stockpiled the soviets left behind enormous arsenals of 
sophisticated weapons diplomatic sources say 
and najib has wasted no time in playing the nationalist card he 
has repeatedly tried to rally the country behind him saying 
afghanistans very existence was at risk from conspiracies and 
armed intervention from outside namely pakistan and the united 
states 
his slogan is homeland or death 
since feb 15 when the soviets declared their withdrawal 
complete kabul has been unnaturally quiet for a city of 225 
million people 
eight rockets have hit the city in the last week killing eight 
people in august at the height of a guerrilla bombardment 
diplomats counted 120 rockets in a single day the sound of 
artillery which less than a month ago was a nightly occurrence is 
missing from the mountains that circle the city 
foreign diplomats say the guerrillas are playing a waiting game 
hoping kabul will collapse from within as supplies grow short and 
discontent with the party rises 
najib has tried to portray a distance between himself and the 
soviet union there was no ceremonial sendoff for the red army 
whose nine years of assistance cost 13000 soviet soldiers their 
lives 
even the some of the fleet of sovietmade volga cars used by khad 
agents have been altered so the russian name no longer shows the 
cars now bear false labels proclaiming them toyotas or other 
nonsoviet models 
the soviet occupation was the uniting force for the mujahedeen 
now that they are gone the resistance will have to find something 
to fight for rather than against said a un official speaking 
on condition of anonymity

spitak near the center of the armenian 
earthquake became the focus of world attention when soviet tv 
commentators said it was practically erased from the face of the 
earth former moscow correspondent carol j williams was one of 
the first western journalists to get into the city then and she 
recently returned here is her report

scrawny cats and packs of dogs prowl for 
food in the ruins of this city that bore the brunt of armenias 
deadly earthquake 
the only human contact they have is an occasional petting or 
shooing from soviet soldiers and armenian volunteers sorting twisted 
metal from broken brick 
residents have been evacuated the new spitak will be built three 
miles away from its present site the confluence of three seismic 
faults 
there are some though who refuse to leave a handful of elderly 
armenians still in shock from the dec 7 disaster wander aimlessly 
among the paths cleared to allow cranes and bulldozers to chip away 
at the sprawl of ruins that were once the homes of 25000 people 
one woman shod in socks and sandals protected from the freezing 
weather by only a flowered scarf and stretchedout sweater 
approaches workers passing by to show them her withered hands she 
speaks in broken sentences that fellow armenians say are 
unintelligible 
shes crazy she lost everyone a young russian soldier said 
somberly after the woman tried to communicate with visiting red 
cross volunteers from west germany we give her food but she 
refuses to go anywhere else 
central spitak is eerily still save for the occasional roar of a 
diesel engine or the grinding of gears as trucks haul away debris 
through the winding mountain roads there is also the cackling of 
crows fluttering between the abandoned skeletons of apartment 
houses darting in through the jagged glass clinging to twisted 
window frames 
on the outskirts of the crumbled city orderly rows of tents and 
tubelike housing stretch out across the parched saddle of land 
between the towering snowcovered caucasus mountains 
more than 4000 people live in the camps waiting and hoping for 
the day when their lives can resume 
i came here to help and i just do what im told said sambak 
azizyan a crane operator from the nearby village of dzhryashen who 
lost his 4yearold daughter in the quake as soon as there is a 
crane available for me im ready to work day and night to rebuild 
idleness has been a widespread consequence of the earthquake that 
destroyed all factories as well as housing and the absence of work 
to take armenians minds off their suffering has slowed the healing 
process 
we lost our daughter our home our jobs everything 
lamented sizush danelyan eyes welling with tears even 10 weeks 
after the disaster were being taken care of and have no 
complaints but the new city will be somewhere else and we cannot 
leave i couldnt abandon my daughter 
she motions toward the nearby hillside that at first glance 
appears to be covered with small metal huts and high fences the 
miniature village is the city cemetery where the cremated remains 
of some earthquake victims have been laid to rest with other 
departed relatives in shrinelike enclaves 
there are isolated attempts to force life back to normal two 
workers in a metal kiosk nestled among the concrete clutter in 
spitaks center sell newspapers and magazines although the trade is 
far from brisk a shepherd drives a flock of two dozen sheep along 
the roadside north of the city and farmers from the neighboring 
republic of georgia stake out the citys inroads selling greenhouse 
fruit and flowers for prices that exceed a weeks wages 
its a healthy sign that commerce has returned to the region 
said manfred blum general secretary of the west german red cross 
who has spent six weeks in the disaster area a pack of marlboros 
is the currency of trade they cost 10 rubles about 16 but they 
can buy a pair of warm socks 
the tons of clothing sent to armenia from foreign countries are 
not visible on the backs of the earthquake victims as most of the 
homeless and displaced continue to wear the clothes they had on 
their backs when the quake struck 
aid agencies like the red cross and church organizations have 
concentrated on providing food shelter and medical care while 
clothing and household goods shipped to the stricken republic 
without distribution directions likely were pilfered after being 
stranded at yerevans airport for days or weeks 
despite occasional corruption and chaos armenians are learning 
to cope with the crisis and start the long work of recovery food 
distribution points are marked with handpainted signs and purified 
water is piped to the tent cities from treatment stations near the 
soviet army encampment 
our priority is to rescue people from the cold and outdoor 
life spitaks communist party leader norik moradyan told the 
red cross visitors in his containeroffice near the biggest grid of 
tents 
negotiating from his desk overshadowed by a poster soliciting 
bank donations to help armenia moradyan offered his west german 
interlocutors an inducement to choose his region as the place to 
spend millions in donations 
if you help us rebuild he said we could name the new 
housing region after beethoven

a group of atheists and agnostics is asking 
major hotel chains to supply them with biblefree rooms saying the 
bible makes for gruesome bedtime reading 
why should innocent people go into a hotel room with an open 
bible that is instructing you to kill homosexuals to kill 
blasphemers said annie l gaylor editor of freethought today 
the newsletter of a group called the freedom from religion 
foundation 
ms gaylor said her group has written to a dozen hotel chains 
including holiday inns of memphis asking for biblefree rooms for 
atheists and agnostics 
were asking for freedom from the bible were not saying they 
cant offer the bible to their other customers she said wednesday 
from her office in madison wis 
ralph berry a spokesman for the holiday corp said the bibles 
at holiday inns are supplied by gideons international a christian 
organization and are there to be read or not read as hotel guests 
prefer 
its personal choice to read them if theyd like to read them 
we dont intend on pulling them out berry said 
in calling for biblefree hotel and motel rooms ms gaylor 
compared the request to the desires of nonsmokers who want 
smokefree rooms 
we want a nonsuperstition section along with a nonsmoking 
section she said 
ms gaylor said her group has 3200 members paying 30 annual 
membership fees and many of them are offended when they check into 
hotels and find bibles in their rooms 
theres a section that says people like me atheists or 
unbelievers should be killed when i go to a hotel room i know 
that is what the bible says about me she said 
ms gaylor said members of her group are being encouraged to 
request biblefree rooms when they check into hotels and the group 
is distributing small stickers to put on the bibles the members find 
advising potential readers to be wary 
warning the stickers say literal belief in this book 
could be dangerous to your life and health

prime minister noboru takeshitas recent refusal to 
call japan an aggressor in world war ii has drawn renewed criticism 
at home and abroad that the nation is unwilling to acknowledge its 
militaristic past 
the backlash comes at a particularly sensitive time for 
takeshita with dignitaries from 163 nations gathering in tokyo for 
fridays elaborate funeral for emperor hirohito whose own 
responsibility for the war is a subject of sharp debate 
when a communist party legislator asked in parliament last week 
about japans wartime actions against asian countries takeshita 
replied 
there are various arguments on whether the past was a war by 
accident or for selfdefense i believe however that it is the 
historians task in later ages to form a conclusion whether it was 
or was not a war of aggression 
asked if he felt adolf hitler waged a war of aggression in 
europe takeshita said it is very difficult to define 
academically war as a whole as a war of aggression 
opponents of the monarchy and critics of takeshitas ruling 
liberal democratic party reacted with rebukes 
the liberal democrats actually believe the war was right they 
simply will not concede that it was aggression said tetsuzo fuwa 
the lawmaker who put the questions to takeshita 
the ldp made nobusuke kishi a former war criminal himself 
prime minister fuwa said in an interview i know of no other 
country where a man with this background can become head of 
government 
sharp criticism also came from china and south korea both 
victims of brutality by japanese forces in the years before and 
during the war 
an official chinese newspaper termed takeshitas comments 
absurd and preposterous and warned that he may lead the 
japanese peole astray once more south korean media accused the 
japanese leader of refusing to recognize japans wartime aggression 
italian and soviet newspapers also published commentaries 
accusing takeshita of evasion and failing to draw lessons from 
history 
ruling politicians dont want to say they were wrong said 
nobuaki nakagawa of the united church of christ in japan the 
largest protestant denomination in this country they deny history 
because admitting it would hinder their militarization of japan but 
their refusal to recognize japans actions increases the chances of 
history repeating itself 
the question of war responsibility is touchy because of debate 
over the personal role of the late emperor who once was revered as 
divine some critics say he encouraged the war others maintain he 
at least could have ended it sooner many historians however 
contend the monarch was a figurehead powerless against the military 
cabinet 
two cabinet ministers were forced to step down in 1986 and 1988 
after they said japans wartime actions were justifiable and did not 
constitute aggression 
this time again the government moved quickly to try to head off 
any diplomatic rows the chief government spokesman said takeshitas 
comments were misunderstood and reaffirmed japans 
acknowledgment that it inflicted grave damage on asian neighbors 
during the war 
in beijing japanese sources said ambassador toshijiro nakajima 
called on chinese vice foreign minister liu shuqing to say japan 
cannot deny its aggressor role he said there is no change in 
japans position stated in a 1972 communique when diplomatic 
relations were established of accepting responsibility for the 
suffering it caused during the war 
all the government does is issue a statement saying it 
recognizes it is under international criticism fuwa said it 
refuses to acknowledge war responsibility because to do so would 
admit the responsibility of the emperor 
japans conservative ruling party has no regrets about the 
injuries and damage it caused said the united church of christs 
nakagawa 
the party feels that the war was proper and not an invasion 
they truly believe they were liberating asia from us and european 
imperialism he said their interpretation of history is warped 
they say war with america was wrong but with asia it was 
inevitable 
demonstrations are planned on the day of the funeral for 
hirohito who died of cancer jan 7 at age 87 the church plans 
several rallies and marches protesting the native shinto religious 
rites for hirohito and japans imperial system

researchers reported today that abnormal nerve 
fibers extending into the brain appear in the noses of alzheimers 
victims which may permit scientists to study the illness in living 
nerve tissue for the first time 
the finding may also lead to the first definitive test for 
diagnosing alzheimers in a living patient said study coauthor 
barbara talamo 
alzheimer experts agreed that studying the nerve tissue may 
reveal secrets about the brain disease for which no cause or cure 
is known but they were skeptical that the tissue which can be 
removed under local anesthetic would be useful for a diagnostic 
test 
talamo is director of the neurosciences program at tufts medical 
school and associate professor of neurology and physiology at the 
school and the new england medical center both in boston 
she describes the new research in todays issue of the british 
journal nature with colleagues there and scientists from harvard 
medical school and the university of pennsylvania medical school 
alzheimers disease is a progressive degenerative illness that 
impairs memory thinking and behavior it afflicts an estimated 25 
million americans 
the new study focused on nerves found at the top of the nose 
within the inner lining where they are responsible for detecting 
odors the nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion of 
the brain that is affected by alzheimers disease talamo said 
researchers took nerve tissue samples from autopsies of nine 
alzheimers patients for comparison purposes they also sampled 
nasal tissue from autopsies of nine people of about the same ages 
but without similar disease and five people who had other brain 
diseases 
eight of the nine alzheimer samples showed marked production of 
nerve fibers called neurites that contained abnormal proteins the 
proteins were excessively modified by a chemical process called 
phosphorylation 
the proteins resembled those found in the brains of alzheimers 
patients in tangled structures within brain cells that are a 
hallmark of the disease talamo said 
in contrast samples from only two of the 14 comparison patients 
showed significant amounts of the abnormal fibers and a third 
showed a small amount 
those three people were among seven nonalzheimer subjects older 
than 65 noted david drachman of the university of massachusetts 
since the fibers appeared in three of the seven they may be 
present in many people older than 65 who do not have alzheimers he 
said that raises questions about the fibers usefulness in 
diagnosing the disease he said 
peter davies of the albert einstein college of medicine in bronx 
ny also said it is not known whether samples from living patients 
would be useful for diagnosis talamo said researchers plan to begin 
studies in living people 
drachman and davies did say that laboratory studies of nasal 
nerve tissue from alzheimer patients may help in learning about the 
disease but drachman said it depends on whether the tissue will 
show more convincing evidence that it reflects the alzheimers 
disease process

the mere presence of more than 150 foreign 
delegations including some of the worlds top leaders for 
emperor hirohitos funeral is a testament to japans towering 
importance in the world 
yet the japanese themselves are not exactly secure with their 
status they take pride in their affluence but are also concerned 
over whether their nation is ready to be a world leader 
in fact national selfscrutiny wrought by the emperors death 
has spurred public debate over japans global responsibilities 
foreign relations and priorities for the 21st century 
government officials say japan intends to fulfill its role as a 
global economic power but is unprepared to be a world political 
leader or even a leader in asia preferring instead to follow the 
united states lead 
i think the japanese are embarrassed or confused when people 
speak of a leadership role because we are used to following so we 
are confused or lost makoto kuroda special adviser to the 
ministry of international trade and industry told a recent 
conference in tokyo 
we cant respond to demands from the united states and other 
countries because we havent discussed things among ourselves 
added commentator and business consultant kenichi ohmae we have 
to develop our point of view 
japan having made the leap from developing nation to economic 
superstar has become more active in international affairs in 
recent years but has kept to noncontroversial areas such as un 
peacekeeping activities and increasing aid to poor countries 
it also seeks to avoid antagonizing its asian neighbors who 
admire its economic progress but oppose a stronger japanese military 
the neighbors recall their treatment in world war ii when japan 
controlled the korean peninsula and much of china the south pacific 
and southeast asia 
japanese are still a subject of terror and suspicion for 
koreans even today said lee do hyang an editorial writer for 
chosun ilbo a seoul newspaper 
a 1987 japanese government survey showed sizable segments of 
southeast asia still see japan as a potential military threat of 
those polled 53 percent in thailand 47 percent in the philippines 
and 34 percent in malaysia said they thought japan could become a 
military power again 
growing trade inside asia has raised the possibility of a major 
trading bloc in asia led by japan that would compare with the 
european economic community and north america 
in the east asian region japan is seen to be a country playing 
a leadership role but i dont think japan has gone that far yet 
said toyoo gyohten vice minister of finance 
the united states which spends 65 percent of its total annual 
income on defense has urged japan which spends about 1 percent to 
do more to build up its own defenses 
but military spending is highly controversial here japans 
postwar constitution limits its military to defensive capabilities 
and bans deployment of soldiers overseas 
in a recent government poll 772 percent of the japanese 
surveyed disapproved of defense spending increases 
japan doesnt have the will or the capability to become a 
military power gyohten said 
tokyo views its international responsibility in mainly economic 
terms 
it has announced it will double its foreign aid to more than 50 
billion during a the five years ending in 1992 
in addition its 10 billion in aid in fiscal 1988 and a budgeted 
11 billion for 1989 have made it worlds largest donor to 
developing nations according to the parisbased organization of 
economic cooperation and development 
japan expects the united states to continue as the leader of 
noncommunist pacific rim nations gyoten said the question then 
is how can east asian countries achieve the role the united 
states wants them to play he said 
but many leading analysts say japan must formulate its own 
policies instead of following the lead of the united states and 
europe 
this passive approach is responsible for much of the criticism 
directed at japan hideo sato dean of the college of 
international relations at tsukuba university wrote in the japan 
economic journal 
yoshiro kurisaka of the japan institute for social and economic 
affairs contends that if japan does nothing but pursue its own 
economic interests it will recreate the nightmarish conditions 
that led to the pacific war 
i keenly feel that japans obligation to act with wisdom 
compassion and generosity will increase with the approach of the 
21st century he said in a recent arcticle

time thursday or just after 11 pm wednesday back in washington 
bush and his wife barbara were greeted on the haneda airport 
tarmac by keizo obuchi the chief japanese cabinet secretary and 
other government officials 
asked if she and her husband were able to get any sleep on the

francois mitterrand 
earlier bush had spoken briefly to a group of us servicemen 
and their families during a refueling stop at elmendorf air force 
base in alaska a traditional departure point for presidential trips 
to the far east 
speaking inside a hangar as snow fell outside bush said the aim 
of his fiveday 18095mile trip is to strengthen key 
relationships with our friends and partners in the pacific region 
alaskans understand that america is as much a pacific nation as 
it is an atlantic one and that the pacific region is of great and 
growing importance in international affairs he said 
saying that his visit would also include talks of important 
policy decisions with foreign leaders from the middle east and 
other areas bush declared but we dont ever want to neglect our 
friends 
and yes things in the pacific seem to be going reasonably 
well but we are a pacific power and this visit will demonstrate 
that we intend to stay a pacific power 
bush spoke before several thousand airmen in blue army 
infantrymen in camouflage uniforms and schoolchildren in parkas at 
the air base he recalled that one of his predecessors president 
william henry harrison spoke at his inauguration for 3 hours 
caught pneumonia and was dead within a month bush added i will 
be brief

state james a baker iii 
fitzwater also hinted bush might have time during the trip to

not in the cards

the board of directors of the 8000member 
bar association of san francisco on wednesday called for an end to a 
state law banning samesex marriages a legal newspaper reported 
such bans were called invidious discrimination by the 
associations president peter g keane 
according to thursday editions of the san francisco banner daily 
journal the associations directors unanimously urged that the 
current state civil code mandating marriages between a man and a 
woman be changed to read marriage is a personal relation arising 
out of a civil contract between two people 
such a change would give partners of both homosexuals and 
heterosexuals many of the same rights now enjoyed as part of legal 
marriage 
keane said banning samesex marriages was a clear denial of 
equal protection under the 14th amendment to the constitution by 
singling out an identifiable class of people 
he added that a new definition of marriage is needed to correct 
invidious discrimination against nonheterosexuals who choose to 
have a relationship that has the same quality and definition that a 
husband and wife have 
members of the board said the samesex marriage law could 
eliminate the need for socalled domestic partners legislation 
harry britt an openly gay member of the city council has 
proposed the legislation to make medical and other benefits 
available to livein companions

a huge crocodile called bujang 
senang or king of crocodiles by river bank people attacked and ate 
a fisherman its 13th victim in 10 years newspapers reported today 
the new straits times and star dailies quoted police 
superintendent nathan ha as giving this account on wednesday 
brian tunging 45 and four other people were fishing monday in 
two small boats in the river muara sungei antek about 600 miles 
southeast of kuala lumpur when the beast attacked the boat on which 
tunging was standing alone 
as tunging fell the monstrous reptile and two smaller ones 
ripped into his thighs and stomach 
police and the other four fishermen found his remains three hours 
later 
there were teeth marks on the boat indicating the jaws struck 
the boat ha said 
the crocodile has been described by those who have seen it as 
being about 23 feet long and more than three feet wide 
last chrismas eve bujang senang attacked a farmer who was 
fishing in the river and escaped with slight injuries 
while there have been other incidents the last victim bujang 
senang killed and ate before tunging was badong apong 51 on 
sept27 1984 
police sharpshooters in boats scoured area rivers then but could 
not find bujang senang 
in november 1982 after another victim was killed malay witch 
doctors went to the area to try to charm the crocodile into being 
shot or captured but they also failed 
the jumbo crocodile is easily identifiable because of its length 
and also because bujang senang has a white tinge on its back above 
the forelegs while almost all other crocodiles in the area are gray 
the national news agency bernama has quoted crocodile experts as 
saying bujang senang is more than 140 years old 
while bujang senang means king of crocodiles in the local iban 
language it means easygoing batchelor in malay it is believed to 
be a male and has never been seen with a mate 
no search was launched for the crocodile this time

the government should recognize that farming is 
a business not a way of life and should stop propping up 
farmers who cant make it on their own a national commission says 
the national commission on agricultural finance said wednesday 
that programs that support farmers whose operations are not viable 
will end up making american agriculture less competitive in the 
global marketplace 
it urged congress to revise farm programs to eliminate farmers 
who cannot make a go of their business and to separate farm credit 
programs from social policy 
agriculture is a business it is not a way of life said 
commission chairman harold b steele of princeton ill we should 
not disguise a social program under a credit agency 
the panel established by congress in 1985 also urged lawmakers 
to choose between crop insurance or disaster payments saying 
using both wont work 
congress last summer passed a 4 billion drought relief bill to 
help farmers whose crops were scorched by the record drought of 1988 
the commission however said that the answer to natural 
disasters is not more credit 
the panel of mostly academicians farmers and bankers sharply 
criticized federal policies that use subsidized credit to solve farm 
income problems 
in essence policy attempts to enhance the welfare of farmers 
while maintaining low grocery bills for the consumer the report 
said although possible this reactive approach is an impediment 
to agriculture as it tries to compete in world markets 
the report said keeping all who want to farm in business 
regardless of capacity and ability leads to antagonism by other 
farmers and other sectors of the economy 
keeping nonviable farmers in business even hurts those very 
farmers the study said they waste critical years of their very 
productive lives it said 
the commission did however endorse the idea of a safety net 
for farm families whose business fails 
commission members also advocated universal loan application and 
accounting standards for farm businesses blaming the farm credit 
crisis in the early 1980s in part on differing lending standards 
that proved inadequate in determining whether a farmer could repay a 
loan 
congress bailed out the farm credit system a cooperatively owned 
network of banks and lending institutions in 1987 hundreds of 
rural banks also failed throughout the decade because of the farm 
credit crisis which was prompted by falling land values high 
farmer debt and bad loan decisions 
lenders may have made better decisions in the gogo borrowing era 
of the late 1970s if they and farmers had all been looking at the 
same criteria balance sheets and cash flow statements rather than 
at collateral and escalating land values the commission said 
while an increasing number of borrowers do make available good 
coordinated records many borrowers still do not have adequate 
records or financial statements from which to make informed credit 
analysis decisions the report said this situation may stem 
from the fact that lenders historically made credit decisions based 
on collateral and not coordinated financial statements

rain and snow have helped improve soil 
conditions in parts of the winter wheat belt but parts of the great 
plains wheat area are still gasping for moisture 
after last years devastating drought moisture conditions are 
being watched closely for signs of an unwanted encore in 1989 a 
siege that a government economist said wednesday could trigger a new 
round of higher food prices and add to the farm debt burden 
the federal joint agricultural weather facility said rain during 
the week of feb 1319 helped winter wheat in oklahoma and parts of 
texas but in kansas the crop needed snow cover and moisture 
snow cover was mostly adequate in the northern plains the 
report said additional snow improved cold weather protection in 
michgan winter wheat was mostly good to fair in illinois 
the facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments to provide weekly updates on weather and crop conditions 
mark drabenstott assistant vice president and economist at the 
federal reserve bank in kansas city mo told the senate commerce 
committee in written testimony that the effect of the drought of 
1988 on farmers agribusiness farm lenders and consumers was not 
as great as had been expected 
he said however that much of agricultures adjustment 
capacity was depleted in 1988 and the effects of continued drought 
in 1989 would be more severe 
norton strommen the usdas chief meteorologist says a 
recurrence of last years severe drought is unlikely 
drabenstott agreed that the odds are against a repeat of the 1988 
drought this year but he added that if another drought did occur 
sharply reduced grain stockpiles would push crop prices to record 
or nearrecord levels 
many crop producers added to their 1988 income by selling grain 
inventories built up in earlier years an option that will not be 
available in 1989 drabenstott said in his written testimony 
thus despite the very high grain prices that would accompany 
continued drought smaller crops and depleted inventories would 
probably mean smaller farm income 
higher crop prices also would deliver a severe blow to the 
livestock industry by driving up feed costs drabenstott said 
consumers he added would feel the effects of lower meat production 
for some time 
as for the drought of 1988 drabenstott said financial 
reserves from recently good farming years and a 39 billion 
federal assistance program helped producers minimize the effects of 
last years poor harvests

the pollination of crops by honeybees is worth 
at least 97 billion a year in added value says a study by cornell 
university 
honeybees are used by the millions to pollinate major crops of 
fruits berries vegetables tree nuts oilseeds and legumes their 
keepers rent them out commercially trucking the bees to crop areas 
the study released wednesday was prepared by cornell for the 
national honey board which was authorized by congress and 
established by the agriculture department in 1986 to promote honey 
and honey research the board is financed by producers 
about a million colonies of bees are involved in commercial crop 
pollination about a third of all us managed colonies the report 
said that is about double the number estimated in the early 1980s 
to a significant degree because of the hard work of the 
honeybee we have abundant food supplies at reasonable prices said 
dan hall manager of the national honey board based in longmont 
colo 
commercial pollination ranges from blueberries and cranberries in 
new england to apples in the northwest and new york to almonds in 
california and some citrus in florida 
other major examples cited included alfalfa seed in the west 
melons in texas cucumbers in the carolinas and michigan sunflowers 
in minnesota and seeds for onions carrots celery and other 
vegetables in many states 
frederick hoff of usdas economic research service said that many 
consumers are unaware that honeybees are used to pollinate foods 
they are dependent upon he said the study shows that pollination is 
even more important than we thought 
the cornell study was based on 1985 information and showed that 
the 97 billion in direct benefits represented the dollar value of 
increased crop yields and quality as the result of honeybee crop 
pollination 
crop quality improvements include larger and more uniform size 
desirable shape uniform maturation date and all result in higher 
market value the report said

the agriculture department says the longtime 
slide in the us cattle inventory has ended and that producers are 
beginning to expand their herds 
a usda report on feb 8 showed that the nations cattle inventory 
as of jan 1 was virtually the same as it had been a year earlier 
many private analysts had been saying the herd numbers would show 
another significant decline 
this expansion dramatically changes the beef outlook for 1989 
and beyond the departments economic research service said 
wednesday beef cows number 2 percent above a year earlier and 
beef replacement heifers were up 5 percent 
moreover the report noted that the jan 1 figures showed last 
years calf crop was 672000 head larger than was projected last 
summer 
including dairy animals the us herd of cattle and calves 
totaled a 28year low of 99484000 head on jan 1 down only 40000 
head from a year ago

james d watkins was headed for a swift vote of 
approval from the senate panel considering his confirmation as the 
first career military man to head the energy department 
watkins a retired navy admiral with broad experience in the 
services nuclear program drew strong praise from nearly every 
member of the senate energy and natural resources committee during a 
threehour hearing wednesday 
the committee is to vote on the nomination next wednesday 
several members told watkins even before questioning him that they 
would vote for him 
although lacking professional experience in civilian energy 
watkins showed a solid grasp of such issues as the future of 
hydroelectric power prospects for using methanol to power cars and 
deregulation of natural gas 
he said the bush administration was devoted to a future that is 
energyindependent healthy and safe 
watkins pledged to shake up the departments management of its 
nuclear weapons complex a network of 17 major plants in 12 states 
that develop produce and test nuclear arms for the pentagon key 
parts of the complex have been shut down for safety and technical 
reasons crippling the nations weapons production and raising the 
specter of huge modernization and cleanup costs 
its a mess watkins told the panel 
he said that while the government would have to invest billions 
to upgrade the nuclear facilities the biggest challenge was to 
instill a better attitude in energy department workers responsible 
for overseeing weapons production the plants are operated under 
government contract by private companies 
within six months youll see a whole new face on it watkins 
said in reference to the departments management of the weapons 
production complex he added however that it would take a couple 
of years to change workers attitudes 
the doe defense program has a culture not yet educated or 
trained to understand each individuals shared responsibility and 
accountability for safe reliable reactor plant operations 
watkins said we are now paying the price for this longterm 
cultural misdirection 
no committee member aimed a critical word at watkins several 
heaped praise on him saying his military background made him an 
excellent choice for the job 
watkins sought to dispel the notion that because of his 
background in the navys nuclear program he had been selected by 
president bush to be secretary of nuclear energy 
while i expect to focus initially on the very serious problems 
our nation faces with regard to cleanup of nuclear waste and putting 
our nuclear defense operations back on track i want to state 
clearly that i intend to function fully as the secretary of 
energy he said 
watkins said he would work to promote a broad mixture of energy 
sources including civilian nuclear power nuclear proponents 
contend that cumbersome and costly federal regulation is a key 
reason for the recent stagnation of the nuclear industry and 
watkins appeared to agree that regulatory reforms are needed 
he said the nuclear regulatory commissions plant licensing 
process should be streamlined to relieve the constipation of that 
process

congressional democrats wrestling with 
president bushs fiscal 1990 budget are trying to put white house 
officials on the defensive by forcing them to admit they cant 
explain how new initiatives will be paid for 
budget director richard g darman and transportation secretary 
samuel k skinner dispatched to capitol hill on wednesday to sell 
bushs 116 trillion spending proposal became the latest victims 
of the democrats strategy 
each man ran into hostile questioning from democrats seeking to 
learn which programs bush wants to cut in order to pay for the 
spending increases he is seeking 
skinner told the house transportation appropriations subcommittee 
that bushs proposals to boost the budgets of the coast guard and 
the federal aviation administration should come out of somebody 
elses pot 
bush is seeking to boost the coast guards budget for antidrug 
efforts by 9 percent next year to 690 million he also wants to 
enable the faa to hire more air traffic controllers and safety 
inspectors and to modernize its equipment and make other 
improvements by increasing its budget 16 percent to 66 billion 
transportation has paid long enough skinner told the 
lawmakers 
but this prompted rep william h gray iii one of the houses 
democratic leaders and a former budget committee chairman to press 
him on where the additional money would come from 
youd want it to come out of interior or education or somebody 
elses committee gray told the cabinet member we all want to 
go and give wonderful statements about wonderful new spending 
programs we want but we all point our fingers and say lets take 
it from another pot 
at a hearing held by the house budget committee white house 
budget director richard darman fended off democratic attempts to 
define the specific spending levels bush seeks for various domestic 
programs 
in a spirited exchange with rep barbara boxer dcalif darman 
refused to say how much money the president seeks for programs such 
as care for poor pregnant women veterans education mass transit 
or even the job training partnership act the bill bush cited in 
choosing dan quayle for his vice presidential nomination 
president bushs position is that he wants to negotiate the 
answer to that and you dont like that apparently darman said 
boxer told darman that while bushs proposals to increase some 
spending in some areas we havent really seen the bad parts 
in the budget he presented to congress on feb 9 bush proposed 
allowing defense spending to grow at the rate of inflation and 
giving slight boosts to several priority areas such as acid rain and 
scientific research he made no cuts in social security and proposed 
no general tax increases but did seek limited tax extensions new 
user fees and asset sales to bring in about 17 billion in new 
revenue next year 
perhaps most infuriating to the democrats however was his 
creation of what lawmakers have dubbed the black box bush 
proposed limiting more than 1000 programs mostly in domestic 
areas to the 136 billion spent for them this year and left it to 
congress to decide how the money would be distributed 
budget committee chairman leon panetta criticized darman for 
outlining options but not bush choices in the hundreds of pages of 
documents he was presenting to congress 
there have been too many games played with the deficit issue in 
the past panetta said my concern is when you strip the 
rhetoric aside some of the same games are being played

the promise of a quick refund is prompting more 
and more americans to have their tax returns filed electronically 
leading the irs to hope that the paper return will soon become a 
thing of the past for millions 
through last week the internal revenue service had received 
510000 returns electronically almost as many as were filed in all 
of 1988 only 120000 electronic returns were filed during the 
comparable period last year the irs expects as many as 2 million by 
the time this years filing season ends on april 17 
electronic filing is available this year in 36 states but only to 
taxpayers who are expecting a refund and whose returns are prepared 
by a professional if you like you may avoid another bit of 
paperwork by having your refund deposited electronically into your 
bank account 
next year electronic filing will be available in all 50 states 
but if irs planners have their way that will be only the beginning 
they are researching the feasibility of 
allowing taxpayers who dont get refunds about 22 percent of 
all filers to file electronically they would pay the balance due 
with a credit card but that would require congressional approval 
permitting taxpayers to file directly from their home computer 
into the irs computer this would require perfection of computer 
software and a system of protecting the privacy of the electronic 
return 
an electronic return usually produces a refund check within about 
18 days compared with five or six weeks for a paper return the irs 
benefits too from fewer errors and less paperwork over 10 years 
the irs anticipates electronic filing will save 200 million in 
processing costs 
if 18 days is too long to wait for a refund many professional 
preparers are offering refundanticipation loans 
for example dollar dry dock bank of new york has a 40state 
network that produces a refund check within three to five days the 
return can be prepared by the taxpayer by dollar dry dock 
professionals or any preparer just filing the return not filling 
it out costs 45 
the bank sends a check for the refund to the taxpayer who in 
effect is getting an interestfree loan until the irs check arrives 
hampr block which prepares more tax returns than any other 
company offers refundanticipation loans at about 3000 of its 
7500 outlets most of the branches of jackson hewitt tax service 
another large franchise preparer offer the instant refund 
the irs said wednesday that it had received 241 million returns 
electronic and paper through last week compared with 235 
million during the same period in 1988 this represents a reversal 
of the trend of the last several years when the number of early 
filers dropped each year 
about 109 million returns are expected this year 
the irs had processed 105 million returns by last weekend an 11 
percent improvement over the 1988 pace of fewer than 95 million 
the number of refunds is up 97 percent this year from 38 
million to almost 42 million the refunds averaged 805 compared 
with 782 during the same period last year

aflcio president lane kirkland defended 
teamsters leaders set for trial next week and dismissed a question 
about whether using showgirls as hostesses for a union reception 
reflected poorly on labors image 
kirkland addressed the questions wednesday after the president of 
the union that held the reception the national association of 
letter carriers said he thought the women would help improve 
the image of his union 
dont you take some things too seriously kirkland said when 
asked about the monday night gathering at which two women in body 
tights and mesh tops greeted guests mostly union officials and 
posed for photographs with some of them 
earlier vincent r sombrotto president of the 315000member 
nalc said i think it improves the image of the letter 
carriers when asked about the hostesses 
several women labor officials at the aflcios annual convention 
here complained privately tuesday and wednesday about the hostesses 
including one who said she found it hypocritical for the union 
leaders to promote expanded child care and parental leave policies 
designed to help working parents 
kirkland at his daily briefing renewed his attack on the 
governments use of racketeering laws to seek to take over the 
teamsters union 
the suit set for trial next week alleges the union for years 
has been influenced by organized crime and names as defendants most 
of the unions leadership including president william mccarthy 
but kirkland while not disputing mob influence in the union in 
the past said i do not think it is a problem of any significance 
in the teamsters at this moment 
and he complained anew that the use of the racketeering statute 
was inappropriate and there are other laws that call for the removal 
of any union official convicted of most felonies 
i think the approach of a government trying to put a labor 
organization under trusteeship is a violation of the basic principle 
of freedom of association kirkland said 
the labor federations executive council which has a light 
agenda today and friday focused on international affairs wednesday 
issuing four statements condemning antilabor efforts by the 
governments of chile burma korea and poland 
the weeklong meeting has been a relatively lowkey event not 
unusual for a postelection year much of the focus has been on the 
threatened strike at eastern airlines by 9000 members of the 
international association of machinists 
the planned march 4 walkout has kept aflcio officials busy 
arranging for other unions to support the machinists while at the 
same time asking president bush to delay the strike deadline by 
naming an emergency board to mediate the dispute 
on wednesday however eastern pilots issued a statement saying 
they would cross machinist union picket lines if theres a strike 
provided the troubled carriers owner grants them concessions in 
their own contract 
kirkland and other council members were attending a rally late 
today with eastern machinists based in miami the airlines 
headquarters

president bushs ethics commission says top 
officials in all three branches of government should curtail their 
outside income stop taking speaking fees resign from corporate 
boards and disclose more of their personal finances 
in its third meeting the eightmember panel on wednesday 
tentatively backed some of the toughest new rules and laws it has 
suggested to date if adopted however the recommendations would 
fall most heavily on congress because panel members repeatedly 
opted for applying already stiffer executive branch standards to all 
of government 
the commissions final recommendations are due on bushs desk 
march 9 
the mood of the session was captured by chairman malcolm r 
wilkey in a comment about banning corporate board memberships vice 
chairman griffin bell the former attorney general pointed out that 
judges have been allowed for 25 years to remain on the board of 
familyowned corporations 
wilkey former federal appellate judge replied it has to be 
changed a man just has to decide whether he wants to be a judge or 
not that rule fit the ethos of 25 years ago but not now 
both wilkey and bell recently persuaded bushs chief ethics 
adviser white house counsel c boyden gray to resign as board 
chairman of his familyowned communications company 
the panel agreed that senior officials of all three branches of 
government should be barred from accepting fees for speeches and 
articles whether or not they get a pay raise 
the evil of honoraria is so great from the appearance of a 
conflict of interest said bell in proposing a ban on the fees 
people wonder whos paying all these honoraria it undermines 
confidence in government 
all eight members agreed though they debated and decided against 
coupling this recommendation with backing for a pay raise 
under enormous public pressure congress recently voted down 50 
percent pay raises for the governments top officials that 
recommendation from the quadrennial commission and presidents reagan 
and bush was coupled with a proposal that members of congress stop 
taking honoraria 
the only former congressman on the ethics panel former sen 
harrison schmitt of new mexico said as a practical matter there 
is no way to divorce these issues from the salary issue a salary 
recommendation has been made but as we can all see it cant be 
implemented 
but former white house counsel lloyd cutler who chaired the 
quadrennial commission disagreed honoraria cannot be justified 
by saying that salaries are too low salaries should be dealt with 
directly 
chairman malcolm r wilkey a former federal appellate judge 
summed up the consensus the practice of honoraria has become 
evil well let others deal with pay questions 
this change if adopted would have a larger impact on congress 
than the executive branch executive branch rules already prohibit 
any honoraria for speeches or articles written about the area of 
ones federal job so very few are offered 
members of congress however may accept honoraria for speaking 
or writing on their congressional duties and special interest 
groups frequently give them large speaking fees the house allows 
members to receive honoraria up to 30 percent of salary and the 
senate up to 40 percent of salary members of both houses are paid 
89500 a year 
the ethics panel also agreed that the total outside earned income 
of top officials in all three branches of government should be 
limited to 15 percent of salary again this is the current 
executive branch standard and is lower than that used in congress 
bush has gone further saying he wants his top officials to receive 
no outside earned income 
on financial disclosure the panel agreed to recommend more 
reporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets and 
income members suggested an end to current exemptions from 
reporting home mortgages and debts to relatives with bell 
commenting im more worried about what a man owes than what he 
owns 
panel members also agreed that officials should disclose whether 
any of their assets are worth more than 1 million reporting now 
cuts off after 250000 and should disclose if their income is 
more than 250000 compared to the current top limit of 100000 
at the same time they recommended that smaller categories on 
disclosure forms be consolidated somewhat as wilkey put this 
question whats the effective difference whether an asset is 
worth 5000 to 15000 or worth 15000 to 50000 why not just 
5000 to 50000 
the panel agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofit 
boards should be subject to approval by ethics officers 
if i were the secretary of defense and i was on the boy scout 
board theyd have more money than they know what to do with id 
make just 10 phone calls the secretary of defense is too 
powerful bell said 
the panel also agreed that the government should have a uniform 
rule on accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists panel 
members preferred the executive branch standard which basically 
bars acceptance of the free meals the senate allows its members to 
accept meals under 50 while house members can accept those under 
35

oliver norths lawyers in the irancontra case 
are trying to blunt charges that he lied to congress by suggesting 
that he had good reason to think lawmakers couldnt be trusted with 
government secrets 
but under crossexamination rep lee hamilton dind 
steadfastly defended the record of the house intelligence committee 
in protecting some of the nations most wellkept secrets 
hamilton the panels former chairman testified wednesday that 
for 18 months before the irancontra affair became public he relied 
on white house denials that north was secretly helping the 
nicaraguan rebels despite a congressional ban on such aid 
i relied on what col north told me hamilton said of an aug 
6 1986 meeting the intelligence panel had with north then a 
national security council aide in the white house situation room 
i believed what col north told me at the meeting i did not 
think there was any credible evidence to the contrary hamilton 
said 
the congressman also said that in 1985 he accepted as 
accurate honest and correct thennational security adviser 
robert mcfarlanes assurances that north was not raising money for 
the contras or giving them tactical military advice as prohibited by 
the socalled boland amendment of 1984 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel is charged with 12 
felonies arising from the irancontra affair that could result in 60 
years imprisonment upon conviction 
among other things he is accused of obstructing congressional 
inquiries into his efforts to raise money for the nicaraguan rebels 
this allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helping 
mcfarlane who has pleaded guilty to withholding information from 
congress draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries 
crossexamining hamilton defense attorney brendan v sullivan 
jr argued that north rightly feared congress couldnt be trusted to 
keep secrets because it leaked like a sieve 
from 1984 1985 and 1986 leaks occurred on capitol hill as a 
result of members and staff members who provided information 
sullivan said 
the late cia director william casey told me he didnt know 
a single leak from the house intelligence committee hamilton 
replied i will not deny leaks but neither can i prove any such 
leaks 
asked about a newspaper report containing classified information 
that appeared the very next day after the panel was briefed by 
the cia hamilton said he had only a cloudy recollection of the 
incident 
i dont assume for a moment that the leak came from the 
congress hamilton added there are some very experienced people 
in the administration who leak information after it comes to the 
congress 
he also denied threatening to leak cia information himself in a 
jan 16 1985 letter to thensecretary of state george p shultz 
i did not threaten to leak anything hamilton said i was 
prepared to follow certain procedures of the house intelligence 
committee to try to release information 
if i had succeeded in that it would have been an authorized 
disclosure and not a leak hamilton said describing an elaborate 
procedure by which the house would meet secretly to discuss 
releasing sensitive information 
the matter was dropped hamilton said after shultz met with him 
and said he agreed with my point of view 
hamilton conceded sullivans suggestion that norths prosecution 
is a product in one sense of the controversy that existed between 
the congress and the executive branch in 1984 1985 and 1986 
sullivan tried to show that north cant be faulted for his 
statements to the intelligence panel because they were made in an 
informal setting when no transcript was kept and no oath to tell the 
truth was administered 
even though it was called an informal meeting its an official 
meeting of the committee hamilton responded 
we did not administer oaths during my period of chairmanship of 
the intelligence committee until the very end of 1986 after the 
irancontra affair had become public hamilton said

the latest update on the federal budget shows 
the deficit for the first four months of fiscal 1989 was smaller 
than during the comparable period a year earlier but analysts 
expect the good news wont last 
the treasury department reported wednesday that for the first 
four months of fiscal 1989 which began oct 1 the budget gap was 
648 billion 23 percent smaller than for the comparable period in 
fiscal 1988 
economists nevertheless expect the fiscal 1989 deficit to exceed 
the 1551 billion shortfall posted in 1988 as interest rates rise 
and the pace of spending increases 
the bush administration is projecting the deficit will hit 1633 
billion which would be a 53 percent increase from the level of red 
ink in fiscal 1988 
economist paul denoon of manufacturers hanover trust co in new 
york said the fiscal 1989 deficit is likely to be in the 160 
billion165 billion range 
as we get later in the year well start seeing some stronger 
outlay figures denoon said he said expenses associated with the 
financial failures in the savings and loan industry and rising 
interest rates will contribute to the larger deficit 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in congressional 
testimony this week indicated the central bank was likely to 
continue to push up interest rates in an effort to slow economic 
growth and thus restrain inflation 
worries about inflation were heightened by the release wednesday 
of the consumer price index for january which posted a 06 percent 
increase 
the government actually posted a 28 billion surplus in january 
due to a surge in revenue caused by quarterly tax payments from 
individuals 
government revenues reached 894 billion last month up 93 
percent from the same period a year earlier spending meanwhile 
was up 314 percent from january 1988 to 866 billion 
spending in january 1988 had been artificially low because social 
security checks which normally go out on the third day of that 
month were mailed out on dec 31 because of the new years holiday 
the change in benefits payments resulted in a 159 billion surplus 
in january 1988 
the biggest government spending categories last month were the 
military social security other programs in the department of 
health and human services interest on the national debt and farm 
subsidies 
military spending totaled 193 billion last month and 966 
billion for the past four months up 33 percent from the yearago 
period 
interest on the national debt totaled 159 billion in january 
and 842 billion for the first four months of the fiscal year up 
111 percent from a year earlier 
spending for social security was 18 billion in january and 726 
billion so far in the fiscal year up 57 percent from the 
comparable period in fiscal 1988 
other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid cost 135 
billion in january and 535 billion for the first four months of 
fiscal 1989 up 59 percent from the comparable period a year 
earlier 
spending by the agriculture department totaled 46 billion last 
month and 206 billion so far this fiscal year down 22 percent 
from a year earlier

laughter rose from opposition 
seats when the acting head of state opened the current session of 
parliament by proclaiming the governments commitment to clean 
administration 
the speech by chris heunis substituting for ailing president 
pw botha came a week after three members of the governing 
national party quit parliament because of links to unrelated 
scandals 
in the ensuing three weeks one of those men has gone to prison 
for electoral fraud and a former member of bothas cabinet was 
described by an inquiry commission as unfit to hold any office 
this week 10 education and development officials were suspended 
for alleged financial misconduct and the cabinet minister who 
oversees them was criticized for incompetence 
a separate ongoing inquiry is examining the affairs of albert 
vermaas a pretoria businessman suspected of foreign exchange 
irregularities vermaas has entertained senior government officials 
at his home and private game farm 
opposition parties on the right and left have condemned bothas 
administration for failing to prevent corruption at a time when many 
south africans are hard hit by inflation and high taxes 
even state radio has called for tougher anticorruption measures 
the simultaneous emergence of irregular practices in different 
areas has created a grossly distorted impression of rampant 
corruption the south african broadcasting corp said in a 
commentary wednesday however the underlying reality remains that 
too many serious shortcomings have been shown to exist 
zach de beer leader of the antiapartheid progressive federal 
party said the prevalence of corruption stems from the complex 
bureaucratic structures of apartheid and the white minority 
governments penchant for secrecy 
he said much of the corruption has been connected to the four 
nominally independent black homelands where impoverished residents 
have been governed by authoritarian south africanbacked leaders 
from the beginning the nonviability of these areas had to be 
dealt with by the payment of large subsidies said de beer but 
because of their alleged independence no proper control could be 
exercised over this handout of money 
another major factor behind the corruption according to 
government critics is the official encouragement of clandestine 
business dealings as part of the nationwide effort to circumvent 
economic sanctions imposed on south africa 
brian pottinger in a new book about bothas first decade in 
power 197888 writes that government officials have grown 
increasingly accustomed to lavish fringe benefits he says taxpayers 
in 1988 paid twice as much to finance perks for bureaucrats than the 
government spent on education for the black majority 
the three parliament members who resigned during the last week in 
january were 
manpower minister pietie du plessis who is being investigated 
for property transactions involving his department that may have 
benefitted his son despite leaving under a cloud he is due to 
receive a onetime 100000 payment and a 50000 annual pension 
leon de beer who last week began a twoyear prison term for 
engaging in electoral fraud in his 1987 campaign in johannesburgs 
hillbrow district 
peet de pontes a central figure in an investigation of fraud 
corruption and perjury in connection with efforts to smuggle a 
convicted mafia drug financier from italy into the black homeland of 
ciskei 
in early february a judicial commission recommended that 
amichand rajbansi a former cabinet minister never be appointed to 
any official post the commission was investigating alleged 
irregularities in the indian chamber of parliament which rajbansi 
formerly led 
the scandals have extended into the private sector 
sol kerzner a businessman who established a regional network of 
gambling resorts resigned feb 8 from all his executive positions 
after acknowledging that he paid a 1 million bribe to protect his 
companys gambling rights in transkei another black homeland 
business day the countrys leading financial newspaper said the 
environment for corruption was created 10 years ago when botha 
halted a major judicial inquiry into alleged misappropriation of 
government funds 
he tried to wrap south africa in secrecy and he has instead 
wrapped it in shame the newspaper said in an editorial this 
month the way to repair the damage is to enforce the law a 
government which does not do that is plainly unfit to govern

the fbi says the university of michigan law 
schools decision to ban its recruiters because of a discrimination 
case will deprive the agency of applicants able to handle civil 
rights cases 
how are we to get top quality fbi agents on board if we are not 
allowed to come on to top quality campuses milt ahlerich 
assistant fbi director for congressional and public affairs said 
wednesday 
lee bollinger dean of the university of michigan law school 
said wednesday by telephone he imposed the ban in december after the 
fbi lost a classaction discrimination suit in texas brought by 
hispanic agents the ban will last through the end of the school 
year in may 
the discrimination suit was filed by fbi agent bernardo matias 
perez on behalf of 311 hispanic agents us district judge lucius 
d bunton who found last september that the fbi had discriminated 
against the hispanic agents is holding a hearing to determine how 
much the fbi should pay them as compensation for denial of 
promotions and assignments to unrewarding and hazardous duties the 
agents are seeking 92 million 
bollinger said students at the law school had brought the case to 
his attention in september saying it was in violation of our 
placement antidiscrimination policy for such an organization to 
be allowed to recruit at the school 
of the fbis 9500 agents about 1300 graduated from law 
schools he said over the past three years the fbi has hired about 
1855 special agents of whom about 320 or 17 percent are trained 
in law according to figures provided by ahlerich 
if the bureau is to be sensitive and particularly able to 
handle challenges of sophisticated crime problems that we have in 
this country today including handling of civil rights

lawrence b gibbs is sounding much the same in 
his final days as irs commissioner as he did when he took over 2 
years ago praising the agencys overall performance and promising 
better service for taxpayers 
we arent there yet but i would like to suggest we have a 
good start gibbs told the senate finance oversight subcommittee 
on wednesday 
critics are sounding familiar themes as well the internal 
revenue service needs to exercise greater control over its farflung 
offices says the general accounting office 
and if the irs doesnt replace the aging computer system that it 
uses to process tax returns theres going to be a train wreck 
said sen david pryor dark subcommittee chairman 
on that point pryor gao and gibbs agree 
we are dealing with a system that is from the ice age 
gibbs said it cannot be upgraded and replacement will cost 
billions of dollars and take a decade gibbs added 
pryor mentioned an estimate of 11 billion gao suggested 3 
billion to 4 billion might be closer 
pryor convened the subcommittee to review a gao report from last 
october which surveyed actions aimed at improving service from the 
irs in addition to calling for a modernized computer system and 
greater attention by irs headquarters to its field offices the 
report said the tax agency must improve its own accounting processes 
and methods of evaluating its services 
the report said the relatively low wages paid irs employees 
hinders improvement of its services 
if the agency cannot attract highly qualified people it will 
find itself at a disadvantage in dealing with lawyers and 
accountants from private firms said gene l dodaro of gao 
gibbs who is leaving the irs in 10 days agreed with every gao 
recommendation in the report he made these points 
taxpayer correspondence this is not acceptable gibbs said 
of a survey finding the irs made errors in responding to 30 percent 
of the letters taxpayers had written about their accounts it is 
not a computer thats going to solve this problem its our quality 
control 
tax deposits when he took office gibbs said the irs was 
making about 120000 mistakes a month in handling deposits of tax 
collections by employers and others now he said the error rate is 
4000 per month 
telephone queries another gao survey found that irs personnel 
gave the correct answer to only 64 percent of telephoned tax 
questions a year ago down from 85 percent in 1982 one reason for 
the wrong answers gao said was the failure of irs employees to 
probe questioners for more information 
you cant have employees asking questions indefinitely before 
they give answers gibbs said noting it would require 42 
questions to cover every possibility in responding to a query about 
personal exemptions 
telephone fee no decision had been made on whether to charge 
taxpayers for calling the irs with questions gibbs said president 
bushs budget proposes a twoyear test of such charges a proposal 
that has been greeted with scorn in congress 
taxpayer rights we are doing everything we can possibly do 
to implement a new bill of rights for taxpayers involved in 
disputes with the irs gibbs said he said he had just signed a 
newsletter designed to acquaint all irs employees with the new law

heavy turnover in the governments indian 
affairs bureau has created a bureaucratic nightmare and official 
neglect of child sexual abuse cases on reservations witnesses at a 
special senate hearing say 
i was put there to keep the administrative portion going 
robert delaware acting chief of social services for the bureau of 
indian affairs testified wednesday delaware told senate panelists 
he was the sixth acting chief in the social services division since 
august 1986 and was unfamiliar with sex abuse cases 
i dont care if you are acting director for one day or three 
months the impression you leave is that it is not your job leave 
it to someone else sen thomas daschle dsd angrily responded 
i can understand the frustration of the people on the 
reservation daschle said were failing at this 
linda guy social services specialist in the bia told the 
special panel of the senate select committee on indian affairs there 
have been so many changes in leadership in the division that it is 
nearly impossible to handle child sex abuse cases 
margaret allen child welfare supervisor for tribal services in 
the gila river indian community in arizona said she has never been 
able to find an official within the bia or the indian health service 
responsible for treating sex offenders 
witnesses also said investigation of sex abuse allegations is 
difficult 
penny coleman attorney advisor in the solicitors office of the 
interior department said the fbi rather than local police 
investigate the crimes on reservations she said the fbi lacks 
specific training for handling child abuse cases and has 
comparatively small staffs for the volume of work in indian crime 
other witnesses said the problem of child abuse was compounded by 
jurisdictional problems the isolation of the reservations and a 
simple lack of money 
dr jane burnley director of the office for victims of crime in 
the justice department said child sex abuse is not inherently worse 
among indians than in the rest of society 
but the federal government which has jurisdiction over indian 
reservations lacks mechanisms to respond to the problems the way 
states do she said after her testimony 
dr eidell wasserman director of a special child sexual abuse 
project on the hopi reservation in arizona said that for the last 
10 months she has been trying to find money to keep her program from 
going out of business 
the project was set up in 1987 to treat members of the 
reservation who were victims of a former teacher in the bia school 
who molested 142 boys during a 9year period 
after the teacher was convicted and imprisoned the federal 
government provided 200000 for therapy and other programs but the 
funding is set to expire in june 
some of the boys who were abused now have become offenders 
compounding the original problems brought on by the teachers 
actions said wasserman 
burnley said victims compensation has grown tremendously as a 
way of funding treatment for victims of child abuse in the states 
but not in indian country she told the committee 
she said about 2 million for fiscal 1989 was earmarked by the 
federal government for such cases among indians and indians are 
eligible to apply to state governments for money from their victims 
funds but she said indian reservations are usually in remote areas 
where communications and transportation are poor making therapy 
much more difficult than in other parts of society

neither time nor missing records nor an 
addressee named smith nor lack of a zip code could stop the final 
two letters in a sack of world war ii mail from reaching their 
destination 
the two letters from sgt clarence f smith were delivered 
wednesday to his brother norman t smith of henderson md in a 
ceremony marking completion of the deliveries clarence smith a 
tailgunner killed in action over italy had written the letters to 
his mother and a friend 
the letters were the last of 235 pieces of wartime mail to be 
delivered after their discovery in an attic in raleigh nc in 
1986 
the postal service spent 30 months tracking down the servicemen 
or their relatives to deliver the letters 
thanks to the efforts of many caring people veterans 
reporters and postal employees at all levels we were able to find 
sergeant smiths brother and to return these last letters from world 
war ii postmaster general anthony m frank said at the washington 
ceremony 
smiths letters and those from 91 other servicemen were 
discovered in an old army duffel bag in the attic of an elderly 
north carolina womans home by an exterminator 
the bag had been hidden by the womans nephew and contained 
letters written in may 1944 by gis bound for algeria aboard the 
troop ship caleb strong the postal service said a homebound 
serviceman had promised to mail the letters for his shipmates but 
never did 
smiths letters were the hardest to deliver the postal service 
said because smith is such a common name they did not have his 
full name and some of his military records apparently had been 
destroyed in a fire at the federal records center in st louis 
another veteran pierre jj kennedy of the 781st bomb squadron 
association who was asked to assist located information about 
smith through the national archives listings of missing air crew 
reports from world war ii 
he found that smith was a tailgunner on a b17 flying fortress 
bomber who was shot down and killed in action on a mission over 
verona italy on july 6 1944 he located smiths mothers old 
address in philadelphia and through neighbors learned of smiths 
brother

americas back door has a new lock and no 
welcome mat central americans applying for political asylum are 
learning here this week 
fewer than 1 percent who have tried to obtain refugee status have 
received it and more than 100 have been jailed under a gettough 
policy that began tuesday to weed out frivolous applications 
before the immigrants travel farther into the country 
immigration and naturalization service officials said wednesday 
it was too early to declare a trend but the sharp drop in 
applicants from 233 on tuesday to 51 the next indicated the plan 
was deterring unqualified applications 
we can only speculate that the word has gotten out and many of 
those coming for purely economic reasons are not coming any more 
said ins harlingen district spokeswoman virginia kice 
but immigration attorney linda yanez said immigrants will merely 
go underground 
my guess is that most people are probably going to just take 
their chances and get apprehended said ms yanez who helped 
organize attorneys to provide free representation for those denied 
asylum under the new program 
if they get apprehended ms yanez said then theyre 
before an immigration judge to submit asylum applications where 
theyre going to get a fair hearing as opposed to this kangaroo 
court that theyre conducting over there 
the new oneday adjudication policy calls for the immediate 
arrest and detention of rejected asylum applicants who are placed 
in deportation proceedings and kept in a detention center 
of more than 300 who applied the first two days only 2 were 
granted refugee status tuesday and none made the grade wednesday 
ins commissioner alan c nelson said the intent of the new policy 
was to deter 100000 central americans who he said otherwise would 
enter the southern tip of texas this year with unfounded asylum 
claims 
but immigration officials said some central americans may try to 
cross into the united states west of the brownsville area where 
patrols have not been stepped up 
the border patrol has added 160 agents to brownsville which lies 
at the states southern tip 15 miles southwest of here 
processing of asylum applications previously took weeks and 
involved relaying information to and from washington immigrants who 
were denied asylum were freed on their own recognizance while 
awaiting appeals or deportation 
political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution ins 
officials contend that most central americans are here to better 
themselves economically and do not qualify for asylum 
more than 40000 people have applied for asylum in southern texas 
since the ins noted a dramatic increase in central american 
applicants last spring a total of 631 applied monday the last day 
they could travel farther into the united states to pursue their 
cases 
the agency has added extra staff and brought in state department 
officials to issue onthespot asylum decisions officials say it 
will take several weeks to bring 500 federal workers to the area to 
fully implement the program 
the ins said 118 single adults denied asylum on tuesday were 
detained at the ins port isabel service processing center a 
minimumsecurity prison 15 miles from the border city of 
brownsville they were held for deportation under bonds of 1000 to 
4000 and issued orange prison jumpsuits 
for richard jesus rivera prison ended a fiveday journey from 
his home in ulsulutan el salvador 
i dont have the money for the bond but i hope that my aunt in 
new york might be able to send it to me i dont want to go back to 
el salvador because there is too much danger because of the fighting 
and besides there arent any jobs rivera said wednesday 
single adults are kept in the prison while family groups are 
sent to an american red cross shelter in brownsville where they 
must answer daily roll calls under the auspices of the justice 
departments community relations service 
the two granted asylum the first day were a 32yearold former 
construction worker from managua who plans to settle in miami and 
a 65yearold nicaraguan businessman and accountant living in 
brownsville according to the ins 
it was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria 
and if they were forced to return to their country they faced a 
wellfounded fear of persecution said ms kice the ins 
spokeswoman

the navy has been cleared of allegations it 
mistreated dolphins and sea lions being trained for various 
underwater surveillance duties 
the marine mammal commission review team after what it described 
as an extensive survey of navy facilities and practices sharply 
criticized a former navy trainer and other unidentified sources who 
charged in november the service was guilty of animal abuse 
the review team found the allegations to be substantively 
lacking states the commissions report released wednesday by the 
navy 
the team concluded that allegations had been put forward in 
such a way as to create an inaccurate picture the report 
continued 
furthermore the team concluded that had the sole motivation 
underlying the allegations been concern for the health welfare and 
care of the animals the former trainer would have made better use 
than he did of the navys animal care committee 
the program now includes about 115 animals the majority of them 
dolphins and the remainder of them beluga whales the service trains 
the mammals to detect enemy scuba divers and to hunt for underwater 
mines the program began more than 20 years ago

a decision by the federal communications 
commission to let tv stations buy exclusive rights to syndicated 
programs will create chaos in the cable channels a representative 
of the cable industry says 
the fcc on wednesday upheld its may 1988 decision to readopt 
syndicated exclusivity intended to give broadcasters the right 
to retain exclusive rights for programming they buy 
under the rules only the local tv station that buys the rights 
to a particular program can air that program in the local market 
the station can prevent a local cable operator from showing the 
program carried by an outoftown station 
in a statement following the fccs action james p mooney 
president of the national cable television association said the 
rules will lead to widespread program blackouts and substantial 
viewer confusion and frustration 
for example he said a cable company operator will have to black 
out a syndicated program star trek for example from an 
outoftown station if a local station holds the rights 
the impact of this on consumers will be that if youre 
expecting a popular show like star trek to be on an outoftown 
channel at 7 pm it wont be there he said some filler 
program or a blank screen will be there instead and if the 
cable operator finds it too impractical to make all the deletions 
and additions he may be forced to drop the outoftown channel 
entirely 
syndication refers to the free marketing of programs usually 
discontinued network series 
in its decision wednesday the fcc also extended the date for 
compliance from aug 18 to dec 31 to give the cable and broadcast 
industries more time to prepare for the new arrangement 
cable operators had wanted more time to prepare for the change 
arguing that new switching equipment will be necessary to make the 
program deletions and find available programming to fill the holes 
created by the rules 
broadcasters however wanted a shorter transition time saying 
substitute programming is already available and the electronic 
switching equipment is readily available

social workers say a us supreme court 
ruling that protects them from lawsuits for failing to prevent child 
abuse means more cases will be reported but critics say it denies 
children their constitutional rights 
the court ruled wednesday that the state of wisconsin was not 
liable for the injuries of 9yearold joshua deshaney who was left 
permanently brain damaged and physically disabled from beatings by 
his father beginning in 1983 
the boys mother melody deshaney sued the department for 
allegedly violating the boys constitutional rights by failing to 
prevent the abuse 
the lawsuit contended social workers failed to take action 
despite their suspicions the boy had been abused several times by 
his father randy before the child was hospitalized in march 1984 
the boy remains institutionalized in the custody of the winnebago 
county department of social services 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the states awareness of the abuse did not mean it had a duty to 
protect him because he was not in the custody of the state at the 
time 
while the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua 
faced in the free world it played no part in their creation nor did 
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them 
rehnquist said 
tom birch counsel for the national child abuse coalition in 
washington dc said the decision should have a positive effect 
on child protective services throughout the country 
birch and others in child abuse prevention said the ruling 
alleviates social workers fears of being sued and that a ruling 
against the workers could have affected their judgment in reporting 
cases 
when they are not held to the high standard of liability this 
case imposes they will have the flexibility they need to protect 
the child when appropriate birch said 
others however said the courts 63 decision weakens programs 
designed to prevent child abuse 
elaine olson executive director of the wisconsin childrens 
trust fund said the decision threatens the safety of children in 
abusive environments 
essentially what theyre the court saying is that children 
have no protection under the constitution olson said the 
purpose of child protective services is to get child abuse cases to 
authorities who can do something about them 
joshuas case was brought to the departments attention in 1983 
when he was hospitalized for cuts and bruises the boy was returned 
to his fathers custody and social worker ann kenmeter visited 
several times the boys mother was living in cheyenne wyo 
on march 7 1984 kenmeter visited the home but did not see the 
boy she was told the boy had fainted in the bathroom days earlier 
for no apparent reason 
kenmeter did not ask to see the boy according to court records 
joshua was hospitalized a day later for head injuries that 
destroyed half his brain court records show 
randy deshaney was convicted of two counts of child abuse and 
sentenced to two prison terms of two years each he was released 
after 2 years 
the supreme court ruled that even though the boy was in 
protective custody resulting from an earlier incident in the home 
the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an 
individuals safety by having once offered him shelter 
we conclude that a states failure to protect an individual 
against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of 
the constitutions due process clause the court said 
joining rehnquist were justices byron white john paul stevens 
sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
in dissent justice harry a blackmun wrote poor joshua it is 
a sad commentary upon american life and consitutional principles 
that this child joshua deshaney now is assigned to live out the 
remainder of his life profoundly retarded and without the ability 
to sue the state 
joining blackmun in the dissent were justices william j brennan 
and thurgood marshall

considerable degree and can feel honorable to ourselves we will 
have struck a real blow for freedom

gathering in cambridge mass where rushdie had been scheduled to 
read from his novel wednesday night rushdies promotional tour was 
canceled when he went into hiding 
we are here to be with rushdie carroll told more than 100

lets guarantee that all of our libraries remain intact 
weve got hitler and gengis khan and lyndon baines johnson up there 
but we dont take them off the shelves bradbury said theyre 
all monsters in their own way but we learn from the monsters of 
history 
in both boston and new york demonstrators rallied in front of b 
dalton and barnes amp noble bookstores 
those bookstore chains which are under common ownership had 
pulled the book from their shelves last week however they reversed 
themselves later wednesday and said they would have the satanic 
verses in stock in about 10 days 
the decision was made at the urging of an overwhelming majority 
of store managers and employees according to a statement 
the waldenbooks chain the nations largest continued its policy 
of not displaying the book but selling it on request the new york 
times reported in todays editions however that because some of 
the 1200store chains managers objected to the ban waldenbooks 
president quietly sent a memo friday giving them the option of 
displaying the book 
in san francisco vandals spraypainted the word cowards on 
the windows of a b dalton and a waldenbooks store in birmingham

its the most important issue in my lifetime as an american 
writer said talese

coresponsibility with rushdie she read a statement from 
rushdies americanborn wife writer marianne wiggins who is in 
hiding with her husband 
writers everywhere have been weighed and measured by the edict 
from iran ms wiggins said we are a dangerous breed and always 
have been because words outlive their authors only fear can 
stop a writers writing only fear can stop a book from being sold 
about 25 moslems protested across the street carrying signs 
reading satanic verses is blasphemous and rushdie is a friend 
of satan 
at the protest march nearly 300 writers gathered in the rain 
across the street from the iranian mission carrying such signs as 
respect our religion freedom of speech and free speech is 
fundamental

a soviet ballet company that was left on shaky 
footing when its original backers pulled out made its new york debut 
thanks to an outpouring of support from the business and dance world 
lead dancer vadim pisarev said wednesday nights performance was 
everything the group had hoped for 
we got a 10minute standing ovation everything went very well 
we are extremely pleased he said 
new york arts patron howard gilman averting an embarrassing 
international incident mobilized the business and dance worlds when 
the donetsk ballets original backers bailed out in midtour 
leaving the visiting performers stranded and penniless in baltimore 
these people started out in baltimore eating pizzas donated by 
theater ushers gilman said i think everybody understood there 
was something more at stake than just a company that wasnt able to 
perform it was everyones reputation 
businesses ballet lovers and even a new jersey firehouse pitched 
in with free meals cash and messages of hope the artistic director 
of the american ballet theatre mikhail baryshnikov provided 
technical and moral support eliot feld founder of the feld ballet 
treated the dancers to dinner 
with the help of icm artists a concert management firm based 
in new york city gilman booked the donetsk into new yorks city 
center with a wednesday night debut future appearances were 
scheduled at the national theater in washington and the shubert 
theater in philadelphia 
we were doing what ordinarily cant be done putting together 
an engagement and a tour in less than a week most often it takes 
six months or a year gilman said this disaster was about to 
happen and i thought someone should do something 
the donetsk is a lesserknown but wellregarded classical company 
from the ukraine with 59 dancers most under age 25 plus a handful 
of support staff 
the first performance was feb 2 in baltimore on a tour that was 
also to include columbus ohio detroit chicago kansas city mo 
and other cities 
disaster struck feb 5 when the californiabased promoter heart 
of art announced that californian and mexican investors had 
withheld 200000 because dancers from betterknown companies like 
the kirov ballet couldnt leave their country to join the tour as 
promised 
i was totally broken like a bird that had flown into an 
obstacle said the 24yearold pisarev 
members of the company feared that if they were sent home after 
only five performances in baltimore the tour would be construed as 
an artistic rather than a managerial failure 
robert m pomory president of the lyric opera house in 
baltimore donated daily rehearsal space and paid for hotels and 
meals while the troupe was in limbo a benefit performance feb 8 
brought in 4200 a baltimore hospital donated its services after 
dancer alexander boytsov 36 broke his foot 
gilman stepped in to revive the tour on feb 9 
wednesdays debut attracted nearly a full house that included 
many wellknown faces among them actresses joanne woodward and 
isabella rossellini 
the audience gave us the kind of welcome and applause we had 
not experienced before pisarevs wife prima ballerina inna 
dorofeyeva 22 said in her native ukrainian they applauded for 
10 minutes we were so pleased 
we were very nervous how could we not be it was our first 
time in new york pisarev said 
to those who helped turned things around for the troupe pisarev 
added in his limited english thank you very much

rose at an annual rate of 72 percent in january fueled by higher

no incentives to create a market trend he said

the chamber of commerce director in lincoln 
city has a message for other coastal oregon towns trying to lay 
claim to the title of kitefliers capital of the world go fly one 
whats this i hear that bandon thinks its the kite flying 
capital of the world david gomberg said tuesday its not 
enough to put a couple of kites in the air and call yourself the 
kite capital of the world youre going to have to prove it 
i suggest this be resolved the way its done in japan with 
giant battle kites he added he said the showdown is scheduled 
for may 13 and 14 
thats just fine with janet and frank mcnew owners of the 
freestyle kites store in bandon about 150 miles south of lincoln 
city on the southern oregon coast 
weve been practicing every weekend rain sleet or snow 
said mcnew were going to go up there and just blow them away 
virgil sams of bandon said battle kites can be 10 feet tall and 
have lines impregnated with shards of glass to cut the lines of 
rival kites 
lincoln city mayor alice sim signed a resolution in 1986 
designating her city the kitefliers capital citing its seven miles 
of public beaches numerous kite stores and its location on the 
windward edge of the continent at the 45th parallel halfway between 
the equator and the north pole 
bandon about 150 miles south of lincoln city on the states 
southern coast is one of a number of towns also claiming to be the 
true kite capitalthe mcnews say average winds of more than 15 mph 
give bandon a natural advantage 
the kite flying capital of the world is kind of a mythological 
place said leonard conover assistant editor of kitelines 
magazine 
lincoln city has a fairly legitimate claim maybe a bigger 
louder claim but whos to say its more sincere than bandons

el salvadors leftist rebels contend their 
offer to lay down their weapons if the government postpones next 
months presidential election and reduces the military gives them a 
claim to the moral high ground 
while rebel attacks back home continued unabated guerrilla 
commanders cast themselves in the role of peacemakers during 
meetings this week with salvadoran politicians at the resort town of 
oaxtepec 40 miles outside mexico city 
the rebel farabundo marti liberation front left the meeting with 
a promise from political leaders to consider the proposal the 
rebels made tuesday and press the ussupported government for 
direct talks 
the san salvador government had no immediate reaction to the 
proposal but the defense ministry issued a statement wednesday 
calling the rebel proposal a sinister plan to obtain power by 
force of arms 
if the government rejects talks which appears likely the rebels 
are bolstered in their claim that government intransigence is to 
blame for continuing bloodshed 
the rebels would then have an excuse for stepped up attacks as 
the march 19 elections approach and gain a propaganda tool in their 
battle for the hearts and minds of the salvadoran people 
rebel commander roberto roca said president jose napoleon duarte 
and el salvadors national assembly will have to decide quickly or 
bear the blame for the continuation of the war the matter is 
urgent 
the war began in 1980 and has claimed an estimated 70000 lives 
most of them civilian at least 27 people died over the last three 
days most of them in guerrilla attacks several were innocent 
bystanders 
the rebels have offered to take an indirect role in the 
presidential elections supporting the leftist democratic 
convergence which is now running third in polls behind the rightist 
nationalist republican alliance or arena and duartes centrist 
christian democrats 
the guerrillas have vowed to respect the outcome if the vote is 
postponed and their conditions are met 
but those conditions would mean sweeping changes in el salvadors 
political and military structure including large cuts in the armed 
forces cuts the military has already rejected 
the armed forces have hinted at a coup if duarte stays in office 
past june 1 the constitutionally mandated end of his term 
rebel leaders say they believe their proposal won them 
international sympathy and gained them credibility with salvadoran 
political leaders 
they said the very fact that they sat down with the politicians 
for the first time ever was a breakthrough 
roca told reporters on wednesday he believes at least some 
politicians left convinced the rebel front genuinely has democratic 
aims 
the rebel offer to end a decadelong ban on participation in 
elections first made in january has been treated with intense 
skepticism by duartes government the military and arena which has 
little incentive to make concessions because of its electoral lead 
the rebel leaders insist they are serious about peace under the 
right conditions they said wednesday that the end of the reagan 
administration was a factor in their decision to make a peace offer 
in hopes the bush administration will press the salvadoran 
government to agree to talks 
the united states has pumped more than 3 billion in military and 
economic aid into el salvador without ending the conflict between 
the 56000man armed forces and the 7000 guerrillas

modernize control towers and buy new radar equipment

hard currency they earn the government annually by directing foreign 
aircraft to soviet airports

carrying out a job action to embarrass aviation authorities into 
agreeing to raise their pay and upgrade their equipment

salman rushdies satanic verses is a dizzying 
547page journey through countless plots subplots satire and 
philosophical discussions 
it also is that book the work that has so enraged the islamic 
world that the author has been condemned to death the controversy 
has revived ageold questions of censorship and freedom of religion 
lyrical scathing inquisitive and at times bewildering the 
novel deals with preconceptions of good and evil britains 
treatment of illegal aliens the desire by indians to become 
assimilated into british culture and most notably the birth of the 
islamic faith 
rushdie a 41yearold bombay native of moslem parents writes in 
a streamofconsciousness style that leaves the reader alternately 
exhilarated bewildered and depending on ones religious and 
political orientation outraged 
the novel has been condemned by moslems for its dream sequences 
that portray the prophet mohammed as a womanizer a coward willing 
to compromise his faith for general acceptance and a conniving 
businessman who makes up laws to suit his own purposes 
it also contains a sequence in which a persian scribe alters the 
holy laws as dictated by mohammed who is referred to in the book as 
mahound 
moslems revere mohammed as the prophet who brought them allahs 
revelations in the koran the holy book of islam 
the book prompted irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to put a 
price on the authors life sending rushdie into hiding along with 
his wife 
the satanic verses begins with terrorists blowing up a jet en 
route to london two passengers gibreel farishta an indian actor 
who specializes in religious roles and saladin chamcha a british 
radio star able to reproduce a myriad of voices fall from the 
plane and survive rushdie writes 
to be born again sang gibreel farishta tumbling from the 
heavens first you have to die ho ji ho ji to land upon the 
bosomy earth first one needs to fly tattaa takathun how to 
ever smile again if first you wont cry how to win the darlings 
love mister without a sigh baba if you want to get born again 
 
the two men emerge on an english coast gibreel begins to assume 
an angelic glow while saladin grows horns and hooves and is 
arrested as an illegal immigrant 
the novels turning point comes when gibreel whose halo dazzles 
police denies to authorities that he knows saladin by having 
gibreel commit an evil act wearing a halo and subjecting saladin to 
the brutal treatment of the english police rushdie confounds 
reality which one is evil which one is good 
the books second fourth and sixth chapters mahound 
ayesha and return to jahilia contain the most controversial 
elements 
gibreel dreams about the city of jahilia built entirely of sand 
one of jahilias citizens is mahound a 
businessmanturnedprophet who is starting a new religion 
unfortunately for mahound the city already has 360 gods and little 
use for more 
mahounds chance for recognition comes when the head of the 
citys ruling council proposes a deal if mahounds allah the 
islamic god will accept three of the local gods lat uzza and 
manat as archangels in his sect his religion will receive 
certification and mahound will have a seat on the council 
mahound always the practical businessman sees the deal as a 
good opportunity to attract converts so he climbs a mountain to 
consult with the archangel none other than gibreel himself rashdie 
writes of mahounds moral dilemma 
the souls of the city of the world surely they are worth 
three more angels is allah so unbending that he will not embrace 
three more to save the human race 
although he does not actually hear an answer mahound undergoes 
what he considers a revelation in the archangels presence 
believing he should make the deal 
but he soon learns that the supposedly divine message did not 
come from gibreel but the devil who had been impersonating the 
archangel mahound renounces the satanic verses and substitutes 
these words which closely follow the spirit of the actual koran 
about lat uzza and manat 
they are but names you have dreamed of you and your fathers 
allah invests no authority in them 
rushdie takes the story a step further by having gibreel claim 
that both answers came from him blurring the distinction between 
god and satan 
mahound and his followers eventually settle in the friendly 
oasis of yathrib just as mohammed journeyed from mecca to medina 
in yathrib mahound proceeds to dictate to the persian scribe salman 
the rules of the new religion as proscribed by gibreel 
however salman becomes convinced that mahound is making up the 
rules himself and decides to test his leader by deliberately 
changing what is recited to him the scribe fearing for his life if 
mahound discovers his trick flees yathrib and concludes his part of 
the story by stating its his word against mine 
rushdie has said his characters seek to become fully human by 
facing up to the great facts of love death and with or without 
god the life of the soul outside it the forces of humanity are 
on the march

is musical variety dead on network television if 
you really want to know just ask anyone who watched the 31st 
annual grammy awards assuming you can wake them up 
dont worry be happy a smile button of a song that 
apparently represents the cutting edge of current western musical 
culture seemed to be the theme of an abnormally dull awards program 
wednesday night but for viewers of the threeplus hours on cbs the 
operative lyric might have been tracy chapmans youve got a fast 
car i want a ticket to anywhere 
it looked at first as if chapman might walk off with the show 
but quiet thoughtfulness was not the order of the night and the 
sequinbedecked proceeding clearly was not her scene she quietly 
accepted her grammys and ducked off stage coming back later to sing 
her hymn of deadend poverty fast car in front of a crowd 
whose aggregate wardrobe pricetags probably equalled the gross 
national product of any three third world nations 
the show was enlivened only occasionally by performances from 
chapman sinead oconnor toni childs and melissa etheridge who 
apparently didnt know better than to care 
otherwise it was snore city though you couldnt tell from the 
glitterati who perhaps sated with sponsor pepsis product gave 
standing ovations at every opportunity regardless of whether theyd 
been regaled by whitney houston or itzhak perlman 
maybe its something in the water out there in la at least last 
year in new york there was a little creative tension in the air 
remember little richard taking the show hostage when it suddenly 
occurred to him hey i practically invented rock n roll and i 
never got a grammy they stuck him in the audience this time around 
it was also last year that michael jackson showed up to rivet the 
crowd with his performance 
if theyre going to insist upon televising this thing somebody 
better give the academy some plot advice dont put oconnor 
etheridge and childs on stage to sing their hearts out then give 
the award to tina turner who wasnt even there 
do however have venerable oldtimers show up kids and thats 
just what lifetime achievement award winners leontyne price dizzy 
gillespie and sarah vaughan did you wont see this on mtv 
it was just so hard to pick a trend for the night from the many 
possibilities perhaps blind date from hell the producers 
seemed to delight in pairing bizarre presenter couples such as kris 
kristofferson and minnie pearl henry mancini and olivia newtonjohn 
or steve winwood and randy travis all of whom had the good sense 
not to try to talk to each other 
but dont worry be happy bobby mcferrins mindless and of 
course highly honored song did so nicely set off the evenings 
tootiredtoreachfortheremotecontrol sensibility 
mcferrin was charming however when he teamed with host billy 
crystal on an amusing history of music that thankfully took up 
several minutes of the tedious show blues and gospel begat soul 
said crystal which begat the cover and twodrink minimum 
crystal for his part better watch it or he will be that which 
he satires after three years as host of the show hes becoming 
rather smug still he showed himself a pro by turning a faulty 
sound system into a routine and he dished oneliners as if he meant 
it he also dusted off the ol sammy davis jr impression to great 
effect on chapmans fast car 
the grammy awards do provide something of a smattering of musical 
updating for network audiences who might have missed george 
michaels latest or havent had the pleasure of being exposed to the 
smoke hair and leather of metallica the network mandate after 
all is public service and now thankfully were all caught up 
until next year

all that remains of civil rights 
pioneer web du bois childhood home is a cellar hole marked 
by a plaque but a group meeting on his 121st birthday today wants a 
more prominent tribute 
it is in stark contrast to paul reveres house faneuil hall in 
boston and other places that are national landmarks said robert 
paynter a university of massachusetts archaeologist excavating the 
homestead 
at a university luncheon commemorating du bois birthday state 
secretary of economic affairs grady hedgespeth was to announce a 
study for a memorial at the plot of land which has been listed with 
the national register of historic places 
du bois a social scientist helped found the national 
association for the advancement of colored people and is revered in 
africa as the father of black nations 
school officials said the state has promised a grant to study 
ways to create a bigger tribute to him the memorial would be at the 
site of du bois childhood home in great barrington which today is 
a cellar hole in the woods paynter said 
scholars have long lamented the lack of homage paid to the man 
who laid the foundation for panafricanism and planted the seeds for 
the independent african nations that sprang up in the 1960s 
the irony is that he is better known internationally than in 
america said university afroamerican studies professor william 
strickland 
du bois spent his final years in ghana which has turned his 
bungalow into a national shrine among guests scheduled to attend 
todays birthday luncheon was victor gbeho ghanas missionary to 
the united nations 
for four years after his birth in 1868 du bois lived in the 
great barrington house which archeologists believe had been in his 
mothers family for a century the long history of the black 
burghardt clan from which du bois is descended is lovingly detailed 
in his autobiographies 
the house was purchased by friends as a 60th birthday gift in 
1928 and du bois used it as a summer retreat for more than 25 
years he sold it because of financial and political pressures 
he had been under government surveillance since 1919 for his 
writings on black rights and in the 1950s his passport was taken 
away embittered he toured eastern bloc capitals and in 1961 he 
moved to ghana and applied for membership in the communist party 
the university of massachusetts arranged for the state to buy the 
homestead last year 
du bois admirers bought the property after his death in 1963 and 
wanted to preserve it as a memorial but their efforts were met with 
hostility a 1968 memorial observation there was opposed by veterans 
groups and the local knights of columbus because of du bois 
politics

the formidable task of ending 10 years 
of jungle war in cambodia moves on to other arenas including the 
first sinosoviet summit in 30 years now that peace talks held in 
this country have broken up without new agreements 
despite the bare results at jakarta this week attempts at 
rapprochment by the united states china and the soviet union and 
unprecedented recent dialogue among the warring cambodian factions 
have created momentum toward peace 
foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam said it was like 
the last 15 minutes of a football soccer match with everyone 
trying to score a point 
prince norodom ranariddh a leader of guerrillas fighting 
vietnams occupation of cambodia said the jakarta meeting had been 
destined to fail because settlement lies with two countries that did 
not attend the soviet union which arms vietnam and china which 
arms the guerrillas 
the cambodian conflict is likely to top the agenda when soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev meets chinese leaders in beijing on 
may 1518 in the communist giants first summit in three decades 
the two nations have declared their commitment to settling the 
major conflict blocking normalization of their relations 
indeed officials fear moscow and beijing might rush into an 
agreement that as in afghanistan would wash their own hands but 
leave basic internal conflicts unresolved and condemn cambodia to 
even more chaotic civil war 
last year the two powers held their first talks solely on the 
cambodia issue then in december chinas foreign minister qian 
qichen discussed it in moscow in the first visit by a top chinese 
official there in 31 years 
in february soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze made his 
countrys highestlevel visit to china in three decades to set the 
date for the summit 
during the shevardnadze visit the two countries reached broad 
agreement on many aspects of the cambodian problem but a joint 
statement also cited their differences over what is also the major 
disagreement between the respective cambodian adversaries they 
support 
beijing came out in support of the guerrillas call for formation 
of a provisional coalition government that would comprise the three 
guerrilla groups and the provietnamese cambodian government 
but moscow backed the phnom penh governments offer of a 
fourparty provisional body that apparently would be charged only 
with implementing a peace agreement and organizing a general 
election 
persistent but unconfirmable reports say the soviets seeking 
better relations with china and the noncommunist southeast asian 
nations and an end to costly foreign military involvements have 
been pressuring vietnam for a speedier withdrawal and peace talks 
more obvious have been signs of increased albeit limited chinese 
flexibility in the past year or so 
most importantly beijing finally has joined the international 
community in publicly declaring its opposition to a return to power 
of its main guerrilla ally the khmer rouge 
chinas once unequivocal support for the group which murdered 
hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled cambodia from 1975 
until vietnams late 1978 invasion had blocked peace efforts for 
years 
after a decade of dismissing all vietnamese attempts at 
highlevel dialogue beijing held talks on cambodia in january with 
vietnams first deputy foreign minister dinh nho liem the parties 
informally agreed that vietnam would withdraw its troops by 
september in exchange for an end to chinese aid to the guerrillas 
there is the prospect of a meeting soon between the chinese and 
vietnamese foreign ministers 
the united states which provides the resistance with diplomatic 
support and nonlethal aid also has been more active in discussing 
ways to settle the conflict in talks with the soviet union and with 
china 
president bush is expected to discuss the issue when he visits 
china this weekend a group of 31 us congressmen has written bush 
a letter asking that he urge the chinese to halt aid to the khmer 
rouge 
rep stephen j solarz a signatory and the influential chairman 
of the house subcommittee on asian affairs calls blocking a khmer 
rouge return one of the major political and moral challenges of 
the new administration 
the chinese in turn may press washington to increase aid to the 
noncommunist guerrilla groups the forces of prince norodom 
sihanouk and of son sann 
a statement from participants at the jakarta talks urged the 
cambodian factions to engage in dialogue until the next such talks 
can be arranged 
their antagonism in jakarta however has dimmed prospects that 
the cambodians will make progress in talks among themselves three 
rounds of talks between the principal leaders of the two sides 
sihanouk and premier hun sen of the provietnamese government have 
sharpened mutual recriminations

a 12yearold armenian girl whose forehead was 
crushed in the devastating earthquake that shook the soviet republic 
has been released from a hospital after reconstructive surgery made 
possible through a us program 
gayane gasparian one of four children being treated at 
massachusetts general hospital was released wednesday and joined 
her mother at an apartment paid for by the city 
the lanky darkhaired girl was among 37 children and their 
guardians flown in feb 9 by the virginiabased organization project 
hope after the dec 7 earthquake in which 25000 people were killed 
and 500000 were left homeless 
at least 10 are outpatients now and many more are slowly coming 
out said martha desrosiers the organizations director of 
humanitarian assistance in general they are all adapted and 
happy some of them are still frightened but some are speaking 
english 
miss gasparians surgery was a week ago and dr michael 
yaremchuk said the girl will spend several days recuperating before 
beginning a series of operations on her hand which was also smashed 
he said it was unlikely any of the other three children under 
treatment in boston would be released soon 
their spirits are good but they all have very difficult 
problems yaremchuk said our reconstructive efforts wont bring 
them back to normal but we can approach that as our goal 
many of the reconstructive operations were complicated by the 
delay in treatment following the disaster yaremchuk said 
if a similar injury had occurred in the united states the 
reconstruction would have been as soon as possible after the 
accident he said but the priorities are different in a crisis 
situation 
the other children were treated at hospitals in illinois 
pennsylvania virginia new york florida and ohio

miami international airport has joined several other 
major us airports in installing an antiterrorism device capable 
of detecting bombs similar to the one that destroyed pan am flight 
103 an airport spokesman said 
the 770000 decompression chamber guards against barometric 
bombs detonated by pressure changes at high altitudes said airport 
spokesman chris mangos it is the first such device to be installed

if such a bomb is hidden in the cargo or luggage it will explode 
within the thick concrete walls of the chamber mangos said 
wednesday 
miami international officials built the narrow 89footlong 
chamber at the insistence of israels el al airlines known for its 
strict security measures 
los angeles international airport ohare international airport 
in chicago and new yorks john f kennedy airport all serviced by 
el al flights already have decompression chambers

sure they are safe and sound in our planes said david shein el 
als general manager for north and central america 
el al said it may double its cargo business out of miami but had 
agreed to proceed with expansion plans only if the chamber was 
installed to deal with security threats shein said

in a sudden switch barbara bush has decided not to 
speak out on such controversial subjects as abortion and gun control 
after an apparent difference with president bush over whether 
militarystyle assault rifles should be outlawed 
the first ladys decision was disclosed today by her press 
secretary anna perez as mrs bush arrived in tokyo with her 
husband to attend the funeral of emperor hirohito on friday 
ms perez said mrs bush had adopted a new policy on 
controversial issues such as guns and abortion 
she will not discuss them the spokeswoman said they are 
not the issues where she wishes to have a focus it doesnt mean she 
doesnt have a right to an opinion it means she has a right to 
discuss them or not 
ms perez said the first lady has decided instead to highlight 
such concerns as the homeless aids and illiteracy 
mrs bush and the president appeared at odds after she said in an 
interview with the associated press that she absolutely favors 
banning militarystyle assault weapons such as the one used recently 
in a schoolyard massacre in stockton calif in which five children 
were killed and more than two dozen children were wounded 
the president questioned separately said he does not believe 
semiautomatic weapons should be banned because they are used by 
sportsmen and hunters a semiautomatic ak47 was used in the 
stockton incident 
bush a lifetime member of the national rifle association the 
nations biggest gun lobby said police should do more to enforce 
existing gun laws 
ms perez quoted the first lady as saying there isnt that much 
of a difference of opinion between her and the president over the 
issue of outlawing assaultstyle weapons 
if there is they will discuss it among themselves ms perez 
said 
the press secretary said mrs bush does not want her views to be 
the focus of attention 
shes not the one that makes policy ms perez said she 
doesnt lobby congress shes not the president 
reflecting mrs bushs views ms perez said the opinions that 
are important that require the spotlight are those of her 
husband 
mrs bush wore an elegant black suit and her customary strand of 
fake pearls today for tea with naoko takeshita wife of japanese 
prime minister noboru takeshita 
how very very kind of you to invite me said mrs bush as 
she greeted mrs takeshita who wore a navy blue suit

table in a small greencarpeted room decorated with flowers and a 
pastel painting of mount fuji 
mrs bush expressed her sympathy over hirohitos death and mrs

outraged war veterans forced the 
government to back down today on its decision to fly the national 
flag at halfstaff over the australian war memorial during fridays 
funeral in japan for emperor hirohito 
prime minister bob hawke intervened after a wave of protest from 
war veterans who inundated radio talk shows with protests of plans 
to lower the flag on all government buildings in respect for the 
late emperor 
hawke said he was aware of the sensitivities of war veterans and 
their families and agreed to exempt the war memorial which 
commemorates all australians who died in wars 
its an affront to all those who were killed fighting the 
japanese to all expows of the japanese who were brutally treated 
and tortured and to their widows said brig alf garland 
president of the returned services league representing some 300000 
veterans of world war ii and vietnam 
it is clear to me that the government is completely out of 
touch with public opinion and puts trading relationships with japan 
ahead of the feelings of australian veterans and war widows 
garland said before hawke intervened 
the row surfaced as australias new governorgeneral bill 
hayden flew to japan to join other foreign dignitaries for the 
funeral 
many australians regard hirohito who died jan 7 at age 87 as 
an unrepentant war criminal who died without explaining his wartime

they looked out of place as they sat on a hard 
governmentissue wood bench in a federal courtroom alongside drug 
peddlers and social security thieves 
tall and trim the twin brothers in the european gray suits and 
silver handcuffs sat in identical positions right leg slung over 
left knee as they awaited their arraignment on fraud charges 
philip and thomas noons had been arrested with the fbi and 
charged with conspiring to embezzle money from the federal savings amp 
loan insurance corp for which philip noons worked 
noons is one of hundreds of officials from the troubled sampl 
industry hired to untangle a mess they helped to create in the 
process officials say they may have helped to make it worse 
the case against the noons brothers is part international 
intrigue and part plain ol bank robbing prosecutors say 
the 31yearold twins who are british citizens worked for 
mainland savings a thrift that has been declared insolvent and has 
been the object of two years worth of fbi investigation 
when mainland failed in 1986 philip noons went to work at the 
fslic trying to sell all the bad mainland assets the government 
suddenly had inherited 
thomas noons went to work for a real estate firm that had a 
contract with fslic to dispose of mainland property 
they even helped the fbi in its investigation of mainland 
on feb 8 the same fbi agent who had worked with the two 
arrested them on charges of conspiring to embezzle money from the 
fslic by grossly undervaluing mainland loans and then selling them 
to two houston companies on behalf of themselves 
one package of 16 loans was valued by philip noons at 1500 and 
sold for 50000 allegedly with money diverted from another 
transaction handled by noons prosecutors said the fslic said the 
package is actually worth 16 million not 1500 
in another case the brothers allegedly paid 692821 for a loan 
on a shopping center the fbi said that loan which was uptodate 
on its payments was really worth 4 million the government 
charged the money to buy it came from a mysterious account in 
britains channel islands called the unicorn trust the fbi said 
and was sent through the cayman islands making it harder to trace 
although charged and released on bail the noons brothers have 
yet to be indicted the fbi had them arrested out of concern they 
might flee the country 
the case is just one facet broken off that mainland 
investigation said assistant us attorney john braddock who has 
spent two years on mainland and anticipates at least two more 
the brothers attorney david berg says his clients are 
innocent and that the government has overreacted 
berg said some fslic employees who helped build the case against 
the twins were simply being vindictive that philip noons helped the 
government get a good price for the loans and that the case rests 
on only the thinnest reed of evidence 
i really think these guys are being victimized by exemployees 
at mainland the attorney said and i think there is a great cry 
and hue to expose sampl scandal and so we got this rush to judgment i 
think the government simply jumped the gun on this one

reversing itself a prominent 
publishing house said today it will publish the germanlanguage 
edition of the satanic verses whose author is the target of an 
iranian assassination order 
the kiepenheuer und witsch publishing house of cologne said 
salman rushdies novel which many moslems consider blasphemous 
will appear some time in the fall after it is translated from the 
english 
the publishing house last week said it would not publish the 
novel because it feared reprisals against its employees but the 
union of west german writers and other cultural institutions 
appealed for the book to be published saying free speech should not 
be compromised by terrorist threats 
though kiepenheuer und witsch owns the germanlanguage rights to 
the satanic verses brief excerpts from the book have been 
appearing in the leftist west berlin newspaper tageszeitung 
a spokesman for the union of west german publishers klaus kluge 
said the newspapers move was unauthorized and could result in legal 
action by kiepenheuer und witsch 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans fundamentalist patriarch 
nine days ago ordered moslems to seek out and kille rushdie and the 
books publishers 
several iranian clerics have since put a price on the head of the 
british author who was born to a moslem family in india and is now 
in hiding

algerians voted today on a new 
constitution that would open the way to a multiparty system 
protect civil liberties and spell the end of two decades of 
socialism 
polling booths opened at 8 am for 12 hours of voting by this 
north african nations 13 million eligible voters who were casting 
ballots for the third time in less than four months 
voters overwhelmingly adopted a first set of political reforms in 
november and in december they reelected president chadli 
bendjedid 59 to a third fiveyear term 
bendjedids proposal to change the constitution is the highlight 
of a process of political and social reform under way since a week 
of bloody riots in october 
the unrest was largely blamed on the oilproducing nations 
struggling economy jolted by a world oil glut and straitjacketed by 
the oneparty socialist state 
while algerian voters are expected to overwhelmingly approve the 
constitution there have been only limited public calls on its 
behalf the ruling party has remained prudently silent 
islamic groups have been divided over the merits of the new 
document in an interview published wednesday in the daily horizons 
said ali belhadj a leader of a fundamentalist faction said if 
ethnic berbers communists and all the others have a voice 
algeria will become a field of ideological confrontations in 
contradictions with the beliefs of the algerian people 
the proposed constitution does not overtly authorize competing 
political parties to replace the ruling national liberation front 
currently the only legal political organization in this nation of 25 
million people but it does recognize the right to create 
associations of a political character 
it also guarantees freedom of expression and the right to strike 
within some limits 
the new constitution would restrict the power of the army to 
defending the national independence the unity and territorial 
integrity of the country 
under the current document the army had a role in the 
development of the country and the building of socialism 
also dropped is a declaration that the algerian state is 
socialist the new text contains no reference at all to socialism 
islam would remain the state religion and arabic the official 
language 
the proposed document would supercede the 1976 constitution drawn 
up under houari boumedienne marxist president from 196578 
for years bendjedid has quietly moved algeria away from orthodox 
socialism to a free market economy but has faced determined 
resistance from the ruling party and the government bureaucracy 
the october riots in which government offices were a main 
target quickened the process officials said 176 people died in the 
fighting but the figure was widely considered low 
a nov 3 referendum that dealt with the separation of powers 
between the president prime minister and national assembly or 
parliament was approved by 92 percent bendjedid was reelected 
dec 23 with 81 percent of the vote

a 16monthold florida boy who underwent a 
rare liver and small intestine transplant on new years eve died 
from a combination of medical problems involving multiple organ 
failures officials said 
calvin oliveira died wednesday at university of wisconsin 
hospital and clinics where the surgery was performed said 
spokeswoman greer sutter 
dr munci kalayoglu who performed the historic liverintestine 
transplant said the problems were triggered by respiratory failure 
hes been really sick and basically failing the last two weeks 
despite everything we could think of to do for him said dr 
william perloff head of the hospitals intensive care unit in 
the last 72 hours he took a significant turn for the worse 
kalayoglu said doctors undertook the operation in an effort to 
save calvins life and unfortunately we were unable to succeed 
despite our best efforts 
calvin from deerfield beach fla gained national attention 
after his father carlos oliveira made a tearful plea to florida 
gov bob martinez for help in saving the boys life 
money for the down payment on the operation was quickly raised 
from private and corporate donors 
only 5 percent of calvins intestine worked at birth the 
intravenous feeding that kept him alive caused his liver to 
deteriorate so severely by december that his only hope was the 
experimental operation 
kalayoglu had expected calvin to be able to use the new intestine 
and go off intravenous feeding a few weeks after the operation but 
a mysterious lung ailment developed 
kalayoglu said calvin had been the only survivor of five children 
who underwent the operation

proiranian captors of three american 
educators today threatened to take revenge against salman rushdie 
the publishers of his novel the satanic verses and their 
supporters for insulting islam 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine delivered the 
threat in a handwritten statement accompanied by an instant 
photograph of american hostages alann steen robert polhill and 
jesse turner 
the group did not directly threaten the hostages who appeared in 
a photograph released with the document to prove its authenticity 
the arabiclanguage statement delivered to the office of a 
western news agency in moslem west beirut threatened to take 
revenge against all those who took part in strong and ferocious 
campaigns against islam 
in the photograph shows the three bearded hostages from the 
knees up sitting on what appeared to be a bed and looking straight 
into the camera 
polhills left arm and hand are noticeably thinner than in a 
picture released 14 months earlier and his left sleeve appears to 
have intentionally been hiked up to the elbow to show the arm 
the document said the revenge would cover all institutions and 
organizations that insulted in one way or another members of 
prophet mohammeds family meaning moslems 
european governments have recalled their ambassadors from iran to 
protest ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis decree last week that moslems 
seek out and kill rushdie and his publishers because the satanic 
verses blasphemes islam 
authors have led demonstrations of outrage at the threat from 
irans fundamentalist patriarch who has refused to accept rushdies 
apology and president bush has called the threat an insult to the 
civilized world 
rushdie a naturalized briton who was born a moslem in india is 
in hiding with his wife in britain and reportedly under police 
guard iranian clerics have offered 52 million for rushdies 
murder 
steen polhill and turner were kidnapped jan 24 1987 from the 
campus of the americanaffiliated beirut university college where 
they held teaching posts steen 49 of boston taught journalism 
while polhill 54 of new york was assistant professor of business 
and turner 42 of boise idaho taught mathematics and computer 
science 
the three are among 15 foreigners missing and believed held 
hostage in lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem extremists nine of 
the hostages are american including associated press chief middle 
east correspondent terry anderson who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
and is the longest held 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine had persistently 
sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages issue in 
accordance with its principles and to show its good intentions in 
light of international detente the statement said 
but it seems that imperialism and zionism consider that moslems 
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the 
price of living in the shadow of international detente 
the beirut newspaper annahar today said efforts to free foreign 
hostages in lebanon have suffered now that iran and the 12 european 
economic community nations are at loggerheads over irans death 
threat against rushdie 
jihad threatened to strike against american and israeli interests 
for supporting rushdie and his novel and called on moslems all 
over the world to stand against the laws of the jungle so that 
advocates of these laws would realize that real human values lie 
in spiritual religions and not in the jungles system 
it described rushdies book and the support it has as the worst 
type of insult against islams sacredness 
the book was part of serious and wideranging programs underway 
to strike against islam because it is the force that fights moral 
and humanitarian degeneration the statement claimed 
many moslems say rushdies book blasphemes islam by portraying 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the koran 
the holy book of islam rather than receiving it from god 
in beirut reactions to rushdies the satanic verses have 
been slow and conflicting an advisor to the sunni moslem grand 
mufti rejected irans ruling while the highest shiite moslem 
religious judge advocated the death sentence

abel wolman a johns hopkins university sanitary 
engineer who helped to bring safe drinking water to millions of 
people around the world has died at age 96 
wolman who died at his home wednesday collaborated 70 years ago 
with the late chemist linn h enslow to develop a method of 
purifying drinking water with precise amounts of chlorine 
its still the primary water treatment used today said jared 
l cohon vice provost for research at johns hopkins university 
its in use throughout the world thats a remarkable thing to 
say 
the concept of chlorinating water was not new when the two men 
developed their formula in 1918 but the technique had yet to be 
refined to take into account the bacterial content in a particular 
water source 
the formula specified how much chlorine should be mixed with a 
given source of water taking into consideration the bacterial 
content the acidity and other factors related to the waters 
desired taste and purity 
wolman had an unconventional willingness to discard western 
assumptions in his role as a cleanwater consultant to about 50 
countries his approach was to weigh unique aspects of each 
communitys water problems cultural barriers bureaucratic inertia 
and resistance to change 
he received the national medal of science from president ford in 
1975 in 1976 he shared the tyler ecology award a 150000 prize 
with two other scientists 
wolman was born in baltimore on june 10 1892 the fourth of six 
children of polish immigrants he received bachelors degrees in 
both arts and science from johns hopkins and joined the faculty in 
1921 in 1937 the university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 
engineering 
he advised the us public health service the tennessee valley 
authority the atomic energy commission and the world health 
organization 
wolman is survived by his son m gordon wolman chairman of the 
department of geography and environmental science at johns hopkins 
and four grandchildren

im here to put you on notice that not only black folks here in 
louisiana but black folks all over he country will be watching

relatives and friends of britons who died aboard 
pan am flight 103 demanded today that transport secretary paul 
channon resign for failing to alert airport authorities to a bomb 
threat against the airline 
in a letter published in the independent newspaper they urged 
channon to accept ministerial responsibility for failing to pass 
on to londons heathrow airport a bomb threat reported by us 
authorities 
his resignation will not bring back the people we have lost 
the 22 signatories said it will however ease our sense of 
betrayal at the actions and omissions of our government 
the new yorkbound boeing 747 jet blew up over the scottish 
village of lockerbie on dec 21 killing all 259 people aboard and 
11 on the ground 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 but 
passengers and baggage were transferred to the doomed jumbo jet at 
heathrow 
the independent reported last week that channons department 
received 16 security bulletins last year from the us federal 
aviation administration 
the letter said channon had given the impression in parliament 
and to the media that the bomb threat against pan am was one of 
such a large number of warnings and in terms of quality was so 
insignificant that he saw no need to inform heathrow airport 
we have since learned that the americans issue only a small 
number of bulletins and that they considered the bulletin in 
question to be one of the most specific to be passed on to the 
british government the letter said 
we have been further angered by the fact that the same 
information led to the authorities at frankfurt doubling their own 
security it said 
the state department said an unidentified person telephoned the 
us embassy in helsinki finland on dec 5 and said an attempt 
would be made that month to bomb a pan am aircraft flying from 
frankfurt west germany to the united states the faa notified the 
british government 
the government said it took no action because it believed 
security at british airports was already strict enough 
british police said last week the bomb was hidden in a 
radiocassette player and probably was loaded onto the plane in 
frankfurt german police say there is no evidence for such a 
conclusion

police said today that a 
13yearold girl was killed in an attack on a soweto home that may 
be linked to the controversy surrounding winnie mandela 
the killing late wednesday was the fourth in the past two months 
that has involved people connected directly or indirectly to mrs 
mandela and her unofficial group of bodyguards known as the mandela 
united soccer club 
police said gunmen fired on the house with an ak47 rifle and set 
the dwelling ablaze with a firebomb the name of the slain girl was 
not released 
a few hours before the attack an occupant of the house was 
detained in connection with the killing last week of maxwell 
madondo a member of mandela united police said they declined to 
release the name of the person detained 
the possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing 
on the murder of mr madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is 
being investigated police headquarters said in a statement 
madondos body with several stab wounds was found last week 
less than 30 yards from house that was attacked wednesday a former 
member of mandela united andrew ekaneng has been charged with 
madondos killing but has yet to enter a plea 
the attack wednesday is the latest development in the controversy 
that centers on mrs mandela and mandela united members who lived 
at her home in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
antiapartheid leaders last week accused mandela united of waging 
a reign of terror renounced mrs mandela and urged their 
followers not to associate with her mrs mandelas husband african 
national congress leader nelson mandela has been imprisoned for 27 
years but remains the countrys best known black figure 
in addition to the deaths of the teenage girl and madondo two 
other people with links to mrs mandela and her bodyguards have been 
killed in recent weeks 
stompie seipei a 14yearold activist was allegedly beaten at 
the mandela home by soccer club members his decomposed body was 
found in january and two members of the soccer club have been 
charged with his murder as well as with the abduction and assault 
of three young men 
dr abu baker asvat a soweto physician and political activist 
was shot and killed at his clinic last month two men have been 
charged with the murder and police have said they believe the 
motive was robbery 
however there have been unconfirmed reports that on the day 
before he died asvat examined seipei who allegedly had been badly 
beaten 
mrs mandela has suggested that asvat may have been killed 
because he had examined seipei and other youths who she said were 
sexually molested by a methodist minister in soweto church 
officials have denied the charges

a university intended to show solidarity with black detainees who 
have staged hunger strikes to protest being held without charge

auditorium at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg

five universities have fasted for varying periods in support of the 
hunger strikers 
hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several 
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that 
the government free them or charge them 
at several prisons the strikes have been suspended because of a 
government pledge to release many detainees the protests continue 
at other prisons but the police and antiapartheid groups say they 
are not sure how many detainees are involved 
at least 58 detainees not all of them hunger strikers have been 
freed since law and order minister adriaan vlok met last week with 
antiapartheid church leaders vlok pledged to free a substantial 
number of detainees and the clergymen called on the hunger 
strikers to suspend their fast 
vlok says less than 1000 people are being held under 
stateofemergency regulations which allow indefinite detention 
without trial many of the hunger strikers have been held more than 
two years 
the star newspaper reported today that 17 detainees held under 
security legislation at johannesburgs police headquarters had begun 
a hunger strike unlike stateofemergency detainees prisoners 
detained under security laws ostensibly are held in order to be 
interrogated

a state law banning marriages between people 
of the same sex should be repealed because it discriminates against 
homosexuals says the board of directors of the 8000member bar 
association of san francisco 
banning samesex marriages was a clear denial of equal 
protection under the 14th amendment to the constitution by singling 
out an identifiable class of people association president peter 
g keane told a legal newspaper 
the directors decided unanimously on wednesday that the current 
state civil code mandating marriages between a man and a woman be 
changed to read marriage is a personal relation arising out of a 
civil contract between two people the san francisco banner daily 
journal reported 
a change would give partners of both homosexuals and 
hetereosexuals many of the same rights now only enjoyed by legally 
married couples 
the new definition of marriage is needed to correct invidious 
discrimination against nonheterosexuals who choose to have a 
relationship that has the same quality and definition that a husband 
and wife have keane said

president bush arrived in japan today and plunged 
into a series of minisummits with israeli and arab leaders as the 
united states suggested that new soviet initiatives in the middle 
east were merely rhetorical exercises 
against the backdrop of an imperial japanese funeral bush 
conferred with jordans king hussein egyptian president hosni 
mubarak and israeli president chaim herzog bush pledged that the 
united states will take an active role in the search for peace in 
the region 
reporting on the talks secretary of state james a baker iii 
said there were perhaps some opportunities out there with respect 
to the middle east peace process that havent existed before 
in particular baker noted that the united states has opened 
talks with the palestine liberation organization which washington 
had shunned for years as a terrorist group 
baker said bush did not offer any new us initiatives in the 
middle east 
on his first overseas journey as president bush will attend the 
funeral friday of japanese emperor hirohito who died of cancer jan 
7 at the age of 87 
some nations refused to send a highlevel delegation to the 
funeral because of hirohitos role as a leading japanese figure 
during world war ii british veterans protested the decision by 
prince philip to attend the funeral and one veteran embarked on a 
hunger strike 
commenting on bushs decision to attend baker said maybe it 
indicated that the wounds have healed as far as the united states is 
concerned bush fought in the pacific during world war ii as a 
navy pilot whose torpedo plane was destroyed by japanese gunfire 
bush held private talks with a handful of world leaders 
including french president francois mitterrand portuguese prime 
minister mario soares japanese prime minister noboru takeshita and 
prime minister chatichai choonhavan of thailand 
it was bushs talks with hussein mubarak and herzog that 
provided a counterpoint to the 10day trip through the middle east 
by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who is trying to 
advance moscows role in the region 
baker said its healthy quite frankly that the soviet union 
would be interested in contributing to the cause of peace in the 
middle east 
he added i suppose we would want to know that there were 
concrete contributions that they have in mind rather than simply 
rhetorical exercises 
challenging moscow to contribute in a concrete way baker 
said the soviet union should establish full diplomatic relations 
with israel and cease its support of radical countries in the 
middle east region such as libya 
he said moscow also could exercise influence with syria 
shevardnadze has been promoting the idea of an international 
peace conference under the auspices of the united nations 
baker said the united states will continue to insist that any 
such conference must lead to direct negotiations between israel and 
the palestinians he said jordan also would be an appropriate 
party in these discussions 
after a 16hour flight from washington bush went directly to the 
us ambassadors residence for lunch with mitterrand white house 
officials said their talks focused on eastwest relations central 
america the global environment and plans for a sevennation 
economic summit in paris in july 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush and the 
french president expressed interest in exploring whatever options 
might be out there in the middle east 
the spokesman affirmed bushs earlier statement that the soviet 
union should play only a secondary role in the middle east 
white house officials said in advance that bushs meetings with 
various world leaders would be brief and lacking in any decisions 
but they were considered significant as the start of bushs personal 
diplomacy as president in search of a mideast peace strategy 
although we think there are some opportunities to move the 
process forward we want to be methodical and deliberate 
fitzwater said 
asked to elaborate fitzwater replied i cant be specific 
simply because we dont want to talk about any opportunities that 
might be there things move slowly in the middle east 
however he said there was a changed situation because of 
us discussions with the plo and recent statements by its chairman 
yasser arafat who has publicly disavowed terrorism 
bush will travel to china on saturday and make a 4 hour stop in 
south korea on monday before returning home 
things in the pacific seem to be going reasonably well bush 
said earlier during a refueling stop in anchorage alaska but we 
are a pacific power and this visit will demonstrate that we intend 
to stay a pacific power 
bush said during a pretrip news conference that he wont be 
stampeded into action by shevardnadzes advocacy of an international 
peace conference hosted by the five permanent members of the un 
security council 
in recent days the soviet foreign minister has conferred with 
mubarak hussein and israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
after his talks with miterrand bush went to akasaka palace the 
government guest house there in the chandeliered and 
marblecolumned room of the morning sun bush paid a courtesy call 
on japanese prime minister noboru takeshita who was the first 
foreign visitor to see bush at the white house 
in a session stiff with formality bush and his six aides were 
seated in a straight row of delicate gold chairs opposite their 
japanese counterparts two waiters in tuxedos served orange juice in 
crystal glasses 
fitzwater said bush told takeshita that americans express their 
respect and sorrow for the emperor 
after the funeral on friday bush is to hold talks with leaders 
of west germany singapore belgium turkey pakistan and zaire and 
may meet with philippine president corazon aquino 
bush and mitterrand spent some time exchanging impressions of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his perestroika program of 
economic reforms 
fitzwater said they agreed that gorbachevs agenda provides new 
challenges and opportunities to the west he said they also agreed 
that the western alliance was strong that nato was in a very 
sound and strong position and that the west was ready to deal with 
soviet change in a very positive fashion

a federal judge has overturned a murderers 
death sentence because the jury that convicted him 10 years ago had 
asked for a bible and because the trial judge improperly instructed 
jurors on the charges 
prosecutors can appeal us district judge charles a moyes 
ruling agree to a life prison term or seek a new sentencing 
hearing for brandon jones 31 of chicago who was convicted of 
murder committed during a 1979 servicestation robbery codefendant 
van roosevelt solomon was electrocuted in 1985 
moye in a ruling handed down feb 16 said it was a 
constitutional error for jurors to be allowed access to a bible 
during deliberations he said the jury had a duty to apply the law 
of the state of georgia not its own interpretation of the law or 
its own interpretation of precepts of the bible 
moye also ruled that former cobb superior court judge luther 
hames didnt instruct the jury about the difference between armed 
robbery and burglary and that the jury wasnt fully informed about 
the definition of aggravated murder 
prosecutors have 30 days from moyes ruling to decide what 
theyll do

former alderman edward vrdolyak a battered 
veteran of chicagos political wars has jumped into the mayors 
race as a writein republican candidate 
vrdolyak joined the race just six days before tuesdays primary 
election telling a multiracial crowd of cheering supporters at a 
restaurant that the endorsed gop candidate dr herb sohn was 
being thrown to the wolves 
the campaign in this heavily democratic city has been dominated 
by the democratic primary contest between chief rivals richard m 
daley and mayor eugene sawyer 
vrdolyak said wednesday at the campaign kickoff rally that sohn 
was a decent gentleman but was left to run with no financial 
support 
sohn a physician and lawyer expressed no thanks for vrdolyaks 
help and called him the count dracula of politics 
vrdolyak 51 a former democrat joined the gop in 1987 soon 
after he unsuccessfully sought the mayors chair as a thirdparty 
candidate against his archfoe the late harold washington vrdolyak 
waged another losing battle in november for cook county court clerk 
tuesdays primaries and the april 4 general election are to 
complete the final two years of washingtons second term washington 
died of a heart attack in november 1987 
mike royko the pulitzer prizewinning syndicated columnist based 
at the chicago tribune said vrdolyak could sure create problems 
the most obvious effect of which would be to siphon off white votes 
from rich daley 
daley and vrdolyak are white sawyer is black 
vrdolyak rejected the spoiler label 
the very essence of the word spoiler means that we have to 
have a racial quota on who can run for office he told the crowd 
of about 400 and the very essence is racist and we should put it 
out of any campaign 
but daley cook county states attorney and son of late mayor 
richard j daley said he thinks he is the target 
i think theyre all out to stop me he said 
sawyer denied that he could benefit significantly from vrdolyaks 
entry he could be siphoning some votes from me the mayor 
said 
the gop and democratic primary winners will face thirdparty

fawaz younis contends he led the hijacking of a 
jordanian airliner in june 1985 because his superiors in the shiite 
moslem militia ordered it but that may not be the key defense when 
he goes on trial friday 
the case is considered a landmark because younis was the first 
suspected terrorist arrested under the 1984 hostagetaking act 
which gives the united states jurisdiction outside its territorial 
boundaries when american citizens are taken hostage 
no one was killed in the 39hour hijacking of 72 passengers and 
crewmembers which ended when the airliner was returned to beirut 
the passengers and crew released and the boeing 727 blown up 
in a pretrial hearing wednesday defense attorney francis d 
carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking on 
orders from commanders of the amal militia a shiite moslem faction 
in lebanon 
an appeals court has already allowed the admission into evidence 
of a confession made by younis after he was arrested by fbi agents 
in international waters in the mediterranean sea in september 1987 
the evidence against younis includes the confession testimony 
from passengers and a videotape of the defendant standing near the 
hijacked plane at beirut airport the hijackers were demanding that 
palestinian guerrillas be removed from lebanon 
carter won tentative approval wednesday from us district judge 
aubrey e robinson to allow expert testimony concerning amal on 
condition that the defendant testify that he was ordered by his 
superiors to hijack an airplane 
if he testifies that he had a direct order we may allow it 
said robinson but he ruled out a defense based on the theory that 
all mechanisms of law and order had broken down in lebanon and that 
any reasonable person would have followed a command to hijack an 
airplane 
assistant us attorney ramsey johnson argued against allowing 
such testimony saying that the hijacking is so patently criminal 
that the defense of following orders should not be allowed in this 
case 
on the use of younis confession robinson indicated that despite 
the decision of the appeals court the defense could try to persuade 
the jury that federal agents induced younis to confess by taking 
four days to transport him to a navy vessel in the western 
mediterranean and giving him only bags of ice to treat injuries 
suffered during his arrest 
his wrists were broken and he was seasick said carter 
younis was lured to the yacht a twomasted sailboat under 
control of federal agents by the promise of what carter called a 
bogus narcotics deal 
it is not something that my client regularly does said the 
defense attorney 
younis has been held at a federal prison facility on the east 
coast that attorneys decline to identify he waived his right to 
appear at the pretrial hearing he will provided with arabspeaking 
interpreters during the trial 
johnson said that three witnesses in the case are in the federal 
witness protection program and that several prosecution witnesses 
were overseas

semiautomatic rifles but would have let people keep guns they 
already own 
most opposition during debate wednesday was to the amendments 
lateness 
franchots bill was introduced after five elementary students 
were killed in january when patrick edward purdy used an assault 
rifle to spray a stockton calif schoolyard with more than 100 
bullets in less than two minutes 
the panel also killed a bill that would have required the sale of 
guns from one private owner to another be reported to state police 
and one that would have increased penalties for people caught 
carrying guns without permits 
under maryland law semiautomatic weapons can be bought over the 
counter without a background check or waiting period and only sales 
by licensed dealers are reported to the police 
the committees action was a victory for the national rifle 
association which had spent a record 6 million in an unsuccessful 
campaign to overturn a new maryland law that bans cheap handguns

the soviet union may resume ties with israel 
if the jewish state takes part in an international peace conference 
that includes the plo soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
said today 
in a speech to egyptian political leaders at the end of a 
fourday visit shevardnadze also made what he called his first 
critical remark about the new president of the united states 
saying george bush was trying unjustly to limit the soviet role in 
the middle east 
his comments about soviet ties with israel where were severed by 
moscow during the 1967 middle east war came one day after he met 
with israeli foreign minister moshe arens in cairo 
we would like the government of israel to know that once it 
opts for the conference and agrees to a dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization our two countries could take yet another 
step toward reestablishing full diplomatic relations he said 
the beginning of the conference would be a starting point for 
resumed relations 
on wednesday arens rejected the idea of a conference with the 
plo however he told reporters afterward the soviets have a role to 
play in middle east peacemaking even without diplomatic ties with 
israel 
however in paris today prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
said the soviet union must first establish normal relations with 
israel before it can play a role in solving the mideast conflict 
we wait for this act on the part of moscow shamir told a 
news conference i hope it will be forthcoming 
in jerusalem deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu said 
today that arens and shevardnadze agreed to expand their nations 
relations through delegations that will meet in the next few weeks 
a foreign ministy official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
without elaboaration that the delegations will focus on the middle 
east conflict 
israels hadashot newspaper said arens and shevardnadze also 
agreed to advance ties by making the consular offices in each 
country permanent 
plo chief yasser arafat today said in cairo the soviet unions 
new dialogue with israel is giving him a channel for indirect 
negotiations with israel 
speaking to reporters one day after he met with shevardnadze 
arafat rejected direct negotiations between israel and the plo 
outside of the proposed international peace conference 
in todays speech shevardnadze warned israel that it has no 
right to deny freedom of choice to the palestinian people 
unless a peaceful comprehensive political settlement is found 
developments in the region would follow a spiral wound by the 
logic of military confrontation he said the region faces the 
threat of an arms race which sooner or later would degenerate into a 
nuclear faceoff 
shevardnadze alluded to israels reported possession of a 
substantial nuclear arsenal and possible efforts by arab states to 
acquire nuclear or chemical weapons 
the speech appeared to sum up his visits to syria jordan and 
egypt he later left for iraq and planned to visit iran before 
returning home 
shevardnadze was in egypt when bush made remarks tuesday 
relegating the soviet union to a limited role in the middle east 
he made a qualification that i didnt like he said the role of 
the soviet union should be limited that is very sad because it 
injects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary shevardnadze 
said 
he added with as smile this is my first critical remark about 
the president of the united states 
shevardnadze spoke in russian and arabic and english 
translations of his remarks were available 
shevardnadze over the weekend unveiled a soviet proposal that the 
five permanent members of the un security council prepare for an 
international conference to negotiate an arabisraeli peace 
settlement 
the plo would attend as a full partner

exciting says john adams who won in the contemporary classical 
composition category for his opera nixon in china

in the classical field the awards are given unimaginatively 
its high name recognition sir georg solti wins all the time 
he said in the past i lost to vladimir horowitz and andrew lloyd

china and indonesia today agreed to normalize 
relations 22 years after they suspended ties over allegations that 
china supported a communist coup attempt against the indonesian 
government 
indonesian president suharto and chinese foreign minister qian 
qichen reached the agreement after meeting for more than two hours 
at a tokyo hotel said max lapod spokesman for the indonesian 
embassy in tokyo 
we are going to go through the process of normalizing relations 
based on the five principles of noninterference nonaggression 
mutual respect beneficial relations and peaceful coexistence 
lapod said in an interview 
both sides are very satisfied with their statements he said 
suharto and qian are in tokyo to attend fridays funeral for 
emperor hirohito who died of cancer jan 7 
indonesia suspended relations with china in 1967 two years after 
an attempted communist coup in jakarta in which indonesia alleged 
chinese backing 
we dont call it severed we say relations were frozen lapod 
said weve been talking at international conferences in jakarta 
and at the united nations 
suharto and qian accepted invitations for the indonesian and 
chinese presidents to exchange visits which could take place as 
early as this year lapod said 
meanwhile chinas staterun news agency xinhua reported that 
qian and suharto agreed upon future efforts for normalization of 
bilateral relations the meeting with suharto marked the beginning 
of the normalization process xinhua quoted qian as telling 
reporters 
they agreed that the two countries should make further efforts 
toward the normalization of bilateral relations which they said 
should be achieved on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence the news agency quoted an unidentified official as 
saying 
china long has been pressing for normalization of relations with 
indonesia but jakarta has held back largely because of fear china 
would use its influence among indonesias ethnic chinese to foment 
unrest 
about 4 million of indonesias 168 million people are ethnic 
chinese many of them wealthy businessmen 
china has repeatedly assured indonesia it will follow a handsoff 
policy 
last spring vice foreign minister liu shuqing visited jakarta 
and told indonesian foreign minister ali alatas that china would not 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries including 
indonesia 
direct trade which the two countries resumed in 1985 reached 
611 million in 1987 with indonesia enjoying a more than 100 
million surplus

the next catastrophic earthquake on 
californias san andreas fault might be triggered by a moderate jolt 
that ruptures a littleknown fault hours earlier says a study by 
new york scientists 
we have noticed a pattern of earthquakes which if it 
continues could trigger the southern san andreas to snap in a 
major quake measuring 7 on the richter scale or a great 
quake of magnitude 8 said geologist ken hudnut of columbia 
universitys lamontdoherty geological observatory 
the next quake in the pattern of northwardmigrating temblors is 
likely to occur on the extra fault 90 miles northeast of san diego 
hudnut and seismologists leonardo seeber and javier pacheco said in 
this months issue of geophysical research letters 
a magnitude55 temblor on the extra fault could be all it 
takes to start a largetogreat earthquake on the san andreas 
fault which the extra fault intersects hudnut said by phone from 
palisades ny 
its a reasonable scenario us geological survey 
seismologist lucile jones said wednesday 
hudnuts theory along with others about how californias 
longdreaded big one could begin soon will be reviewed by a 
usgs committee cochaired by jones and california institute of 
technology geologist kerry sieh 
we want to consider ahead of time how we would respond to 
various smaller earthquakes and other physical phenomena that might 
be precursors to a great earthquake sieh said 
jones said the committee will decide whether and when public 
warnings should be issued if ominous signs of an impending big 
one are detected 
such warnings could spur evacuations of dangerous buildings 
preparations of emergency crews and equipment and precautions by 
citizens said mike guerin spokesman for californias office of 
emergency services 
a usgs study last summer concluded that a major or great quake is 
at least 60 percent likely within 30 years somewhere on the southern 
san andreas 
if hudnuts theory is correct the quake would start where the 
extra fault intersects the southern end of the san andreas 
coachella valley segment an area already considered overdue for a 
big jolt 
if the quake was limited to that 60mile segment which stretches 
from the salton sea northwest to near palm springs it would be a 
magnitude7 quake jones and sieh said 
however the san andreas might continue to rupture through an 
additional 120 miles on its san bernardino mountains and mojave 
segments which are closer to los angeles that would be a 
magnitude8 great quake nicknamed the big one jones and 
sieh said 
a 1980 federal report estimated such a quake would kill 3000 to 
14000 people seriously injure 12000 to 55000 and cause up to 
17 billion in damage 
there is no indication when the extra fault might snap but the 
theory it might trigger the big one is supported by computer 
calculations of fault behavior and a pattern in which quakes on 
certain crossfaults have migrated north since 1979 hudnut said 
crossfaults run from southwest to northeast intersecting the 
san andreas and other major faults that run southeastnorthwest 
jones and other officials spent a sleepless night after the most 
recent crossfault quake a magnitude62 jolt on the elmore ranch 
fault on nov 23 1987 they worried it might trigger the big 
one on the san andreas but didnt issue a warning instead 
scientists believe it triggered a magnitude66 quake that occurred 
11 hours later on nov 24 on the san jacinto faults superstition 
hills segment injuring 94 people 
that experience spurred formation of the usgs committee so 
decisions on public warnings can be based on predetermined criteria 
rather than being made during a crisis jones said

the house ethics committee began closeddoor 
deliberations today on how to handle allegations of improper conduct 
against house speaker jim wright as republicans set their political 
sights on the texas democrat 
the panel started reviewing a voluminous report by its 
independent counsel richard j phelan who has been investigating 
wright for nearly nine months the meetings are expected to extend 
at least into next week 
the politically sensitive nature of the process was evident in 
the tight security surrounding the committees activities the 
limited number of copies of the ethics report were being kept locked 
up in the committees basement offices and the 12 members of the 
panel six democrats and six republicans were not being permitted 
to take them out of the rooms 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif paused on his way into 
the session only to say tersely that the panel was meeting on 
routine business and that no announcements would be forthcoming 
today he said other meetings would be scheduled for next week 
the panel is expected to decide within the next week or two 
whether wright violated house rules by abusing his office for 
financial gain as alleged and if so whether to seek punishment of 
the speaker 
whatever the outcome of that probe republicans already were 
laying plans to make political hay of wrights problems in the 1990 
congressional elections edward rollins executive director of the 
national republican congressional committee said the gop campaign 
organization will make sure wright has a wellfinanced opponent next 
year 
im going to make a lot of democrats stand up and defend jim 
wright rollins said wednesday im going to give him the run of 
his life 
wright reacted strongly today to rollins threat suggesting that 
congressional democrats would be less inclined to cooperate with 
president bush on budget and other matters if political attacks 
persist 
you cant have it both ways obviously wright told 
reporters rollins confirms what i have known all along that 
the whole motivation of the inquiry was from its inception 
partisan 
the speaker said he had no knowledge of the ethics reports 
contents he reiterated that he has violated no rules but 
acknowledged that in retrospect he might have done some things 
differently theres 100 things you wish you hadnt done in your 
life any of us would do a lot of things differently sure he 
said 
in a resolution approved last june 9 the ethics committee 
formally called the committee on standards of official conduct set 
out to investigate wright on six counts they include allegations 
that he improperly lobbied for a constituent with whom he had 
financial dealings that he used campaign and taxpayer funds to 
publish a book on which he received 55000 in royalties and that 
he improperly lobbied officials of the federal home loan bank board 
phelans report on those and other charges is the product of a 
nearly ninemonth preliminary inquiry the ethics panels equivalent 
of a grand jury investigation 
todays meeting was scheduled for phelan to present the results 
of his work and for members of the committee to ask questions the 
next step for the panel will be either to dismiss the case if it 
finds no rules have been violated or to call for a disciplinary 
hearing if wright is found culpable 
members of the ethics panel were asked to clear their calendars 
next week to allow for continued meetings 
phelan and his staff interviewed 63 witnesses under oath and a 
handful of other unsworn witnesses in the probe which appeared to 
extend beyond the six specific charges against wright to include his 
life and political career extending back four decades 
the ethics committee has been given up to 850000 to pay phelan 
and reimbursement for expenses could push the total cost of the 
investigation to more than 1 million 
wright on wednesday maintained that he would be exonerated 
i do know there hasnt been any violation of any law or any 
house rule he said they spent over 1 million and a long long 
time and went back into the last 40 years of my personal and public 
life thats fine im glad they did 
wright said the result is a thorough and exhaustive 
investigation one nobody under the widest stretch of the 
imagination could describe as a whitewash 
rep newt gingrich rga sought recently to press a resolution 
through the house republican policy committee calling for public 
disclosure of all the evidence but he agreed to withhold the 
resolution for now after being assured by rep john myers rind 
the senior republican on the ethics panel that a detailed report 
will ultimately be made public

i just think it was such a neat thing we had such a hoot when 
we got it said paula roberts manager of the smith book store 
rick lawson admitted swiping the goods while he was a student at 
oklahoma state university in 1981 he said he took the materials 
because he did not have the money to buy them at the time 
in his letter received by the store feb 16 lawson said he 
recently surrendered my life to the lord and asked store 
officials for their forgiveness 
lawson who now lives in saginaw texas said in a telephone 
interview that it was a tough decision but it had to be done 
i could tell it was the right thing to do he said 
i think it took a lot of courage to write that letter ms

the red cross said today it resumed an 
airlift of food and medicine to tens of thousands of starving people 
in southern sudan after a twoweek interruption caused by 
technical problems 
the government confirmed the rebel shelling of an important 
southern provincial capital and said 11 civilians died 
bernard juler acting director of the international committee of 
the red cross told the associated press the airlift resumed 
wednesday and that three planeloads had already reached wau capital 
of the southern bahr elghazal region 625 miles south of khartoum 
the red cross was able to get approval from the government and 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army or spla in december to 
airlift supplies to both governmentheld and rebelheld areas in the 
south 
it had been difficult to get relief to the south because the 
rebels were shooting at civilian and military flights there 
claiming the army was using relief planes to transport its supplies 
the airlift was abruptly stopped two weeks ago 
it was only technical questions and we have overcome that we 
have supplied both the government and the spla with new flight 
programs and schedules and we obtained the okay juler said 
juler said that airlift would continue as long as it was needed 
and conditions were favorable he said there would be two flights a 
day each carrying about 17 tons of food and medicine 
the flights to the governmentheld towns leave from khartoum and 
those for the rebelheld areas leave from airports in northeast 
kenya 
the rebels took up arms against the government in 1983 demanding 
more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms 
in a broadcast over national unity radio monitored wednesday 
night in nairobi the sudanese government said the sudan peoples 
liberation army shelled the southern city of juba on monday killing 
11 civilians 
more than 50000 refugees have crowded into juba in the past 
year seeking relief from famine and civil war 
the rebels announced the artillery attack in an earlier broadcast 
over their clandestine radio station saying the shelling was 
confined to military targets juba a city of 150000 about 80 miles 
north of the ugandan border is the capital of sudans southernmost 
province of equatoria

us authorities raided the downtown jewelry 
market and arrested at least 37 people nationwide in an effort to 
smash a 1 billion cocaine moneylaundering ring allegedly run by a 
syrian national 
the surveillance investigation which lasted for more than a 
year was the biggest of its kind undertaken by the government 
attorney general dick thornburgh and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady said in a statement released wednesday

1 billion through jewelry merchants in los angeles texas florida 
and new york authorities said 
a key leader of the ring was identified as wanis joseph 
koyomejian 47 a syrian national who lives in suburban northridge 
he was ordered held without bail wednesday night by us magistrate 
ralph geffen 
a man answering the telephone at koyomejians home declined to 
comment and hung up calls to the house were unanswered this morning 
the los angeles raid began just as stores in the nations 
secondlargest jewelry district prepared to open for business 
wednesday 
hundreds of federal agents swept through the downtown district 
creating a traffic jam as incredulous onlookers stared while dozens 
of employees were handcuffed at jewelry counters 
complaints filed in us district court here charged 33 people 
and a hollywood fla corporation with laundering colombian cocaine 
profits the 13monthold probe nicknamed polar cap also led to 
the seizure of 640 pounds of cocaine according to court documents 
it was unclear exactly how many people were arrested wednesday as 
authorities searched 85 locations in los angeles new york and 
miami the justice department statement issued in washington said 
37 people were arrested 
the arrests came a day after a 1 billion heroin raid in new york 
city what authorities called the largest in us history police 
and federal agents had tracked 800 pounds of the drug from southeast 
asia 
the los angeles moneylaundering operation was directed primarily 
from two wholesale jewelry companies ropex corp owned by 
koyomejian and andonian brothers manufacturing co according to 
court documents 
the owners of andonian brothers vahe andonian and his brother 
nazareth andonian also were arrested wednesday 
the defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of 
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of millions of 
dollars in cash the money packed like bricks and shipped by

most striking employees at a staterun 
hospital that had been staffed by national guard troops returned to 
work today under a court order and their union leaders suggestion 
the hospitals administrator said 
the numbers are good this reflects a complete turnaround from 
the past couple of days general hospital administrator james p 
benedict said after the 7 am shift began work 
seventyfour of the 85 attendants scheduled to work showed up as 
did eight of 10 licensed practical nurses and virtually all of the 
registered nurses benedict said the remaining number of workers 
absent was normal for that shift 
the national guard which had been helping to care for more than 
400 chronically ill patients since the strike began sunday night 
will remain at the facility for the rest of the day to help with the 
transition benedict said he said the guard has been costing the 
state 20000 a day 
gov edward d diprete said wednesday workers who failed to 
return by 7 am would be fired and termination letters were 
prepared overnight 
benedict said the letters had not been sent 
at a hearing in providence superior court a state attorney john 
breguet told judge antonio s almeida the state would not seek to 
fine local 1350 of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees even though the union did not immediately obey 
the judges order to return to work at 3 pm wednesday 
we believe 1350 is actively encouraging workers to return to 
work breguet said 
almeida said he was annoyed that his order had not been obeyed 
but accepted the states recommendation he scheduled a new hearing 
for march 15 and continued the backtowork order until then 
diprete called both sides to his office for three hours of 
negotiations wednesday the first in five days and said after the 
talks that a settlement was near but only if the union returned to 
work 
union president jospeh fargnoli said he encouraged them to go 
back to work but it was up to each member whether to return 
some workers chanted no work no work as they left the 
union hall wednesday more than a dozen union members picketed near 
the hospitals entrance 
nearly half of 66 scheduled attendants and 19 of 29 nurses 
reported for their 3 pm shifts said benedict thirty acutecare 
patients have been transferred to other facilities he said 
union members walked out over claims that the state refused to 
fill contractmandated positions the state in an effort to cut 
overtime has refused to call in additional staff in many cases 
where workers are sick 
diprete said the states offer of a 53centsanhour pay raise 
rejected overwhelmingly by union members was still available the 
increase would have raised attendants starting salaries from 
16600 to 17600 and nurses starting wages from 18800 to 
20000 
wednesdays negotiations ended with some concessions on staffing 
levels after a wardbyward analysis said gerard p cobleigh a 
union attorney fargnoli said there was nothing concrete at all 
no new negotiations were scheduled but fargnoli and cobleigh said 
they would return to the table if necessary

the former chairman of the house intelligence 
committee testified at oliver l norths trial today that he knew 
nothing of reagan administration efforts to obtain aid for the 
nicaraguan rebels from other countries until after the irancontra 
affair became public 
new details of the administrations efforts to solicit assistance 
from foreign nations in return for increased us military and 
economic aid emerged during defense crossexamination of rep lee 
hamilton dind 
defense lawyer brendan v sullivan jr asked hamilton if he knew 
that the administration arranged for an asian nation to sell 
missiles to the contras asked an asian country to supply 
communications equipment and obtained aircraft from a central 
american nation to train rebel pilots 
none of these countries was identified but hamilton told 
sullivan he was not told of these and other administration efforts 
to solicit the contra aid while direct us military assistance was 
banned by congress between 1984 and 1986 
my recollection is that my knowledge of the events came 
subsequent to the time frame hamilton said 
the defense is trying to blunt charges that north a former white 
house aide lied to congress about his efforts to assist the contras 
by showing that the reagan administration didnt tell lawmakers 
about its broad efforts to help the rebels by soliciting foreign 
donations after congress shut off us aid in 1984 
hamilton the leadoff prosecution witness in the us district 
court trial was followed to the stand by adolfo calero the 
americaneducated president of the nicaraguan freedom forces as the 
contras were known 
colero said that from the time he joined the organization in 
1983 it was my clear understanding that the effort to regain my 
country was being financially supported by the united states 
government the cia was understood to be the source of the money 
calero said the money flow dried up in may 1984 after congress 
banned military aid to the contras but he said members of the cia 
accompanied by north visited him and he gave them an account number 
in a miami bank 
the contra leader said that beginning in june 1984 and ending in 
february 1985 32 million was put into the account of which the 
rebels spent 17 million or 18 million for lethal weapons 
but sometime in 1985 calero said north mentioned the need to 
help american hostages in lebanon and i said i would gladly 
contribute money he said he gave north 90000 in visa travelers 
checks 
one of the charges against north is that he used at least 4300 
of that money for himself 
calero said he didnt expect that north would spend any of the 
money for his personal use he said north told him he kept a 
detailed accounting of how he spent the travelers checks but i 
never demanded it of him i had absolute trust i was not asking him 
for an accounting 
hamilton said he didnt know at the time that secretary of state 
george p shultz asked an asian country to provide communications 
equipment to the contras because the rebels devices were antiquated 
he also said he wasnt told that that shultz and thennational 
security adviser john m poindexter knew of a plan by a central 
american nation to provide aircraft to help train contra fighter 
pilots 
sullivan asked if hamilton was told that poindexters predecessor 
as national security adviser robert mcfarlane authorized north to 
contact a senior military official of an asian country to 
arrange the sale of missiles to the resistance 
hamilton said he couldnt recall being told this he also he was 
not told that gen john w vessey jr thenchairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff also met with the asian official to arrange the 
sale 
on redirect examination hamilton insisted that he did not have 
to check the denials north and mcfarlane made to him of news reports 
the national security council staff was helping the contras in 
defiance of the congressional ban on such aid 
why did you rely in 1985 to the word of national security 
adviser mcfarlane asked prosecutor john w keker 
mcfarlane was a top security adviser to the president of the 
united states upon whom can i rely if i cant rely on the 
presidents top adviser hamilton replied 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel is charged with 12 
felonies arising from the irancontra affair that could result in 60 
years imprisonment upon conviction 
among other things he is accused of obstructing congressional 
inquiries into his efforts to raise money for the nicaraguan rebels 
this allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helping 
mcfarlane who has pleaded guilty to withholding information from 
congress draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries

us rep donald e lukens was indicted 
today on a misdemeanor charge stemming from allegations that he had 
sex with a teenage girl a prosecutor said 
the 58yearold divorced congresman was indicted by a franklin 
county grand jury on a charge of contributing to the delinquency of 
a juvenile girl county prosecutor michael miller said 
lukens rohio faces up to 180 days in jail and a fine if 
convicted miller said 
anna coffman the mother of a 17yearold columbus girl has 
accused lukens of paying for sexual relations with her daughter on 
two occasions once four years ago when the girl was 13 years old 
in a statement issued by his office in washington the fourterm 
congressman said i do categorically deny that i contributed to 
the delinquency and unruliness of a minor at any time 
columbus television station wsyx on feb 1 broadcast a videotape 
that shows lukens apparently offering a job to ms coffman after she 
asked him why he was messin around with her daughter the 
station said it secretly videotaped the nov 11 meeting between 
lukens and ms coffman at a fastfood restaurant in columbus 
lukens told ms coffman he thought her daughter was an adult 
according to the videotape 
the fbi reviewed the tape and said it found no evidence of 
bribery or extortion 
police investigated lukens last year and gave their report to 
miller 
the grand jury heard testimony on friday from ms coffman and a 
woman who said she saw lukens with the girl in his columbus 
apartment another woman who said she saw the girl in lukens 
apartment testified tuesday 
the grand jury did not request testimony from lukens and he did 
not testify before the panel miller said 
had the congressman wished to testify i would have allowed him 
to testify miller said 
lukens also was the subject of published reports this week that 
he sought and accepted a 95000 bank loan in june 1985 a week 
before he voted for a banking bill he sponsored while he was a state 
senator the bill allowed financial institutions to expand into 
other states 
he has declined comment on those reports but a spokesman bill 
jarrell said lukens did nothing wrong and used no influence in 
soliciting the loan needed to save the family farm from foreclosure 
lukens was first elected to congress in 1966 and served two 
terms and lost a bid for governor in the 1970 republican primary 
after that race he was barred from seeking public office for 
five years for not filing campaign reports on time however that 
campaign law was changed before the fiveyear period expired and he 
was appointed to the state senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term 
in 1974 while in the state senate he fought allegations that he 
accepted 1000 in campaign contributions from korean businessman 
tongsun park during his first stint on capitol hill he denied the 
charge presenting the results of a voluntary lie detector test that 
indicated he was not lying when he said he had not received a 
contribution from park 
he returned to congress in 1986

a judge acquitted a dentist today of one 
charge in a scheme to conceal the death of a man whose family tended 
his mummified corpse for nine years but ordered the trial to 
continue on another charge 
knox county judge daniel j roberts dismissed a charge of cruelty 
to children against richard g kunce 57 kunce who also faces a 
forgery charge is accused of helping conceal the 1979 death of carl 
stevens 39 of rural knoxville 
kunce later took the stand and denied committing any crime and 
the defense rested its case 
kunce a livein guest at the stevens home since 1986 said he 
had met stevens both before and after stevens death at age 39 and 
described himself as a nutritional adviser to the family 
i met him carl once before he went down and i met him many 
times after he went down kunce said 
when he first saw stevens body in may 1980 kunce said carls 
body was totally black and carole had been putting liquid vitamins 
in his belly button 
roberts rulings today were in response to a defense motion to 
dismiss both charges against kunce of aurora the trial began 
tuesday 
the cruelty charge stemmed from allegations that kunce taught 
stevens teenage children about suicide black magic and 
communication with the dead 
i have come to the conclusion there is no showing what effect 
kunces actions had on the children roberts said theres no 
evidence of injury to the children therefore i must dismiss the 
cruelty charge 
the judge said he did not dismiss the forgery charge however 
because of contradictory testimony he felt jurors should consider 
the trial resumed after he issued the rulings 
authorities discovered stevens corpse last year when his cousin 
saw it and called police authorities later learned that stevens 
widow carole had tended the corpse as if it were alive 
on wednesday kunces attorney john pepmeyer acknowledged his 
client had helped mrs stevens forge a power of attorney to 
refinance her house but he said kunce signed the document to help 
a friend not to defraud anyone 
i didnt hear anything sufficient to prove criminal acts beyond 
a reasonable doubt pepmeyer said they prosecutors dont have 
enough ammunition to get to first base 
it has long been the law that fraudulent intent is an essential 
element of forgery pepmeyer said 
knox county prosecutor jonathan schlake argued that kunce helped 
mrs stevens deceive bankers in obtaining a new mortgage 
the power of attorney document was capable of being used to 
defraud someone on its face schlake said 
earlier wednesday police detectives testified that kunce told 
them he regularly spoke with carl stevens during the nine years his 
corpse was in the home 
kunce said carl was happy and content according to the 
detectives 
one conversation took place just days before kunce was arrested 
said investigator dick flanagan 
kunce said he was working out walked into the bedroom and 
carl said good workout richard the investigator said 
flanagan and stephen johnson a knox county sheriffs detective 
told of entering the stevens home and finding the body dressed in 
blue pajama bottoms and white socks lying in bed with sheets pulled 
up around his chest 
also wednesday forensic pathologist larry blum of mchenry said 
he found no evidence of homicide when he performed an autopsy on 
stevens corpse the body had been naturally mummified 
my opinion is that mr stevens died of complications of the 
disease of diabetes blum said adding that the body could have 
remained in its mummified condition indefinitely if protected from 
the elements 
ive never seen a body completely mummified like mr stevens 
blum said this was a first for me 
mrs stevens 43 pleaded guilty last march to forgery and 
failure to report a death she was sentenced to 12 days in jail and 
placed on two years probation 
kunce faces up to five years in prison and a 10000 fine if 
convicted of forgery

the environmental protection agency was 
criticized at a house hearing today for using skilled contract 
employees as office workers even though they were hired to inspect 
hazardous waste sites 
these contract rates are not minimum wage but sometimes more 
than 30 per hour said rep gerry sikorski dminn chairman of 
the civil service subcommittee of the house post office and civil 
service committee 
sikorski conducting the hearing to review epa contracting 
practices also criticized epa for giving contractors undeserved 
monetary performance awards for paying contract workers for 
attending conferences 
he based his remarks on findings by epa inspector general john c 
martin who testified before the panel 
sikorski accused the epa of taking a dont worry be happy 
attitude in which the agency views the criticism as perception 
problems 
henry l longest ii director of epas office of emergency and 
remedial response told sikorski im not saying we dont have any 
problems but he also defended agency contracting especially in 
the superfund hazardous waste cleanup program 
the skilled inspection employees were working in the office he 
said because we had data inhouse on the hazardous waste sites 
they would have inspected in massachusetts longest said 
he added that the incentive award fees are based on a 
contractors overall work and can be given out even if certain 
parts of the work are below standards 
martin described to the committee his findings on the epas 
contract with nus corp 
the agency hired the company of the washington suburb of 
gaithersburg md to provide field inspection teams to inspect 
potential superfund cleanup sites in four of the agencys regions 
atlanta boston new york city and philadelphia the inspector 
generals report estimated the fiveyear contract will cost 125 
million by its finish 
the report said the contract turned sour within a month of its 
nov 1 1986 beginning when the bostonbased region i stopped 
preliminary onsite inspections of hazardous waste areas the region 
ordered the contract employees to get data from state officials and 
information supplied by the polluters of the sites 
the contract employees morale was affected since almost all 
activity was office work the report said during the 10 
months the policy was in effect 41 percent of the nus professional 
staff resigned or was transferred the report said 
the inspector general said the policy of paying for nus employees 
to attend conferences was questioned internally by at least one epa 
official who wrote the practice might not hold up too well under 
any type of scrutiny congressional inspector general or 
otherwise 
a separate inspector generals report given the subcommittee 
criticized the philadelphiabased region iii management of epas 
emergency superfund response program which uses contract employees 
to respond to environmental emergencies 
the report found that members of a team of groundwater 
hydrologists toxicologists chemists and environmental scientists 
often were used as file clerks 
the inspector generals reports included comments from the epa 
which defended its actions 
the agency said the audit covered only the first 13 months of a 
fiveyear contract and failed to list major accomplishments of 
the site inspection program that occured near the end of the first 
year 
the epa also disagreed with the emergency response team report 
emphasizing that maintaining good records was within the contracts 
scope of work but the agency said that to avoid the appearance of 
wasteful work the clerical tasks will now be handled by people from 
the american association of retired persons 
donald couchman the nus vice president for administration 
declined comment calling the report internal review of epa 
management 
the nations superfund program is designed to clean up hazardous 
waste sites more than 30000 potential sites have been identified 
with 1175 designated on a national priority cleanup list remedial 
action has been completed at 48 sites with some work under way at 
more than half the priority sites according to epa 
the nus report said epa was too lenient in evaluating company 
work and gave the company undeserved performance awards 
one unit of contract employees received praise and award fees of 
over 90000 even though the team did not perform field work and had 
transferred a large segment of the team to do work on a state 
contract 
at the top superfund site in the country the lipari landfill in 
pitman nj the epa paid a nominal award fee even though an epa 
official was sharply critical of the companys work the report said

means she has a right to discuss them or not ms perez said

in the recent schoolyard massacre in stockton calif where five 
children were killed and more than two dozen were wounded

on semiautomatic weapons because they are used by sportsmen and 
hunters it was a semiautomatic ak47 that was used in the stockton 
incident

nations largest gun lobby said police should do more to enforce 
the laws

orders to factories for big ticket durable 
goods dropped 3 percent in january the government said thursday in 
a report that some analysts said could portend a welcome slowdown in 
economic growth 
the commerce department said total orders fell 4 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 12806 billion last month pulled down by sharp 
declines in the volatile transportation and defense sectors 
virtually all other major industrial categories were down as well 
with other reports indicating the strong economy has resulted in 
an acceleration of inflation analysts said some moderation in the 
pace of growth would be constructive 
this is one of the first signs that the economy is cooling 
off maury harris chief economist for painewebber inc in new 
york said of januarys decline in orders if you continue to get 
this weakness in february and march then all these inflation 
worries will fall by the wayside 
last months decrease in orders was concentrated in reduced 
demand for ships and tanks which affect both the transportation and 
military categories orders for aircraft and parts remained strong 
although down from decembers high levels 
overall transportation orders fell back 72 percent last month 
after a 221 percent surge in december excluding transportation 
orders in all other categories were down 12 percent in january 
in the erratic defense category subject to wide swings depending 
on when government contracts are signed orders plunged 335 percent 
in january after a 242 percent increase in december excluding 
defense all other orders were down 04 percent last month 
januarys 3 percent decrease in total orders was the biggest 
decline since a 74 percent drop last july and the first drop since 
a 28 percent decrease in september 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said manufacturers were experiencing a definite 
deceleration in the rate of advance after an earlier boom that was 
fueled by strong demand for exports and capital equipment 
orders had been up 109 percent for all of 1988 the best showing 
since 1984 and had risen a robust 73 percent in december 
the sizzling blistering frenetic pace that we had earlier has 
given way to something that is more temperate dederick said 
that is perhaps desirable given the concern about inflation it 
suggests we are perhaps moving toward a more sustainable growth 
path 
however jerry jasinowski chief economist for the national 
association of manufacturers said it was too early to be seeing 
signs of significant slowing 
we see a slowdown later this year but not in the first 
quarter jasinowski said this report shouldnt be looked at as 
a premature indicator that the economy is slowing 
he said the bright spot in januarys report was a 15 percent 
increase in demand for nondefense capital goods a category 
considered to be a good barometer of business intentions to 
modernize and expand 
in other industries orders for primary metals were down 12 
percent in january after a 44 percent jump in december orders for 
nonelectrical machinery were down 08 percent after a 11 percent 
increase and orders for electrical machinery were down 23 percent 
after falling 1 percent in december 
shipments of durable goods were unchanged in january at 12418 
billion following a 35 percent increase in december

the senate finance committee voted 170 today 
to confirm the nomination as secretary of health and human services 
of dr louis sullivan who testified that he opposes abortion except 
in three circumstances 
i am opposed to abortion except when the life of the mother is 
threatened or cases of rape or incest sullivan told the senate 
finance committee 
one member of the committee sen william armstrong rcolo 
replied present when the vote was taken 
sullivan apologized to sen bob packwood rore for having 
misspoken when they discussed sullivans position on abortion 
last month 
i support a human life amendment embracing the exceptions just 
noted like president bush i would welcome a supreme court decision 
overturning roe vs wade the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion 
he said 
packwood a prochoice advocate said that though he disagrees 
with sullivans position on abortion he will support his 
nomination he said the important decisions concerning abortion will 
be made in congress and the courts not at hhs which spends only a 
small fraction of its funds on abortions 
i think youre a whale of a guy packwood said 
sullivan said that if confirmed as hhs secretary he would work 
to encourage adoption and other alternatives to abortion 
abortion opponents were upset when packwood reported that 
sullivan had told him during a meeting that the nominee favored 
retaining the supreme court abortion ruling before his nomination 
sullivan was quoted in an atlanta newspaper as saying he favored a 
womans right to abortion 
sullivan the only black bush has nominated to his cabinet 
outlined for the committee his goals in running the largest federal 
bureaucracy 
bringing a new spirit of kindness and compassion to a vast 
federal department one with 114000 employees and a 400 billion 
budget may seem excessively idealistic but it is an ideal we can 
and must attain nothing less shall be my goal as secretary of 
hhs sullivan said 
among the things he hopes to achieve he said are finding ways 
to contain rapidly rising medical costs in federal programs without 
sacrificing quality of care for the poor and improving programs that 
help the poor work their way out of poverty 
he also said he wants to find ways to strengthen family life and 
continue research efforts to find a cure for aids as well as 
cancer heart disease and other debilitating diseases 
antiabortion activists demanded assurances from the bush 
administration that sullivans policies would follow those of the 
president on abortion and he later asked the white house to 
nominate three administrators known for their antiabortion views to 
top positions at the agency 
despite the controversy sullivans confirmation appears to be a 
certainty members of the senate finance committee are expected to 
approve his nomination after the hearing and the full senate is 
scheduled to vote on tuesday 
his hearing was postponed three weeks ago because an fbi 
background investigation was incomplete and questions remained about 
his finances 
but two weeks ago he put to rest concerns about conflicts of 
interest when he decided to forfeit nearly 300000 in severance pay 
due him if he cut his ties with the morehouse school of medicine 
the atlanta medical school he founded and has served as president 
sullivan told the panel that he will step down as president of 
the school if he is confirmed by the senate he said he would take 
an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of medicine and would 
receive no compensation from the school however he would continue 
to participate in fringe benefit programs offered by the school 
including life health and disability insurance 
he said he will not take the severance pay due him under his 
contract with morehouse in order to set to rest any concerns about 
potential conflicts of interest i felt it was more important to 
clear up those questions by the action i took he said 
sullivan a blood specialist will run the the federal 
governments largest department its budget of nearly 400 billion 
covers social security medicaid medicare the food and drug 
administration the public health service and the national 
institutes of health 
sullivan faced questioning on the bush administrations fiscal 
1990 budget proposal and about many of the more than 200 programs 
the department runs 
in response to questioning sullivan said the morehouse school 
made a mistake when in 1984 it hired a fulton county commissioner as 
a parttime lecturer that commissioner reginald eaves was paid 
more than 34000 over four years while he used his seat on the 
commission to promote issues that benefited the school in an 
unrelated matter eaves during that period was convicted of 
extortion 
sullivan told committee members it had been his understanding 
that the commission was aware that eaves was on the morehouse 
payroll the commissioners however were not aware he had 
understood that the commission had approved of eaves position at 
morehouse he said 
this was a serious error on our part in not assuring this had 
been done sullivan said 
he told members of the panel the school has taken steps to assure 
that kind of problem would not occur again 
several members of the panel said they hoped the white house 
would review its decision not to allow sullivan to take a paid 
sabbatical leave from morehouse while he is at hhs 
its grossly unfair to him said sen john danforth rmo 
the white house initially approved sullivans request to take a 
paid leave but then reversed itself and said the medical schools 
sabbatical policies did not meet the governments standards because 
they did not provide for the policy to be implemented uniformly 
among those eligible

the massive funeral for emperor hirohito and george 
bushs first overseas visit as us president have brought all four 
american television networks to japan for a week of unprecedented 
news coverage 
in the costliest effort cbs is wagering more than 2 million 
that its reports will draw an interested audience at home cbs 
evening news anchor dan rather said the effort was warranted 
because hirohitos death marked the end of the postwar era 
cbs coverage with more than 60 separate pieces to be broadcast 
over 18 hours is unprecedented because the network has taken its 
entire show on the road every news program except 60 minutes is 
broadcasting from japan cbs also scheduled live covering on its 
primetime program 48 hours 
the japanese always eager to learn how foreigners view them are 
busy drinking in the attention 
one japanese tv network is translating the cbs material and 
running them nightly and another network sent one of its anchors to 
los angeles to report on the us reaction to all the news about 
japan 
but the countrys week in the tv spotlight likely would not have 
happened if bush had not chosen japan as the site of his first 
overseas trip as president said lane venardos cbs executive 
producer for special events 
of course this is the dawn of a new era in japan and we felt 
that was worth reporting but george bush provides the catalyst for 
us to be here said venardos 
with feature stories ranging from memories of world war ii to 
sumo wrestling the risk is that people back in the us wont 
care and wont watch said venardos if its a turnoff we will 
have blown 2 million of cbs money and will be looking for new 
jobs 
long working hours attempts to drink in tokyos vibrant 
atmosphere and learn some of its rituals are taking a toll 
during a commercial on the set of cbs this morning host 
kathleen sullivan joked about a traditional tea ceremony she and 
cohost harry smith observed for the show 
the two had to kneel on the floor without moving for a 30minute 
rehearsal of the ceremony then repeat the excruciating halfhour 
for the real thing in introducing the spot sullivan sweetly read 
her lines coming up tea and serenity 
and pain she added through clenched teeth after the camera 
had clicked off 
cbs is not alone abc sent anchor peter jennings nbc sent anchor 
tom brokaw and cable news network sent mary alice williams and 
bernard shaw 
cbs started the week scooping the japanese media on their own 
turf with a 20minute interview with former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone in which nakasone made his first public statements denying 
any involvement in a stockprofiteering scandal that has rocked the 
government 
cnn sent a staff of more than 100 to tokyo to broadcast 20 hours 
of live coverage of the funeral and of the gathering of world 
leaders in tokyo 
nbc nightly news is broadcasting thursday and friday with 
brokaw at a serene japanesestyle garden at a tokyo tv station 
jennings is anchoring five nights of world news tonight from 
an outdoor post in the bustling commercial shibuya area of tokyo 
all four have been spotlighting japans culture economy and 
emerging political clout in reports leading up to the funeral and 
bushs activities

the huge pressure vessel from the 
worlds first dismantled commercial nuclear reactor is awaiting 
better weather to begin its 8100mile journey through the panama 
canal to washington state for burial 
the 1000ton vessel and neutronshield tank from shippingport 
the nations first commercial nuclear plant were packed in concrete 
and lifted onto the 200foot seagoing barge paul bunyan in the ohio 
river last week 
the 60day journey to the us energy department dump at hanford 
wash will begin in several weeks when officials can count on 
better weather along its route down the ohio and mississippi rivers 
and through the gulf of mexico and pacific ocean department 
spokesman tom bauman said wednesday 
were going to make very sure its very safe for sea before we 
ship it he said there will be no danger whatsoever in fact 
the radioactivity levels are less than 1 percent of the standards 
allowed for this type of radioactive shipment 
the reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site at 
shippingport 30 miles from pittsburgh on dec 14 in the most 
dramatic although not necesarily the most critical phase of the 
fiveyear decommissioning 
it was lifted by a crane placed on a specially constructed 
flatbed transporter with 320 rubber tires and rolled to the river 
bank and the barge which has a 4000ton capacity 
the shippingport plant was dedicated by president eisenhower in 
1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 65 billion kilowatthours 
of electricity 
it is the worlds only commercial reactor to be dismantled 
several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed 
the government hopes to show that reactors that have outlived 
their usefulness can be dismantled safely and affordably 
federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so 
the site can be returned to unrestricted use no decision has been 
made as to how to use the land 
the decommissioning is expected to be completed by 1990 at a cost 
of about 98 million 
the cylindrical reactor 41 feet long 30 feet high and 18 feet 
in diameter is composed of a pressure vessel with 8inch steel 
walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1 inches 
thick 
spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete to stabilize 
it and reduce radioactivity

religiously 
he can boast of 70 years of nearly perfect attendance and has 70 
attendance pins to show for it 
sunday school is a spiritual boost for me said codd who 
turned 80 sunday and also leads a weekly bible study for a group of 
seven elderly people 
i just enjoy the fellowship he said 
getting there hasnt always been easy 
at age 11 when codd was visiting his grandmother in chesterton 
ind a storm dumped 3 feet of snow 
his uncle hitched a horse to a sleigh and got him to church no 
one else made it but a church janitor initialed a card noting that 
codd had tried to attend 
codd received his first perfect attendance pin in 1916 from grace 
united bretheran church in chicago two years later the flu kept 
him from receiving a pin but he attended for 50 years from 1919 to 
1969 
since then codd has missed sunday school only three weeks 
because of an operation and job obligations he said 
when traveling codd stops at the first church he comes upon 
it doesnt matter what denomination the church is he said 
its a shame we have so many denominations because the sunday

a lebanese man suspected of hijacking a 
jordanian airliner with americans aboard goes on trial friday in a 
landmark case highlighting the long reach of us antiterrorism 
laws 
fawaz younis is accused of participating in the june 1985 
hijacking of a jordanian jetliner en route from beirut lebanon to 
amman jordan younis held without bail since his capture in 
september 1987 pleaded innocent to charges that carry a maximum 
sentence of life in prison if he is convicted 
younis is accused of leading the hijacking in which the boeing 
727 with 72 passengers and crew members was forced on a 
mediterranean odyssey starting and ending in beirut no one was 
killed in the hijacking 
the prosecution contends younis and four companions heavily 
armed with ak47 assault rifles freed the hostages and blew up the 
aircraft on the runway at the beirut airport 
younis 29 arrested in 1987 by us intelligence agents is the 
first suspected terrorist captured under the 1984 hostagetaking 
act which gives the united states jurisdiction outside its 
territorial boundaries when american citizens are taken hostage 
the decision to capture younis came after the united states was 
frustrated in an attempt to gain the extradition from west germany 
of mohammed ali hamadi allegedly among hijackers of a twa plane in 
which an american navy diver was killed hamadi is on trial in west 
germany 
younis was identified in pretrial testimony as one of the guards 
in the twa hijacking which took place three days later but he has 
not been charged in that case 
in an operation involving the justice state and defense 
departments younis was lured by an fbi informant in cyprus onto a 
uschartered yacht with the promise of a drug deal and a party 
operating in international waters to avoid legal complications 
with other countries fbi agents transferred younis to a navy supply 
ship in the mediterranean then to an aircraft carrier and then by 
airplane to andrews air force base outside washington 
younis who sustained broken wrists during his arrest was read 
his rights in arabic and then provided interrogators with a 
confession while he was at sea 
the defense argued in pretrial motions that younis confession 
was obtained illegally because he was seasick and in too much pain 
to remain silent but an appeals court has allowed the confession to 
be admitted into evidence 
evidence against younis also includes testimony from passengers 
and a videotape of the defendant standing near the hijacked plane at 
beirut airport the hijackers were demanding that palestinian 
guerrillas be removed from lebanon 
witnesses in the case include two middle eastern crew members 
two american passengers and one arab passanger 
william slade an american student who was aboard the seized 
airliner has testified that younis spent most of the time in the 
cockpit but emerged about 10 times 
at a pretrial hearing wednesday defense attorney francis d 
carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking on 
orders from commanders of the amal militia a shiite moslem faction 
in lebanon 
carter won tentative approval from us district judge aubrey e 
robinson to allow expert testimony concerning amal on condition that 
the defendant testify that he was ordered by his superiors to hijack 
the plane if he testifies that he had a direct order we may 
allow it the judge said 
however the judge ruled out a defense based on a theory that all 
mechanisms of law and order had broken down in lebanon and that 
any reasonable person would have followed a command to hijack a 
plane 
assistant us attorney ramsey johnson said that the hijacking 
is so patently criminal that the defense of following orders 
should not be allowed in this case

more than 24 hours after hed left washington 
president bushs inner fires were still burning as brightly on 
thursday as the blaze in the fireplace of the us embassy where he 
ended his long day meeting separately with six world leaders 
at the end of his first day in japan bush spent three hours 
speaking with two prime ministers three presidents and a king one 
after another 
sometimes being president means doing the same thing over and 
over again 
this was the procedure and it did not deviate 
into an ornate highceilinged room in the us embassy the 
very room where a victorious gen douglas mcarthur first received 
the vanquished emperor hirohito bush received leader after leader 
such as thailands prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
nice cozy fire here said bush leading the prime minister to 
one blue chair taking the other while photographers snapped away 
they were maybe the most photographed chairs in tokyo 
you came in today the president asked how long a flight 
was that 
about five hours said choonhavan bush nodded 
the press was ushered out as the two leaders and a handful of 
aides from both countries moved to a circle of nottoocomfortable 
looking chairs elsewhere in the room for about 20 minutes of 
diplomatic icebreaking choonhavan got 22 minutes indias president 
ramaswamy venkataraman got 28 jordans king hussein got 20 
bush to venkataraman did you come direct 
bush to egypts president hosni mubarak how are all the 
problems of the world and with a wave toward the press corps 
we cant discuss it until they leave 
for heavens sake exclaimed venkataraman when he saw the 
fire in the fireplace 
it was remarkable smokeless well drafted the flames shot 
straight up in between dignitaries an aide moved in with fresh 
logs feeding the flames 
but bushs fire finally appeared to sputter a bit after his 
27hour day 
at the end of his final chat a clearly tired president waved at 
reporters and said see you guys sleep well

the biggest cheer bush heard all day the only noisy spontaneous 
outburst of approval came hours and thousands of miles earlier at 
elmendorf air force base in alaska what brought it on was bushs 
suggestion to an audience of airmen infantrymen and their families 
that hed like to return to alaska to go fishing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was at elmendorf that hirohito landed on the start of a 14day 
visit to the united states in 1975 during that trip according to a 
biographical sketch put out by the us government he acquired his 
favorite american souvenir a mickey mouse wristwatch 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us biographical sketch of bush issued in connection with 
this trip diplomatically glosses over his wartime experiences it 
says he won four decorations as a bomber pilot in the pacific 
theater but says nothing about having been shot down by the 
japanese 
and the usissued biography of bushs japanese counterpart 
prime minister noboru takeshita covers the period from his birth to 
his graduation from college in 1947 skipping takeshitas wartime 
experience he was a pilot trainee when the japanese sued for peace 
in 1945 after the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki

an environmental time bomb is ticking away 
miles above the north pole as chemicals there threaten to damage the 
earths protective ozone layer sen albert gore jr said thursday 
stated as simply as possible this is one of the most serious 
environmental threats our planet faces gore dtenn said at a 
hearing during which a team of scientists reported on a 
justcompleted study of the arctic atmosphere 
dr adrian tuck of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said that while no direct evidence of arctic ozone 
damage was found scientists were surprised at the extent to which 
conditions in that area show the potential for such damage 
these threatening changes in the arctic atmosphere present a 
virtual time bomb gore commented at a hearing of the senate 
commerce subcommittee on science technology and space 
the north pole study was conducted in an effort to determine if 
that portion of the world has an ozone hole similar to that 
detected over the south pole in recent winters 
scientists are concerned about the seasonal depletion of ozone in 
the air eight to 10 miles above the earths surface because it is 
that layer that protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun a 1 percent depletion of ozone worldwide 
could lead to a 2 percent increase in skin cancer among fairskinned 
people said dr robert t watson of the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
in addition increased ultraviolet radiation could damage plants 
and other life forms including the plankton krill and other ocean 
life so vital to feed larger fish and animals he said 
determining the extent of damage will not be easy since little 
research has been done and the noaa budget for such studies was cut 
annually under the reagan administration said sen john f kerry 
dmass 
watson said scientists turned their attention to the north 
because most of the worlds people live in the northern hemisphere 
and an ozone loss in that area could have even more significant 
effects than in the south 
the antarctic ozone loss has been measured at as much as 50 
percent in the southern winter although the ozone is renewed in 
summer as more air flows into that region from other areas 
good ozone statistics are lacking for other areas watson said 
although he estimated that between 1970 and 1988 the layer has been 
depleted as much as 5 percent to 7 percent between 40 degrees north 
latitude and 65 degrees north that would be roughly between the 
middle of the united states and the northern end of norway 
as to the arctic region itself no significant loss was found in 
the new study but the region seemed poised on the brink tuck said 
dr susan solomon of noaa said the arctic study found increased 
levels of chlorine the chemical blamed for the loss as well as 
polar stratospheric clouds which can increase the rate of chemical 
reactions which damage ozone 
chlorine migrates to high altitudes from a variety of sources 
including refrigerants and other industrial chemicals many nations 
signed a protocol in montreal to reduce the use of these chemicals 
known as chlorofluorocarbons but watson said that agreement doesnt 
go far enough

specifically threaten the men or any of the 12 other foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
the group said it will take revenge against all those who took 
part in strong and ferocious campaigns against islam the revenge 
will cover all institutions and organizations that insulted in one 
way or another members of the prophet mohammeds family it said 
some say the satanic verses insults islam by portraying the 
prophets wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the koran 
rather than receiving it from god iranian clerics offered 52 
million to anyone who killed rushdie 
rushdie apologized saturday for the distress the book has caused 
khomeini who on feb 14 called for rushdies death rejected the

the us bookstore chains of b dalton and barnes amp noble which 
last week pulled the book from their shelves both reversed 
themselves after nationwide rallies by writers and said wednesday 
they would have the satanic verses in stock in about 10 days 
the decision was made at the urging of an overwhelming majority 
of store managers and employees according to a statement from 
the chains which are under common ownership 
the parliament of yugoslavias most liberal republic slovenia 
condemned irans death threat against rushdie and also criticized 
belgrades hosting of iranian pesident ali khamenei in the midst of

president bush used the occasion of an imperial 
japanese funeral to pursue a middle east peace while his secretary 
of state challenged the soviet union on thursday to pitch in with 
deeds instead of simply rhetorical exercises 
on the eve of services for the late emperor hirohito bush 
engaged in around of fastpaced diplomacy meeting with a succession 
of world leaders including egyptian president hosni mubarak israeli 
president chaim herzog and jordans king hussein 
after bushs round of meetings secretary of state james a baker 
iii challenged the soviets to contribute to the peace process in a 
concrete way by establishing full diplomatic relations with 
israel using its influence in syria and denouncing radical 
countries such as libya 
baker said a new dynamic for peace existed in the area and 
that bush hoped to nurture it the presidents sessions with mideast 
leaders provided a counterpoint to soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadzes 10day tour through the region where he attempted to 
advance moscows role 
on friday bush was to attend an elaborate state funeral for the 
late japanese emperor joining about 10000 other japanese and 
foreign leaders in two giant opensided tents for the solemn 
ceremony at tokyos shinjuku imperial gardens the park in downtown 
tokyo once served as the garden for the imperial household 
hirohito the last of the world war ii era world leaders died 
jan 7 of cancer at age 87 after reigning for six decades 
in a meeting with japans prime minister noboru takeshita on 
thursday bush began by expressing the condolences of the american 
people upon hirohitos death white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said 
first lady barbara bush meanwhile donned a tailored black suit 
and an elegant strand of pearls to pay a visit naoko takeshita the 
wife of the japanese prime minister 
the two women sipped tea at takeshitas official residence with 
mrs bush expressing sympathy over hirohitos death and the mrs 
takeshita offering congratulations on bushs election as president 
bushs focus on the middle east during his first overseas trip 
a fiveday visit to three asian capitals appeared to be an effort 
to steal some of the spotlight from shevardnadzes journey to the 
area 
baker briefing reporters after bushs full day of meetings with 
world leaders said soviet overtures to participate in a middle east 
peace were healthy quite frankly 
but he added i suppose we would want to know that there were 
concrete contributions that they had in mind rather than simply 
rhetorical exercises 
he said he would have a better idea of what the soviets intend 
when he meets with shevardnadze in march in vienna 
baker said contributing to the new dynamics for peace were talks 
between the united states and the palestine liberation organization 
and statements by plo leader yasser arafat denouncing terrorism 
he said the united states intended to be active in the peace 
process 
however he said ultimately a settlement would have to flow from 
direct negotiations between the palestinians and the israelis 
we are concerned that if we act too precipitously we might 
preempt promising possibilities that could surface if we adopted a 
more reasoned and measured approach baker added 
earlier fitzwater the white house spokesman said the subject 
of a middle east peace settlement also came up in a lunch with 
french president francois mitterrand 
we think there are some opportunities to move the peace 
process forward fitzwater said we want to be methodical and 
deliberate in our approach 
bushs seven hours of meetings with foreign leaders began 
immediately after he stepped off air force one following a 16hour 
flight here from washington 
by the time he ended a day that had begun at 5 am est on 
wednesday a clearly tired bush waved at reporters and said see 
you guys sleep well 
his meetings also included sessions with prime minister mario 
soares of portugal prime minister chatichai choonhavan of thailand 
and president ramaswamy venkataraman of india in backtoback 
meetings at the us embassy a block away from the okura hotel 
where bush and his entourage are staying 
he also paid a courtesy call on takeshita the japanese leader 
had been bushs first foreign visitor to the white house earlier 
this month 
yukio okamato a japanese foreign ministry official said bush 
and takeshita called each other by their first names george and 
noboru 
during the session bush a former combat pilot did not mention 
his experience of being shot in the pacific during world war ii by 
the japanese okamato said 
the japanese people are deeply touched by president bushs 
basic position that he is concerned with the present not the 
future okamato said in the meeting with takeshita at the richly 
decorated akasaka palace bush discussed a range of issues 
including trade the environment eastwest relations and cambodia 
fitzwater said 
on cambodia bush voiced concern that the withdrawal of 
vietnamese there was proceeding at a slower pace than we would 
like to see fitzwater said 
president bush also emphasized that we would like to see a 
government in cambodia that would involve prince sihanouk and would 
not see a return to the power of the khmer rouge the spokesman 
said 
after fridays funeral bush was expected to participate in still 
more facetoface sessions with foreign leaders including 
philippine president corazon aquino 
us officials had said a meeting with aquino had been hard to 
arrange because of scheduling difficulties 
the president was to have an audience with japans new emperor 
akihito on saturday before visiting beijing china and seoul 
south korea

state media on thursday attacked 
playwright and human rights activist vaclav havel and authorities 
filed charges against three more activists in a harsh crackdown on 
dissent 
the charter 77 human rights group issued a statement calling for 
citizens to oppose the lies and injustice around all of us 
former communist party chief alexander dubcek was quoted as calling 
for the release of havel and all political prisoners 
also on thursday thousands of people attended a rally in a 
prague square marking the 41st anniversary of the ruling communists 
1948 takeover 
the charges against charter 77 signatories vlasta chramostova and 
libuse silhanova and spokesman tomas hradilek were leveled 
wednesday the same day a prague court sentenced two younger 
activists to nine months and one year in jail 
ms chramostova and ms silhanova were charged with approving a 
crime and attacking state organs charges that carry a maximum jail 
sentence of one year said fellow activist petr uhl 
hradilek was charged with sedition punishable by up to five 
years in jail the charges against ms chramostova and ms silhanova 
were based on open letters they wrote jan 16 supporting a banned 
demonstration the day before and condemning the police violence used 
to break it up 
the demonstration was to mark the 20th anniversary of the death 
of jan palach a student who set himself afire to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
the actions and this weeks conviction and sentencing of havel 
constituted one of the biggest crackdowns ever on the human rights 
group 
the communist party daily rude pravo on thursday carried a 
lengthy attack on havel who despite strong protests from the west 
and east bloc was ordered jailed for nine months tuesday for his 
role in a banned demonstration last month 
havel a cofounder of charter 77 was depicted as the son of 
rich parents said to have collaborated with the occupying nazis in 
world war ii and as a man who wanted to restore the bourgeois 
democracy that existed before the war 
charter 77 issued a statement to commemorate the death on feb 
25 1969 of jan zajic a 19yearold student who also set himself 
afire 
let us at least try to react to that now 20 years later no 
longer by demonstrating but each of us in our own place and at our 
own discretion said the statement released in prague and london 
lies and injustice are visible all around us everyone of us is 
a witness to irresponsible frivolous selfseeking 
decisionmaking it said let us not accept it let us point 
out every wrong and let us not allow ourselves to be brushed aside 
the human rights organization formed in january 1977 was named 
for the document issued by founding members calling on 
czechoslovakia to respect civil liberties 
in an interview published in the current edition of the 
underground journal lidove noviny former communist party chief 
alexander dubcek denounced the jailing of havel and others as an 
action against common sense 
recent demonstrations are thus a direct reflection of the 
policy of the party over the last 20 years socialism is not 
threatened by rfe radio free europe but by a wrong policy which 
ignores social needs and the opinions of people said dubcek 
who was ousted after the 1968 invasion 
in pragues old town square politburo member miroslav stepan 
told a rally that authorities absolutely reject the casting of 
doubts on the government program 
stepans speech was sparsely applauded by a crowd estimated by 
the state news agency ctk at 120000 western reporters estimated 
considerably fewer people on the square 
stepan has been in the forefront of an apparent leadership 
attempt to stem mounting dissatisfaction and pressure for reform in 
czechoslovakia 
he has met in recent weeks with several of nearly 3000 artists 
and scientists who took the unprecedented step of protesting the 
detention of havel and other dissidents jan 16 and the police 
violence used to break up antigovernment protests last month 
the effort at dialogue has gone handinhand with the crackdown 
on known dissenters and stiffened penalties on violating public 
order

health experts on thursday urged an estimated 
12 million americans including 3 million young people to take a 
through with chew pledge saturday and abandon their use of snuff 
and chewing tobacco 
the campaign is aimed especially at youngsters mostly boys who 
have turned in increasing numbers to smokeless tobacco products in 
the false belief they represent a safer alternative to cigarettes 
according to organizers 
the through with chew day following seminars on the dangers 
of smokeless tobacco at schools across the nation marks the fifth 
anniversary of the death of sean marsee a star high school athlete 
from ada okla marsee died at age 19 after a tortuous battle 
against mouth neck and brain cancers he had used chewing tobacco 
and snuff since he was 12 
at a press briefing american league president bobby brown 
himself a physician joined marsees mother betty ann and a panel 
of cancer surgeons to announce the new campaign brown noted that an 
estimated 40 to 50 percent of major league ball players use chewing 
tobacco and vowed renewed efforts to discourage though not ban the 
practice 
brown announced the establishment of a group called athletes 
through with chew to be headed by taxas rangers pitcher nolan ryan 
nolan has never used tobacco and that is the kind of role model 
young people should have he said 
brown said he hoped the overall educational campaign sponsored 
by the academy of otolaryngology head and neck surgery would sway 
young people to abandon smokeless tobacco products but im not 
sure we can get a dramatic drop among current users in the major 
leagues he said the addiction is extremely severe i have a 
nephew in his early 20s who has tried repeatedly and cant stop 
byron j bailey president of the academy said many young 
users believe smokeless tobacco is a safe alternative to cigarettes 
but it actually may be more addictive 
the academy represents 8500 physicians specializing in oral 
cancer and other problems found among users of smokeless tobacco 
according to the national cancer institute snuff and chewing 
tobacco have regained popularity since the 1970s as the use of 
smoking products waned particularly disturbing says the institute 
are indications that many boys are using smokeless products as early 
as age 10 and that 16 percent of all males under age 21 use snuff 
or chewing tobacco fewer than 1 percent of women use the products 
the nci said 
the nci and the academy attributed the growing rate among boys 
not only to the notion that smokeless products are safer than 
cigarettes but to 
comparatively lower prices and marketing endorsements by 
macho athletes and other personalities in many schools it is 
a status symbol for a boy to have a worn bleached ring on his back 
jeans pockete where he carries his snuff can the nci noted 
the academy citing nci surveys said an estimated 3 million 
americans under the age of 21 use snuff which is finely ground or 
powdered tobacco or chewing tobacco which is more coarsely ground 
it said the products can cause cancer of the cheeks gums and 
throat dicoloration of the teeth mouth sores bad breath an 
increased heart rate and high blood pressure 
michael j kerrigan president of the smokeless tobacco council 
an industry group disputed charges that the industry had promoted 
use among young people manufacturers have for years stressed that 
smokeless tobacco is an adult product he said 
as for health effects kerrigan said that whether smokeless 
tobacco causes any human disease including oral cancer continues 
to be the subject of scientific dispute

a former imperial army major thinks he saw navy 
pilot george bushs plane shot down more than 44 years ago and he 
said thursday the japanese might have killed the future president if 
they had captured him 
bush parachuted into the ocean and an american submarine picked 
him up 
he must be a man of good fortune to survive that battle said 
yoshitaka horie who described himself as a staff officer in a unit 
defending the chichijima island on sept 2 1944 when us navy 
planes attacked a communications center 
he said japanese soldiers were taught not to surrender and looked 
down on americans who did so or were captured some of more than 
half a dozen american pilots captured on chichijima were ordered by 
the generals to be killed he said 
bush was in japan on friday for the funeral of emperor hirohito 
in whose name all japanese soldiers fought during world war ii bush 
has said he was doing whats right in honoring hirohito because 
japan and the united states now are close allies 
looking forward a bush campaign biography published in 1987 
described the chichijima action and recalled his sorrow at the loss 
of the two other crew members of his grumman avenger bomber 
during his inauguration week in january the president had a 
reunion with comrades from the aircraft carrier san jacinto and the 
submarine uss finback which rescued him 
horie 74 said in a telephone interview he remembered an attack 
in which a plane was shot down and an american flier survived 
he was lucky his parachute landed far off the island and that 
he was picked up by a us submarine before japanese boats 
arrived he said if he had been captured by the japanese he 
might have been killed 
i saw the plane going down and a parachute pop up i ordered 
the navy elements to send their boats and capture the pilot until 
recently of course i wasnt aware that the pilot was mr george 
bush 
chichijima about 600 miles south of tokyo near iwo jima was a 
strategic island and heavily fortified 
bush wrote that he managed to drop four 500pound bombs on the 
target after his plane was hit then headed out to sea before he and 
the others bailed out 
horie a retired university lecturer said chichijima had about 
200 antiaircraft machine guns and 20 antiaircraft artillery guns 
he said he was in charge of transportation for a combined armynavy 
force defending the island 
officials of the defense agency said they had no records on the 
battle 
naotoshi sakonjo a retired viceadmiral said hories story 
seemed generally authentic sakonjo now is with the research 
institute for peace and security a private institute in tokyo 
chichijima covers roughly 10 square miles and is home to 1555 
people most of them involved in fishing agriculture or tourism a 
navy communications unit and a mine sweeper unit are based there

plo chairman yasser arafat packing a pistol 
and dressed in a military uniform jousted and joked thursday with 
about 15 israeli journalists telling them we are not asking for 
the moon 
the unsual encounter arranged by israeli peace campaigner abie 
nathan took place in an egyptian government guest house flying a 
palestinian flag 
it came after a week of intense diplomacy initiated by the soviet 
union and aimed at bringing israel and the palestine liberation 
organization to the negotiating table 
i hope this will help both of us to understand our points of 
view said arafat 
his message was that the plos quest for negotiations was sincere 
and not a tactical maneuver as claimed by israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
but arafat gave no ground on issues of substance such as his 
demand for a palestinian state which israeli leaders oppose and 
the right of exiled palestinians to return to their homeland 
he attacked the israeli government for refusing to deal with the 
plo to be an ostrich will not serve anybody he said 
arafat said he saw progress in what he described as the indirect 
negotiations that took place wednesday when he and israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens met separately with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
there is a little step advanced forward in the israeli 
position arafat said speaking in english he did not elaborate 
waving his arms excitedly arafat also said israels cabinet had 
authorized the mossad intelligence agency to assassinate him he 
said the plan was codenamed best hit 
asked if he was worried about his image in israel arafat said 
i am not worried about my image with the israeli government i am 
worried about the israeli people 
asked about his past references to israels government as a 
military junta arafat said israeli leaders constantly called 
him a terrorist you are always calling me a terrorist terrorist 
terrorist he said 
the guerrilla leader wearing a black checkered kaffieh 
headdress was flanked by mohammed milhelm former mayor of the west 
bank town of halhoul who was deported from israel in 1980 and 
yasser abd rabbo a member of the moscoworiented democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine 
arafat angrily interrupted an israeli journalist who told him 
that it was in your interest to stop antiisraeli violence in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and halt guerrilla 
infiltrations from lebanon the journalist said this would improve 
the plos credibility about its desire for peace 
you have to stop the crimes of the israeli army retorted 
arafat ticking off figures in which he claimed 619 palestinians had 
been killed and 31000 wounded including 3600 palestinian woman 
who miscarried as a result of inhaling army tear gas 
the figures were far higher than official and unofficial israeli 
counts which put the death toll at less than 400 since dec 8 1987 
arafat did say however the plo was considering what he 
described as an israeli request for a cease fire along the border 
with israeli 
there were also light moments in which arafat joked about a 1984 
law that bans contacts with the plo it carries a maximum penalty of 
three years in prison 
at one point nathan who is facing trial for an earlier meeting 
with the plo leader in tunis asked arafat to use his influence in 
accounting for five israeli soldiers who are missing or captured as 
a result of israels involvement in lebanon 
arafat asked nathan to meet him later and then quipped or 
they will punish you if you discuss with me 
arafat also joked with amira hassan a reporter for the israeli 
daily hadashot who insisted on asking a question in arabic instead 
of english this is democracy said arafat 
he is a palestinian with a sense of humor the man is quite 
funny israeli journalist amnon abramovitch said after the meeting 
in an interview broadcast on israel army radio 
representatives from most of israels daily newspapers attended 
the meeting along with a few foreign journalists some israelis were 
exmilitary officers including amos gilboa a former army general 
and senior intelligence official 
nathan who arranged the meeting to encourage other israelis to 
join in the dialogue with the plo said it was unclear whether the 
israeli journalists violated the israel ban he said authorities 
have not prosecuted cases in which israelis attended news 
conferences with foreign journalists 
on thursday israeli authorities banned arafats statements from 
israels staterun television the israel tv crew did not attend 
thursdays session but did shoot an earlier news conference 
uri porath director general of israeli tv said thursday no such 
interviews would be allowed as long as the states official policy 
forbids it and certainly as long as there is a law against it

prompted a reconciliation with the father who walked out on hackman 
his mother and his younger brother

coming to terms with my fathers weakness made me understand 
that being strong means being honest hackman said in the upcoming 
issue of parade magazine 
hackman said that for a long time i did what a lot of 
successful people do which is to take credit for inventing oneself 
as if the past had nothing to do with it 
but then i saw myself becoming a frankenstein monster mouthing 
all the cliches of the socalled selfmade man like i pulled 
myself up by my bootstraps and ive paid my dues he said 
now hackman said i realize that its all part of who i am and 
that only by accepting everything i have experienced can i remain

former assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams says the reagan administration probably should have ousted 
nicaraguas leftist government five years ago through a blockade or 
possibly even an invasion 
abrams said a very good argument could have been made for 
taking either step after the usled invasion of grenada in october 
1983 
abrams who headed the latin american affairs bureau at the state 
department for 3 years outlined his views in an interview with 
policy review a magazine published by the heritage foundation 
abrams joined the conservative think tank after leaving government 
service last month 
after the grenada invasion he said the president should 
simply have said look we have to enforce the monroe doctrine we 
cannot have a communist government in nicaragua and done whatever 
we needed to do to get rid of it including a naval blockade or 
possibly even an invasion 
abrams said the administration made a number of other mistakes in 
pursuing its nicaraguan policy but most of the blame belongs to the 
house democratic leadership which put up a fierce and for the 
moment a winning battle to hand nicaragua over to communism 
although that was not their goal abrams said that was 
certainly the effect of their actions 
abrams was particularly critical of house speaker jim wright 
dtexas who successfully campaigned against an administration 
military aid request last february for the nicaraguan contras 
wright has been one of the leaders of the leftwing caucus of 
the house democrats and has proved to be impossible to work with 
abrams said 
abrams who was interviewed by the magazine last october said 
the new administration should seek military aid for the contras 
if we abandon the contras then yes absolutely bloodshed will 
increase in central america there will be a significant 
increase in violence in el salvador and guatemala the sandinistas 
will increase their support for subversion and for communist 
guerrillas in the region when that happens you can be sure there 
will be a reaction from the military and from the right which will 
produce more bloodshed 
abrams said that latin american democracies declined to support 
us policy in central america out of fear of a hostile political 
reaction internally 
he quoted a south american foreign minister whom he refused to 
name as saying that if his government supported the contras 
cuban president fidel castro would just flip a switch and wed 
have the biggest student and labor demonstrations that you have ever 
seen in my country

salman rushdie has been in hiding for 10 days under 
a death sentence from ayatollah ruhollah khomeini but he has 
fulfilled at least one literary commitment a review of fellow 
novelist philip roths autobiography 
in the review for the weekly observer newspaper rushdie is said 
to hint at a feeling of kinship with the american jewish author 
whose portrayals of his fellow jews got him into trouble 
in the course of reviewing roth who himself had a period when 
he was vilified by the jews he rushdie says he found roth was not 
just speaking to him but for him blake morrison the literary 
editor who commissioned the article told the associated press 
thursday 
roth was attacked in the 1960s for his irreverent painfully 
personal descriptions of jewish life especially in his novel 
portnoys complaint 
rushdie born a moslem in india has been deemed by khomeini to 
be a blasphemer for what he wrote in his novel the satanic 
verses about the prophet mohammed and the koran the moslem holy 
book 
the book rushdie reviewed is the facts an autobiography in 
which roth responds to his jewish critics 
mr rushdie says this has helped him during his own predicament 
when he has been similarly beleaguered morrison said by 
quoting roth he gives some indication of his own feelings 
but where roths fiction stirred debate primarily at the 
intellectual level rushdies work has put his life in danger 
irans spiritual leader issued the death call feb 14 and 
iranian clerics offered a 52 million bounty for the assassin most 
experts on iran have advised him to take the threat seriously and 
rushdie has said he does 
rushdie 4l reacted with shock and apparent bewilderment last 
week when he was telephoned and told of the death sentence he 
dropped out of sight 
four days later he issued a terse statement apologizing for any 
distress caused to moslems by the publication of his book he has 
made no public statements since 
irans president ali khamenei had indicated that an apology 
could alleviate the sentence but rushdies words had no apparent 
effect on wednesday khamenei said the arrow has been launched 
toward its target it is now flying toward its aim 
asked to elaborate a khamenei aide said the arrow was directed 
toward the heart of this blasphemous bastard salman rushdie he 
must be killed 
rushdie and his american wife novelist marianne wiggins are at 
an undisclosed address and both have canceled us promotional 
tours rushdie to publicize the satanic verses and ms wiggins 
to publicize her latest novel the critically acclaimed john 
dollar 
morrison said the review in the observer would appear sunday a 
week later than originally planned 
he said rushdie telephoned him on the day he went into hiding and 
assured him he would write the review he phoned again this week to 
make sure it had arrived in the mail 
morrison said rushdie asked that their conversation about his 
ordeal not be publicized and morrison declined to say anything that 
might hint at the novelists whereabouts 
many moslems say the satanic verses is sacrilegious because 
it casts doubt on central tenets of the islamic faith the book for 
example portrays the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggests he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather than 
receiving it from god 
in other developments thursday 
former pop singer cat stevens who gave up a successful music 
career in 1977 after becoming a moslem endorsed khomeinis order 
stevens who has changed his name to yussuf islam and is a teacher 
in london told moslem students the koran makes it clear if 
someone defames the prophet then he must die 
police in canada said they received a bomb threat against the 
iranian embassy in ottawa 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which holds 
americans alann steen robert polhill and jesse turner in beirut 
released a statement threatening to avenge the action by rushdie 
the book publishers and their supporters the group released a 
photograph of the three but did not make specific threats 
a west german government spokesman dieter vogel said its 
credit talks with iran will not resume until the death threat is 
withdrawn 
in the netherlands dutch police have taken precautions to 
protect veen the publishers of the dutch translation 
publishers wsoy in finland and christian bourgois in france 
announced they had changed their stances and would publish the 
finnish and french translations

children were infected with the deadly aids virus are being pelted 
with stones and asked to move away by fearful neighbors a newspaper 
reported thursday 
writing in the government newspaper izvestia poet david 
kugultinov urged legislation banning discrimination against people 
suffering from the virus 
the mass media has so vividly described the dirt roaches mice 
in our medical institutions the low profession level of doctors 
nurses and sanitarians that unwillingly the impression has been 
created that in all this the aids virus grew all by itself he 
wrote 
in late january the official media reported that 27 babies and 
children had been infected with the virus in elitsa a city near the 
caspian sea by nurses using dirty syringes several mothers of the 
children also were found to have been infected 
now kugultinov said residents of nearby areas have begun 
throwing stones at cars with kalimkii license plates as if the 
cars are spreading aids 
the relationship to students leaving kalimkii to study in 
neighboring republics has sharply changed voices are calling out 
demanding to separate them from the dormitories he said 
the poet said that the soviet union should follow the example of 
the united states in seeking to prohibit discrimination against aids 
victims 
after long denying the existence of the disease in the soviet 
union officials have acknowledged that soviets have been infected 
and started a campaign against it new regulations require 
foreigners who want to stay in the soviet union more than three 
months to prove they are free of aids 
since august 1987 it has been a crime to infect anyone with the 
disease and the official media has reported at least two aids 
deaths 
but the country cannot produce enough hypodermic needles and 
syringes to avoid reusing them 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer

afghan guerrillas ended three weeks of 
fractious debate thursday by splitting the top jobs in an interim 
government between a hardline islamic fundamentalist and a more 
moderate philosophy professor 
sibghatullah mojaddidi considered a moderate among the moslem 
guerrillas was elected president with 174 votes said sources close 
to the assembly mojaddidi is leader of the afghan national 
liberation front guerrilla group 
the 440 delegates chose hardline fundamentalist rasul sayyaf as 
prime minister sayyaf is from the ittehadeislami rebel group he 
received 173 votes 
fundamentalist factions advocate a strict moslem system while 
moderates have pushed for a broadbased government in afghanistan 
embracing islam as its official religion 
under a formula devised by a commission of afghan field 
commanders and scholars the leader with the most votes became 
president and minister of health the secondhighest votegetter 
became prime minister and minister of communication the sources 
said 
feuding between hardliners and moderates and between shiite 
moslems and sunni moslems dominated the islamabad council or 
shura since it convened feb 10 
a spokesman for the national islamic front of afghanistan said 
its moderate leader ahmed gailani abstained from voting and 
exhorted his delegates to the shura to follow their conscience 
the shura held at a religious compound on the outskirts of 
islamabad was closed to journalists except for the final vote 
results released late thursday 
the pakistanbased rebel alliance says the provisional government 
is to oversee the interim administration of afghanistan until the 
guerrillas can form an islamic republic of afghanistan and hold 
formal elections in the country 
guerrillas have predicted afghanistans communist government will 
soon fall now that the soviet soldiers who were helping afghan 
troops fight the guerrillas have left the country 
the interim government lacks representation of afghanistans 
largest minority shiite moslems 
the majority of afghan shiite guerrillas live in iran and they 
boycotted the shura after the pakistanbased rebels the majority of 
whom are sunni moslems refused to give them the representation they 
sought 
the guerrillas have been fighting afghanistans government since 
the communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup soviet forces 
intervened in december 1979 and under a unmediated accord 
withdrew their troops by feb 15 
afghanistans official radio accused pakistan on thursday of 
sending troops to help guerrillas attack the key eastern afghan city 
of jalalabad 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad claimed 1600 armed 
pakistanis went to the border area of afghanistans kunar province 
to help in the assault 
the kabul government summoned the pakistani charge daffaires and 
demanded that he stop hostile actions against the democratic 
government of afghanistan the radio said otherwise the full 
responsibility may rest with the government of pakistan 
afghanistans official communist media repeatedly have claimed 
that pakistani american and other foreign advisers have 
infiltrated their country to help insurgents fight the kabul 
government 
the accused countries deny the charges

the supreme court on thursday agreed to 
hear a petition from a social service group asking union carbide 
corp to pay 600 million as liability for the 1984 bhopal gas 
disaster 
the case will come up for a hearing friday a court official said 
legal experts speaking on condition of anonymity said it was a 
legal duty of the supreme court to agree to hear the petition filed 
by the association for sociolegal literacy 
the court has already given its judgment and both the parties 
the indian government and the union carbide have agreed to abide 
by the order said a supreme court lawyer who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the supreme court on feb 14 ordered the danbury connbased 
union carbide to pay 470 million to settle the bhopal case it was 
not clear if the group wants 600 million to be paid in addition to 
the 470 million or if it wants the 600 million to include the 
earlier judgment 
gas leaked from the indian subsidiary of the company in the 
central indian city of bhopal on dec 3 1984 and killed more than 
3400 people 
the federal minister for industries j vengala rao told 
parliament on thursday the highest figure offered by union carbide 
for the disaster was 300 million 
therefore the settlement of 470 million was much higher and 
it meant immediate availability of finance rao said 
opposition members shouting shame shame walked out of the 
house protesting the government support of the judgment 
rao made no mention of the petition by the social service group 
which was filed wednesday 
the association for sociolegal literacy filed the petition under 
an article of the constitution allowing any individual or group to 
ask the supreme court to seek constitutional remedies to a previous 
judgment 
the petition said the supreme court should not have disposed of 
such an important case by a onepage order without giving 
reasons 
the petition said the people have the right to know as to what 
was the material before the court and what were the circumstances 
and reasons to reach a conclusion that 470 million would absolve 
union carbide of its liabilities and also satisfy the gas victims

saying that the republic is in trouble a 
panel organized by the american association for the advancement of 
science announced plans thursday to work with school districts in 
four states to find new ways to teach science mathematics and 
technology 
f james rutherford chief education officer of the association 
said teachers and principals in the school districts will work with 
universities and industry to develop a blueprint for action for 
a fresh approach to science and math education 
its not a project to patch up the system we have now he 
said but an attempt to create the schools of the future 
participating in the project are the san diego unified school 
district the san francisco unified school district the green 
county and oglethorpe county schools in georgia the mcfarland 
community schools in wisconsin and four districts in san antonio 
texas the san antonio harlandale northside and edgewood 
indpendent school districts 
the program calls for up to 25 teachers from every grade level in 
each district to create and test new approaches to science 
education the project is supported by almost 2 million from the 
national science foundation 700000 from the carnegie corp 11 
million from ibm and 735000 from the particpating states 
part of an association program called project 2061 efforts in 
the school districts are designed to reorganize science education 
around a system that concentrates on training habits of the mind 
instead of memorizing vast amounts of detail 
this is an effort to move schools away from their fixation on 
teaching mountains and mountains of isolated facts about science 
and instead to spend the primary and secondary school years 
teaching students how to think evaluate and react to new 
circumstances throughout life said rutherford 
science education in america is failing he said because it 
concentrates on such things as thousands of words the kids are 
asked to memorize 
you can cut away a large part of that debris and still get down 
to fundamentals he said 
deborah larson coordinator for the program in wisconsin said 
new methods of teaching science and math must be developed if 
american students are to become scientifically literate now she 
said us schools are doing a poor job of teaching technical 
subjects and are graduating students who are not prepared for an age 
of technology 
the republic is in trouble she said illiteracy is rampant 
and if we dont bring it under control it will be the end of life 
in this country as we know it 
rutherford announced the school districts at a news conference 
during which the association released a study on education called 
science for all americans which is the first phase of project 2061 
the report analyzes what experts consider to be minimim amount of 
science and math that americans should know to be able to function 
competitively in the next century rutherford said the study was 
designed to define the fundamentals of scientific literacy 
project 2061 named for the year that haleys comet will return 
to the vicinity of earth is a longterm effort by several hundred 
scientists academics and corporations to develop a plan to overcome 
what is considered to be a serious deficit in science education in 
america the program is directed by the association but supported by 
a combination of federal and private grants 
the study released thursday established broad outlines for the 
redesign of science education 
sweeping changes in the entire educational system from 
kindergarten through 12th grade will have to be made if the united 
states is to become a nation of scientifically literate citizens 
the report said 
science literacy it said is essential if americans are to 
combat global problems tied to the environment and to nature 
without the ability to think critically and independently 
citizens are easy prey to dogmatists flimflam artists and purveyors 
of simple solutions to complex problems the study said 
the report proposes that all high school graduates 
understand how scientific endeavors work and how various fields 
relate to each other 
be able to grasp the fundamentals of nature and the role of 
humans in it 
acquire mental habits preparing them to be inquisitive critical 
participants in the affairs of the world

india has agreed to provide 50 million toward 
the super collider atom smasher making it the first foreign nation 
to commit funds to the 46 billion project a texas congressman 
told his colleagues thursday 
officials of japan taiwan korea and several western european 
nations have held preliminary costsharing discussions with us 
officials rep joe barton told the energy research and development 
subcommittee of the house science space and technology committee 
barton is a republican whose district includes the planned 
collider site 
last year italy signed an agreement to explore collaboration on 
the project india is the first country to make a commitment 
president bush has endorsed the super collider and recommended 
spending 250 million in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 toward 
initial construction 
the energy department has chosen a site around waxahachie texas 
for the 53mile underground tunnel in which beams of protons would 
smash into each other with 20 times the energy of todays most 
powerful atomic accelerators 
faced with heavy demands for funds for science projects congress 
last year agreed only to spend 100 million on the project in the 
current fiscal year and decreed none of the money could be used for 
construction 
robert o hunter jr director of the office of energy research 
at the energy department confirmed bartons disclosure of the 
indian contribution and said several hundred million dollars is 
a minimum estimate for foreign contributions of particlecollision 
detectors to the project but the exact sum wont be known for 
another year or two 
though hunter said foreign contributions could be substantial he 
did not repeat predictions of department officials about a year ago 
that foreign countries could pay up to half the cost of the machine 
such large installations are used by scientists of all nations 
and foreign contributions are usually made to speed a project along 
not in return for specific agreements for research time said 
department spokesman jeff sherwood 
the agreement with india calls for a contribution of 50 million 
in kind that is equipment or services contingent upon a 
us commitment to build the collider hunter said 
the 46 billion cost is the lumpsum equivalent of all future 
federal spending expressed in dollars of 1988 buying power the 
office of management and budget has used a figure of 59 billion in 
inflated dollars of future years of which the energy department 
expects 18 billion to come from nonfederal sources 
at least some of the 1 billion being contributed by the state of 
texas will be counted in that 18 billion said sherwood but it is 
not clear that all of that is for items in the departments collider 
budget 
the project still faces high hurdles in congress which must 
provide substantial funds for construction this year if the collider 
is to operate in 1996 as the department would like

a man who tried to become the first person 
to cross the pacific alone in a balloon said thursday he is 
embarrassed he had to be rescued but is confident hell succeed on 
the next attempt 
when i first recognized the japanese flag on an aircraft flying 
beside my gondola i thought i was safe fumio niwa told a news 
conference after returning home but i became a bit worried when 
no one came to save me for some time after landing 
half an hour or so later i lost consciousness because of 
severe seasickness and do not remember what happened he said of 
his rescue after more than 10 hours bobbing in the pacific in the 
18foot plastic gondola 
uncooperative winds last week forced the 38yearold balloonist 
to abandon his pacific crossing and drop into the sea saturday he 
was less than halfway to his target in southern california 
a coast guard rescue vessel returned him thursday to yokohama 
where he started his flight feb 15 
niwa who quit his job with a computer firm to attempt the 
crossing landed in the water about 1560 miles southwest of tokyo 
he said he regained consciousness when his gondola hit something 
i looked out the window and there were blinding lights outside 
and i realized there was a ship right next to my gondola he said 
he was picked up first by a japanese fishing boat operating 
nearby and transferred the next day to a patrol vessel of the 
maritime safety agency japans coast guard 
niwa said he felt embarrassed by his failure 
his flight encountered trouble from the start as highspeed winds 
that usually blow toward california veered sharply to the north 
forcing him to stay at lower altitudes in slower winds 
on the radio i fought my navigators and sponsors idea to 
quit the flight until the very last minute but i had no choice when 
i was told you know we are not going to make it now so why dont 
we quit bravely before troubling other people any further 
japanese officials said it cost about 560000 to rescue niwa 
asked if he would try the solo crossing again niwa said of 
course i miscalculated and underestimated the winds this time but 
i think i got a taste of it after reviewing the failure this time 
i can confidently say i can make it next time

the house ethics committee met in secret 
thursday to begin reviewing an independent counsels report in the 
investigation of speaker jim wright while the texas democrat warned 
republicans not to try to make political hay out of his problems 
the ethics panel formally known as the committee on standards of 
official conduct met for about an hour to map out its procedures 
for considering a voluminous report by independent counsel richard 
phelan 
the committees proceedings were being conducted under heavy 
secrecy chairman julian dixon dcalif made a terse statement 
saying only that the committee would hold further meetings next 
week the next session was scheduled for monday 
the limited number of copies of phelans report were being kept 
under lock and key in the committees offices in the capitol 
basement and members were allowed to read them only on the premises 
wright said he knew nothing about the status of the case or 
phelans recommendations but repeated his assertions that the 
charges were politically motivated and said the committee had 
wasted their million dollars a reference to the cost of the 
ninemonth investigation 
among formal allegations are that wright improperly lobbied for a 
constituent with whom he had financial dealings that he used 
campaign and taxpayer funds to publish a book on which he received 
55000 in royalties that he improperly lobbied officials of the 
federal home loan bank board and that he accepted use of a fort 
worth texas condominium at a belowmarket price 
wright said continued republican talk about capitalizing on his 
ethics problems in the 1990 elections could put an early end to 
cooperation with the gop administration of president bush on the 
budget and other issues 
you cant have it both ways obviously wright told reporters 
he said comments on wednesday by edward rollins director of the 
republican house campaign committee designating the speaker as his 
no 1 target in 1990 proved that the ethics probe was a 
political reprisal 
it really is a little bit amusing wright said the day 
after bush has democratic leaders down to the white house and talks 
about being friendly and bipartisan on the budget rollins comes out 
and says that 
house democratic whip tony coelho of california amplified on the 
warning later saying you dont politicize the process on day one 
and expect people to work with you on day two and day three 
of rollins coelho said bush should jerk his chain and subdue 
republicans seeking to jump on wrights problems for political gain 
house republicans criticizing the speaker are only making it harder 
for bush to get his programs enacted he said

actor ian mckellen climbed into a large muddy hole 
thursday and cried out to think that the voice of william 
shakespeare echoed from these stones 
around him archaeologists scraped at the foundations of the 
newly discovered rose theater on bankside where the bard made his 
london debut as an actor in 1592 
the puzzles of the centuries are being answered here we are 
finding out what the elizabethan theater really looked like it was 
all guesswork until now because when oliver cromwell closed the 
theaters in 1642 they vanished into the mud mckellen said in an 
interview 
duckboards lead to the site at rose alley which commemorates the 
name of the theater nearly 400 years after it was demolished 
traffic crossing the thames river thunders along southwark bridge 
where passersby idle to stare at the diggers below 
mckellen was joined by 17 other shakespearean actors and 
actresses supporting efforts to preserve the remains of the rose 
summoned by roger rees who had the title role in the london and 
broadway versions of nicholas nickleby 
when i heard about it i couldnt believe that the site of the 
first commercial theater in central london had been found rees 
said 
the troupe saw the chalk foundations six feet below the modern 
surface collapsed walls and the presumed site of the sloping pit 
beyond which may still be the stage buried under tons of soil 
the dig has found thousands of hazelnut shells the 
elizabethans popcorn and clay pipes one with a bowl as small as 
an acorn 
that comes from the 1580 level when tobacco was in its first 
years of import to england and very expensive said archaeologist 
patricia price 
we also found these bits of pottery this wig curler this stem 
of a glass goblet bones of sheep and masses of oyster shells she 
said displaying a box there were no dustbin men garbagemen 
then and all the rubbish was buried 
museum of london experts who located and uncovered the remains 
after an office building was torn down two months ago said thursday 
they had only until the end of next week to dig before quitting the 
site to allow the construction of a new building to go on 
but after meeting with developers imry merchant securities 
harvey sheldon the museums archaeological officer for greater 
london said some time had been gained 
the new building will go ahead but we will have an extension to 
evaluate the site to see what best can be done he said 
perhaps some of the remains can be preserved scholars from 
abroad are coming to london to see how the discovery matches the 
argument that has gone on for generations were the theaters round 
or manysided sheldon said 
the rose was thought to have been octagonal in shape but the dig 
suggests it had 16 or 18 sides or was elliptical a design never 
hinted at in contemporary maps or descriptions 
bankside contains the sites of three other historic theaters of 
the elizabethan and early stuart times the globe the swan and the 
hope all close together near the rose 
the globe is the most famous because shakespeares finest plays 
were first performed there in his lifetime 
his friend actor richard burbage believed to have been the 
first hamlet othello and lear built the theater and shakespeare 
was a partowner entitled to a proportion of the gallery takings 
he describes it in henry v as this wooden o 
american actorproducer sam wanamaker who is reconstructing the 
globe as a shakespeare performance and study center joined the 
preservation campaign 
in a letter from los angeles published thursday in the 
independent newspaper wanamaker urged the whole of bankside be 
protected as a heritage area and not built over 
he called the rose find the 20th centurys most important 
discovery regarding the cradle of the great elizabethan theater 
suzanne bertish who has acted in london and new york with the 
royal shakespeare company said as she surveyed the site i think 
we are in danger of being very negligent about our great artistic 
tradition if this is not preserved

daley immediately accused him of trying to be a spoiler without 
any real expectation of victory the people are smarter than 
that daley said he thinks hes going to fool the people hes 
not going to fool anyone 
vrdolyak denied on thursday that he was entering to spoil daleys 
chances voters would be foolish to think a republican can go in 
and upset a democratic primary where the two candidates have spent 
8 million and in five days upset the campaign he said 
most political observers believe too few white ethnic voters 
daleys core constituency would cross over and vote for vrdolyak 
to hand sawyer an upset victory both vrdolyak and daley are white 
sawyer is black 
the most recent polls published in the chicago suntimes and 
chicago tribune show daley 46 heading into the final weekend 
before the primary with a lead of between eight and 12 percentage 
points over sawyer 
vrdolyak has beaten the political odds in the past 
he survived a series of city council runins early in his 
aldermanic career with daleys father richard j daley and rose to 
the top of the local democratic heap before defecting to the gop 
late in 1987 
but few political observers doubt vrdolyak can muster enough 
votes to overtake the republican partys endorsed candidate 
61yearold urologist dr herbert sohn 
that despite sohns brave prediction that he would end vrdolyaks 
political career and be the one that drives the spike through 
count draculas heart 
eugene kennedy a loyola university professor and author of 
himself a biography of the late mayor richard j daley said 
vrdolyaks impact on the younger daleys candidacy would be limited 
by a number of factors 
most important kennedy said is that sawyer 54 does not 
command the monolithic black support that installed the late harold 
washington as the citys first black mayor in 1983 and reelected 
him four years later 
the number of black voters is down significantly on top of 
that kennedy added a handful of black leaders are working 
against sawyer and for black thirdparty candidate tim evans and 
that doesnt even begin to address how strong daleys own political 
organization is 
vrdolyak however is not without an impressive organization of 
his own 
during a fiveyear stint as city and county democratic party 
chairman and 18 years as alderman vrdolyak delivered votes for 
himself and state and national democrats with a consistency matched 
by few political peers 
even after stepping outside the democratic party to make a 
thirdparty run at washington in the 1987 mayoral election his 
personal popularity was such that vrdolyak still captured 18000 
votes of the 25000 votes in his ward

a shooting attack that killed a 
13yearold girl at her soweto home may be linked to the controversy 
surrounding winnie mandela police said thursday 
the killing wednesday night was the fourth in two months 
involving people connected to mrs mandela and her unofficial 
bodyguards known as the mandela united soccer club 
mrs mandelas husband jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela met for more than four hours thursday with three 
antiapartheid lawyers at a prison farm near cape town one of the 
lawyers dullah omar said no details of the discussions would be 
disclosed 
mrs mandela has denied media speculation that her 30year 
marriage is in jeopardy because of her estrangement from major 
antiapartheid groups 
last week leading antiapartheid activists accused mandela 
united members of conducting a reign of terror in the vast black 
township outside johannesburg and said mrs mandela should be 
ostracized 
police said the soweto girl whose name was withheld was killed 
when gunmen fired on her house with ak47 rifles and set the 
dwelling aflame with a firebomb 
a few hours before the attack a woman living in the house was 
detained in connection with the stabbing death last week of maxwell 
madondo a member of the soccer club plice declined to identify the 
arrested woman 
the possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing 
on the murder of mr madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is 
being investigated police said 
madondos body was found near the house that was firebombed a 
former soccer club member andrew ekaneng has been charged in the 
killing 
two other people with links to mrs mandela and her bodyguards 
have been slain recently in soweto 
stompie seipei a 14yearold activist was allegedly beaten at 
the mandela home by mandela united members his decomposed body was 
found in january two members of the soccer club have been charged 
in the slaying and the abduction and assault of three men 
dr abu baker asvat an activist was killed at his soweto clinic 
last month two men have been charged in the shooting death and 
police have said they believe the motive was robbery however mrs 
mandela has suggested asvat may have been killed because he had 
examined seipei and other youths who she said were sexually molested 
by a methodist minister in soweto 
the rev peter storey the senior methodist official for the 
johannesburgsoweto region on thursday reiterated the churchs 
denial of the sex allegations 
the church particularly resents recent suggestions that it is 
involved in a conspiracy with the police to frame the mandela united 
soccer team he said 
mrs mandela has denied complicity in any wrongdoing has 
suggested that seipei is still alive and has asserted the 
controversy results from a campaign to discredit her 
in another development police banned a rally thursday intended 
to show solidarity with black detainees who have staged hunger 
strikes to protest being held without charge 
more than 300 people mostly students had gathered in an 
auditorium at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been 
banned 
student leaders faculty members and administrators from at least 
five universities have fasted in support of the hunger strikers 
hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several 
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that 
the government free them or charge them

israelibacked militiamen patrolling southern 
lebanon on thursday shot and killed three guerrillas from a radical 
plo faction who were on their way to attack a target in israel an 
army spokesman said 
the marxist guerrilla group the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine said in a statement that the three fighters 
killed three israeli soldiers and two christian militiamen before 
they were gunned down 
the army official said on condition of anonymity that no 
militiamen were hurt in the clash and he made no mention of israeli 
troops being involved 
an israeli foreign ministry official also speaking privately 
said the attempted infiltration was another example of the 
inability of the plo to fulfill its declared statement of stopping 
terror 
in a related development a top aide to labor party leader shimon 
peres urged the israeli government to reverse its stand and open 
talks with the palestine liberation organization if the group 
abandons terror 
yossi beilin deputy finance minister said the plo has not yet 
met the condition but he told israel television if this happens 
we would be ready to talk with them 
in clashes in the occupied west bank and gaza strip six 
palestinians were wounded by army gunfire including a 16yearold 
girl shot in the stomach arab doctors said the army confirmed five 
wounded and said it was checking further 
at least 385 palestinians have died in the 14month uprising 
along with 16 israelis 
in the west bank village of aqaba 19yearold shepherd mohammed 
mahmoud kassem was wounded in the face and hands when an explosive 
device went off as he grazed his sheep said doctors at al ittihad

two palestinians have been killed and a dozen wounded by 
unidentified explosives in recent weeks and the army has launched 
an investigation

israeli border in israels selfdeclared security zone 
a south lebanon army patrol spotted the squad about a mile north 
of the village of al jibbayn and opened fire the army official said

members of naif hawatmehs democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine a radical faction of the plo the officialsaid 
the guerrillas carried three sovietdesigned kalashnikov rifles 
a rocketpropelled grenade launcher large quantities of grenades 
food and wirecutters the army said 
they were on their way to attack a target in israel said the 
official adding that the equipment carried by the guerrillas showed 
they were not picnicking 
plo chief yasser arafat renounced terrorism during the palestine 
national council meeting in november but the plo feels this 
definition does not apply to military confrontations or attacks on 
military targets 
thursdays attempted infiltration was the second by a radical plo 
faction since arafat launched a diplomatic initiative in december 
and the united states renewed talks with the plo 
on feb 5 israeli troops killed five guerrillas on the northern 
border of security zone and the army said the squad was en route to 
attack a target in israel three of the guerrillas belonged to the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine a plo faction

maria olivia berrios crossed three 
countries begged for food and avoided cops and robbers as she and 
her 16yearold nephew facto aristes fled el salvador 
but her thousandmile weeklong trek that ended when she reached 
the texas border tuesday led to an immigrant detention center not 
freedom 
on thursday she was jailed on 4000 bail pending deportation 
under stringent new rules governing political asylum applications 
the immigration and naturalization service refused to give 
further details about her case and the status of her nephews 
application could not immediately be determined thursday by the ins 
after all that weve been through i cant believe well be 
turned back ms berrios 33 had said late wednesday while 
awaiting the decision 
she and with five other salvadorans had talked to a reporter as 
they waited 100 yards from the entrance to the port isabel service 
processing center where ins officials were processing asylum 
applications 
we dont want to return to el salvador where her three 
children remain she said with tears in her eyes there are nights 
we havent been able to sleep because of all the shooting that goes 
on around us 
many people cant even go to work because of all the 
shooting she said biting a sweet roll and periodically setting 
down a small but apparently heavy bag in which she carried her 
belongings 
well either be killed or well die of hunger if we go back 
she said 
only immigrants who can show they are victims of persecution may 
receive asylum those who come to the united states solely to better 
themselves economically are deported 
not one of the 51 applications processed wednesday was accepted 
the ins said only eight applicants were being processed thursday 
morning compared to some 50 wednesday and 233 tuesday the first 
day that the ins implemented new rules that call for jailing of 
those filing claims deemed frivolous 
asylumseekers such as ms berrios whose applications are 
denied may appeal to an ins administrative judge but must remain at 
the federal compound unless they can secure the 4000 bail 
most like 20yearold freddie marquezrodriguez of managua 
nicaragua arrived only with the clothes theyre wearing and cant 
afford the bond 
i came here because i did not want to go into the military in 
nicaragua and now i dont know whats going to happen to my wife and 
children because im not working he said 
marquezrodriguez clad in the bright orange prison uniform and 
wearing a green oakland athletics baseball cap was one of three 
central americans detained at the federal camp who agreed to talk to 
reporters wednesday 
he said he would try to get word to his wife that he was in jail 
and would try to get bond money from a friend in san francisco 
keeping us in this jail is destroying us physically and 
psychologically because we want to work to bring over our families 
or to send them money for food and we cant get out of here said 
marquezrodriguez 
he said he went to the detention center monday seeking asylum 
before the new rules took effect but he said ins officials closed 
early that day 
marquezrodriguez said he knew he was taking a risk when he left 
his wife and two small children to come to the united states 
i had to come out of necessity he said all of us who came 
here are looking for serenity and for the same advantages for our 
children that children here have 
rosendo lopez a rio grande valleyarea missionary for the 
southern baptist convention was among the volunteers who operated a 
soup kitchen just inside the detention center about 50 volunteers 
fed about 1400 people over three days 
we just wanted to help our fellow man they really do want a 
better life and we just wanted to give them some food as they want 
on their way lopez said 
because of the tighter rules and an influx of 500 immigration 
personnel into the area officials believe the many central american 
asylumseekers will try to enter the country elsewhere

gov cecil andrus on thursday partially 
lifted his fourmonthold ban on shipments of nuclear waste bound 
for temporary storage at the idaho national engineering laboratory 
citing national security concerns 
but shipments will be allowed only from the us department of 
energys rocky flats weapons plant in colorado and only for the 
next six months he said 
we have not thrown the borders open and we will not andrus 
said 
the governor said he had agreed to allow the department to 
transfer two railroad boxcars per month from the rocky flats site 
near denver 
an average of four boxcars per month were shipped from the 
colorado plant to the laboratory before andrus closed idahos 
borders to waste shipments oct 19 
lifting the ban on shipments will allow rocky flats to remain 
open and give the energy department time to clear up problems that 
have delayed opening of its waste isolation pilot plant a permanent 
waste storage site near carlsbad nm 
i do not relish the job of once again pulling their chestnuts 
out of the fire andrus said but it is obvious to me that doe 
has no alternative short of closing rocky flats and precipitating a 
national security crisis 
because there already are thousands of boxcar loads of waste at 
the inel andrus said 12 more really wont make that much 
difference to us 
nuclear waste is building up at rocky flats and the plant could 
be weeks away from reaching its limit of 1600 cubic yards of 
material said rich marquez an energy department spokesman in 
albuquerque nm 
colorado gov roy romer had threatened to shut down rocky flats 
if waste storage reached capacity 
sooner or later we were going to bump into the ceiling 
marquez said this gives us some breathing room 
the inel is the only facility in the nation other than rocky 
flats that can accept the waste right now

assistant defense secretary ronald f lehman a 
former us negotiator will be named director of the us arms 
control and disarmament agency and margo carlisle another top 
pentagon official will be his deputy bush administration and 
congressional sources said thursday 
lehman was in charge of strategic weapons reduction talks with 
the soviets in geneva from 1985 to 1988 when he moved to the 
pentagon to take charge of international security policy in the 
closing months of the reagan administration 
ms carlisle who is close to senate conservatives is the 
pentagons chief liaison to congress and like lehman holds the title 
of assistant secretary of defense she is a former aide to sen 
james a mcclure ridaho and was staff director of the senate 
republican conference 
the sources who declined to be identified said the nominations 
would be sent to the senate for approval 
the arms control agency created by congress in 1962 usually 
cooperates closely with the state department where it has most of 
its offices lehman will head a staff of about 250 people and act as 
a principal adviser on arms control issues to president bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
however brent scowcroft the presidents assistant for national 
security affairs is considered likely to play a more prominent role 
in decisions on how to negotiate with the soviet union on reducing 
nuclear conventional and chemical weapns 
lehman 43 has close ties to former sen john g tower whose 
nomination as defense secretary is facing opposition in the senate 
armed services committee lehman worked for tower when he was 
chairman of the committee and later succeeded him as chief 
negotiator with the soviets in geneva on strategic nuclear arms 
he apparently won the endorsement of baker while traveling with 
him last week to the 15 countries that are us allies in the north 
atlantic treaty organization lehman had been making tentative plans 
to return to private life in northern california 
baker in testifying tuesday before the house foreign affairs 
committee said he expected the head of the agency to operate 
primarily as a technical adviser to bush rather than as an 
independent voice in policy disputes 
the agency has been headed since last april by william f burns 
a retired major general

both the value and tonnage of us farm exports 
are recovering at a faster pace than expected three months ago the 
agriculture department said thursday 
increased demand for us grain has boosted the forecast for 
us agricultural exports in fiscal 1989 to 38 billion and 145 
million metric tons the report said 
that would mean an 8 percent in export values from 353 billion 
in the 1988 fiscal year that ended last sept 30 and the most since 
1984 when they totaled 38 billion 
however the actual volume forecast at 145 million tons would 
be down from 1483 million tons last year 
in november usda predicted exports at 365 billion and a 
decline in volume to 136 million tons 
the new figures represent a gain of 15 billion and 9 million 
tons since the november forecast the report said larger 
prospective corn imports by the soviet union account for much of 
the expansion also competitor corn production and exports are 
lower than forecast in november

dr louis sullivan nominated as president 
bushs first black cabinet secretary won overwhelming support 
thursday from a senate finance committee that showed no interest in 
prolonging controversy over his abortion views 
the panel voted 190 to recommend to the full senate sullivans 
confirmation to be secretary of health and human services the vote 
on which sen william l armstrong rcolo had himself recorded as 
present came after a twohour hearing in which both republicans 
and democrats spent much less time on abortion than on sympathy over 
sullivans apparent sacrifice of 300000 to take the government job 
sullivan did address the subject of abortion a main point of 
controversy in recent weeks in his opening testimony reading a 
series of sentences that echoed the position taken by bush he 
apologized to committee member bob packwood rore for having 
misspoken on the subject during a private meeting 
he was not asked about it during subsequent questioning in which 
senators asked him about such major programs as medicare and social 
security that will come under his jurisdiction as head of the 
114000employee department that administers fully a third of all 
federal spending 
indeed the only senator who brought abortion up directly was 
packwood who said the issue had been blown out of proportion and 
the hhs secretary really has little to do with substantive decisions 
on abortion 
i do not understand the disproportionate attention said 
packwood who disagrees with the position sullivan stated in his 
testimony 
my side of this issue has lost on the floor of the 
congress said packwood noting that by congressional direction 
few abortions are financed with federal money 
saying that the hhs chief has no authority over private 
abortions packwood told sullivan the questions that people ask 
of you might appropriately be asked of the department of justice 
where we apparently are going to litigate this matter for a number 
of years 
that was a reference to bushs assertion that he favors reversal 
of the 1973 supreme court decision in a case entitled roe vs wade 
that legalized abortion 
in his opening remarks sullivan had apologized to packwood for 
having misspoken his position on abortion in their meeting 
packwood had indicated after that meeting that sullivan had said he 
did not want roe vs wade overturned a position similar to one 
sullivan had been quoted as taking in an earlier interview with the 
atlanta journal constitution 
he told the committee on thursday 
i am opposed to abortion except when the life of the mother is 
threatened or cases of rape or incest 
i support a human life amendment embracing the exceptions just 
noted 
like president bush i would welcome a supreme court decision 
overturning roe vs wade 
as for armstrong the colorado senator said he might vote for 
sullivan on the floor of the senate but was voting present in 
committee to express his displeasure that sullivan would not state a 
public position on research use of tissue from intentionally aborted 
fetuses 
sullivan said he had not reviewed the recommendations of a 
national institutes of health advisory committee convened to study 
the fetal tissue issue and wanted to do that before deciding 
another controversy that had swirled around sullivans nomination 
concerned an arrangement with morehouse college in atlanta where he 
founded the predominantly black institutions medical school under 
the arrangement he could have received about 300000 in severance 
benefits built up over his 32year association with the school 
sullivan told the committee he decided to forfeit the money 
because as the issue was presented in the press he was 
concerned that it would raise ethical questions that might hamper 
his effectiveness 
i was also concerned about the image of morehouse he said 
i know its a tremendous privilege to work with us but i dont 
think you ought to have go through a toll booth where the charge is 
300000 said sen john h chafee rri 
it is grossly unfair to him and has nothing at all to do with 
ethics said sen john c danforth rmo you have forgone 
benefits you have earned it just doesnt seem right to me 
sen lloyd bentsen the texas democrat who chairs the committee 
said he too was concerned about what appeared to be undue 
sacrifice made by sullivan and he told the nominee just prior to 
the panels vote that he would probe the matter further 
sen bob dole of kansas the senate republican leader was the 
only member to mention sullivans race 
there are a few cynics in this town not all in the media and 
there are some who will say well were greasing it for dr 
sullivan the only black appointed by president and therefore hell 
get through dole said 
he invited sullivan to comment 
i believe and i hope i was asked to serve because of my 
qualifications that i bring both as a physician and because of my 
life experiences said sullivan 
i think the fact that i am black should be incidental but i 
also do represent an important constituency i believe we have a 
government that works best when we have representatives of all 
segments of our society 
i am black and i am proud of that fact but i am equally if not 
more proud of what i have been able to accomplish and what i hope to 
accomplish as secretary of health and human services he said

resumed shipping food and medicine to starving masses in the 
southern sudan after reaching agreements with government and rebel 
forces in the region

elghazal region 625 miles south of khartoum 
the red cross got approval from the government and the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army in december to airlift supplies to 
government and rebelheld areas in the south

civilian and military flights there claiming the army uses relief 
planes to transport supplies

striking nurses and attendants at a state 
hospital returned to work under court order thursday relieving 
national guardsmen who cared for patients during the fourday 
dispute 
its unfortunate that a strike had to take place all parties 
know that a strike by state employees is illegal in this state 
said superior court judge antonio s almeida 
the guard was sent home as nearly all the striking employees 
reported to work thursday the numbers are good this reflects a 
complete turnaround from the past couple of days said hospital 
director james benedict 
union workers walked out sunday night over staffing levels the 
state in an effort to cut overtime has refused in some cases to 
call in additional staff members when workers are sick 
local 1350 of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees represents 650 hospital workers and nearly all 
honored the strike

hospitals 410 chronically ill patients the soldiers spent much of 
their 12hour shifts bathing feeding and dressing patients 
i just want to get back to work back to my regular job as a 
pipe fitter said guard member robert johannes 
im tired said mary eckstein 
patients were relieved to see the employees returning although 
some enjoyed the change 
it was sort of a break from the boredom of hospitals every day 
is the same as the last especially for some of the shutins said 
dan sherman 43 a patient for five months 
gov edward d diprete said wednesday that workers who failed to 
return thursday morning would be fired those claiming to be sick 
must provide a medical excuse officials said 
as of seven oclock this morning the pickets were no longer 
present staffing at the general hospital was within normal levels 
we believe the union is actively encouraging workers to return to 
work state attorney john breguet said at a hearing thursday 
almeida had ordered workers to return on wednesday on thursday 
he said he was annoyed his order had been violated but would not 
impose sanctions 
union workers staged a fourday sickout that ended jan 31 when 
the governor called out the national guard and threatened to fire 
employees who failed to report to work 
thomas romeo director of the state department of mental health 
retardation and hospitals said the state would try to recoup from 
the union the estimated 249000 spent on the guard the strike and

three senators investigating problems on indian 
reservations said thursday there should be a white house staff 
member designated to work primarily on issues affecting native 
americans 
this designation would send a signal throughout the indian 
communities of your dedication to americas first inhabitants 
sens dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and thomas 
daschle dsd said in a letter to president bush 
the senators members of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs have been conducting special investigative hearings on a 
wide range of problems on reservations and within government 
agencies doing business with them 
saying they wanted to meet with whomever bush designates soon 
after the appointment the senators predicted their hearings would 
produce legislative proposals to correct longtime deficiencies in 
government policies toward indians 
in the meantime they said a more formal institutionalized 
process for coordinating indian affairs policies could begin at the 
white house 
there was no immediate response from the white house to the 
letter bush was in japan for the funeral of the late emperor 
hirohito 
the senators said testimony before their committee raises 
significant concerns about whether the united states is adequately 
fulfilling its fiduciary duties to protect the property rights of 
american indians rights to land water forest hunting fishing 
and mineral resources 
as we are sure you will agree legal representation is at the 
very core of the federal governments trust responsibility to 
american indians the inherent conflicts facing the federal trustee 
arise not only in legal matters but also in policy decisions 
they cited as one major shortcoming in us policy president 
reagan never having appointed anyone to work on indian affairs 
despite establishing a policy of dealing with indians on a 
governmenttogovernment basis and promising to fulfill federal 
responsibilities to them

the national guard of the district of columbia 
is planning to help city police in the fight against drugs in the 
nations capital but guardsmen would not be used in street patrols 
guard officials said thursday 
meantime more than 30 ministers from drugplagued city 
neighborhoods urged mayor marion barry jr to put more police on 
patrols and sought a curfew that would prohibit teenagers from 
gathering between midnight and 6 am on streets where drug sales 
are most common 
the feeling is weve had enough said hr crawford a city 
council member who set up the ministers meeting with the mayor 
the talking is over we simply need to see some action too many 
people are dying barry was not immediately available to comment 
on the ministers requests 
city police officials have asked the guard if it could help in 
the battle against the drug trade police blame the trade for 60 
percent of last years record 372 killings in the city so far this 
year 84 people have been slain in the district compared with 52 at 
this time a year ago 
before the guard can begin providing equipment or expertise the 
plan must be approved by the defense and justice departments but 
guard officials said they expect approval and hope to start the 
program in the next 60 days 
maj gen calvin franklin of the dc national guard said the 
pentagon has given preliminary approval to fund a 300000 project 
we have put together a detailed comprehensive drug operation 
and support plan in concert with the district police department that 
will help fight the drug problem franklin said it could 
involve the dc guard using helicopters and nightvision devices to 
assist in monitoring and detection of illegal drugs 
guardsmen would not be involved in street patrols we would be 
concerned about having armed military personnel on the street to get 
involved in arresting people franklin said when you put a 
soldier out there in uniform he would make an ideal target for a 
drug operator wanting to send out a signal hed make a target 
the plan calls for the guard to train city police in the use of 
nightviewing devices sophisticated radar systems and other 
equipment the police do not have

nicaraguan rebel leader adolfo calero testified 
thursday in oliver norths criminal trial that he hadnt expected 
north to make personal use of any of the 90000 calero gave him to 
help free american hostages in lebanon 
i had absolute trust in what colonel north was doing so i was 
not intent in demanding an accounting for the money calero said 
he said that he had an accounting we talked about getting it but 
i guess i never got around to it 
prosecutor john keker asked calero if he expected north who is 
charged with embezzling 4300 of the money to spend any of it on 
himself 
no said calero 
later norths attorney asked whether calero complained to the 
government that north misappropriated any of the travelers checks 
you gave him 
not at all to anyone said calero to this day i believe 
he acted properly 
calero also said he wasnt disturbed that north gave 1000 of 
the travelers checks as a wedding gift to robert w owen a former 
aide to north who served as norths courier in contra dealings owen 
is to be the next witness friday 
in a light moment during a long day of testimony calero said he 
never took notes at his many meetings with north adding that i 
never dreamed i would be here said us district judge gerhard a 
gesell we can all say that 
calero also brought laughter to the courtroom when he said he 
felt so close to the late cia director william casey that he 
referred to him very dearly as uncle bill 
calero one of the top leaders of the nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras testified that he gave north money in travelers checks 
after the white house aide mentioned the need to help rescue 
americans held hostage 
the money came from a miami bank account that had received 32 
million in deposits in eight months after calero gave north the 
account number he testified 
the money began flowing in he said in june 1984 soon after 
official united states financial support for the nicaraguan 
guerrillas was barred by congress 
i informed colonel north of everything i did calero said 
he was the one who listened to all our laments to all our 
problems 
the defense tried to show that norths dealings with calero were 
well known in washington the contra leader said whenever i talk 
to agency cia people if i went beyond what they were permitted to 
hear or talk to me about they would say see ollie about that 
calero spoke highly of north saying at one point for us he 
became sort of a savior at another point he declared they are 
going to erect a monument to him once we free nicaragua 
north lawyer brendan sullivan who has been trying to persuade 
the jury that north was merely following orders from president 
reagan and other top administration officials distributed to jurors 
looseleaf binders of pictures taken of calero and other contra 
leaders with reagan at the white house 
the president of the united states had been very outspoken he 
had clearly stated a number of times that we had the support of the 
country the contra leader said those sentiments he pointed out 
were expressed after official us aid was suspended 
calero who was president of the nicaraguan democratic force 
fdn was the second prosecution witness at norths trial as he 
waited to take the witness stand calero did not look at the 
defendant who was staring at him intently 
the leadoff witness rep lee hamilton dind testified he had 
not known at the time about reagan administration solicitations of 
help for the contras from other countries in return for increased 
us military and economic aid 
hamilton said he didnt know then that secretary of state george 
p shultz asked an asian country to provide communications equipment 
to the contras because the rebels devices were antiquated 
he also said he wasnt told that shultz and thennational 
security adviser john m poindexter knew of a plan by a central 
american nation to provide aircraft to help train contra fighter 
pilots 
and he didnt recall being told that poindexters predecessor as 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane authorized north to 
contact a senior military official of an asian country to 
arrange the sale of missiles to the resistance 
he said too that he was not told that gen john w vessey jr 
then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also met with the asian 
official to arrange the sale 
none of the countries involved was identified 
hamilton answering questions from sullivan said he was not told 
of these and other efforts on behalf of the contras in the 19841986 
period when direct us military assistance was forbidden by law 
the defense is trying to show the reagan administration didnt 
tell lawmakers about its efforts to help the rebels by soliciting 
foreign donations after the ban on aid north who was a marine 
lieutenant colonel attached to the national security council is 
charged with lying to congress about his role 
sometime in 1985 there was a crisis in lebanon where american 
hostages were taken he said colonel north talked about that 
he mentioned the need to help reduce the americans held hostage i 
said i would gladly contribute money i had control of to free those 
hostages i gave him money for that purpose 
calero also testified he bought 11 million worth of weapons from 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord whom he met through 
north between january 1984 and early 1985

part in international search efforts around 6 pm seven hours 
after the crash the wreck of the gulfstream aerocommander ac90 
aircraft was found about 260 feet below surface about half a mile 
from the shore 
waldemar marquart a swiss investigating judge said in an 
interview on austrian tv that the submarine crew made a video film 
of the sunken plane to help salvage teams in their efforts to raise 
the aircraft on friday 
on the basis of the video pictures it is quite clear that 
none of the people on board is still alive marquart said 
ernst sperl a spokesman for the civil aviation authority told 
the associated press earlier no hope of survivors existed 
it was not known why the plane crashed as it was preparing to 
land at altenrhein just over the border in switzerland

peoples army claimed responsibility for the crash in a telephone

william k reilly the new head of the 
environmental protection agency promised thursday vigorous 
enforcement of toxic waste cleanup cases saying a hard line is 
needed to force polluters to clean up sites voluntarily 
reilly said president bush has made clear in both public and 
private comments that he wants strong enforcement of the superfund 
law that provides 85 billion over five years for cleaning up toxic 
waste dumps 
but reilly in an interview with the associated press also said 
the cleanup effort will not succeed without voluntary action by many 
of the polluters 
i worry that we wont come close to making a dent in the 
national priority list of sites in need of cleanup in this century 
if we dont find some more creative ways to get people to settle 
their obligations said reilly 
as of last count the epa has listed 1175 toxic waste dumps as 
deserving priority for being cleaned up 
reilly the former head of the world wildlife fund and the first 
veteran environmentalist ever to head the epa said that while he 
strongly believes many environmental issues can be resolved through 
consensus he does not believe the superfund cleanup effort can 
succeed without government first wielding a big stick 
i think the problem with superfund is you want to create a 
climate of enforcement that is both certain and severe it needs 
an injection of vigorous enforcement to get the attention of people 
who wont come to the table said reilly 
the epas program aimed at cleaning up the nations toxic waste 
dumps has come under repeated criticism from congress and elsewhere 
over use of private consultants its level of compliance with 
timetables and its overall management 
reilly said that he too has concerns about the operation of the 
superfund program in recent years and has directed an internal 
examination of the program including a review of some two dozen 
reports and studies that have been done on the program by 
congressional investigators and others 
on other matters reilly reiterated that he is confident that 
bushs public promises to give environmental matters fresh priority 
are legitimate 
but he said budget constraints facing the federal government in 
general will also have an effect on the epa and the administrations 
ability to deal with environmental problems 
the budget deficit problem is serious that has got a high 
priority and leaves us with making due with less resources than we 
would like and that many programs need he said we need to be 
very creative

premier mieczyslaw rakowski said thursday 
he will ask parliament for the power to fire plant managers who pay 
workers too much 
lech walesa founder of solidarity said he will urge a boycott 
of forthcoming parliamentary elections unless the outlawed 
independent union is returned to legal status by then 
supporters of a freespeech group did a brisk business in 
underground newspapers outside the official pap news agency before 
police arrived and briefly detained three of them 
rakowski told foreign journalists attending a 
governmentsponsored seminar he needs more authority over state 
enterprises to make sure economic reforms proceed and managers do 
not give excessive pay raises 
today for example as prime minister i am unable to fire a 
manager he said i think the chief of a concern has such a 
right and i dont 
he said some members of the opposition are against the government 
having the power to fire a manager who drastically abuses 
principles of the wage and prices policy 
the opposition stated that it was a return to the hard hand and 
even stalinism rakowski said 
soon ill be hearing stalin was my father he declared but 
he said he will seek the power from parliament because i am 
against the weakening of the authorities in poland i 
experienced it a few years ago when our legs were hobbled like a 
horses and then there was a whip trying to hurry us up 
keeping wages from rising faster than prices is one of the 
governments major goals both to fight inflation and to maintain 
adequate supplies 
former premier zbigniew messners government gave in last year to 
pressure for wage increases when inflation reached more than 60 
percent economists blame the raises for a buying sprees that made 
shortages worse 
walesa told a news conference in gdansk where he works as a 
shipyard electrician if elections are held before we become a 
union if there is no decision about the relegalization of 
solidarity everything becomes invalid there will be a boycott and 
lech walesa will not vote 
government spokesman jerzy urban was asked for comment during a 
student rally at gdansk polytechnic and replied all will be 
settled before the elections 
reform of the electoral system is a central topic in talks on 
political and economic reform between authorities and the 
opposition which have entered their third week 
officials say the government wants its opponents to be in 
parliament so they will share responsibility for unpopular decisions 
and so conflicts can be dealt with politically rather than through 
protests or strikes 
solidarity was born in the labor turmoil of 1980 the first free 
union in the soviet bloc then suppressed and outlawed after the 
declaration of martial law in december 1981 since the talks began 
the government has indicated a willingness to make the union legal 
again 
about two dozen people who said they were from the newly formed 
movement for free speech assembled outside the pap offices across 
the street from communist party headquarters and a library featuring 
books and periodicals from communist countries 
they held up banners saying free access to radio and 
television we demand lifting of censorship stop 
repressions against independent publishing houses and we demand 
a change of the press law 
about a dozen sold banned underground weeklies including 
tygodnik mazowsze the solidarity weekly of the warsaw region were 
sold to passersby 
police watched for half an hour then confiscated the banners and 
detained three young men for about 10 minutes

christian militias on thursday abandoned a 
strategically and financially important beirut port they had 
controlled for nearly three years sources said 
weve closed all our financial operations at the port and 
withdrew our fighters the port now is in the hands of the beirut 
port authority said a source at the command of the lebanese 
forces christian militia 
customs officials and other government employees have not been 
reporting to duty at beirut port since the militia took control in 
mid1986 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
christian militia will maintain a symbolic force near the port to 
protect the southern flank of its war council headquarters 
a source at the command of gen michel aoun who heads christian 
units of the lebanese army confirmed that the christian militia has 
closed its illegal clearing and taxation offices at the port 
there was no real handing over of territory they withdrew and 
we later deployed in the port vicinity the source said 
asked whether the army would control activities at the port the 
source said no its a civilian port and not a naval base port 
activities will be carried out by the usual departments in charge of 
them 
aoun who also heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government said the withdrawal of the lebanese forces from the port 
and discontinuing illegal tax collections were conditions for not 
renewing clashes between his forces and the militia 
aouns troops and the lebanese forces fought in east beirut and 
the christian heartland feb 14 with 82 killed 200 wounded and 
millions of dollars in property damage 
in an interview with the daily paper addiyar aoun said the 
lebanese forces have turned themselves into a complete state 
they conclude international agreements and unload hundreds of 
millions worth of weapons at beirut port without the governments 
knowledge aoun said 
aoun told a news conference friday the lebanese forces were 
collecting 400000 daily in illegal taxes 
aouns move against the christian militia drew positive reaction 
from his moslem opponents 
salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads the prosyrian moslem 
cabinet in the dual government described the lebanese forces 
withdrawal from the 5th basin as a positive step 
hoss and aoun have not met since aoun was named to head the 
interim military government by former president amin gemayel minutes 
before his term expired sept 22 
prosyrian moslems rejected aouns appointment which violated 
the traditional distribution of political powers that gave the 
premiership to the sunnis the presidency to the maronites and the 
house speakership to the shiite moslems 
in kuwait meanwhile clerics from lebanons main religious 
communities ended four days of talks with an arab mediation panel 
thursday after agreeing that political reforms are the key to a 
settlement for lebanons civil war 
kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed who heads the panel 
told a news conference that the clerics agreed that a settlement of 
the 14yearold conflict should be based on justice equality 
preserving lebanons arab identity and restoring efficiency to its 
government institutions 
sabah said in the near future the panel will establish 
contacts with all other lebanese sides 
christians have dominated power in lebanon since its independence 
from france in 1943 moslems who make up 55 percent of the 
population of 4 million want reforms that will give them an equal 
share of power

the beginning of the conference would be a starting point for 
resumed relations he said relations were severed after the 1967 
middle east war 
israel opposes a unorganized conference but has said it would 
go to one under the auspices of the united states and the soviet 
union israel however has said it will not talk with the plo 
which it considers a terrorist organization 
under the plan proposed by moscow the soviet union the united 
states and the other three permanent members of the un security 
council would attend such a conference along with israel the plo 
and other regional parties 
israel should not be afraid of the conference shevardnadze 
said our view is that it would indeed give a chance for a 
historic compromise between the arabs and the israelis 
during their meeting arens rejected the idea however he said 
afterward the soviets have a role to play in middle east peacemaking 
even without diplomatic ties with israel 
in jerusalem israels hadashot newspaper said arens and 
shevardnadze agreed to advance ties by making the consular offices 
in each country permanent

although no date or place have been announced 
asked about the results of shevardnadzes meetings the plo 
leader noted 
actually it was indirect negotiations he informed me 
about what was mentioned by the israeli delegation and no doubt he 
will inform the israelis what i have mentioned 
mayor teddy kollek of jerusalem indicated at a news conference 
there on thursday that he would support formation of an independent 
palestinian state in the occupied west bank but would never agree 
to any part of jerusalem serving as its capital as the arabs demand

affairs the israel broadcast authority said in jerusalem on 
thursday

israeli law bars contacts between israeli citizens and terrorist 
organizations 
shevardnadze complained to reporters after the speech about 
president bushs comments relegating the kremlin to a limited 
role in the middle east 
the us president said he was not concerned about the soviet 
ministers tour of the region that is basically quite right 
shevardnadze said 
but in the end he made a qualification that i didnt like he 
said the role of the soviet union should be limited that is very 
sad because it injects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary 
he added with a smile this is my first critical remark about 
the president of the united states

army recruiters last fall failed for the first 
time in eight years to meet their enlistment quotas and the other 
three services are showing similar signs of distress the pentagon 
said thursday 
the defense department in releasing figures for the 
octoberdecember quarter quoted its top manpower official as saying 
the shortfall if it persisted could jeopardize one of the 
pentagons biggest success stories of recent years 
we need to act now to head off future recruiting problems 
said grant s green jr the assistant defense secretary for force 
management and personnel 
the first step is to work with congress on military pay and to 
restore the value of recruiting incentives advertising resources 
and education benefits otherwise we could begin the chain of 
events that led to the serious military manpower problems of the 
last decade 
president reagan proposed and president bush has endorsed a 36 
pay raise for military personnel next year at the same time both 
would cancel a scheduled costofliving raise for military retirees 
congress has not acted on the requests 
last year reagan asked for a 4 percent pay increase for military 
personnel congress approved a 2 percent hike 
the pentagon operating under congressional budget restraints 
expects to spend about 199 million on recruiting this year down 
from 2053 million in fiscal 1988 
rep beverly byron dmd chairman of the house subcommittee on 
military personnel and compensation said the federal deficit has 
sometimes not allowed congress to allocate all it would like 
however she said strides were being made to improve the quality 
of life for soldiers including approval last year of an increased 
housing allowance and money to help military families move their 
possessions when transferred 
the subcommittee planned a hearing on march 1 on the new 
recruitment report she said 
the pentagon report gave this breakdown of recruiting for the 
first quarter of fiscal 1989 
the army fell short of its goal of 24143 by 475 men and women 
its first recruiting shortfall since 1980 
the navy signed up 300 more recruits than its 18900 goal but 
only by calling up early volunteers who had signed up for delayed 
enlistment 
the marine corps mets its objective of 7100 and the air force 
met its goal of 11800 
both the marines and the air force green said reported they had 
met their goals only by working harder 
in all the four services fell 200 recruits short of the combined 
quarterly goal of 61700 
green said officials were more concerned about declines in the 
number of recruits who signed up under the delayed entry program 
which allows them to delay reporting for duty by up to a year 
fortyfive percent of the delayed entry enlistment goal for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 was met in the octoberdecember 
period but that was down from 51 percent in the same quarter in 
each of the two preceding fiscal years 
green also noted that the army and the navy had to take more 
lessqualified recruits 
the army the largest of the services had to accept almost 11 
percent of its recruits from the lowscoring category 4 pool more 
than double the 4 percent level maintained for the last three years 
the navy also reported accepting more category 4 recruits about 
10 percent overall during the period the marine corps and the air 
force were steady at less than 1 percent 
the category 4 classification includes individuals who scored 
from 10 to 30 points on the 100point armed forces qualification 
test by law any individual who scores below 10 cannot be accepted 
into a service 
in terms of overall quality 91 percent of new recruits for the 
first quarter were high school diploma graduates 2 percentage 
points below the same period last year green said 
overall the assistant secretary said the report presented the 
first solid evidence of trends the pentagon has been anticipating 
for more than a year 
unemployment is at a 14year low the youth population will 
continue to decline through fiscal 1996 and budgetary pressures 
remain a concern green said 
the census bureau says the pool of 18yearolds has been 
declining for several years and doesnt expect it to begin rising 
for at least seven years 
green also cited congressional decisions on military pay raises 
and cuts in recruiting budgets he said the army and the navy were 
moving to increase recruiters in the field and to sign up more women 
the united states switched to an allvolunteer military in 1973 
after years of trying to establish the system and attract 
highquality recruits the defense department finally met its annual 
recruiting objectives in fiscal 1980 and had managed to meet or 
exceed the goals ever since 
at the same time it announced the recruiting shortfalls the 
pentagon said its overall activeduty strength rose from december to 
january by 3250 to 2124909 over the last year activeduty 
strength fell 40909 largely because the reagan administration 
decided to reduce its forces and have armaments available sooner 
than would otherwise have been possible

technology to completely clean up the most 
serious radioactive waste problems at the nations weapons plants 
does not yet exist a top official of the department of energy told 
a house subcommittee thursday 
troy wade acting assistant secretary for defense programs said 
the department was working to develop needed technology 
wade specifically said the department is still trying to find a 
way to deal with the aging singleshell underground tanks 
containing highly radioactive sludge at the hanford reservation in 
washington state 
over the past 40 years more than 500000 gallons of highly 
radioactive waste from the tanks have leaked into the soil at the 
reservation 
while the tanks are no longer in active use the department has 
yet to decide whether it will just pump out the remaining sludge and 
stabilize the tanks in place or whether an effort will be made to 
remove the tanks 
wades comments came shortly after the head of the general 
accounting office testified that hanford and other 
defenseproduction sites operated by the department may be 
irreversibly contaminated 
comptroller general charles bowsher who heads the investigative 
arm of congress also said he wasnt convinced that the department 
had the technical expertise to handle such problems 
some sites may be irreversibly contaminated and the department 
of energy may have to place them in longterm institutional care 
bowsher told the house energy and commerce committees 
transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee 
bowsher said that the departments weapons plants make up one 
of the more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the 
world and that to date none of the reports issued by the 
department adequately addresses the cleanup of the facilities 
does plan places modernization on a faster track than 
environmental cleanup and decontamination bowsher said

the government said thursday it will 
not ask indian troops to leave sri lanka until radical violence that 
has killed thousands of people is finally crushed 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said it would be foolish to 
ask indian forces to withdraw before a provincial administration and 
police force were established in the violenceplagued north and east 
we dont want to act foolishly just to satisfy the whims of 
both sinhalese and tamil extremists said wijeratne who also is 
sri lankas deputy defense minister 
when law and order is established the president will ask the 
indian troops to leave wijeratne said 
in july 1987 india and sri lanka signed an agreement aimed at 
ending the tamil insurgency that began in 1983 and has claimed at 
least 8500 lives 
the mostly hindu tamils comprise 18 per cent of the islands 16 
million people they say they are discriminated against by the 
nations predominantly buddhist sinhalese majority who comprise 75 
percent of the population 
militant tamils have waged a guerrilla war for an independent 
nation in the north and east of sri lanka where they are a majority 
india prevailed on militant tamils to accept limited autonomy in 
exchange for giving up the struggle and sent in troops to monitor a 
ceasefire but the most hardline guerrillas rejected the accord 
and began battling the indians 
sinhalese extremists claiming the government had made too many 
concessions to the tamil minority also began demanding the indians 
withdraw and started assassinating sinhalese officials 
neighboring india became involved in the situation because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils 
india says about 40000 of its soldiers are posted in northern 
and eastern sri lanka four battalions of indian soldiers about 
7000 men withdrew from the island soon after ranasinghe premadasa 
in the dec 19 presidential election 
elsewhere in the island police and military officials said at 
least six sinhalese rice paddy farmers were shot and stabbed by 
suspected tamil militants 
at least 10 others were injured in the attack late wednesday in 
the sinhapura village 160 miles northeast of colombo the militants 
attacked the villagers and set six huts on fire officials said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
two indian soldiers were killed wednesday in confrontation with 
tamil militants in northern jaffna town 186 miles north of colombo 
said a spokeswoman for the indian high commission or embassy

the national guard will soon join the war on 
drugs in the nations capital guard officials said thursday while 
mayor marion barry agreed to send additional police officers to city 
neighborhoods where the drug problem is the worst 
district of columbia national guard maj gen calvin franklin 
said the pentagon has given preliminary approval to a 300000 
project that will allow guardsmen to aid city officials in breaking 
up more than 80 openair drug markets that flourish in the district 
we have put together a detailed comprehensive drug operation 
and support plan in concert with the district police department that 
will help fight the drug problem said franklin 
it could involve the guard using helicopters and night vision 
devices to assist in monitoring and detection of illegal drugs 
however no guardsmen will patrol the streets despite the wishes 
of some city council members and community activists to have them do 
so 
we would be concerned about having armed military personnel on 
the street to get involved in arresting people franklin said 
when you put a soldier out there in uniform he would make an 
ideal target for a drug operator wanting to send out a signal 
under the plan the guard will train city police to use infared 
nightviewing equipment sophisticated radar systems and other 
devices the police do not have 
the partnership began in november after city police officials 
asked the guard to help fight the citys growing drug trade police 
say 60 percent of last years record 372 killings were drugrelated 
eightyfour people have been killed in the district so far this 
year compared to 52 at the same time last year 
the plan must be approved by the departments of defense and 
justice before the guard can start providing equipment or expertise 
but guard officials say they expect approval and hope to start the 
program in the next 60 days 
meanwhile barry agreed to demands from a group of ministers that 
he assign 50 extra police officers to neighborhoods where the drug 
problem is worst 
ive been delighted that these ministers came here in 
partnership with some real concerns barry said we want these 
killings these shootings stopped 
the ministers also gained a commitment from the city council that 
it would draft a bill giving the mayor authority to declare a curfew 
in specific areas to prevent teenage drug dealers from plying their 
trade on neighborhood street corners such legislation would allow 
barry to flood the areas with police officers 
but the ministers did not receive a pledge from barry to declare 
a state of emergency in any of the citys neighborhoods 
im perfectly willing to take a waitandsee attitude said 
councilmember hr crawford who helped organize the meeting 
crawford said he was satisfied with todays actions 
i consider this real action a real step forward crawford 
said 
the city is also proceeding with plans to hire an additional 150 
officers police sources confirmed however police union officials 
cautioned that these officers will only replace others who are 
retiring and will not increase the number of police officers on the 
streets

a judge declared a mistrial in a drug trial 
when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime 
scene to see how long it took a toilet to flush 
this particular privy was supposed to be private 
im hard pressed not to use the analogy flushed down the 
toilet superior judge robert bradley said in declaring the 
mistrial tuesday in the case against nelson cortez of oxnard 
the jury foreman told the judge the panelists visited an 
apartment rented by codefendant joel ruvalcaba to test the truth of 
cortez testimony 
cortez had testified he was awakened by the sound of a toilet 
flushing on jan 14 1988 went into the bathroom and was 
immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of 
cocaine in the bowl 
cortez claimed he didnt know how the drug got in the toilet 
ruvalcaba meanwhile was arrested in the living room 
two jurors tried flushing their own toilets at home to see if 
cortez would have had enough time to get up go to the bathroom and 
get arrested all in the flush of a toilet 
not satisfied with the home experiments three jurors went to the

evangelist jimmy swaggart says his 
scandalrocked ministry has been saved by supporters who answered 
his plea for donations to keep his television programs on the air 
on feb 12 swaggart said that his daily and weekly tv shows 
would go off the air on feb 26 unless he received hefty donations 
during his program last sunday swaggart said the ministry had lost 
15 million in january 
during wednesday night services at his baton rouge church 
swaggart said a telethon to raise funds had been successful 
if there are any newsmen out there and i know that there are 
i want to announce that the telecast will go on the air sunday 
continuing to tell the world that jesus christ is coming he said 
swaggart confessed to an unspecified sin before his congregation 
last year and that was followed by a new orleans prostitutes claim 
that she had sexual affairs with the evangelist he was later 
defrocked by the assemblies of god denomination 
swaggart also commented wednesday on a fullpage advertisement in 
the feb 20 issue of time magazine purchased by planned parenthood 
half of the page is covered by a photograph of swaggart when he 
confessed before his congregation 
the ad asks readers to join planned parenthoods campaign to keep 
abortion safe and legal 
america has always been blessed with characters who claim to 
have all the answers the ad says the problem is they dont 
always practice what they preach and hypocrisy can be extremely 
harmful 
swaggart said his son donnie told him the organization had 
directed a 2 million campaign against us he said the 
advertisement cost 250000 
theyve got 1750000 left and im going to get that 
swaggart said 
william treeby an attorney for swaggart said the remark was 
made in jest and swaggart had no intention of filing suit over the 
ad 
in january penthouse magazine published a story that quoted new 
orleans stripper catherine mary kampen as saying she had an affair 
with swaggart swaggart has threatened to sue the magazine 
kampen has been arrested in new orleans on allegations of 
shoplifting a 40 dress from a department store nearly a year ago 
detectives said wednesday that kampen 38 was booked with theft 
when she surrendered tuesday and later was released on bond police 
said a guard saw her photo in a newspaper jan 31 and recognized her

president mikhail s gorbachev made his first visit 
to the chernobyl nuclear power plant thursday and indicated to a 
worried soviet public that he will take a cautious approach to 
nuclear power 
official soviet television showed gorbachev dressed in a white 
robe and hat touring the site in the ukraine of the worlds worst 
nuclear power accident 
he quizzed workers and officials about its safety and both the 
soviet president and workers made reference to a previously 
unreported incident in which safety equipment automatically shut 
down one of the three reactors that still are operated at the plant 
no details were provided but technicians said the shutdown 
reactor was undergoing repair while gorbachev was there the plant 
director mikhail umanets said it would be restarted friday morning 
earlier plant spokesman yuri risovany said in a telephone 
interview that three reactors were running during gorbachevs visit 
the damaged no 4 reactor encased in a steelandconcrete shell 
does not operate 
later at a meeting with nuclear power officials gorbachev said 
that in making decisions about present and future atomic power 
stations the soviet union would be strictly guided by scientific 
data which should contain the replies to all questions technical 
security ecology social and so on 
on monday the first day of his visit to the ukraine gorbachev 
told an elderly woman that officials will consider earthquake safety 
before deciding whether to finish a nuclear power plant in crimea a 
popular vacation area on the black sea 
one shouldnt play around in these matters gorbachev said 
monday its serious dont think we want to trick anyone we 
would only back ourselves into a corner 
officials already have said they will shut down a nuclear plant 
in armenia where an earthquake killed 25000 people in december 
gorbachevs visit to chernobyl was symbolic because after the 
accident in april 1986 the soviet public became much more critical 
of nuclear power the chernobyl accident killed at least 31 people 
and released a radioactive cloud that eventually circled the globe 
nuclear power officials and plant workers who met with gorbachev 
before the tv cameras told him that the chernobyl plant is now safe 
that nuclear power is the most reliable form of electricity and 
that the soviet economy needs it 
gorbachev listened soberly asking detailed questions about 
safety procedures and equipment at the chernobyl plant which is 80 
miles north of the ukrainian capital kiev 
in december nuclear power minister nikolai lukonin said six 
plants or planned additions to existing stations were scrapped 
because of fears of earthquake damage or tougher construction 
standards imposed after chernobyl 
at the same time reports have increased about health problems 
associated with the chernobyl accident the weekly moscow news 
reported last week that cancer cases have doubled and that calves 
often are born without heads and limbs in a region of the ukraine 
within 30 miles of the plant

the number of central americans seeking 
political asylum declined again thursday under tough new immigration 
rules that place most of them in jail 
critics of the immigration and naturalization services rio 
grande policy said refugees would just be driven to other border 
crossing points or go underground 
only 10 applicants were processed thursday compared to some 50 
wednesday and 233 tuesday the day the tougher rules went into 
effect 
of all those applicants only two had been granted asylum by 
thursday and the rest were put in barracks at the ins port isabel 
service processing center here 15 miles from brownsville or in a 
red cross shelter in brownsville 
they were held on bail 1000 to 4000 while they await hearings 
before an ins administrative judge 
the government announced thursday it is giving 3 million to the 
red cross to operate the brownsville shelter 
hundreds of ins officials have been sent to the rio grande valley 
to process cases the day they are submitted and weed out 
applications the agency says are made by central americans coming to 
the united states for economic not political reasons 
under ins policy that took effect tuesday immigrants applying 
for asylum in south texas must remain in the area until their cases 
are processed and those found to have submitted false or frivolous 
claims are jailed 
previously most immigrants remained free while they awaited 
processing appeals or deportation 
among the 625 immigrants held at bayview was juan bautista 
sanchezsanchez 28 who said he fled nicaragua after he was 
arrested and beaten because of his participation in marches against 
the leftist sandinista government 
sanchezsanchez said his application was denied because ins 
adjudicators did not believe his claims that the government of 
president daniel ortega would jail him or kill him if he returned 
they want us to get papers signed by daniel that they beat us 
up sanchezsanchez said if they send me back to nicaragua 
theyll probably put me in jail for 30 years on treason charges 
the two granted asylum the first day were a 32yearold former 
construction worker from managua who plans to settle in miami and 
a 65yearold nicaraguan businessman and accountant living in 
brownsville according to the ins 
it was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria 
and if they were forced to return to their country they faced a 
wellfounded fear of persecution ins spokesman virginia kice said 
ins officials and attorneys representing central americans 
seeking asylum said the dwindling number of applicants may mean that 
they are going underground and taking their chances getting to their 
destination in the united states 
nobody is coming to apply for asylum and thats sort of 
predictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jail 
here so obviously people are going underground and they are not 
going to be going through the system anymore which is a tragedy 
said mark schneider an attorney with the harlingenbased proyecto 
libertad which represents central americans 
we really dont believe this repressive policy here in the rio 
grande valley is going to do anything to stop refugees from coming 
to the united states 
ins officials hope that the word will spread to central america 
that refugees will face a tougher battle getting into the united 
states 
ms kice said the number of central americans entering the united 
states through brownsville would decrease or shift to another area 
since last spring more than 100000 central americans have used 
the rio grande valley as their gateway to the united states 
sanchezsanchez said more central americans would continue to 
travel to the united states even if it meant they would be jailed 
they will be coming not only for economic reasons but for 
political reasons and i think they will come if i tell them that 
even if they get put in jail here they will not get beaten up he 
said

proiranian kidnappers of three americans 
issued a statement thursday vowing revenge on author salman rushdie 
and his publishers for insulting islam but did not threaten harm to 
the captives 
the kidnappers who call themselves islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine made the threat in an arabiclanguage 
statement delivered to a western news agency with a photograph of 
hostages alann steen robert polhill and jesse turner 
they pledged revenge on all those who took part in strong and 
ferocious campaigns against islam all institutions and 
organizations that insulted in one way or another the prophet 
mohammed and his family through rushdies novel the satanic 
verses 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 88yearold shiite moslem 
patriarch has ordered his followers to kill rushdie 
steen polhill and turner kidnapped jan 24 1987 from the 
campus of beirut university college were shown from the knees up 
seated on what appeared to be a bed looking directly into the 
camera 
polhills left arm and hand were thinner than in a picture 
released 14 months ago and his left sleeve was pulled up to the 
elbow showing what might be a deformity but he was smiling 
turner 42 sat on polhills left clad in a striped sweater and 
dark trousers steen 49 was on turners left in a dark track suit 
steen who is from boston taught journalism at the college 
polhill 54 of new york was assistant professor of business and 
turner of boise idaho taught mathematics and computer science 
they and six other americans are among the 15 western hostages in 
lebanon held longest is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
turners wife badr who knows all three men said of polhills 
arm maybe its a shadow in the picture im not aware that he had 
a deformity in his left arm and hand 
she said the three captives have nothing to do with what the 
captors are saying 
my husband looked fine but im worried about their 
psychological wellbeing mrs turner who is lebanese said in a 
telephone interview were suffering without them 
neither polhills wife ferial nor steens wife virginia rose 
could be reached for comment 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
we hold the kidnappers fully responsible for the safety and 
welfare of all the hostages the hostages are innocent victims they 
should be freed immediately and unconditionally 
in their statement the abductors said their group had 
persistently sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages 
issue in accordance with its principles and to show its good 
intentioins in light of international detente 
but it seems that imperialism and zionism consider that moslems 
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the 
price of living in the shadow of international detente the 
statement said we are going to shatter their dreams and foil 
their schemes 
american imperialism and international zionism should realize 
that by supporting the ugly contents of the satanic verses they have 
linked the destiny of their interests with the fate that awaits the 
socalled indian author of the book as well as promoters of the 
antiislam campaign 
the captors urged moslems all over the world to stand against 
the laws of the jungle so that advocates of these laws would realize 
that real human values lie in spiritual religions and not in the 
jungles system 
rushdies book is the worst type of insult to islams 
sacredness in general and the sacredness of islams prophet in 
particular part of a serious and wideranging programs under 
way to strike against islam because it is the force that fights 
moral and humanitarian degeneration the kidnappers said 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by portraying 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the koran 
the holy book of islam rather than receiving it from god 
annahar an independent beirut newspaper said efforts to free 
the 15 hostages were undermined by the strain in irans relations 
with the 12nation european economic community caused by khomeinis 
execution order it did not attribute the report 
reaction to khomeinis death sentence has been mixed among 
moslems in lebanon 
hezbollah the proiranian group believed to be the umbrella for 
shiite extremists who hold most or all of the hostages said a 
statement khomeinis decree was just and added 
the publication of this book comes against a zionist background 
that manifests malicious intentions scheming to defame islam this 
is also the purpose of the current campaign in the west 
particularly in the united states and britain 
hasan saab adviser to sunni moslem grand mufti sheik hassan 
khaled declared islam does not allow the killing of man without 
a trial the koran teaches us that the unjustified taking of one 
life is tantamount to killing the whole world

attorney general dick thornburgh stepped 
thursday into the controversy over whether political asylum should 
be granted to irish republican army member convicted in britain of 
killing a british soldier 
thornburgh got involved in the case of joe doherty who has been 
in federal prison in manhattan since fbi agents arrested him june 
28 1983 at the request of the immigration and naturalization 
service which wants him deported said dave runkel a spokesman for 
the attorney general 
he was asked to by the ins and he decided to take a look at 
it runkel said 
at issue is a board of immigration appeals decision last nov 14 
that doherty could reopen his request for asylum in the united 
states and remanding that request to an ins judge 
had thornburgh stayed out of it doherty could have pursued his 
search for asylum with the judge justice department spokesman loye 
miller said 
doherty who was convicted with three others of the killing that 
occurred during a gunfight between british soldiers and ira members 
who had planned to ambush a british army patrol in 1980 broke out 
of a maximum security prison in northern ireland more than six years 
ago 
he contends he is not a terrorist or a murderer but a soldier 
engaged in war and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that he 
would be subject to persecution if he were sent to britain 
stephen a somerstein one of dohertys new yorkbased attorneys 
criticized thornburghs involvement 
we had requested that the attorney general not review it the 
board of immigration appeals decision and just allow us our day in 
court to press our political asylum claim that the board said we 
should have somerstein said in a telephone interview 
weve felt all along that it was improper for the attorney 
general to be reviewing decisions of his own board of immigration 
appeals he said its tantamount to his being a judge in his 
own case 
thornburghs decision means just more delay he said the 
delay already has been interminable and hes been incarcerated all 
through this the length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of 
fairness of reasonableness 
dohertys case has involved the attentions of the white house 
the justice department civil rights activities and the leaders of 
great britain and ireland 
british prime minister margaret thatcher raised the case in talks 
with president reagan during a 1986 visit to washington 
dohertys supporters include new yorks roman catholic archbishop 
cardinal john oconnor amnesty international the american civil 
liberties union and jesse jackson who visited doherty last july 
in the latest twist in the case which has wended its way through 
federal courts and immigration hearings over the past five years 
thornburgh ordered that the ins submit by march 27 a brief in 
support of its position 
after that doherty will have 30 days to submit a brief arguing 
his case and then the ins will have 14 days to file a reply 
in 1983 the british government filed a formal request for 
dohertys extradition it was denied in december 1984 by us 
district judge john e sprizzo in brooklyn who ruled that dohertys 
crime was a political act and qualified the defendant for political 
asylum 
the government appealed and us district judge charles s haight 
decided in dohertys favor a government appeal to the us court of 
appeals in new york upheld dohertys previous victories 
then the justice department began deportation proceedings 
since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent 
doherty chose the independent republic of ireland and his decision 
was upheld in 1986 by immigration judge howard i cohen in 1986 
then the ins appealed cohens order and lost again the 
government appealed twice more and lost twice again the most 
recent loss coming last nov 14 
former attorney general edwin meese iii meanwhile issued an 
opinion that it was not in the interest of the united states 
foreign policy that he be allowed to go to ireland that he should 
be deported to britain miller said 
the option of being deported to ireland was eliminated for good 
when ireland under pressure from london and washington in december 
1987 ratified the european convention on terrorism which calls for 
mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists 
doherty at that point asked the board of immigration appeals to 
revoke his concession that he was deportable claiming grounds of 
changed circumstances and the likelihood he would be subject to 
persecution miller said thats gounds for asking for asylum 
when the bia ruled 32 last november the three said that they 
thought there was a wellfounded possibility that his fear of 
persecution was valid and should be considered again miller said

troops of an elite army 
battalion attacked a rebel field hospital killing 10 wounded 
guerrillas and medical workers the roman catholic churchs legal 
aid office said thursday 
it said two of the female victims a mexican doctor and a 
14yearold nurse were raped or molested before being killed in 
the feb 13 attack 
the office a highly respected human rights organization in el 
salvador sent church representatives and forensic specialists to 
exhume the bodies of the two women 
the doctors body bore 10 bullet wounds and the nurses body six 
and both bodies were severely bruised on the inner thighs and 
breasts according to the legal aid office report 
radio vencermos the guerrillas clandestine station reported on 
feb 15 that troops of the atlacatl battalion attacked and destroyed 
the field hospital two days earlier it said six people three 
medical workers and three wounded guerrillas were killed 
the army denied the guerrilla radio charge when it was contacted 
last week by the associated press 
both the legal aid office and the rebel radio said that among the 
victims were alejandra bravo betancourt a 35yearold mexican 
physician and rosibel dubon a 14yearold paramedical worker 
their bodies were exhumed and examined last friday by the legal aid 
office 
the alleged massacre took place outside the village of los 
encuentros near the sumpul river that forms el salvadors northern 
border with honduras the northern province of chalatenango where 
los encuentros is located is a stronghold of leftist rebels waging 
a 9yearold civil war against the usbacked government 
col ciro lopez roque military commander of chalatenango told 
journalists thursday there was no field hospital near los 
encuentros but he said atlacatl troopers killed several guerrillas 
including the mexican doctor in combat feb 13 
they were treating one wounded subversive said lopez roque 
but it was not a field hospital there wasnt even a hut there 
legal aid said extensive interviews with residents of the area 
indicated that in addition to the doctor and nurse five wounded 
guerrillas and three paramedics were killed in the atlacatl attack 
those bodies were buried in various remote spots in the rugged 
mountainous terrain and were not exhumed said the report 
the church office concluded that a field hospital was in fact 
installed near los encuentros it said atlacatl troops attacked 
and destroyed the field hospital and killed war wounded and the 
medical personnel present 
because the bodies of the two exhumed women were completely 
nude and both were bruised around the breasts and on the inside of 
the thighs rape or attempted rape is presumed the report said 
the church office called the attack a flagrant violation of 
the salvadoran constitution and of the 1949 geneva conventions to 
which el salvador is a signatory 
the alleged massacre took place 10 days after a visit to el 
salvador by vicepresident dan quayle quayle delivered what he 
called a very emphatic message to the effect that washington 
expected the salvadoran armed forces to improve their record on 
respect for human rights

national institutes of health workers who are 
accidently exposed to the aids virus will immediately be started on 
doses of zidovudine the only drug now approved for treatment of the 
viral disease 
in a notice posted late thursday to nih employees an aids 
advisory group announced that nih director james b wyngaarden had 
approved the emergency use of zidovudine also known as azt for 
research and clinical workers exposed to the aids virus in 
laboratory or hospital settings 
the aids virus known as human immunodeficiency virus or hiv is 
being studied at a number of laboratories at the nih and there also 
are patients treated at the nih clinics elaborate laboratory 
procedures are in effect to contain and control the virus but there 
have been a number of health care workers exposed through needle 
sticks or other accidents at least one medical worker in the us 
has developed aids after such an accident 
although definitive evidence for the efficacy of azt 
prophylaxis preventative in hiv exposures has yet to be 
established the advisory group concluded that the available data 
suggest possible value in this setting the announcement said 
azt the announcement said will be provided where it is judged 
that the individual may have sustained a significant exposure 
hiv can be transmitted through an exchange of body fluids the 
disease usually is spread through sexual contact the sharing of 
needles among drug addicts from birthing mother to child or from 
the medical transfusion of blood or blood products 
but experts say that health care workers can also be at risk if 
spilled blood body fluids or laboratory specimens are absorbed 
through small cuts or abrasions or from the accidental stick of a 
syringe needle a fairly common accident in hospitals 
the announcement said that the nih advisory group on aids 
recommended that medical workers experiencing an exposure accident 
should start azt medication as soon as possible preferably within 
hours following the exposure 
azt once called azidothymidine is marketed by the burroughs 
wellcome co under the brand name retrovir it was approved for the 
treatement of aids in 1987 after studies showed that the drug could 
suppress the hiv infection in many patients though the drug can 
control progress of aids in many cases it is not considered a cure 
for the disease 
recent studies have also suggested that the drug is able to 
prevent persons exposed to the hiv virus becoming infected if the

president raif dizdarevic 
arrived thursday in troubled kosovo province where thousands of 
ethnic albanian workers struck for the fourth straight day despite 
government warnings 
the official tanjug news agency said dizdarevic was accompanied 
by petar gracanin president of the yugoslavias serbian republic 
which administers the province it was an apparent attempt to head 
off possible clashes between the albanian majority and the serbian 
minority 
tanjug said hostile pamphlets written by albanian nationalists 
and separatists calling for an uprising and bloodshed by ethnic 
albanians have appeared in the provincial capital of pristina and 
other kosovo towns 
the pamphlets allegedly denounced the provincial and national 
communist leadership 
about 1200 workers at the trepca lead and zinc mines continued 
occupying their pits and protesting alleged discrimination by 
authorities in serbia 
about 2000 ethnic albanian students from the provinces capital 
pristina protested through the night in a sports hall to show 
solidarity with the miners about 10000 other people were involved 
in protest strikes throughout the economically depressed province 
we are determined to stay in the pits until we die if our 
demands are not met azim suljemani a digger told the associated 
press in an interview conducted about a half mile underground 
the miners are on all 12 levels of the mine which was founded in 
1925 by a british company they were sitting on wooden crates in 
ankledeep mud 
they read reporters a written statement addressed to the united 
nations committee for human rights denouncing discrimination of 
ethnic albanians by the serbian government 
serbian leaders say the republic should have more judicial and 
police control in kosovo to protect the serbian minority serbs say 
they are persecuted by the ethnic albanians who make up about 85 
percent of the provinces 2 million population 
the nineman national presidency meeting in an emergency session 
urged the workers to immediately end their strikes and said it would 
take all constitutional and legal measures to prevent the crisis 
from growing 
among other demands the strikers were calling for the 
resignation of the provinces communist party chief rahman morina 
at least 17 trepca miners were hospitalized for exhaustion after 
spending three days in the pits kosovos information bureau said 
eleven ethnic albanians were sentenced in pristina on thursday to 
jail terms of between four months and eight years tanjug said 
the were sentenced for illegal hostile activities allegedly 
carried out as members of a group which calls itself the 
marxistsleninists of kosovo tanjug said

president bush will stick with embattled defense 
secretarydesignate john tower even though a senate committee voted 
to reject his nomination a white house spokesman said friday 
in advance of the senate armed services committees 11 to 9 vote 
against favorably recommending towers nomination to the full 
senate press secretary marlin fitzwater also told reporters that 
bush has not had any discussions of dropping tower and finding 
another candidate for the pentagon job 
fitzwater said that bush had a telephone conversation friday 
morning with senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and that 
white house chief of staff john sununu had made calls to the hill 
during the night tokyo is 14 hours ahead of washington time 
we have not heard anyone say he would not make a good secretary 
of defense fitzwater said we have not heard anyone say he is 
not qualified for the job we hear vague talk about concern about 
his personal habits and we think this debate ought to be on a 
slightly higher level than that 
fitzwater briefed reporters just after bushs motorcade left for 
the funeral of emperor hirohito at shinjuku park just a short ride 
from the hotel 
the press secretary reiterated the white house view that the 
muchawaited fbi report which was submitted last monday 
refutes allegations of excessive drinking by tower 
asked pointblank whether bush and sununu had discussed finding 
another candidate for the top pentagon job fitzwater said there had 
been no such talk whatsover 
i can flatly say that i do flatly say that he said ive 
talked to the president about that several times including just 10 
minutes ago theres no consideration of alternative candidates 
theres no alternate list bar none 
fitzwater however said there had been no discussions with sen 
sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
we think hes been fair the spokesman said hes tried to 
have open consideration here hes been critical but the committee 
has every right to look into these matters 
and we simply say that if the committee vote is not as 
positive as we would like the next step is to consider it on 
the floor and thats what we will do the press secretary said 
asked whether tower should offer to withdraw his name from 
further consideration he said that was not an option because we 
think hes a good candidate and we presume the secretary wants the 
best secretary of defense they can get 
we now go to the senate floor fitzwater said theres a 
lot of time left in this process the fbi report we feel deals 
in great detail with the drinking problem and should put the matter 
to rest 
fitzwater said that you may be assured that the president 
has been kept abreast of this of this all the way 
in the ensuing days the spokesman said bush will be making 
any number of contacts on the tower matter but said we dont 
have a specific schedule of meetings or anything like that 
asked if tower had been too damaged by the confirmation process 
to succeed in the cabinet the spokesman said no we dont 
believe so believe he will come out of this a strengthened 
secretary of defense 
fitzwater also said that bush does not see the tower confirmation 
battle as a sign of any refusal by congressional democrats to seek 
bipartisanship consensus on the various issues 
the president believes the candidate deserves to have a 
hearing before the full senate he said lets hear what it is 
that theyre basing their judgment on 
weve been lobbying through the day the nomination went up we 
believe he will be confirmed and we will certainly work toward that 
end fitzwater said 
we dont believe this speaks to any larger question of 
bipartisanship he added saying that i would think the members 
of the senate and house would tell you the same thing this is 
quite a separate matter that has to be considered in that context 
fitzwater said the white house had been in the game since the 
day the nomination went up and said administration officials see 
the tower situation as an important nomination that we will 
pursue

it has been 30 years since the senate rejected 
a presidents choice for his cabinet and 44 years since such action 
was taken by a senate committee 
all in all eight cabinet nominations have been turned down by 
the full senate according to the senate library 
the most recent was president eisenhowers nomination of lewis b 
strauss to be secretary of commerce which was rejected by a 4946 
vote on jan 19 1959 strauss had been serving in the post by an 
interim appointment since the previous november 
the senate commerce committee controlled by democrats had 
recommended strauss confirmation by a vote of 98 with three 
democrats joining six republicans in support of him 
strauss had previously been chairman of the atomic energy 
commission opponents said that in that position he withheld 
information from congress or gave misleading information 
before the senate armed services committee voted thursday to 
reject the nominiation of john tower as secretary of defense the 
last time a senate committee rejected a cabinet nominee was on jan 
26 1945 
the commerce committee then turned down president roosevelts 
nomination of henry a wallace to be secretary of commerce by a vote 
of 145 wallace who had been secretary of agriculture and then 
vice president was nevertheless confirmed by the full senate by a 
vote of 5632 on march 1 
the first president to have a cabinet choice rejected by the 
senate was andrew jackson whose nomination of roger b taney to be 
secretary of the treasury was turned down on june 23 1834 taney 
who was already serving in the post by a recess appointment was 
later named chief justice by jackson and confirmed for that post by 
the senate 
president john tyler had the worst luck of any president when it 
came to his cabinet nominations he had four of them turned down 
one of them three times 
the senate rejected tylers nomination of caleb cushing to be 
secretary of the treasury by three separate votes on march 3 1843 
it also rejected his choice of james s green for the treasury post 
on june 15 1844 james madison porter for secretary of war on june 
30 1844 and david henshaw for secretary of the navy on jan 15 
1844 
also rejected by the senate was president andrew johnsons 
selection of henry stanberry to be attorney general in 1868 
president calvin coolidges nomination of charles b warren as 
attorney general was rejected twice on march 10 and again on march 
16 1925

friday of abandoning vietnamese refugees at sea who later turned to 
cannibalism to survive is a decorated hero of the war that created 
the boat people

states third highest military award for valor for saving members 
of his crew after their river patrol boat was caught in a viet cong 
night ambush 
his tours of duty since then have included command of the 
ammunition supply ships uss kilauea and uss kiska and the 
amphibious assault ship uss peleliu 
he took command of the uss dubuque a 16500ton amphibious

carried 400 marines as a ready reaction force and also served as 
mother ship for us minesweepers in the persian gulf 
balian was convicted of failing to render adequate assistance to 
more than 80 vietnamese refugees when the dubuque en route to the 
gulf encountered the boat people in the south china sea last june 9

following are excerpts from newspaper editorials 
friday the day of emperor hirohitos funeral 
the liberal daily asahi shimbun wrote 
at the time hirohito ascended the throne six decades ago japan 
was regarded with suspicion by the world as an emerging military 
power we must never forget the tragic sacrifices that many 
people were forced to make in japan as well as abroad along 
japans path of change 
we must not turn our eyes away from this somber history it is 
most important to renew our awareness of the responsibilities japan 
has to the world today 
for todays state funeral ceremonies the government never 
really drew a clear line between the secular and the religious 
moreover the japanese public at large tends to bow to orders from 
above as a matter of course a perfect case in point is the 
education ministrys order to all public schools that they should 
teach their children the importance of mourning for the late emperor 
another nationally circulated japanese daily mainichi shimbun 
said 
although the government has asked people to conduct a 
nationwide meditation at noon the decision of whether to express 
mourning should be left up to each individual 
unlike the days of previous deified emperors this funeral 
is the first one under the new constitution it should be a concise 
ceremony suitable for the symbolic emperor 
prime minister noboru takeshitas remarks that whether world 
war ii was a result of japanese aggression was a matter that future 
historians should determine have received severe criticism from 
countries damaged by the japanese 
such overseas reactions may puzzle those of the younger 
generation without knowledge of war but we cannot erase the 
fact that japan caused great damage among other asian nations which 
has not healed even today

house committee appointments he wanted thursday including one that 
oversees welfare legislation and the former ku klux klan leader 
said he was pleased 
duke who was seated wednesday in the house amid controversy over 
his residency in the new orleans suburb of metairie also received a 
seat on house judiciary committee in addition to a spot on the 
health and welfare committee 
im very happy with them duke said thats what i wanted 
i want health and welfare because obviously welfare reform is 
one of the most important parts of my program judiciary im 
concerned about our courts and law enforcement 
rep alphonse jackson the chairman of the health and welfare 
panel and a member of the black legislative caucus said glad to 
have him we can keep an eye on him 
duke said he planned to pursue legislation encouraging welfare 
recepients to obtain job training and employment and to cut down on 
the illegitimate birth rate two planks of his campaign platform 
the new lawmaker said he favored a system of incentives for 
those who show responsibility such as preferential housing 
areas job training and education programs 
although duke said the panel probably would not meet until the 
regular legislative session he said he planned to present 
amendments to gov buddy roemers tax revision proposal once it 
reached the house floor 
earlier thursday roemer said he had no plans to meet with duke 
but added that the door to his office was open to duke under 
specific circumstances 
if he wants to come see me in terms of his district or our 
state im willing he said but if its in terms of his 
political philosophy not now not ever 
duke whose platform also called for no tax increases and 
opposition to affirmative action programs said he intended to 
represent his district which is 996 percent white 
he is the governor of our state and i have respect for him in 
that position and im sorry that the man doesnt understand what my 
philosophy is duke said hes operating on what he perceives my 
philosophy was 10 years ago or 15 years ago i wish he would have a 
little bit more of an open mind

blaze said johnson county sheriff eddy boggs

rep donald lukens was indicted thursday on 
a misdemeanor charge that he had sex with a teenage girl but the 
58yearold congressman declared he was innocent 
the charge stems from a meeting secretly videotaped by a tv 
station between lukens and the girls mother who contended lukens 
paid for sex with her daughter four years ago when the girl was 13 
and again last november 
the fourterm conservative republican who is divorced was 
charged with contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a 
child the offense carries up to six months in jail and a 1000 
fine 
a state grand jury accused him of having sex with the girl on 
nov 6 when she was 16 in his columbus apartment the girl is now 
17 
in a statement issued in washington lukens said i do 
categorically deny that i contributed to the delinquency and 
unruliness of a minor at any time and i further categorically deny 
the accuracy of the alleged facts upon which the charge was 
apparently based i am innocent of the charge brought forth today 
lukens said his attorney had advised him against commenting on 
the allegations but i do feel an explanation is owed to my 
friends and constituents in southwestern ohio he said 
lukens who is from middletown about 30 miles north of 
cincinnati and represents a rural district said he was pleased 
that the grand jury found no evidence for the basis of serious 
charges 
the house ethics committee which has jurisdiction over 
allegations of wrongdoing by lawmakers typically waits for the 
outcome before taking any action in cases where members have been 
charged in court 
a criminal conviction does not automatically bar a legislator 
from sitting in congress 
franklin county prosecutor michael miller said he had recommended 
a different charge than the one returned but he would not elaborate 
miller also said he recommended an additional charge against 
lukens for an alleged incident in 1985 when the girl was 13 jurors 
determined there was insufficient evidence because of conflicting 
testimony from the girl he said 
no date for a court appearance was set for lukens 
columbus tv station wsyx on feb 1 broadcast a videotape that 
showed lukens apparently offering a government job to anna coffman 
after she asked why he was messin around with her daughter the 
station videotaped the nov 11 meeting at a fastfood restaurant in 
columbus after ms coffman contacted the station 
lukens told ms coffman he thought her daughter was an adult 
according to the videotape well first of all i didnt really 
know she was a teenager i didnt know that no i do now of 
course lukens said 
the fbi and prosecutors reviewed the tape and but said they found 
no evidence of bribery 
ms coffman interviewed by wdtntv of dayton after the 
indictment said she had hoped for a more serious charge 
i expected more because this is a very serious matter ms 
coffman said what kind of impression does it have on our 
children our future 
mrs coffmans daughter said she thinks lukens should be sent to 
jail and stripped of his congressional seat 
its like a hurt right underneath my heart the daughter 
said donald lukens he ruins my life 
wdtn also interviewed michelle foster 20 of columbus who said 
she was lukens girlfriend she said the girls allegations are not 
true 
lukens was first elected to congress in 1966 and served two 
terms he lost a bid for governor in the 1970 gop primary he 
returned to congress in 1986 and was reelected in november 
after the 1970 race he was barred from seeking office for five 
years for not filing campaign reports on time however the law was 
changed and he was appointed to the state senate in 1971 to fill an 
unexpired term 
in 1974 while in the state senate he fought allegations he 
accepted 1000 in campaign contributions from korean businessman 
tongsun park during his stint on capitol hill 
he presented results of a voluntary lie detector test that 
indicated he was not lying when he said he had not received a 
contribution from park

housing secretary jack kemp visited a 
baltimore soup kitchen and a shelter thursday then came here to 
continue his firsthand look at what he has called a national 
tragedy of appalling proportions homelessness 
in philadelphia kemp visited a home for impoverished women and a 
shelter for homeless men ending the nighttime tour at a federally 
subsidized apartment house for senior citizens where he was spending 
the night 
he said he came to the nations fifthlargest city to talk with 
folks and to listen to learn about the problems to see what 
theyve done and what i can do to be a catalyst to make an impact 
make a difference in this problem 
its a very human real problem that exists and its a national 
tragedy and president george bush wants me to not only inventory 
the problem but inventory some of the answers he said 
we want to make some changes kemp told an audience earlier 
thursday at the viva house shelter in baltimore saying he came as 
an advocate for their needs not as an adversary 
viva house director brendan walsh told kemp that programs for the 
homeless suffered during the reagan administration so much money 
has gone to the military that the federal housing budget has been 
cut from 31 billion to 7 billion walsh said 
thats why im here kemp answered i want to find some 
answers to the problem of homelessness 
kemps philadelphia tour began thursday night at women of hope a 
permanent shelter for impoverished women he was accompanied by 
pennsylvanias us senators republicans john heinz and arlen 
specter 
kemp heard 16 victims of poverty complain about the lack of 
affordable housing and jobs for unskilled workers 
while we sit here in this room tonight many of our sisters and 
brothers are out in the freezing cold said sister mary scullion 
who runs the center 
we expect you as our representative to begin to solve this 
problem 
we wanted kemp to see human faces said robert m hayes an 
attorney for the coalition for the homeless ten minutes on a 
steam grate is worth 50 white papers 
in addition hayes said the tour will help link kemp to the 
issue 
i hope this touches his heart but in any event his political 
future will be linked with his success in battling homelessness 
hayes said we want to teach him but we want to link him and 
hes jumping in head first 
officials estimate 10000 women children and men are homeless in 
the city 
kemp who served nine terms as a conservative republican 
congressman from upstate new york has called the plight of the 
homeless a national tragedy of appalling proportions 
after his tour of various shelters kemp was to spend the night 
at the opportunity towers a federally supported apartment complex 
for senior citizens in impoverished north philadelphia 
henry taylor the building manager said kemp would have his own 
apartment at the towers which he described as being right in the 
heart of the one of the citys lowincome neighborhoods 
the homeless issue went to the forefront in philadelphia in 
middecember when city workers demolished a cardboard city 
erected in a subway concourse by about 75 street people seeking 
shelter from freezing temperatures 
the workers returned the following night to clean out more 
makeshift homes 
some of the homeless then left the concourse and erected 
cardboard shelters outside the us courthouse where they and 
members of a philadelphia coalition for the homeless maintained a 
12day vigil 
in the morning kemp is to visit dignity housing a north 
philadelphia shelter for homeless women and their children 
hayes who is acting as a tour guide called kemps visit a 
nonideological novices composite tour with as little time as 
possible spent in offices with politicians 
kemp spent two days in atlanta last week visiting housing 
projects renewal programs interim housing for the homeless and 
privately financed developments aimed at low and moderateincome 
families

wednesdays city council meeting had a bit more 
punch than usual when a councilman who later explained he was tired 
of being called a coward scuffled with a lawyer 
a stunned mayor annette strauss and other council members watched 
as colleague al gonzalez marched into the gallery and confronted 
lawyer domingo garcia 
garcia said he had come to the council to speak on a zoning issue 
when gonzalez surprised him by coming up to his seat 
police officers quickly separated the two after gonzalez a 
former professional boxer began pummeling garcia on his chest and 
shoulders observers said 
a gonzalez staff member was unable to say where the councilman 
could be reached for comment by the associated press but earlier 
gonzalez told a dallas radio station he does not remember throwing 
the first punch 
garcia said he clearly was assaulted and later was asked by 
police if he desired to press charges garcia declined 
both men agreed that the incident was politically provoked 
mr garcia had been making some personal remarks about me 
gonzalez told wbap he said something about me being a coward and 
something about not having the courage or what have you 
i needed to defend my honor and certainly i needed to defend 
my name 
garcia criticized gonzalez about a month ago when the council 
member said he would not endorse any hispanics for the next council 
elections the 30yearold garcia and other hispanic community 
leaders have said that gonzalez who is not running again is not 
supporting their effort to replace him with another hispanic

bobby mcferrins feelgood song dont worry 
be happy was the choice of the music academy for song and record 
of the year over tracy chapmans downhearted fast car at the 
31st grammy awards 
mcferrin the vocal gymnast who uses his voice and body as an 
instrument won four grammys wednesday night while miss chapman a 
shy 25yearold folksinger from boston whose selftitled album dealt 
with racism poverty and desperation won three trophies 
i think it was so popular because it went to the spirit 
mcferrin said backstage of his song i think given the mood at 
the time it was such that people wanted something uplifting and 
jovial and funny the tempo was nice 
both big winners lost to george michael for album of the year he 
won for his platinum faith a crossover blend of ballads rock 
and soulful pop including the hit single i want your sex

social workers say a us supreme court 
ruling that protects them from lawsuits for failing to prevent child 
abuse means more cases will be reported but critics say it denies 
children their constitutional rights 
the court ruled wednesday that the state of wisconsin was not 
liable for the injuries of 9yearold joshua deshaney who was left 
permanently brain damaged and physically disabled from beatings by 
his father beginning in 1983 
the boys mother melody deshaney sued the department for 
allegedly violating the boys constitutional rights by failing to 
prevent the abuse 
the lawsuit contended social workers failed to take action 
despite their suspicions the boy had been abused several times by 
his father randy before the child was hospitalized in march 1984

americas back door has a new lock and no 
welcome mat central americans applying for political asylum are 
learning here this week 
fewer than 1 percent who have tried to obtain refugee status have 
received it and more than 100 have been jailed under a gettough 
policy that began tuesday to weed out frivolous applications 
before the immigrants travel farther into the country 
immigration and naturalization service officials said wednesday 
it was too early to declare a trend but the sharp drop in 
applicants from 233 on tuesday to 51 the next indicated the plan 
was deterring unqualified applications 
we can only speculate that the word has gotten out and many of 
those coming for purely economic reasons are not coming any more

if you sometimes wonder why federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan is so worried about inflation which might 
not even reach 5 percent this year think back to the 1970s 
that was the decade in which the nations economic powers lost 
control of inflation and then in a belated effort to restrain it 
forced interest rates to the highest levels in most americans 
memory 
the 1970s were not a long time ago but the pace of economic 
activity is so swift now that those days seem buried in history and 
gone with them somehow forgotten are the financial tragedies 
that destroyed ordinary people 
the setting for the disaster was in the previous decade that of 
the 1960s when inflation was insignificant from 1958 through 1965 
the consumer price index measured from one december to the next 
never even reached 2 percent 
stability of that sort made planning easy you saved your money 
at a certain rate of interest and low as that rate was you could 
project your financial assets far into the future you knew where 
you stood 
in the latter half of the 1960s things began to change in part 
because the united states under president lyndon johnson sought to 
pursue a guns and butter economy that is johnson said both an 
asian war and a great society were possible 
it wasnt true as history demonstrated inflation began creeping 
into the economy as budget deficits appeared by 1969 it exceeded 6 
percent it slowed a bit over the next three years then it struck a 
devastating blow 
from 1967 to the end of 1983 the consumer price index tripled in 
the 1970s alone it doubled three times between 1974 and 1980 the 
rise in the price index exceeded 10 percent reaching an incredible 
133 percent in 1979 
at 133 percent the value of a dollar is cut in half in less 
than 5 years while that was the extreme and lasted for only a 
year the average annual inflation rate in the 1970s exceeded 7 
percent 
at 7 percent a year the value of savings accounts insurance 
policies savings bonds and the like is cut in half in 10 years 
true savings accounts and savings bonds did earn interest but at 
much less than the inflation rate 
many savings accounts for example were fixed by law at 525 
percent 
those people who believed in old virtues such as saving for a 
rainy day virtues nurtured in the steady decade of the 1960s found 
themselves robbed 
meanwhile those who borrowed to speculate on inflation became 
rich in spite of rising interest rates investors borrowed heavily 
and bought real assets such as houses housing prices soared 
faster even than the cpi 
so what if interest rates were high you wrote them off on your 
taxes and you repaid the mortgage in cheaper dollars and you also 
wrote off depreciation on the house while it doubled in market value 
all this was possible because other people had saved money in the 
good old american tradition and were robbed it was the heist of 
the century as if a big truck had been backed up to the banks of 
america 
some of those people mainly older ones never recovered and of 
course the inflation that robbed them and the efforts to overcome 
it pitched them into still another disaster the terrible recession 
that followed the 70s 
this sad tale was just one of the consequences of the great 
inflation of the 1970s while the economy is different today the 
consequences are no less and probably much greater

billy tipton kept to himself as his jazz 
trio toured the west 
he never went swimming in the motel pools waiting for a call 
from the groups manager hed say or didnt want to burn his fair 
skin he stayed in a separate room and didnt talk much about 
childhood or family life when he did talk hed say he came from a 
broken home and was sent to live with an aunt 
drummer dick oneill considered tipton to be his best friend but 
even he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had been 
hiding 
billy tipton was a biological female pathologist george 
lindholm said after an autopsy on tipton who died jan 21 from a 
bleeding ulcer 
interviews with family friends colleagues and jazz afficionados 
shed little light on tiptons early years even her age is 
uncertain kitty oakes who lived as tiptons wife after 1960 until 
they separated about 10 years ago told a funeral home tipton was 
born dec 29 1914 in oklahoma city and was raised in kansas city 
mo but no birth certificate has been found 
what is known is that tipton a saxophone and piano player who 
liked to write vocal arrangements performed with the jack 
teagarden russ carlyle and scott cameron bands before forming the 
billy tipton trio in the 1950s 
he gave up everything oakes who adopted three sons with 
tipton told the spokesmanreview newspaper there were certain 
rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a 
musician 
but jazz experts including several women who played in bands in 
the 1930s said that while there was discrimination they doubted 
that a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make it 
in the industry they point to mary lou williams and others who 
became famous as jazz musicians and composers 
when i first started i was skipped over unless they couldnt 
get anybody else said pianist norma teagarden sister of jack 
teagarden at that time it was hard to break in with a band 
especially if you played saxophone 
there was a lot of resistance there were not many women in 
that business anyway youve got to be on the road so much you 
cant very well be married unless your husband was one of the 
group 
i was a piano player and didnt have any problems joining a 
jazz band she said having three brothers who were established 
musicians probably helped said ms teagarden who performs in san 
francisco two nights a week 
marion mcpartland a jazz pianist who hosts a national public 
radio jazz show said its such a strange story i dont feel it 
any part of my own career i cant identify with somebody doing 
something like that 
there were many women jazz players around in lots of bands 
i can only say that ive been fortunate in that ive never even had 
the feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that 
mcpartland said 
the bands were mostly men and i would think in the 1930s where 
they were on the road doing onenighters a lot having a woman on 
the bus had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used 
and so on said stanley dance who has written eight books on jazz 
musicians from that point of view a lot of males would not 
welcome the woman 
still it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that 
it certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano in 
jazz bands said george simon a jazz critic i dont think that 
society was really well prepared for women jazz players even 
jazz which was as liberal a society as you could find there wasnt 
that much integration 
oneill said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows the 
fact that tipton was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor 
tiptons baby face and high voice prompted some cracks in 
nightclubs but the drummer said i would almost fight anybody 
who said tipton looked too feminine to be a man 
i came from a small town and was a mill worker he had feminine 
features and at first i thought he was kind of queer but after i 
went to work for him i had no reason to think that oneill said 
he was a straight guy and there was no hankypanky 
tipton was the type of person who would give you the shirt off 
his back he made gobs of money for other people and ended up with 
nothing he said 
tipton stayed for several months in a rooming house run by the 
teagardens mother in oklahoma city ms teagarden remembers tipton 
was in her late teens and lived with an older woman even then 
tipton dressed in mens clothing 
billy was trying to get started she had a few jobs around 
town but i never heard her play said ms teagarden tipton told 
members of her trio she had learned to play piano from norma 
teagarden who also doubts that tipton played with her famous 
brother jack 
a lot of people claim those kinds of things if they did play 
with my brothers band it was usually someone drafted for one night 
to replace one of the regulars who got sick she said theres 
something very sad about it to have to live all your life like 
that under false pretenses

even a bigfoot believer like paul 
freeman concedes the supermarket tabloids get carried away 
huge bigfoot monster terrorizes the rockies it stunk like a 
sewer roared like a lion and clutched the leg of an animal in its 
hand 
bigfoot attacked us bloodcrazed creature savages camera crew 
and pounds 2ton truck into junkyard scrap 
freeman smiles at the outlandish stories which he collects in a 
cardboard box there are some crazy people out there he says 
freeman himself has been called the craziest of all 
but he knows otherwise he says he has seen bigfoot four times 
he swears its true and he is out to convince a doubting world that 
the legendary apemonsters perhaps a thousand strong really do 
roam the dark woods of the pacific northwest 
i know they are there and i know what i see freeman says 
nothing has to be proven to me but id like to prove it to the 
public so theyll say freemans not really a kook 
bigfoot or sasquatch as the indians called the beast is one 
of the northwests enduring legends more than 750 sightings of the 
creatures or their oversize footprints have been reported over the 
past century mostly in the evergreen forests stretching from 
northern california to british columbia 
yet no bigfoot has ever been killed or captured 
no carcass or bones have ever been found 
a few purported bigfoot photographs exist including a picture 
taken in october by freemans son but they always seem to be out of 
focus too dark or too far away what looks like sasquatch could be 
a misshapen tree stump or someone in a monkey suit 
skeptics point to hoaxes like the time a washington man created 
a whole bigfoot family by stomping around with three whopping pairs 
of feet he had carved of wood 
but if you want to believe talk to paul freeman 
drive with him eastward from walla walla where the flatlands of 
southeastern washington rise into the blue mountains of the umatilla 
national forest listen to freemans tales of safaris into the 
forests 177000acre wilderness area behold a lonely land of 
windbared ridges and dark forested canyons 
bigfoot country freeman says you can go in there all summer 
and not see anybody 
not that nobody sees you 
freeman tells of suddenly skittish horses of normally docile 
dogs growling fiercely at the darkness your skin gets kind of 
crawly and the hair stands up on your neck he says you know 
youre being watched but you dont know from where 
freeman 45 does not seem the type to spook easily he is beefy 
bearded and at 6foot4 and 265 pounds approaches sasquatch 
proportions himself hes a meatcutter by trade an outdoorsman and 
hunter by nature 
he says he too was a skeptic until june 10 1982 when he was 
working as a watershed patroller for the us forest service and met 
up with a shaggy reddishbrown bigfoot nearly 8 feet tall 
he was 60 yards away freeman recalls i watched him walk 
the length of two football fields hed take a few steps look back 
at me and take a few more steps then he went up over a hill and 
disappeared 
when word got out freeman became an instant celebrity but the 
fame was spiked with ridicule reporters hounded him his 
supervisors doubted him anonymous callers said he was crazy and 
threatened to take his three children away 
freeman quit his forest service job and moved away drifting 
through a series of jobs a gnawing need for vindication he says 
drew him back to walla walla in 1984 
he has been on the spoor of bigfoot ever since he says he is in 
the woods three days a week and figures he has sunk 50000 into the 
search funding it by driving trucks part time and tapping profits 
from the sales of a meatcutting business and to houses 
what can he show for his effort 
there is a trunk filled with plaster casts of bigfoot tracks and 
hair samples that according to freeman experts cannot identify as 
man or beast 
near the kitchen door of his rented home a map is webbed with 
lines marking where he and son duane 22 have tracked sasquatches 
in the freezer sits a chunk of suspected bigfoot scat 
last oct 5 duane snapped three color photos that he and his 
father say show a creature they spotted 35 miles east of walla 
walla the best one shows a black apelike shape in a clearing 150 
yards away 
duane says it made a believer out of him but the fuzzy pictures 
do less for one who wasnt there i was shaking a lot duane 
explains 
freeman says that bigfoot was on the small side about 7 feet 
tall maybe 700 pounds the biggest he says top 8 feet and leave 
18inch footprints uprooted trees attest to their strength he 
says but unlike the monsters that stalk tabloid headlines they are 
gentle and shy 
the secretive animals evade detection by sticking to dark 
canyons foraging at night and even altering their prints to 
resemble bear tracks freeman says 
sure theyre that smart he says if they didnt have a 
lot of intelligence theyd be dead by now 
they eat mushrooms and skunk cabbage elk calves and salmon 
freeman says come winter they may hole up in caves which he says 
would explain their awful stench 
freeman has received moral support from at least one researcher 
in the murky world of cryptozoology the study of questionable 
creatures 
grover krantz a washington state university anthropology 
professor and veteran sasquatch seeker has examined some of 
freemans plaster casts and found them rather convincing complete 
with fingerpintlike dermal ridges 
but another bigfoot researcher canadian author rene dahinden 
denounces freeman as a publicityseeking huckster 
forest service officials dont know what to think 
ive spent a lot of time in the woods and ive never seen 
anything that would lead me to believe that bigfoot exists says 
wayne long a fire management officer and the umatillas de facto 
sasquatch spokesman then again he adds you can go out in the 
woods all your life and never see a cougar but that doesnt mean 
they dont exist 
freeman says hed just like to get a good photograph or maybe 
some bones he has heard there are caves deep in the umatillas 
wilderness and says that might be where sasquatches hide their dead 
if i could find some bones he says it would pay me back 
100 times over what ive spent 
so far freeman says his bigfoot work has paid him only 2000 
mostly from appearing in an ice cream commercial featuring people 
who do unbelievable things

a popular outcry against big spending greeted the 
recent proposal to raise congressional salaries it helped defeat 
the pay raise it did little to stop the big bills 
the pay raise would have amounted to about 29 million but 
spending on the legislative branch in fiscal year 1989 will rise 
381 million a oneyear 21 percent increase to a total of more 
than 22 billion 
spending on congress itself that is for operation of the senate 
and house but not including legislative agencies will reach more 
than 1 billion in fiscal 1989 six times what it cost for the same 
job in 1970 
these figures compiled by the tax foundation illustrate many 
points but perhaps none more convincingly than the inability of the 
public to even find to say nothing of grabbing and gripping the 
handle of bureaucracy 
voters might have thought they had the handle in the pay raise 
proposal what they had however was just a little burr on the 
slick hide of the beast they never knew what they missed 
they howled for example about a pay raise that would have 
represented 13 percent of the cost of operating congress and its 
legislative branch agencies and they overlooked spending that 
over the years amounts to billions 
among the bigger things for example is that members of congress 
will average 100000 each for postal expenses this year and that 
the operations of congress now cost 36 million per senator and 
13 million per representative 
those operations arent solely for what happens under the capitol 
dome or for the trips back home or the factfinding missions abroad 
thats because congress also maintains a number of legislative 
agencies 
among these agencies is the congressional budget office the 
botanic garden the general accounting office the architect of the 
capital the library of congress and the government printing office 
each has its own complexities and budget too according to the 
foundation the legislative agencies will cost taxpayers more than 
congress itself a total of nearly 12 billion or 38 percent more 
than in 1988 
the foundation selfdescribed as a nonprofit and nonpartisan 
research organization that monitors taxing and spending provides 
these other illustrations of how complex and perhaps unmanageable 
things have become 
congress runs on a committee system the senate has 20 
committees and 87 subcommittees employing 770 key staff personnel 
the house has 28 committees and 160 subcommittees employing more 
than 1271 key staffers 
including the joint committees the congressional bureaucracy is 
made up of more than 50 committees with more than 250 subcommittees 
paying a key staff of more than 2100 people 
the legislative branch now employs more than 37500 workers 
congress itself has 19200 on the payroll 7200 in the senate and 
12000 in the house 
confronted with the impossibly of dealing with such complexity 
the public turned its rage against the otherwise minor pay increase 
they directed their anger at the visible targets using them as 
symbols of the unknown whole 
the question now is whether members of congress can act on the 
directive to cut spending or whether their efforts also might be 
only symbolic 
that question arises from a review of the totals 
overall says the tax foundation the 21 percent leap in spending 
for the legislative branch is triple the percentage increase for 
total federal spending in fiscal year 1989

canadian animators turning the babar stories into 
a television series and feature film are well aware of the long 
memories their viewers may have of the elephant king 
you have generations of people who have heard of babar 
director laura shepherd said you dont want to contradict that 
the babar stories date back to 1931 in france first by jean de 
brunhoff and then his son laurent 
after torontobased nelvana productions won the rights to produce 
a babar series the team that would be working on the project 
immersed itself in the books to find out what was so special about 
the them 
the result churned out at the companys headquarters in a 
fashionably renovated munitions factory already has started 
showing on the canadian broadcasting corp in a weekly evening slot 
and will start this spring on home box office in the united states 
the programs can be expected in other countries as well 
marvelous as the books might be the animators found more visual 
strength and character in them than 30minute plot lines for 
animation 
the story lines had to be significantly changed but the 
bottom line for us is that the spirits still there shepherd said 
indeed its hard not to smile through much of the first shows 
possibly because of the animated characters of babar celeste the 
old lady and all the rest or perhaps just from the lingering 
goodwill of old memories 
the company is hoping to attract parents as well as children 
we had to show networks it could work for the whole family 
said producer michael hirsch one of the companys three founders 
the solution was to concentrate on stories about babar as a young 
king each episode is framed with a bookend featuring the more 
familiar older babar and his family flashing back to problems that 
he had as a boy king and how he solved them 
in one for example one of babars sons tries to please everyone 
at his birthday party by entertaining too many special guests babar 
then recalls how he once had a date with celeste and a gorilla 
princess at the same time 
we made the theme of the series growing up hirsch said we 
think it makes it easier for older children and adults 
that makes babar significantly different from one of nelvanas 
earlier success stories since the companys start in 1972 the care 
bears projects which were aimed for children from 2 to 6 
hirsch and fellow producer patrick loubert two of the companys 
three founders dont worry about the sometimes mixed reviews the 
simpler projects have had the care bears are frankly for younger 
kids they work on a young kid level loubert said 
care bears have very high parental approval hirsch said 
children love it parents love it but reviewers have the toughest 
time of it 
the first babar episode drew mixed reviews in toronto where the 
toronto star said nelvana succeeded in a painstaking balance of 
styles while the globe and mail said fans would be better advised 
to stick to the books 
the first episode includes the scene in which his mother is 
killed by a hunter recalling the tragic episode in the animated 
disney movie bambi 
asked if it was difficult to include such a scene in a childrens 
series loubert replied its a classic property i believe the 
death of the mother was part of the story we agonized over it 
let me tell you there was a lot of talk 
the producers are hoping for a long run with the series and babar 
animated films the first due this summer 
the company which among earlier animation projects handled star 
wars characters and the strawberry shortcake fad also is taking a 
direct role in licensing for the first time the producers talk 
about babar being as durable as a disney character so the elephant 
can be expected on everything from sheets to toys 
not everything lasts loubert said we would hope that this 
property would last for years 
we want babar to be a perennial hirsch said 
nelvana is among the more visible companies in the growing 
toronto film and tv production industry it claims to be among the 
worlds top 10 animation companies 
the arrangement with laurent de brunhoff was made by clifford 
ross who formed a company to work with classic childrens stories 
and then brought babar to nelvana

andrea marcovicci recalls a moment last year 
when she spotted a brief announcement that the american conservatory 
theatre would include george bernard shaws saint joan in its 
upcoming season 
marcovicci who was in town then to perform her cabaret act at 
the plush room turned to her accompanist and mused i wonder 
whos going to play st joan 
the surprise answer came when director michael smuin asked her to 
take on the title role which is sometimes described as the female 
equivalent of hamlet its won that reputation for three very good 
reasons first everybody who comes to see the play has their own 
vision of what joan of arc was like second the shavian concept of 
joan is quite unlike most others 
third almost every major actress of the 20th century has tried 
on joans sandals the leading women of stage have included uta 
hagen siobhan mckenna sarah miles joan plowright wendy hiller 
jane alexander lee grant and lynn redgrave ingrid bergman hedy 
lamar jean seberg and julie harris have played joan in screen 
adaptations 
being with such heavy talent is enough to cause any actor to lose 
sleep and marcovicci has indeed had trouble sleeping lately a 
month ago she was worried about learning her lines now she finds 
herself tossing in bed as she mentally walks through her part 
but she no longer worries whether shell measure up to the great 
performers of the past 
if you were to worry about that how could you ever get up if 
i were to think that way when i was singing it would be impossible 
for me to sing a song because ella fitzgerald did it so much better 
judy garland did the man that got away better than im ever going 
to do it so why should i ever try 
from what ive been reading ill never touch siobhan mckenna 
in their minds but then you have to throw that out and you have to 
say once you take on the part you become joan and she becomes 
you since she was a real person if you open yourself to the echoes 
of what she really said you should be able to take her on without 
too much intimidation 
marcovicci has retraced shaws footsteps in researching the part 
she has even read the transcript of joans nineweek trial which 
has shown her that shaw was correct when he told his admirers he was 
merely quoting the saint 
that transcript is staggering when you read it that great line 
when they say can you possibly tell me that you are in a state 
of grace and she says if i am not may god bring me to it if i 
am may god keep me in it thats exactly wordforword from 
the transcript 
marcovicci also wants to show another side of st joan 
i have to dare to let her be actually unpleasant at times 
which will be surprising to people who think well shes a saint 
and were supposed to love her at all times but she was irritating 
beyond belief to the people that were around her she said 
she allowed medals to be cast in her honor when she came into 
town she had the bells ringing a halfhour at a stretch so she 
could hear them she became quite puffed up thats the thing 
thats so tragic this really has shakespearean scope because she 
doesnt see what shes doing 
but marcovicci who played ophelia opposite sam waterstons 
hamlet at the new york shakespeare festival doesnt see the 
comparison of joan to the bards prince 
hamlet is much more difficult because hamlet is neurotic she 
said joan never doubted she firmly believed in everything she 
did because it came from god and she had what none of us have 
complete assurance 
although marcoviccis acting career has included roles in such 
shortlived musicals as ambassador chaplin and 
nefertiti and work in television and film she is best known to 
many as a torch singer and that strikes her as funny 
its weird ive only been best known as a singer in the last 
two years i mean people are coming up to me at my concert 
appearances and saying i heard a rumor you were once an actress 
after finishing the run of saint joan at act which opened 
feb 28 and will close april 7 she hopes to return to singing but 
marcovicci also intends to keep the public aware shes more than 
just another pretty soprano 
ive always wanted to go back to doing shakespeare she said 
id like to work again with joseph papp and i feel that this has 
opened that door again

call it toothy gold a getrich quick plan for 
an area devastated by the crash of the oil market 
across louisianas marshes once flush with profits from black 
gold small patches of land increasingly are being turned into 
alligator farms with investors hoping to quintuple their 
investments in short order 
year before last there were just under 9000 farmraised 
gators sold by 37 farms said dave taylor alligator research 
coordinator for louisianas department of wildlife and fisheries 
that number is going to reach 60000 quickly and could be up to 
100000 certainly within five years 
thats in addition to the 24000 wild alligators trapped each 
fall in carefully supervised hunts 
spurred by prices of 37 a linear foot for hides 21 new farms 
have opened in the past two years and we expect them to produce 
18000 gators taylor said the waiting list for permits for new 
farms is about 100 
jerry jones jr 28 went into business two years ago near 
sweetlake and expects to put 12000 hides a year on the market his 
farm is stateoftheart automated cleaning watersource heat 
pumps carefully supervised diets 
the result is quicker growth at less cost we have some are 56 
feet long in a year and six months we have 8monthold gators that 
are 2630 inches 
skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length and are 
used for luggage farmraised gators are skinned at two years old 
and about four feet long their hides are used for shoes purses 
belts and other smaller highfashion accoutrements requiring smaller 
patterns on the hides 
for about 30000 a potential farmer can put up a couple 
windowless cinderblock buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to 
raise 1000 gators a year it would take another 25000 to 30000 
to operate until the gators grew enough to sell at current prices 
1000 fourfoot hides would bring 148000 
the minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to 
two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length 
taylor said buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water 
and be kept about 89 degrees 
the first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests 
paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the 
hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long thats a carefully 
researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of 
15 million wild alligators reached after the alligator was taken 
off the endangered species list in the mid1970s 
the wild nests arent easy to find and female alligators guard 
their eggs about the only time in their lives they show maternal 
instincts 
no task for the timid taylor agreed but everybodys got to 
learn some time or another if they want to get into farming 
obviously what would be best for a guys first involvement 
would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests 
from the air thats the only way to go rent a helicopter and go 
find them and pick them up 
the success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive 
prices down and there are risks any time a market depends on 
fashion or something volatile he said i dont think the bottom 
will fall out of the price i dont think theyll go to 2 a foot 
but it certainly could go to half of what it is now 
jones a former trapper commercial diver and underwater welder 
who now devotes full time to his farm agrees with taylors 
analysis a lot of these farms youll see what happens prices 
are good right now but with all these hides coming on the market 
its going to have to go down 
but jones believes he will survive when others fail because his 
expenses are low look at it this way youve got an electricity 
bill of 500 a month to raise 1000 alligators and my bill is 150 
a month to raise 12000 
his major problem is finding enough nutria small water rodents 
to feed the gators nutria often are dyed like beaver and jones 
said the price of skins is so low right now that you cant get 
all you want last year i got 40000 pounds and i could have used 
140000 
he had to supplement with fish and horse and young alligators 
dont grow as quickly on that diet in addition too much fish gives 
alligators gout

although its little known china has included 
jewish inhabitants going far back to the middle ages it later was 
home for thousands of them who fled nazism in europe 
most of them now live elsewhere but they plan a reunion this 
spring in that land where some have roots for generations and where 
others were given refuge 
at the time of hitlers rise when most countries had rejected 
them china opened its door to the refugees says yosef tekoah 
it was easier to find shelter there than elsewhere 
tekoah born and raised in china is now chancellor of ben gurion 
university of the negev in israel and that countrys former united 
nations ambassador he added in an interview 
many people in the west dont realize the greatness of chinese 
culture its inherent tolerance and humanity basically there was 
no discrimination of the kind which jewish people have suffered over 
the years in many countries 
as honorary chairman of an international assembly of jews in 
china to be held in shanghai april 1830 time of the jewish 
passover tekoah said it will be a significant event renewing 
old chinese ties 
it also will recall a part of jewish history an interesting 
and fascinating period in a great and fascinating country he 
said people are coming from all over the world 
the affair has implicit though unofficial approval of the 
chinese government planners say reflecting the thaw in 
chineseisraeli relations toward trade and other exchanges 
the earliest accounts of china jews go back before the journey of 
italian explorer marco polo into china in the l3th century the jews 
apparently having gone there from ancient israel or other parts of 
the middle east 
but traces of those olden china jews generally have disappeared 
over the years that community was completely assimilated and 
absorbed into chinese civilization tekoah said however here 
and there chinese people still claim they are descendents of that 
community 
he said remnants of it were reported in the centralnorthern part 
of china at kaifengfu near the end of the 19th century when 
christian missionaries first arrived in china 
there had been very little contact with china from the outside 
and the jewish community became isolated which is one reason it was 
completely absorbed he said 
however he said that at the same time about the end of the 19th 
century jewish families in india and iraq then both under british 
rule migrated to china including the kadouri hardoon and sasoon 
families 
they mostly settled in shanghai while in the early 20th century 
jews of european origin arrived especially russians fleeing the 
communist revolution and settling mainly in chinas manchurian 
north in harbin 
later they moved southward to mukden tientsin and shanghai 
which developed the largest jewish community in china a big influx 
from the nazi threat in germany poland and austria swelled 
shanghais jewish population to 20000 by 193839 
tekoahs forbears had left russia in the 1920s after the 
communist revolution and lived in harbin china where tekoah was 
born until 1937when the family moved south to shanghai 
most jewish people who have lived in china remember life there 
fondly he said china has one of the oldest civilizations in 
the world a very fascinating country 
jewish life there was quite developed with an advanced communal 
life organizationally there were synagogues schools elderly 
citizen homes newspapers and so forth 
however their residence there generally ended about 194849 as 
the nationalist government collapsed and the communist forces took 
over causing a general exodus of all westerners including jews 
some jewish people a very few remained into the 50s but 
they too soon left tekoah said his own family had left in 
1945 after which he completed undergraduate studies in the us 
before going on to israel 
shanghai buildings that had once housed jewish institutions have 
been converted to other purposes and signs of jewish life there 
removed 
however at the coming reunion there after 40 years of absence 
planners said that with the blessings of chinese authorities 
plaques are to be erected on sites cherished in jewish memory 
for most of us tekoah said returning to shanghai will be 
a tangible restatement of our faith in jewish survivial and our 
friendship toward china

my god was personal he said but he found that personal

more than a century after arab slave 
traders and gold and ivory merchants built their lavish homes shops 
and bazaars near zanzibars flourishing harbor the labyrinthine old 
quarter is crumbling 
now the government is trying to restore the district known as 
stone town to at least a semblance of its former glory through a 
process very similar to the gentrification of rundown neighborhoods 
in england and the united states 
stone town never ceased to be a commercial focal point for the 
spice island its elaborately carved brassstudded wooden doors and 
the latticework balconies hanging over narrow alleys embody 
zanzibars intertwined arab asian and african heritage 
during 20 years of social and economic upheaval stone town was 
neglected and suffered severe deterioration but with new money 
created by the governments 5yearold policy of economic 
liberalization and 400000 in technical assistance from the united 
nations zanzibar hopes to reverse the decay 
the effort is led by ahmed sheikh ahmed director of the stone 
town conservation and development authority which has put most of 
its resources not into renovating the buildings but selling them 
the idea of selling the buildings is not to get money the idea 
is to get people to look after the buildings said ahmed 
after a revolution by zanzibars black majority in 1964 many of 
their abandoned buildings were confiscated by the socialist 
government which converted them into multifamily dwellings for 
lowincome families and newly arrived rural peasants 
many of the dilapidated structures now pose a potential danger to 
tenants and shoppers in the quarters busy alleys said ahmed 
during heavy rains in 1984 seven buildings collapsed killing five 
people he said 
stone town is home to an estimated 18000 people 
it is zanzibars historic seat of government and still houses 
most of the islands official offices 40 percent of the citys 
classrooms the majority of its mosques temples and churches as 
well as banks movie houses hotels restaurants and the islands 
main market 
it contains the remains of a stone fort built by omani arabs in 
the 1700s a palace built by the islands arab rulers in the 
mid19th century the home of tippu tub a notorious slave trader 
and other historically or architecturally valuable buildings 
since 1985 the development authority has overseen the sale of 
120 buildings and ahmed credited the sales to the nations economic 
liberalization policies that opened doors to free enterprise 
before 1984 most shops were closed after 1984 most shops 
opened now they can do business make money and repair buildings 
ahmed said

the most frustrating part of driving a 1989 acura integra is the 
other cars on the road many dont have anywhere near the 
performance and handling features of the integra and seem well to 
get in the way 
its not that the integra purposely wants to show off its just 
built to be a serious traveler 
introduced in late 1986 the car was named in january 1987 one of 
car and driver magazines 10 best it also was runnerup to its own 
kin the more expensive acura legend coupe in the competition for 
motor trends import car of the year 
in january 1988 the integra bowed again on car and drivers 10 
best list and in the annual car book released last december 
198688 integras had the honor of showing no owner complaints of 
trouble in federal government files 
not bad for a car that starts at 11260 but offers the 
performance of some higherpriced autos car and driver once wrote 
that the integras sticker price brings tears to the eyes of general 
motors executives 
it also brings out relatively wellheeled buyers many of whom 
were previous or current honda buyers integra sales in calendar 
1988 totaled more than 54000 up from more than 50000 in calendar 
1987 
median household income of integra fivedoor buyers is 54000 
said company spokesman mike spencer seventypercent are men 89 
percent have college education the median age is 39 and 78 percent 
are married 
its positioned as a family sports sedan spencer said noting 
the integra made by honda but sold in separate acura dealerships 
competes against the sporty honda prelude and widely popular 
honda accord 
but the integra leans more heavily toward the sports side than 
the family side spencer admitted saying the company has pushed 
the performance image and the ties to formula one racing with the 
car some engineered items such as the integras sophisticated 
electronic engine management systems stem from that racing 
experience the company says 
in contrast the accord appears a more sedate type of family 
vehicle although its 2liter 12valve fourcylinder engine is no 
slouch it compares with the integras 16liter 16valve twin 
overhead cam four cylinder and the preludes 2liter 16valve 
powerplant 
there are subtle differences among the cars spencer explained 
noting the prelude is positioned more as a sheer sports car with 
less interior room for passengers and cargo than the integra has 
pricewise the integra is amid its honda cousins the accord 
starts at around 11000 and the prelude begins at around 14000 
the test car an integra ls fivedoor squealed its tires a few 
times until i got accustomed to the 118 horsepower under the hood 
the integra sure tried to grab the road even in slick conditions 
the ride was all sport no cushiony floating feeling here but 
it also made for good road handling and feel 
seats were nicely contoured to fit the body well and not quite as 
fitted and low to the floor as those in the prelude making entry 
and exit easier 
the ride combined with the smooth enginefivespeed manual 
transmission performance and low road noise made for pleasurable 
traveling up front 
in the back seat legroom could be at a premium if the front 
seats were pushed back all the way rear legroom was ok if the front 
seats were pushed up a ways it also could be a close fit for three 
adults in the back seat 
in comparison the accord is a couple inches wider 
like nearly all family cars now the integras back doors had 
childproof locks and the rear power windows could be deactivated 
by a switch on the driver door 
the hatchback area was roomy and the rear seats could fold down 
for more room there was a shelf behind the rear seat where items 
could be placed it doubled as a partial cover for things stowed 
below in the hatchback and folded upward for access below 
i found i had to be sure to keep the rear lap belts out of the 
way when putting the rear seats back up or the belts could get stuck 
against the car body 
the integras fit and finish inside and out was impeccable i 
noted that while the integra had power windows and door locks the 
outside mirrors had to be adjusted manually as did the radio antenna 
consumer reports magazine ranked the 198687 integras much better 
than average according to its survey of owner trouble reports

theres nothing like a political exorcism to 
make a name for a fringe candidate all of a sudden david duke is 
the bestknown state legislator around 
right now more people probably know the name of the state 
representative from metarie la than know who represents them in 
their own legislature 
duke 38 a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan came to 
national note because as soon as the republican party found out 
about him gop leaders up to and including president bush and 
former president reagan tried to purge him 
actually the republicans were in a nowin situation when duke 
barged onto the ballot in metarie a suburb of new orleans they 
couldnt be silent without appearing to accept him but by speaking 
out against him they provided duke the very platform he sought 
thus a 227vote margin in the 81st assembly district of louisiana 
provided what duke couldnt get as a minor party candidate for 
president he was on the ballot in 15 states as a populist party 
candidate in a campaign managed by a former leader of the american 
nazi party 
duke got a total of 48267 votes for president 18612 of them 
in louisiana or 11 percent of the total vote there 
then duke who had started as a democrat changed his 
registration to republican and ran for the legislature on jan 21 
he led a sevencandidate field with 33 percent of the vote in an 
open primary a system unique to louisiana all candidates 
regardless of party run against each other in the primary and the 
two top finishers meet in a runoff 
in this case both finalists were republicans duke and john 
treen a homebuilder and the brother of a former governor duke got 
8459 votes treen 8232 
dukes primary lead sounded an alarm to state and national gop 
leaders who went to work for treen and arranged the bush and reagan 
endorsements that raised the stakes and his election to the 
legislature he took his seat on wednesday became a national gop 
embarrassment 
it was heightened because of the bitter and often negative 1988 
presidential campaign in which the bush organization was accused of 
racist tactics for its tv commercials about the crimes of a 
furloughed black convict 
furthermore republican southern strategies in presidential 
campaigns dating back to 1964 concentrated on the conservative white 
voters who broke up what once was a solidly democratic south 
lee atwater the southerner who managed the bush campaign and now 
is republican national chairman says the gop is reaching out to 
black and other minority voters seeking to broaden its base among 
groups that have been overwhelmingly democratic 
duke quit the klan in 1980 in a leadership dispute and set up 
his own organization the national association for the advancement 
of white people atwater said duke is no republican but a 
pretender a charlatan and a political opportunist he said he 
wanted duke disenfranchised from our party but excommunication 
implies that the sinner was in the church in the first place so 
party leaders decided to censure duke instead declaring that he is 
not a republican in gesture deed or belief 
even that adds to the notoriety level for duke atwater said he 
was going to stop talking about the unwanted gop legislator because 
a prolonged argument plays right into his hands 
bush acknowledged that some people in metarie may have thought it 
was improper or overkill for the president to pick a candidate in a 
special election to the state legislature i just felt i had to 
speak out he said but whether it helped or hurt i dont 
know 
history says that sometimes a challenge to the dictates of a 
national party can pay dividends at home in 1965 house democrats 
stripped rep john bell williams of mississippi of his seniority as 
punishment for his endorsement of republican barry goldwater for 
president in 1964 it didnt hurt in mississippi two years later he 
was elected governor

step into golden west financial corps oakland 
calif executive headquarters and you wont find a smiling 
receptionist to greet you nor will you be invited to sample the 
culinary concoctions of a company chef 
these along with automatic teller machines are considered 
luxuries that the large savings and loan company says it will 
forsake for now 
staying lean and sticking to the traditional business of safe 
singlefamily home loans has helped make golden west a huge success 
story in an industry marred by fraud incompetence and highflying 
lending deals 
about a quarter of the 3200 federally insured sampls are 
considered insolvent or close to it with most concentrated in the 
oil and farm belts 
these thrifts account for most of the industrywide losses and 
the government is grappling for solutions that will likely require 
more than 100 billion in aid 
the crisis has incited widespread speculation that sampls will 
inevitably die like dinosaurs nevertheless many have made it to 
the top or rebounded from hard times and intend to stay there 
the guys who got in trouble got away from tradition said 
james h grohl a senior vice president for the industry trade group 
us league of savings institutions if you stuck to your housing 
knitting chances are youd be in much better shape 
a study by the giant trade organization last fall found that 
thrifts considered successful had twice as many assets on average 
65 percent in traditional housing related investments such as 
mortgages or mortgagebacked securities as unhealthy institutions 
the problem thrifts had three times as many assets 40 percent vs 
127 percent in nontraditional areas such as commercial loans or 
risky junk bond securities the report found 
golden west with 14 billion in assets is probably the best 
example of a thrift that has prospered by staying on the straight 
and narrow it makes no loans except for housing and 80 percent of 
them are for singlefamily units 
as a result bad loans represent 04 percent of its loan 
portfolio compared with 2 percent for the industry on average 
husbandandwife team herbert and marion sandler have placed a 
tight rein on costs since taking the thrifts helm in 1963 and 
steadily expanding it to 200 branches in six states partly through 
carefully planned acquisitions 
instead of footing the bill for a receptionist golden west asks 
visitors to announce themselves through a black telephone in a small 
reception area at its 17th floor executive suite the sandlers also 
have gone without the comforts of a private diningroom or a chef 
preferring to munch deskside on fruit and cottage cheese 
customers also dont have access to atms because the sandlers 
who control a 20 percent stake in the company dont think it makes 
sense financially although sandler says the wiring is in place if 
they decide to take the plunge 
sandler said his thrifty thrift is not a penny pincher were 
just planning to grow prudently he said 
golden west also has an aggressive training program geared to 
improving customer service and a covert team of shoppers who 
rank employee performance at bank branches he noted 
equally as lean and mean only on a smaller scale is washigton 
federal savings and loan association in seattle which has 2 
billion in assets and is widely thought to be one of the strongest 
and best managed thrifts in the country less than 10 percent of its 
loan portfolio is in commercial real estate 
more telling is washington feds 11 percent ratio of equity to 
assets among the highest in the nation and four times the minimum 
amount required by the federal savings and loan insurance 
regulations the company believes the strong net worth position 
will among other things protect earnings against interest rate 
risk 
talman home federal savings amp loan association a chicago thrift 
with 63 billion in assets and tcf financial banking and savings 
of minneapolis with 52 billion in assets learned the hard way 
that venturing too far from their roots is risky 
talman started out with the traditional focus of mortgage 
lending but chairman theodore h roberts said its problems began 
after acquiring four troubled sampls at the urging of federal 
regulators which were heavily involved in commercial real estate 
the company has since gotten back on its feet with the help of 
about 200 million in federal assistance 
roberts said all problem assets have since been disposed of 
along with about 20 unprofitable branches and the thrift has become 
plain vanilla again 
the secret of success is just to go back to basics and do what 
the thrift charter intended us to do which is to take in personal 
savings and intermediate those savings into single family home 
loans roberts said 
tcf formerly known as twin city federal savings amp loan 
association got into trouble after setting up a bigtime lending 
operation national properties inc in new york more than five 
years ago it had planned to make money by funneling the savings of 
thrifty minnesotans into eastern real estate ventures but wound up 
with about 100 million in loan losses 
we made most of the classic mistakes that were made in the 
industry said william cooper tcf chairman and chief executive 
officer 
three years ago a new management team led by cooper began 
reshuffling tcfs loan portfolio and closing unprofitable branches 
tcf revived its nearly dormant mortgage lending operation and found 
a comfortable niche in consumer finance 
we capitalized off our roots and diversified but into the kinds 
of things that sampls tend to do well which is retail banking 
cooper said 
bert ely an alexandria va thrift consultant said thrifts 
often do well in finding the proper niche theyve got to be 
somewhat like the gourmet delicatessen so to speak or the shop 
that sells clothing for tall men 
columbia savings amp loan of beverly hills calif had found a 
comfortable and very profitable niche in junk bonds with the 
highyield highrisk securities making up about a quarter of its 
11 billion in assets 
while the volatile junk market is not considered a traditional 
safe haven for thrifts columbia beat the odds through good 
management analysts said 
the key is theyve brought sufficient expertise aboard said 
henry s peltz a thrift analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods a new 
york securities firm they have their own underwriting investment 
department they dont take anybody elses word for it

given normal precipitation as winter fades 
away farmers will take to the fields this spring hoping for bumper 
crops good prices and smiles at the bank just in case of hail or a 
summer dry spell 
just about everywhere though lurks the memory of last years 
heat and drought that caused billions of dollars in losses to crops 
and livestock 
many farmers who had successfully survived the farm financial 
turbulence of the mid1980s faced a new challenge in 1988 as their 
crops withered in the fields says an agriculture department 
report some farmers were fortunate enough to have large crop 
inventories from the previous season and could sell them at 
droughtinduced higher prices 
others made extensive use of irrigation and harvested good crops 
at substantially higher prices 
but there were others who had no stored grain no irrigation and 
not much chance of convincing lenders that the 1988 drought was just 
a glitch and that times were bound to get better in 1989 or 1990 
the staff report by the departments economic research service 
estimated that without drought relief some 20000 to 30000 of the 
nations 550000 commercial farmers those with annual sales of 
40000 or more suffered losses that put their longterm survival 
at risk 
as it was congress passed the 39 billion disaster assistance 
act to help hardhit farmers that law and its relief programs will 
likely reduce the core problem group by half and leave 10000 to 
20000 shaky farms the report said 
most of the farms hurt most by drought losses are in the northern 
great plains corn belt and great lakes areas 
higher prices for the big grain inventories kept the cash income 
of farmers nationally at a nearrecord level in 1988 despite 
drought and lower yields 
cash income in 1989 is expected to fall somewhat because 
farmers likely will replenish inventories will receive fewer 
government payuments because of higher commodity prices and 
consistent with increased planting will incur somewhat larger 
expenses the report said 
nonetheless it added the farm sector will be in a 
stronger financial position in 1989 and possibly 1990 because the 
drought lowered burdensome stockpiles especially corn while 
strengthening commodity prices 
the drought of 1988 was a major event for agriculture with crop 
and livestock losses at around 13 billion in dollars of 1982 buying 
power those losses amounted to only about 03 percent of the 
nations real gross national product or the total value of all 
goods and services produced last year the report said 
in specific areas however the effects of the 1988 drought were 
much more disheartening 
the report included findings on five severely hit areas of 
montana north dakota wisconsin illinois and ohio here are 
descriptions of these areas and capsule summaries of the drought

a government report of a jump in inflation and a warning from the 
federal reserve about higher interest rates unnerved the stock and 
bond markets 
the labor department reported wednesday that consumer prices 
jumped 06 percent in january the fastest rise in two years and 
twice the 03 percent increases of november and december 
the government said prices rose not only in the volatile food and 
energy categories but also for a variety of other goods and 
services 
the latest increase translates to an annual inflation rate of 72 
percent in 1987 and 1988 inflation grew at a moderate 44 percent 
pace 
fed chairman alan greenspan pointed to the consumer price surge 
and restated an earlier warning that if price pressures are not 
brought under control inflation will advance and intensify a 
recession 
the fed has been trying to keep the economy from overheating by a 
series of credittightening moves that have pushed shortterm 
interest rates up about 3 percentage points since last march 
even in advance of wednesdays report worries about inflation 
were intensified by evidence that the economy entered 1989 with 
strong momentum and by a sharp 1 percent jump in wholesale prices 
during january 
economists predicted the fed would respond to the latest consumer 
price figures by swiftly driving interest rates even higher 
greenspan who testified for a second day before congress 
indicated the credit tightening would continue until the fed was 
satisfied the economy had slowed enough to lessen inflationary 
pressures 
on wall street the inflation numbers and greenspans remarks 
gave the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks its worst day in 
three months the index skidded 4250 to 228393 while declining 
stocks outnumbered gainers by 4to1 on the new york stock exchange 
the credit markets also responded negatively to the news the 
treasurys closelywatched 30year bond fell about 625 for every 
1000 in face value its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price jumped to 912 percent from late tuesdays 
905 percent 
gold and silver futures advanced modestly in reaction to the 
consumer price report 
president bushs chief economic adviser michael boskin said 
wednesday the administration believed inflation developments needed 
to be monitored closely with swift action taken if it appears that 
inflation is accelerating 
we will not tolerate a rise in inflation boskin said in an 
appearance before the joint economic committee of congress 
boskin stressed that it would be wrong to read too much into one 
months inflation figure 
in another report wednesday the government said it posted a 28

meanwhile was up 314 percent from january 1988 to 866 billion

workers at bostons hotels are eager to improve 
their living conditions through a unique union contract provision 
but their use of the unions new housing fund is on hold because it 
apparently violates federal law 
business and labor leaders alike hailed the affordable housing 
trust fund adopted in december by bostons hotel management and the 
aflcios local hotel and restaurant workers union as part of the 
workers contract 
labor advocates say substandard housing conditions are as 
unacceptable as inadequate health care and that union aid is long 
overdue especially in expensive housing markets such as bostons 
the plan also has been touted as a potential boon for 
hardtostaff businesses based in pricey resort areas like 
massachusetts marthas vineyard or aspen colo 
but the groundbreaking fund has sparked concern that it violates 
federal labor law 
lawmakers in washington are considering whether to legalize the 
housing fund under the labor restrictions contained in the 
labormanagement relations act of 1947 
the legislation known as the tafthartley act was initiated 
chiefly to prevent union kickbacks by specifying exactly what kinds 
of joint unionmanagement funds may be established 
the law has to catch up to the times said bruce marx the 
local unions housing director we have to pick up the slack for 
the reduction in the federal governments involvement in housing 
and yet the law makes it illegal for unions and management to 
cooperate 
boston union leaders last year proposed the fund to help workers 
afford the citys housing the leaders envisioned building housing 
with the fund or subsidizing mortgages down payments and rental 
deposits 
in a recent survey 98 percent of the citys hotel workers 
reported they could not afford to buy a mediumpriced home while 78 
percent said the couldnt rent an average apartment marx said 
recent figures show the median cost of a home in boston is about 
177200 while the average hotel workers annual salary is 16000 
resolved to bridge the housing affordability gap labor leaders 
negotiated up to a december strike deadline before securing the 
unprecedented housing fund 
the threeyear agreement requires hotels to funnel 1 million 
into the housing trust which will be combined with 12 million in 
union pension funds earmarked for upgrading workers accommodations 
hotel managers initially were reluctant to adopt the fund but 
reconsidered when it became apparent that housing was a top priority 
for most of the 3000 union workers said peter van kleek president 
and chief executive officer for saunders hotel co inc which 
operates three large boston hotels 
our reaction in the final analysis was that we want to respond 
to those issues which the workers feel are important he said 
nevertheless van kleek predicted the fund could run into trouble 
on capitol hill 
there have been any number of efforts over the years to reopen 
tafthartley and there is im sure a whole shopping list of items 
people would like to see included he said i suspect there 
might be some controversy 
but richard ferlauto a director at the american affordable 
housing institute said housing has become a critical concern 
nationwide the housing fund is thus likely to gain bipartisan 
support in congress where lawmakers are expected to set the labor 
policy agenda in coming weeks he said 
we happen to think that housing benefits will be the new 
collective bargaining benefit of the 1990s much like day care was 
the cutting edge issue in the 1980s said ferlauto whose new 
brunswick njbased institute is affiliated with rutgers 
university 
labor activists are pushing for an amendment to current federal 
law before june 1990 at which time the money being set aside for 
housing will revert to the unions health and welfare fund if no 
such legislation has been passed

unisys corp which last week promised to 
trim its work force by 3 percent in 1989 has effectively met its 
goal by laying off 1700 employees at 60 us locations in a major 
restructuring 
in addition to the us layoffs the company said wednesday from 
its headquarters in suburban blue bell that it will close a 
component assembly plant in nogales mexico at a cost of 400 jobs 
obviously this is a major restructuring that has brought us 
essentially into the range where we told people we wanted to be for 
1989 said j peter hynes a unisys spokesman 
the move comes on the heels of last weeks announcement by unisys 
chairman w michael blumenthal that the computer giant planned to 
reduce its work force of 93000 by 3 percent this year or about 
2800 people and cut more than 500 million from its inventories by 
midyear 
about 190 employees at the companys headquarters were laid off 
wednesday and about 400 more will lose their jobs at the end of 
july when the company consolidates a computerdesign group at the 
headquarters with a larger division in roseville minn unisys said 
the action this week was just the latest move in unisys employee 
cutbacks 
since burroughs corps 48 billion takeover of sperry created 
unisys in 1986 the company has pared 18000 from its payroll 
through sales of operations and 12000 more through early 
retirements and layoffs not counting the layoffs announced 
wednesday 
hynes said only a small number of the affected employees 
would be transferred or rehired 
hynes said all employees released this week will receive six 
weeks pay in addition to a severance package all also are eligible 
for job counseling he said 
hynes said earlier that about 900 of unisys 68000 us 
employees have been offered early retirement so far this year 
on tuesday unisys introduced a longawaited line of mainframe 
computers designed by the engineering group in blue bell the new 
2200 series will replace the companys 1100 line the products 
release was delayed by several months hurting sales as customers 
postponed purchases until the new line was available 
blumenthal acknowledged last week that it had been a tougher 
year than anticipated and that he expected a weakness in sales to 
continue in the first half of 1989 
sales in 1988 increased 2 percent from 1987 to 99 billion 
although unisys profits rose about 18 percent in 1988 most of the 
increase was attributable to lower tax rates not bigger profit 
margins the companys operating profits slumped by nearly 
onequarter in the final quarter of 1988 
at a recent meeting with wall street analysts senior executives 
said they expected results from the first three months of 1989 to be 
poor with no revenue growth largely because of the bottoming 
of the 1100 product cycle 
the second quarter will improve as the new computer line starts 
kicking in revenue while the third and fourth quarters will be 
exceptional they said

the federal reserve board says it has directed 
its examiners to closely scrutinize banks involvement in leveraged 
buyouts warning they have the potential to raise the level of 
risk in bank loan portfolios 
the fed which regulates bank holding companies including the 
nations largest banking firms said wednesday that lending in 
leveraged buyouts or lbos is not considered inappropriate so 
long as it is conducted in a sound and prudent manner 
however it cautioned that banking organizations involvement in 
lbos which have mushroomed over the last year could have 
significant implications for the quality of their asset portfolios 
and their overall levels of risk exposure 
in an lbo an investment group borrows heavily in order to take 
over a company or a division of a company often lbos are proposed 
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover the companys new 
owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to pay 
back loans 
the danger according to the federal reserve memorandum is that 
the high debt levels can place heavy demands on a borrowers cash 
flow and reduce the borrowers ability to absorb the effects of 
unanticipated financial shocks or economic adversity 
the board said examiners should review a banks overall exposure 
to risk by involvement in lbo lending as well as the soundness of 
individual lbo loans 
any significant portfolio risks need to be identified and 
brought to the attention of senior management and the directors 
it said 
the fed also warned that banks which participate by lending money 
in lbos arranged by other firms should independently evaluate the 
deals before advancing any money 
the boards memorandum to examiners released wednesday was 
dated feb 16 it supersedes lbo guidelines issued in june 1984 the 
new instructions also apply to other socalled highly leveraged 
transactions including stock buybacks financed by high levels of 
debt 
the office of the comptroller of the currency an arm of the 
treasury department that regulates nationallychartered banks 
issued similar instructions to its regulators in december 
meanwhile a half dozen congressional committees are examining 
ways to curb the buyout boom but have been unable to agree on an 
approach that wouldnt cut tax revenues or have other unintended ill 
effects

like foxes guarding the chicken coop some culprits in the 
savings and loan industry collapse may have been hired by the 
federal government to oversee billions of dollars in assets of 
failed thrifts the associated press has learned 
two officials of failed thrifts who became regulators are now 
targets of criminal investigations and a federal prosecutor says 
hes thinks there will be more 
most of the people hired to handle the billions of dollars worth 
of property and loans seized from failed thrifts are honest 
officials said yet they expect to find more bad apples 
i would not be surprised to see one or two instances of that 
emerging as the justice departments bank fraud task force 
proceeds said us attorney marvin collins of dallas 
a longtime savings industry official agreed i would imagine 
there would be one or two others when you hire 800 people maybe 80 
or 50 or 30 people some percentage that drops over the line the 
official said speaking on the condition of anonymity it will 
take a long time before it all gets out 
collins said fraud may be continuing in the thrifts themselves 
some people feel they can take advantage because the system is 
currently overloaded by investigations said collins whos been 
working on sampl fraud since the mid1980s well be very attentive 
to them 
the federal home loan bank board hired as many as 800 people a 
high percentage of them from failed sampls without performing 
background checks government and industry officials said 
when employees of failed thrifts are hired as regulators 
thats a risk sure acknowledged bank board spokesman bill 
fulwider 
still he added the assumption is its generally not their 
fault the institution went down they understand the assets and 
they have expertise thats valuable 
two cases illustrate the pitfalls 
philip s noons was hired by the federal savings amp loan insurance 
corp in april 1986 after mainland savings a houston highflier 
suspected of widespread fraud was declared insolvent noons had 
been a project manager at mainland and he went to fslic managing 
mainland assets 
on feb 8 the fbi arrested noons and his 31yearold twin 
brother thomas and charged them with conspiring to embezzle money 
from the fslic by grossly undervaluing mainland loans acquired by 
the fslic and then selling them to two houston companies on behalf 
of themselves 
one package of 16 loans was valued by philip noons at 1500 
prosecutors said while the fslic said the package is actually worth 
16 million in another case the brothers paid 692821 for a loan 
worth 4 million the fbi said 
the noonses attorney david berg says that his clients are 
innocent and that the government has overreacted and overstated the 
amounts involved because of pressure for sampl action following 
president bushs new plan neither brother was implicated in any 
wrongdoing while at mainland berg said 
regulators have also drawn fire for the hiring of stuart jones a 
former real estate loan officer for richardson savings amp loan 
association 
jones was hired in october as deputy director of the bank board 
in charge of disposing of the agencys massive real estate 
portfolio despite criminal referrals to the fbi about his conduct 
at richardson officials said 
in december when officials in washington learned about the 
request for an fbi probe made by dallas regulators jones was 
transferred to a post that does not handle selling assets fulwider 
said the investigation continues he said 
despite those two cases and suspicions of others regulators say 
they do not believe they have a significant problem 
until these two instances surfaced for all the rapid buildup 
it seems to have worked pretty well fulwider said out of 
several hundred people who have been added throughout the bank board 
staff we dont seem to have encountered any real problems in terms 
of numbers 
but the bank board may not be aware of the full extent of the 
problem according to collins when the justice department task 
force uncovers evidence against an sampl official now working for 
regulators it cant tip off the agency because of confidentiality 
laws 
a private attorney specializing in bank fraud told the ap of a 
case he encountered where a former sampl official was hired by the 
government to handle repossessed properties even though he has a 
financial interest in some of the properties a probable 
conflictofinterest violation 
as many people as they had and as many problems as they had i 
wouldnt believe thats the only problem said the attorney a 
former whitecollar crime prosecutor who asked not to be named 
because the incident involved a confidential attorneyclient 
relationship 
as the sampl industry was deregulated and highflying thrifts took 
off into speculative and sometimes fraudulent endeavors federal 
regulators found their agencies grossly understaffed and unable to 
keep up 
by the mid1980s a hiring push was approved and the federal 
home loan bank board found itself needing not only examiners but 
also realestate and banking experts who could help handle the giant 
portfolios the government was seizing 
the people with experience and available for hire were the ones 
who had worked at the failed thrifts 
until august 1986 they were hired under schedule b a government 
program that waives background checks to speed up the process 
fulwider said after that the bank board contracted with an agency 
to check new hires for criminal records checks have never been done 
retroactively 
the bank board made 6000 criminal referrals to the fbi from 
insolvent thrifts asking the bureau to look into specific 
transactions and individuals 
the collapse of the sampl industry is expected to cost some 100 
billion to resolve a large portion of that cost officials have 
said results from mismanagement and outright fraud by sampl 
executives

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said today the fed will make it easier for bank holding companies to 
buy troubled savings and loans and he suggested that a specialized 
thrift industry may not be needed in the future 
greenspan in testimony submitted to the senate banking 
committee also said the fed has made arrangements to support the 
federal home loan bank system in the event of runs on sampls 
the committee was holding its second day of hearings on president 
bushs plan to rescue the ailing industry by selling 50 billion in 
bonds to raise the money to close insolvent institutions 
some analysts have said the presidents plan wont provide enough 
money but greenspan said that in our judgment all things 
considered the 50 billion should be adequate to take care of 470 
insolvent sampls 
investment from outside the thrift industry from banks and other 
firms likely will be needed in order for the thrift industry to 
meet the new capital standards that the administration is proposing 
analysts have said greenspan said more than a majority of 
thrifts that are not insolvent will be able to meet the new 
capital requirements 
the central bank chairman also said he attaches considerable 
importance to a proposed treasury department study of the deposit 
insurance system he said the study should help ensure a smooth 
transition to modified insurance arrangements 
part of the study should include whether it is unnecessary to 
provide special government subsidized facilities for mortgage 
lending greenspan said in the future it may be possible to 
bring all the depository institutions under one regulatory and 
supervisory system he suggested 
he told the committee it is vitally important for congress to 
move very promptly to consider and enact the presidents proposals 
congressional leaders say an attempt by bush to keep the rescue 
plan from inflating the shortterm federal deficit will add billions 
of dollars to the eventual cost 
bush wants to pay for part of the rescue by selling 50 billion 
in offbudget bonds over the next three years through a special 
governmentsponsored corporation that way the government could 
spend 50 billion that would not show up on the books as part of the 
budget deficit 
senate banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich 
said wednesday that figures compiled by his staff show the 
offbudget mechanism will cost the government an additional 46 
billion over 30 years 
meanwhile james blum acting director of the congressional 
budget office told the house ways and means committee that the 
administrations plan would boost the governments interest payments 
by 100 million to 200 million a year 
but treasury secretary nicholas f brady vigorously defended the 
arrangement wednesday before riegles committee which conducted the 
first congressional hearing on the 2weekold plan 
brady acknowledged that the bailout could be financed onbudget 
through regular longterm treasury borrowing but said that would be 
at a cost of one less trident submarine or no day care 
brady also was sharply questioned about whether the 
administration is proposing a big enough rescue to put the industry 
on a sound footing he said that not only would the plan provide 
money to close 350 insolvent institutions and meet the commitments 
on 205 failed sampls rescued last year it would provide 24 billion 
from 1992 through 1999 to handle the possible failures of another 
150 weak institutions 
riegle told reporters after wednesdays hearing that he was 
keeping an open mind but so far could find no reason to favor an 
offbudget arrangement 
if there are advantages theyre not obvious to me i think 
you start from the premise that you ought to keep the cost to a 
minimum especially when you and your folks and your neighbors are 
going to have to pay for this problem or a large part of it he 
said 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said in a 13page analysis of the bush plan that 
taxpayers would save 138 billion over 30 years if congress directly 
appropriated the sampl money 
but he conceded that would require a special tax earmarked 
solely for the purpose of financing the savings and loan bailout 
and administration policy and political reality may rule out this 
more direct approach 
riegle and the ranking republican on his panel sen jake garn 
rutah said they were introducing the 333page administration 
proposal on wednesday riegle said he hoped to have a bill ready for 
action by the full senate by the first week in april 
gonzalez despite his reservations about parts of the 
administration plan intends to introduce it in the house 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman asked 
the house ways and means committee on wednesday to extend tax breaks 
offered to private buyers of failed sampls and banks theyre set to 
expire at the end of the year 
seidman said the tax breaks reduce the onbudget cost of rescues 
and promised to use them to minimize the governments total cost 
however charles a bowsher head of the general accounting 
office said more direct assistance to failed institutions is 
cheaper blum also warned that the current system is attracting some 
buyers who are most interested in obtaining the tax breaks than in 
operating the rescued sampls efficiently

the machinists represent about 8500 mechanics baggage handlers 
and other ground personnel at miamibased eastern the union has 
threatened to strike over contract concessions demanded by texas air 
to save money at the airline which has lost hundreds of millions of 
dollars over the last several years 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said today the airlines 
negotiators believe progress has been made recently on reaching an 
accord with the pilots on a fence agreement 
easterns fence proposal to the pilots matell said 
guarantees that the airline would keep its fleet at the current 
level guarantees all pilots against layoffs and prevents easterns 
international routes from being transferred to another texas air 
subsidiary 
the pilots who are scheduled to meet with management on monday 
are seeking a contract guaranteeing their job security as well as a 
pledge from lorenzo not to sell any more eastern assets the union 
also wants management to outline a business plan for action for 
eastern and seeks the eventual merger of eastern and continental 
airlines another subsidiary of texas air 
but ron cole a spokesman for the eastern pilots union said 
today the unions negotiators werent satisfied with the companys 
fence proposal which they believe didnt provide sufficient 
guarantees 
officials of the machinists union were not available for comment 
wednesday 
eastern and the machinists have been talking for 16 months the 
union will be free to strike legally march 4 if no new contract is 
reached by then a 30day coolingoff period mandated by the 
national mediation board expires at midnight march 3 
a federal mediator began meeting wednesday in washington with 
both sides in an intensified effort to reach a settlement 
the pilots will go out on strike for pilot issues said 
wright b george another member of the pilots union council and 
chairman of the unions business committee this has nothing to do 
with the machinists if we go out it will be for pilot issues 
thats posturing for the longer term said robert joedicke 
an airline analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc referring to the 
pilots demand 
joedicke and other observers believe its unlikely that the 
hardnosed lorenzo would agree to such demands 
the pilots and machinists at eastern have no love between 
them joedicke said theyre singing out of the same hymn book 
just because of sheer fear 
pilots at major airlines have rarely supported strikes by their 
fellow unions industry observers note 
the eastern pilots officials said they have begun polling their 
membership on the strike issue and expect to have the results by 
march 2 one day before the machinists deadline 
eastern meanwhile is instructing supervisors to avoid verbal or 
physical confrontations with striking employees in the event of 
machinist walkout 
in a 26page supervisor survival kit a copy of which was 
obtained by the associated press eastern warned supervisors not to 
permit any picketers or strikers to embroil you in shouting 
matches exchanges of hostilities physical confrontations or the 
like 
if there is a strike supervisors also are told not to speak with 
the press or any outside party about the airlines strike 
planning or decisions

a new dodge sportutility vehicle and 
another jeep vehicle will be built in early 1992 at a new chrysler 
corp plant in detroit the company said thursday 
the vehicle code named the zj will be the first 
sportutility vehicle marketed by dodge dealers the company said in 
a statement it will be the only vehicle made at chryslers planned 
jefferson north plant 
the zj will be larger than the jeep cherokee now made at a 
chrysler plant in toledo ohio the statement added details of the 
vehicle will be available when production starts 
the dodge and jeep versions would be different but chrysler 
spokesman doug nicholl declined to say how 
the 1 billion jefferson north factory will replace chryslers 
current jefferson avenue plant chrysler said it expects to begin 
construction at the jefferson north complex in two months and that 
production would start in january 1992 
the new plant with two shifts operating will have a production 
capacity of about 200000 vehicles a year by 1993 nicholl said 
chrysler now makes the plymouth horizon and the dodge omni at the 
jefferson avenue plant a production decision involving those two 
cars beyond 1992 has not been made 
the no 3 automaker said it is putting the new sportutility 
vehicle at the jefferson north plant because of growing demand in 
that segment of the light truck market and because the toledo plant 
was at full production levels

a federal judge has refused to quash grand jury 
subpoenas issued to three traders in the probe of commodities 
trading practices ruling that it is too soon to decide questions 
about investigators methods 
attorneys for the traders contend their clients should not be 
forced to testify or hand over documents because evidence against 
them came from tape recordings obtained improperly by fbi 
investigators 
us district judge john grady rejected the argument in a ruling 
released wednesday attorneys for the traders who are identified 
only as john doe traders 1 and 2 and jane doe trader 1 said they 
would appeal 
the ruling was the first public document detailing legal 
maneuvers in the federal probe into suspected illegal trading 
activities at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile 
exchange 
grady said he couldnt rule on the propriety of the 
taperecordings unless he knew what questions prosecutors planned to 
ask the traders during grand jury proceedings 
it would be difficult to ascertain whether those questions are 
based upon electronic surveillance he wrote and if so 
whether they are based upon illegal as opposed to legal electronic 
surveillance 
grady placed a weeklong stay on subpoenas requiring the three 
traders to appear before the grand jury to allow them to appeal his 
ruling attorneys for the traders said they would appeal 
susan bogart who filed the motion for the traders said she was 
pleased grady recognizes the difficult and interesting question 
concerning the unlawfulness of the wiretaps 
the chicago tribune reported today that mounting paperwork 
including the task of transcribing voluminous tape recordings will 
delay plans to bring charges in the case until late march 
citing unnamed sources the newspaper reported that the 
government was trying for early indictments to pressure suspects to 
cooperate 
the investigation first disclosed in january focuses on 
allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of 
millions of dollars in executing their orders to buy and sell 
futures contracts for commodities ranging from soybeans to swiss 
francs

the us bankruptcy judge overseeing the 
future of public service company of new hampshire proposed 
auctioning off the insolvent utility still swamped in debt from the 
stalled seabrook nuclear power plant 
judge james yacos made the surprising suggestion wednesday during 
the first day of a hearing on the direction of the utilitys 
complex 13monthold bankruptcy case 
i realize this is coming out of left field yacos said after 
raising the auction idea with steven davis president of a 
bondholders group that is a major player in the reorganization the 
biggest by an investorowned utility since the depression 
yacos asked davis who was the first witness at the hearing 
whether it would be feasible to establish a set of terms and 
conditions that all bidders would have to meet 
davis replied that yacos idea could work but only if there 
first is agreement on what electricity rates the reorganized or 
boughtout public service will be allowed to charge 
the auction procedure you have outlined could be very valuable 
and useful provided rate levels are set beforehand davis told 
the judge 
differences among the state the utility and its creditors on 
appropriate rates already have turned the reorganization into a 
bitter and potentially lengthy ordeal 
in testimony today an executive of a utility hoping to buy 
public services nonseabrook assets warned against being too 
specific in setting terms for bids to settle the bankruptcy 
im very concerned that if we overly structure the process 
well end up undervaluing the outcome said robert busch senior 
vice president for finance of connecticutbased northeast utilities 
busch said bids submitted without a formal structure could be 
compared with one another adequately though that wouldnt be easy 
in debt from its 36 percent share of seabrook and barred by state 
law from charging ratepayers for the reactor before it operates 
commercially public service sought bankruptcy protection on jan 
28 1988 
settlement talks among new hampshire officials the utility and 
its creditors broke off in december and public service filed a 
reorganization proposal on dec 27 under which it would seek federal 
regulation and gain higher rate increases than the state is willing 
to offer 
state officials have offered rate increases totaling 22 percent 
over five years and say the rates public service seeks would drive 
away customers and prove counterproductive public service wants the 
equivalent of a onetime increase of about 30 percent 
the utility which serves 75 percent of new hampshires 1 million 
residents is trying to get an extension of the exclusivity 
period during which it has the exclusive right to make 
restructuring proposals 
however state officials creditors and northeast utilities new 
englands largest power company oppose the extension charging 
that public service is stalling 
to reach a decision yacos said this court has to know whether 
there are real negotiations going on and whether they are going 
anywhere 
northeast utilities already has announced a bid for public 
service which says about a dozen other companies also have 
expressed interest new england electric system of massachusetts is 
the only one to have said so far that it plans to bid too 
davis president of consolidated utilities amp communications inc 
was called to the witness stand by public services chief bankruptcy 
lawyer richard levin with banking giant citicorp consolidated 
owns key public service thirdmortgage bonds 
davis testified for four hours on whether the judge should let 
creditors and other parties start filing reorganization proposals 
buyouts or otherwise to compete with the proposal public service 
filed dec 27 
since filing its restructuring plan public service has said it 
was continuing negotiations with consolidated and other creditors 
but state officials refused to join the talks saying the company 
and its creditors were not being realistic in their demands 
davis disclosed wednesday that talks with the company on rates 
broke off during the first week of february 
that particular effort is not going forward davis told 
levin he said another meeting was held thursday on other matters 
but he declined to elaborate saying the participants have agreed to 
confidentiality davis said no further talks are scheduled

when christopher whittle and friends from the 
university of tennessee teamed nearly 20 years ago to publish 
magazines the dapper doctors son who wore bow ties was drafted to 
court the advertisers 
he was an absolutely superb salesman recalls wilma jordan a 
former whittle colleague who now runs an investment banking firm 
besides she said whittles flair was just what the young 
publishers needed for calling on conservative clients 
at 41 whittle still wears the bow ties he also has sold some of 
the nations biggest advertising clients on his company which has 
expanded beyond magazines into a 150 million business recognized as 
an industry innovator 
its 44 properties range from magazines to videos to wallboards 
which resemble miniature billboards with a mix of brief articles and 
ads hung in offices and schools 
whittles latest venture is a satellitedelivered television news 
show aimed at highschoolers which hes launching in early march 
book publishing may lie ahead 
he has fostered the growth by arguing that conventional print and 
broadcast media arent delivering the audiences they once did his 
creations are designed to deliver ad messages to precisely defined 
audiences such as new mothers college students pet owners and 
travel agents 
that message has won bigname clients such as procter amp gamble 
co ralstonpurina co and warnerlambert co it also has saddled 
him with a reputation as a maverick because of his unsubtle jibes at 
magazines and television 
for instance whittle heralded special reports his glossy 
package of quarterly magazines designed for pediatricians waiting 
rooms with fullpage ads featuring this headline over a photo of a 
torn and smudged magazine page 
few things equal the special quality of magazines in a doctors 
waiting room 
whittle promised doctorsubscribers that he would send someone by 
every month to replace tattered copies but he asked them not to 
keep more than two other magazines titles in the office 
the request enraged rival publishers who count on waiting room 
readers to bolster circulation some threatened lawsuits but never 
filed any 
robert teufel president of rodale press inc which publishes 
children magazine conceded that he and other publishers have cooled 
off 
i think our reaction was to his hype he said 
so what does he think of whittle and his magazines now i think 
their products are graphically superb whittle is probably the best 
salesman in the publishing business teufel said 
whittle doesnt need compliments to know what the industry thinks 
of him hes got cash instead 40 million for himself alone when 
magazine giant time inc paid 185 million last fall for half 
interest in his company 
he has a track record the rest have hopes said reginald 
brack chief executive of times magazine group 
whittle a country doctors son born aug 23 1947 in etowah 
tenn went to the university of tennessee where he met phillip 
moffitt and others who would become his business partners 
eighteen months after his 1969 graduation he went back to 
knoxille bought a tworoom log cabin he still calls home and 
joined extennessee classmates already working on the magazine 
company 
they called it 1330 corp named after the age group they hoped 
to reach their first magazine was knoxville in a nutshell a guide 
for incoming tennessee freshmen 
after making 2000 the first year they decided they could 
multiply profits by publishing guides to other locales the costs of 
keeping as many as 115 magazines in operation at once nearly crushed 
the company 
whittle said the money crunch became so severe he once asked an 
advertiser would you mind if i go down to the finance department 
to get the check the advertiser agreed and the check paid 
whittles office phone and electric bills 
the company eventually consolidated its city guides into a single 
national magazine for college students called nutshell and began 
making money 
in 1974 whittle sold japanese automaker datsun on the idea of a 
singlesponsor magazine a twiceayear travel publication aimed at 
college students the combination has lasted 15 years although the 
cars now are called nissan 
in 1979 the company bought a controlling interest in esquire 
magazine which whittle said was losing 100000 a week at the time 
it took five years to refocus the magazine fix circulation problems 
and make it break even 
whittle decided he was spending so much time in manhattan that he 
needed a second home in 1980 he bought a fiveroom apartment in the 
dakota a sprawling building on the west side of central park where 
the late john lennon had lived whittles apartment is filled with 
paintings hes collected in the past six years mostly from the late 
1800s and early 1900s his dakota neighbors include singer roberta 
flack and actress lauren bacall 
by mid1986 the demands of esquire split whittle from his 
founding partner moffitt and they divided the company moffitt 
took esquire and whittle got the rest 
while the initial reaction was that moffitt got the best deal 
whittle saw the writing on the wall the renamed whittle 
communications lp plunged headlong into developing wallboards as 
advertising vehicles that could be displayed in school lobbies and 
gyms and doctors offices 
whittle faces a challenge in running his rapidly expanding 
company he also has expressed interest in running for political 
office one day but he insists his wealth hasnt dulled his 
innovative spirit 
the financial reward is only one reason for what i do he

car and light truck sales by the nations big 
three automakers dropped 04 percent in midfebruary compared wiith 
a year earlier the companies said thursday 
the big three said gains in truck sales were offset by losses in 
automobile sales 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp reported 
they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34580 during 
the feb 1120 period compared with a rate of 34718 during the 
same 1988 period 
car sales by the big three dropped 32 percent to an average of 
21507 a day from a 22209 daily average in midfebruary last year 
truck sales meanwhile jumped 45 percent to an average of 
13072 a day compared with a 12509 a year ago 
car sales during january and february 1988 were strong due to 
incentives after a big surge in late december last year sales have 
been running below last years pace but thursdays figures showed a 
narrowing of that gap 
so far in 1989 the big three have sold cars and trucks at a pace 
49 percent slower than a year ago car sales showed a big downturn 
dropping 84 percent and truck sales have shown a modest upturn 
rising 15 percent 
chrysler showed a big dip falling 185 percent during the period 
this year the nations no 3 automaker said its average daily sales 
rate for cars fell to 2960 compared with 3630 last year car 
sales for 1989 at chrysler were 151 percent below the rate through

us business failures declined 66 percent in 
1988 over the previous year the largest annual drop in a decade 
dun amp bradstreet corp reported thursday 
the businessinformation company said 57098 businesses went 
under last year compared with 61111 in 1987 
the significant decline in failures underscores the continued 
strength of the economy now in its seventh year of expansion 
said joseph w duncan chief economist for dun amp bradstreet 
the nations weakest regions are showing improvements while 
those areas that led the expansion are holding their own he said 
the dun amp bradstreet survey said failures were down in six of the 
nations nine census regions with only the middle atlantic states 
reporting a significant increase in business failures 
the decline in failures was especially notable in states with 
agriculture and oilbased economies according to the survey 
among oil businesses failures were down or flat in seven of the 
nine major sectors agriculture failures dropped 516 percent to 
1823 from 3766 and failures in the mining sector which includes 
oil and gas extraction were down 212 percent to 494 from 627 
the dramatic decrease in agricultural failures in 1988 is 
attributable to the surge in failures in early 1987 as farmers took 
advantage of the new chapter 12 bankruptcy code duncan said 
chapter 12 allows troubled family farmers to reorganize their 
debts while being protected from their creditors 
the report also found that retail failures decreased 61 percent 
to 11488 from 12240 and services bankruptcies were down 47 
percent to 22686 from 23802 
manufacturing failures were down 16 percent to 4204 while 
wholesale trade failures increased 27 percent to 4455 
construction failures were essentially unchanged at 6791

bally manufacturing corp has canceled a proposed 
restructuring because of opposition by new jersey gaming officials 
to a spinoff of its casinohotel operations 
bally had announced in october a plan to make its four casinos 
two in atlantic city nj and two in nevada a separate publicly 
owned company bally had proposed to retain a 15 percent stake in 
the new firm 
but in a preliminary opinion issued wednesday the gaming 
enforcement division of the new jersey attorney generals office 
objected to the plan it did not disclose its reasons 
were not going ahead with the plan because of new jerseys 
opposition bally spokesman william peltier said 
anthony parrillo director of new jerseys gaming enforcement 
division said the opinion would not be made public unless bally 
pursued the matter before the state casino control commission 
parrillo did say his office believed the spinoff would leave 
ballys atlantic city casinohotels financially weakened 
the chicago tribune quoted an unidentified source saying the 
divisions principle objection was that the casinohotels would have 
to take on more debt as part of the spinoff plan 
the spinoff would have left bally with a healthclub chain the 
aladdins castle videoarcade chain and three companies that 
manufacture fitness lottery and gaming equipment bally sold its 
pinball and videogame manufacturing operations last year

after a 22month investigation the state 
thursday fined six cooking oil wholesalers more than 1 million for 
allegedly diluting and mislabeling corn oil 
richard mcguire commissioner of the state agriculture and 
markets department said the companies mixed cheaper soy oil with 
corn oil and then labeled the products pure corn oil 
he said the state assessed 1021997 in penalties from the 
firms four of which are based in new york and two in new jersey 
the case of a seventh firm procter amp gamble co is being 
handled by state attorney general robert abrams mcguire said 
a state officials said the oil appeared on grocery store shelves 
under brand names and store brands but he didnt specify which ones 
state investigators conducted the oil probe by collecting samples 
from grocery stores and warehouses the state also subpoenaed 
records and officials of oil manufacturers and distributors mcguire 
said 
an analysis revealed widespread economic adulteration of corn 
oil he said 
soy oil is a fine healthy food product mcguire said the 
incentive for this fraud was purely economic at the time soy oil 
was considerably less expensive than corn oil 
the largest penalty 669007 was assessed to cbs food products 
corp of brooklyn manager bob green said the company will challenge 
the penalty 
the other firms and penalties were oasis trading co hillside 
nj 216740 supreme oil co englewood nj 130260 garden

gov evan bayh signing his first bill into 
law approved a measure thursday that will give indianabased 
companies a new defense against hostile takeover attempts 
bayh signed senate bill 255 during a brief ceremony attended by 
legislative leaders 
the measure backed by many of indianas largest companies swept 
through the general assembly in less than one month winning its 
first committee approval on jan 31 clearing the senate on a 472 
vote and being approved by the house on a 935 vote 
sb 255 which is effective retroactively to the end of january 
expands on a section of indianas historic 1986 antitakeover law 
the measure states that boards of directors when considering 
buyout bids can weigh factors other than getting the topdollar 
price for shareholders the new law says that directors can also 
weigh the interests of constituents such as employees suppliers 
customers and the communities in which the companies are located 
i think its appropriate that the boards of directors take into 
account the interests of the people of indiana and not just the wall 
street brokers said bayh a democrat who took office jan 9 
indianas 1986 antitakeover law has been copied by other states 
since its adoption and a 1987 us supreme court decision upholding 
the law and a states attempt to protect its own companies 
however indianabased companies decided the 1986 statute needed 
strengthening after courts in delaware which has a similar law 
ruled last year that shareholders interest in getting the best 
return on their investments should be a boards primary standard in 
evaluating takeover bids 
the measure had the support of both cummins engine co and arvin 
industries two columbusbased corporations a british company 
currently owns almost 10 percent of cummins stock and an indonesian 
company announced recently it has purchased 56 percent of arvins 
stock

aided in part by lower labor costs and an improved marketing 
strategy

from 2455 million in the same 1987 quarter fourthquarter revenue 
rose 114 percent to 8399 million from 7539 million a year

stabilization and improvement of our principal subsidiary pan 
american world airways pan am chairman thomas g plaskett said in 
a statement 
he said the airline is now realizing benefits of lower labor 
costs had a yearend cash position of around 290 million has

product 
but plaskett said the first quarter of 1989 will show a loss 
greater than the 1988 first quarter pan am lost 833 million in 
that period 
the increased loss results from a combination of higher 
expensesas well as lower revenue resulting principally from a 
traffic shortfall in our atlantic division he said

to merge with another airline to ensure its survival the statement 
sent the companys stock soaring on the new york stock exchange

a halfdozen schools are each getting 50000 in 
television equipment in exchange for their participation in whittle 
communications lps test next month of channel one a commercial 
news program for teenagers 
the project represents the knoxville tennbased media companys 
first venture in satellitedelivered television and it has raised 
concerns among some educators about the propriety of allowing paid 
advertising into classrooms 
but if the test proves successful whittle chairman christopher 
whittle hopes to take the project into 8000 or more schools in the 
fall of 1990 at a cost in hardware alone of more than 100 million 
he said the project was designed to enable schools to obtain a 
sophisticated television system they may not otherwise be able to 
afford while giving students a useful embellishment to their daily 
education 
whittle said he hopes to sign advertisers to longterm 
commitments to the news program in exchange for getting product 
exclusivity on the network and the ability to reach a teenage 
audience that has often proven elusive 
the program will be produced each weekday in los angeles and 
beamed via satellite to the participating schools in time for the 
principal to review it schools are expected to run the program once 
each schoolday although school officials have the right not to air 
it if they find something objectionable 
whittle plans to assemble a news staff of about 100 if the 
project is taken national and he has already sent a crew to the 
soviet union to do a series on a day in the life of a soviet 
teenager 
a pilot of the 12minute program which includes four 30second 
commercial spots ran like this 
news headlines in which an announcer reads several brief stories 
accompanied by purchased film footage to illustrate it 
a focus piece produced by the channel one staff on someone 
interesting to teens such as an interview with the daughter of an 
american hostage in lebanon 
following a oneminute commercial break another channel 
oneproduced segment of a weekly fivepart series on topics such as 
environmental pollution 
a pop quiz poses a question and following another commercial 
break provides the answer

music video with historical scenes from the life of the rev martin

the soviet union has bought an additional 
400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the wheat was part of a jan 25 authorization of more than 2 
million tons under the export enhancement program or eep said 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service 
he said the wheat is for shipment for march counting some left 
over from a previous eep arrangement and the jan 25 authorization 
the soviets have more than 101 million tons still available under 
the program 
with the latest sale the soviet union has bought about 3 million 
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a longterm supply 
agreement which was extended last fall to run through dec 31 1990 
a metric tons is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 400000 tons are equal to about 147 million bushels 
worth around 60 million at recent us farm prices of 408 per 
bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also 
included about 102 million tons of corn along with 450000 tons of 
soybeans 14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of 
grain sorghums 
goldthwait said 300000 tons of wheat were sold by louis dreyfus

the companies will get subsidies of 2206 per ton or about 60 
cents per bushel under the eep arrangement

venezuela has suspended capital 
payments on about 5 billion in privatesector debt owed to creditor 
banks mainly in the united states according to a published report 
thursday 
the decision which affects 472 million in principal due this 
year was called unprecedented by the independent newspaper el 
nacional 
there was no immediate official confirmation of the decision and 
the newspaper did not provide a source for the information 
bankers and businessmen had mixed reactions to the report but 
said it did not come as a surprise 
privatesector debt was being paid off in an eightyear period 
dating from 1986 at preferential rates granted by the venezuelan 
government one businessman said 
i dont think anyone expected the debt to be recognized at 
preferential rates over the whole eightyear period said the 
businessman owner of an electric parts plant who did not want his 
name used 
but it will hurt some people who have not paid off the debt in 
full he added 
the decision would add to the suspension in january of capital 
repayments totaling more than 204 billion owed by the public 
sector to foreign banks 
venezuelas total foreign debt of 33 billion is latin americas 
fourth largest after brazil mexico and argentina venezuela 
recently began talks with its creditors to define new repayment 
terms 
suspension of principal payments on both the private and public 
sectors foreign debts affects a total of 2 billion due this year 
the newspaper reported 
a representative for an international bank said the decision 
would create real problems for international bankers 
the initial decision was a signed and sealed agreement well 
have to start all over now said the banker who asked not to be 
named 
he said he expected a new refinancing of the private sector debt 
to include some sort of subsidy otherwise many companies would be 
forced into bankruptcy 
as of january 1987 the private sectors debt totaled 497 
billion capital payments for 1989 represented 95 percent of that 
total the newspaper said 
venezuelas privatesector foreign debt had been paid off 
regularly over the past few years and the suspension ordered by the 
social democratic government implies a radical change in the 
nations strategy with its creditors according to el nacional 
besides suspending amortization on the private sectors debt 
the government will demand this debt be granted the same treatment 
to be accorded for the public sectors debt the report said 
that would represent a repayment period of 20 years up from 
eight begining in 1987 six to seven years of grace and 
rescheduling of interest payments 
a greater problem according to many business leaders is what to 
do about some 68 billion in letters of credit owed to financial 
institutions 
the government says the imf is only willing to grant fresh 
money if the letters of credit are paid off at free market rates 
but we see it as a violation of the rules we were operating under 
we never asked for those rules said a business representative 
the letters of credit were granted to businesses at preferential 
rates but negotiations between venezuela and the international 
monetary fund are trying to determine which of those letters of 
credit must be paid back at free market rates as part of the imfs 
austerity program 
a team of venezuelan negotiators are scheduled to travel to the 
united states on sunday including central bank president pedro 
tinoco planning minister miguel rodriguez and finance minister 
eglee iturbe to sign a letter of intent with the imf for fresh 
loans said press accounts 
contingent on the signing with the imf will be additional funds 
forthcoming from the central bank of spain and the us federal 
reserve worth some 11 billion to prop up venezuelas reserves 
depleted to just 15 billion dollars in operative money said el 
nacional

wiring problems in two more jetliners have been 
reported by a boeing co customer and the plane manufacturer says 
it is studying possible changes in its assembly line to address the 
matter 
air canada discovered the latest wiring mixups on two of its 
boeing 767 passenger jets boeing passed the reports on to the 
federal aviation administration last week 
boeing confirmed on wednesday that the repeated wiring mishaps 
have prompted the company to start an engineering study in an effort 
to prevent crossed wires and pipes in all boeing models 
there would be changes in the plugs and sockets so that for 
example an individual wire can only go into a particular socket 
boeing spokesman craig martin said 
martin said the study to modify plugs and sockets was also in 
response in part to the firesuppression wiring problems detected 
on boeing 757s as well as problems noted on other boeing aircraft 
he said company executives were supervising studies by three 
engineering teams but it was not known when changes might be made 
or what the costs might be 
boeing hopes to find an acrosstheboard solution that will 
make assembly of the units consistent and foolproof as much as 
possible martin said 
some boeing aircraft fire safety systems are colorcoded or keyed 
to prevent wrong hookups but others have identical fittings for 
different parts of the systems he said 
the air canada reports followed a flap between boeing and the faa 
over apparent delays in reporting similar wiring problems in at 
least seven other boeing aircraft since last august 
some of the mishaps were not reported by boeing until last month 
boeing officials called the delays a misunderstanding but 
changed the companys reporting procedures this week to ensure 
timely reporting said philip condit boeings executive vice 
president

a general accounting office official said 
thursday that the number of disciplinary actions taken against 
commodities traders in recent years does not necessarily indicate 
the degree of abuse at the nations biggest futures markets 
richard fogel assistant comptroller general at the gao which is 
congress auditing arm also said results of an ongoing fbi 
investigation of the chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board 
of trade may give a better idea of possible abuses in the 
commodities pits 
the federal government has subpoenaed more than 100 traders and 
brokers in connection with a sweeping undercover investigation of 
trading abuses alleged to have defrauded exchange customers of 
millions of dollars 
the gao stated the number of contracts traded at the chicago 
mercantile exchange grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in 
1988 and at the chicago board of trade from 80 million to 140 
million during the same period 
the number of traders sanctioned for violations on the floor of 
the merc rose from 13 in 1984 to 105 in 1988 while sanctions at the 
board of trade went from a low of eight in 1985 to a high of 32 in 
1986 in 1988 the board of trade sanctioned 13 floor participants 
sen bob kerrey dneb called the number of sanctions taken 
against traders pitiful given the volume of trading 
fogel said the numbers could reflect an oversight system that is 
working well or one that needs improvement because it is not 
detecting abuses or punishing offenders severely enough 
fogels testimony came at the first senate oversight hearing this 
year on the commodity futures trading commission which oversees the 
commodities markets and is up for congressional reauthorization this 
year 
the cftcs policing of commodities markets has come under fire 
from a number of critics since the federal probe was disclosed 
earlier this year 
separately wendy lee gramm chairwoman of the cftc said the 
agency has not yet responded to a request that it delay approving 
new types of futures contracts until completion of the fbi probe and 
a review of the commodities markets by the house agriculture 
committee 
gramm made her comments in response to questions from reporters 
following a speech in new york earlier this week members of the 
agriculture committee asked the agency to hold off considering 
proposals it has pending 
at the hearing fogel said mercantile exchange fines for trade 
practice abuses totaled 36 million from 1984 to 1988 for the same 
period comparable board of trade fines were 811000 
the number of members expelled on both exchanges averaged about 
two a year fogel said he said exchange officials consider 
permanent expulsion or lengthy suspensions as more severe than fines 
because they deprive members of their livelihood 
fogel said cftc officials told the gao they could not comment on 
their involvement in identifying or investigating alleged abuses 
until after any indictments stemming from the fbi probe are issued

support the dollar but we still have twin deficits and no 
resolution on that said dan holland an analyst at discount corp 
holland said traders also were concerned that the federal reserve 
might be cautious in raising interest rates so as not to burden the 
struggling savings and loan industry 
traders see washington as placing a relatively low priority on 
supporting the dollar said holland who predicted the us currency 
could return to the levels where it traded before the november 
election 
overseas dealers said the dollar was driven lower by skepticism 
that us interest rates will rise and by the west german marks 
strength the mark in turn was helped by continuing speculation 
that a hike in official west german interest rates would materialize 
soon 
after the close of trading in new york two major banks announced 
they were raising their prime lending rate half a percentage point 
to 115 percent the second increase in two weeks however prime 
rate hikes tend to follow and not portend increases in other 
interest rates

chrysler corp said thursday it plans to replace 
an aging detroit assembly plant with a new 1 billion factory that 
will make a new sportutility vehicle beginning in 1992 betting 
that demand for such vehicles will continue growing into the next 
decade 
the vehicle codenamed the zj will be available in jeep and 
dodge dealers and will be the first sportutility vehicle carrying 
the dodge nameplate 
details about the zj which will be available in two models 
will not be given until production begins in january 1992 but 
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said it would be larger than the jeep 
cherokee now being made at a toledo ohio plant 
chrysler said it will continue manufacturing jeep cherokees in 
toledo after 1992 when its current fiveyear contract with the 
united auto workers union expires 
the zj is basically a vehicle that is for another segment of 
the market nicoll said it is not a replacement for the 
cherokee it is targeted at an upscale market 
the current base price for a twowheeldrive jeep cherokee is 
about 12374 fourwheeldrive and options can push the cost much 
higher 
the zj is the second new sportutility vehicle for the 1990s that 
chrysler has announced this month 
chairman lee iacocca said feb 2 that chrysler and the french 
automaker renault would collaborate on a minisportutility 
vehicle codenamed the jj it will be assembled at one factory 
in the united states and another either in spain or portugal 
beginning in mid1992 
the base price for the jj would be less than 10000 iacocca 
said 
the zj will be the only vehicle produced at chryslers new 
jefferson north plant which will replace the companys aging 
jefferson avenue assembly plant full production is expected to be 
about 200000 vehicles a year 
sales of utility vehicles of all sizes from compacts like the 
suzuki samurai to large ones like the ford bronco have risen from 
63 percent of the truck market in 1980 to 163 percent last year 
it was too early to tell how many of the new vehicles would be 
allocated to dodge and how many would go to jeep nicoll said final 
names for the vehicles wont be determined for two to three years 
he said 
the jefferson avenue plant which has been producing cars since 
1925 now makes the dodge omni and plymouth horizon cars nicoll 
said the company was unsure whether the onmi or horizon nameplates 
would continue after the plant is shut down 
construction of the jefferson north plant on detroits east side 
is to begin in april nicoll said 
chrysler indicated it was optimistic that problems regarding 
chemical deposits on the plant site and acquisition of the land by 
the city of detroit would be cleared up by the time construction is 
to start 
any delays in land acquisition or environmental cleanup in turn 
could delay the startup and significant delays could jeopardize the 
project nicoll said

petroleum futures turned in a mixed performance 
thursday with crude prices nearly flat in lackluster trading on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
the april contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil closed the day down 1 cent at 1783 a 
barrel contracts for later delivery were unchanged to 4 cents lower 
among refined products march heating oil rose 044 cent to 5059 
cents a gallon after jumping 123 cents on wednesday in response to 
an industry report showing an unexpected decline in inventories 
unleaded gasoline for march settled at 4974 cents a gallon up 
067 cent analysts said there was no fresh news to move the market 
although beginning investor concern about a seasonal decline in 
demand for crude oil might have influenced prices somewhat 
activity in the gasoline pits reflected some concern about the 
possibility of higher retail gasoline prices this summer analysts 
said buyers were trying to lock in lower prices for summer 
deliveries gasoline prices scheduled for delivery between june and 
november were up 103 cents to 130 cents a gallon 
the concern stems from the possibility that some northeastern 
states will impose new regulations requiring motorists to use higher 
octane gasoline the states are awaiting environmental protection 
agency approval 
refining capacity already is tight and the new gasoline would 
require refiners to use more oil to produce a smaller amount of 
motor fuel

selling rate rather than on total sales 
the overall sales rate during the period was bolstered by a 54 
percent increase in truck sales which offset a 03 percent decline 
in car sales

from a year earlier 
chryslers truck sales were up 71 percent during the 
midfebruary period to a daily rate of 3105 from 2899 last year 
joseph phillippi an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new 
york agreed with chrysler executives who recently predicted that a 
short supply of cars due to model changeover might depress sales 
numbers during early 1989 
general motors corp car sales fell 12 percent during 
midfebruary dropping to a daily rate of 11714 this year from 
11852 during the period last year for the year to date gms car

labor leaders staged a rowdy show of support 
thursday for machinists planning to strike eastern airlines 
receiving a boost from the airlines pilots while predicting 
president bush would intervene to stop a walkout 
the aflcio executive council joined members of the machinists 
and other unions at a noisy rally at easterns headquarters 
buoyed by the presence of more than a dozen eastern pilots the 
labor leaders predicted they would mount a unified front and stall 
air travel and cargo if the 8500 machinists and ground personnel 
strike eastern as planned march 4 
im here to let the machinists know were going to help them 
aflcio president lane kirkland said as he and about 1000 eastern 
workers and supporters marched in front of easterns operations 
yard weve got a special effort here all the unions in the 
federation are showing their support 
the union is threatening to strike because of what it considers 
150 million in unreasonable concessions demanded by eastern 
kirkland said organized labor would do everything possible 
within the law to halt eastern sister carrier continental 
airlines and their parent company texas air corp in the event of 
a strike 
on hand for the rally were a handful of uniformed eastern pilots 
and several officials from their union including one who sparked 
the ire of several aflcio leaders by saying wednesday the pilots 
would cross machinist picket lines if eastern management makes it 
worth our while 
that official rick chapman secretary treasurer of the eastern 
pilots union contended he was quoted out of context 
we support the membership of the iam said chapman who 
apologized to kirkland and william winpisinger president of the 
international association of machinists for any trouble his 
wednesday statement had caused 
the pilots according to union policy will not decide whether to 
honor machinist picket lines until there is a strike but a pilot 
bob breslin said the momentum is growing very rapidly to side 
with the machinists 
airline pilots however have traditionally spoiled labors hopes 
of crippling airlines during strikes by crossing picket lines 
eastern management which has said it plans to operate in the 
event of a strike made its presence felt as well 
a sign hanging from a company building read welcome aflcio 
delegates eastern your official airline during the rally a 
small plane flew overhead toting a banner reading eastern 
official airline of the aflcio 
most of the federation officials gathered in nearby bal harbour 
for the aflcio leaderships annual meeting flew here on eastern 
which offered a group discount federation officials have 
acknowledged the irony in that but said they encourage people to fly 
eastern because they want the financially strapped airline to 
survive 
the rally was part of labors dual strategy of preparing for a 
strike while at the same time trying to pressure bush to name an 
emergency board and automatically delay the march 4 strike deadline 
by 60 days 
i have no reason to believe the president wont do that 
winpisinger said when asked if he expected bush to name an emergency 
board if lastditch mediation under way in washington fails 
kirkland called on bush to name the board for the sake of the 
future of the airline for the sake of the communities eastern 
serves for the sake of the country 
machinists leaders said there would have been a larger crowd at 
the rally but that eastern invoked mandatory overtime rules and 
forced several hundred employees to work past 330 pm when the 
rally was to begin

congressional tax analysts estimated thursday 
that the capitalgains tax reduction proposed by president bush as a 
revenueraiser would actually reduce tax collections by 242 
billion over the next six years 
the bush administration calculates the presidents proposal would 
increase revenues by 93 billion during the 198994 period 
whos right sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
senate finance committee asked in releasing the report from the 
staff of the joint committee on taxation thats the first thing 
well have to determine when the finance committee takes this matter 
up 
just two years ago the treasury department estimated a 
capitalgains cut would lose 218 billion over five years it may 
be significant that joint tax is far closer to what treasury was 
saying two years ago than what treasury itself is saying today 
bentsen said 
bentsen has indicated he could live with a reduction in the 
capitalgains rate if the upperincome taxpayers who would benefit 
most were made to pay elsewhere for the cut but his house 
counterpart rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the ways and 
means committee has vowed allout opposition to a reduction 
this assault on tax reform would be a bad idea no matter what 
its deficit impact rostenkowski said in a statement thursday 
now that we know of its alarming impact on the deficit i urge the 
president to reexamine the proposal he said 
rostenkowskis committee lined up behind the chairman thursday 
the panel by voice voice stated its opposition to any significant 
change in the 1986 law ending the special benefit for capital gains 
was a major portion of the 1986 law 
in a message to congress on feb 9 bush said i propose that 
we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase longterm 
investment history is clear this will increase revenues help 
savings and create new jobs 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stocks real 
estate and other property had enjoyed preferential tax treatment 
unil passage of the 1986 tax overhaul now capital gains are taxed 
just as other income such as wages and interest at rates of 15 
percent 28 percent or 33 percent depending on total income 
under bushs proposal the maximum capitalgains rate would be 
cut to 15 percent for most productive assets when fully effective 
in 1995 the change would apply only to assets held longer than 36 
months a couple with adjusted gross income under 20000 or a 
single person under 10000 would pay no tax on such gains 
including the sale of a principal home 
bushs tax analysts in the treasury department reason that 
reducing the tax on capital gains will encourage taxpayers to sell 
large quantities of longterm investments thus boosting the amount 
of income subject to taxation in the long run they say the lower 
rate will induce greater saving 
despite rostenkowskis opposition there is considerable support 
in both parties in congress for restoring a preferential tax rate 
for capital gains 
most of the opposition is based on the fact that almost all the 
benefit from the change would go to the richest americans and that 
it would mark the first step toward undoing the big 1986 tax 
overhaul 
according to figures from the internal revenue service more than 
34 percent of the 135 billion of capital gains that were reported 
on returns filed in 1987 were recorded by 34818 taxpayers whose 
incomes were over 1 million apiece seventy percent of the gain 
went to 15 million people with incomes over 100000

general motors corp says it has given up 
trying to sell its closed fairfield auto parts stamping plant as an 
ongoing business and instead will sell the property 
gm spokeswoman sharon hines said thursday that the automaker 
tried but failed to conclude deals with two companies to sell the 
factory so that it could continue as a stamping plant no other 
prospective buyers have stepped forward she said 
the 15 millionsquarefoot plant employed up to 2500 workers in 
this southwestern ohio community before it closed six months ago as 
part of a consolidation of gm facilities 
gm plans to transfer some of the fairfield plants equipment to 
other plants and then sell the property she said 
darrell bowling codirector of a gmunited auto workers center 
formed to help former gm fairfield workers find new jobs said gms 
decision was unfair to the 500 to 600 former employees who stayed in 
the fairfield area hoping to get a job when the plant reopened under 
new ownership 
theres still some hope that something positive will happen

a hike in a key banklending rate dominated the economic news 
thursday reflecting stronger inflationfighting steps by the 
federal government and signaling higher borrowing costs for millions 
of american consumers 
the halfpercentage point hike in the prime rate by two big new 
york banks chase manhattan and republic national was the second 
increase in two weeks and lifted the rate to 115 percent the 
highest level since november 1984 
the prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business and 
consumer loan rates including car loans and adjustablerate home 
mortgages an increase in the prime means borrowers will have to pay 
more to finance their debts 
it also reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks face 
themselves indicating the federal reserve is soaking up money in 
the banking system one of its weapons in restraining inflation 
the prime hike overshadowed another report that suggested the 
economy might be slowing which might have eased fears about 
inflation the commerce department said durablegoods factory orders 
fell 3 percent in january 
chase said it raised the prime rate because its own cost of funds 
had risen sharply since the last prime rate hike feb 10 major 
banks then boosted the rate to 11 percent from 105 percent 
the primerate hike came a day after the labor department 
reported consumer prices rose in january at an annual rate of 72 
percent the highest level in two years fed chairman alan greenspan 
called the inflation trend disturbing and vowed to pressure rates up 
until he squeezes inflation out of the economy 
fears about inflation and interest rates influenced the financial 
markets although they already had closed by the time the primerate 
increase was announced 
on wall street stocks recovered only slightly from the day 
before when they tumbled on anxiety about inflation in the bond 
market a sensitive economic barometer prices fell because of what 
traders called indications that the fed was tightening credit 
further 
in foreign exchange trading the dollar slipped over pessimism 
about washingtons ability to restrain the us budget and trade 
deficits which have been partly blamed for the currencys 
depreciation over the past three years

international business machines corp confirmed 
thursday it has agreed to settle a 100 million lawsuit charging 
that its personal computers violated a basic patent on word 
processing held by a small rockvillebased company 
the settlement calls for ibm to acquire the patent held by the 
company berkeley limited partnership ibm spokeswoman cynthia 
stevens said she declined to comment on how much if anything ibm 
was paying berkeley 
max stul oppenheimer a baltimore lawyer not involved in the 
case said it was considered important to software publishers and 
other computer businesses nationwide 
berkeley had sought more than 100 million in lost royalties from 
ibm and an injunction preventing ibm for making or selling personal 
computers until the expiration of its patent on oct 31 one of its 
lawyers edward goldstein of houston said last year 
in a counterclaim that was dismissed before the settlement ibm 
had accused berkeley of trying to extort money by forcing ibm to 
license its technology 
berkeley filed its suit in 1987 contending that ibm personal 
computers when they ran word processing software infringed on its 
1972 patent on a word processing device 
ibm argued that the patent was invalid because the ideas in it 
were widely known at the time the patent was issued and that ibms 
computers worked differently 
a stipulation on the settlement was signed by us district judge 
joseph c howard in baltimore last week the agreement becomes void 
if its terms are not completed within 180 days 
goldstein berkeleys lawyer said thursday he could not comment 
on the settlement arnold d berkeley a washington lawyer who set 
up the company with some other investors was away from his office 
and unavailable for comment a secretary said

a stockbroker accused of fleeing with millions of 
dollars in clients money wrote that he lived in a bowl of lies 
and deceit according to an entry from the stockbrokers diary 
read in court thursday 
the us government has charged former dean witter reynolds inc 
broker walter f curran with 26 million in bank fraud and mail 
fraud 
curran was arrested last week at a uscanada border crossing 
carrying 32000 in cash with 100000 more stuffed in a suitcase 
stowed in his car trunk 
curran appeared thursday before us magistrate joyce alexander 
who continued the detention hearing to friday us attorneys are 
arguing that curran should be held without bail while the defense 
is seeking his release on 500000 bail 
curran 46 crossed his arms and lowered his head as prosecutor 
peter mullin read from a diary seized when the defendant was 
arrested 
everything has finally come to a head there is nothing to 
say to justify what i did went the entry for feb 8 i tried to 
capitalize on the use of other peoples money i know i will 
have to face the consequences 
the silverhaired curran showed little emotion during the allday 
hearing that was attended by friends family members and attorneys 
for his alleged victims 
defense attorney thomas troy said the diary could weaken his 
clients case 
it might be incriminating but its there and were going to 
have to talk about it troy said after the session adjourned 
in the lengthy diary entry curran lamented about the struggle he 
had faced since the october 1987 stock market crash and asked 
forgiveness from his family for any suffering he had caused 
the former stockbroker also instructed his former clients to 
approach dean witter for reimbursement they can claim i 
misrepresented their interests the diary said 
ive lived in a bowl of lies and deceit hoping i could resolve 
my problems with a miracle curran wrote i used other peoples 
money to create a fantasy life and became a prisoner of my own 
wishful thinking 
curran was returned late wednesday to boston from which he 
allegedly fled last month with millions of dollars in client 
investments 
executives at the brokerage houses new york headquarters sent 
representatives to calm nervous employees after several of currans 
clients stormed the boston office feb 8 demanding to know his 
whereabouts 
curran allegedly persuaded the investors to place their money 
directly with him on the promise of higher returns 
the stockbrokers disappearance initially sparked reports that 
hed left the country with as much as 10 million in clients money 
and 475000 in funds owed the bank of boston 
but dean witter spokesman james f flynn said wednesday that 23 
million was unaccounted for and no further claims were expected 
curran has been sued by the bank of boston for 260000 in bad 
checks and an unsecured loan 
dean witter representatives on feb 9 informed federal 
investigators that curran was missing after he failed to show up for 
work court documents show 
federal officials captured curran a week ago when he attempted to 
reenter the united states at an outoftheway town in new york 
customs officials alerted authorities after his canadian rental 
car aroused suspicion and a check of his drivers license revealed 
he was wanted in massachusetts

the government witness list has 500 names 
a moving van had to be hired to carry the 4000 documents to be 
entered as evidence 
one of the most farreaching thrift fraud cases went to trial 
this past week in a texas federal court where attorneys began 
presenting their accounts of flamboyant developer dl danny 
faulkner and six other defendants accused of bilking sampls by 
inflating the values of a condominium empire 
if convicted the defendants face a total of 1696 years in 
prison and fines of almost 15 million 
its a case that has resulted in dozens of indictments in related 
scams and reflects what many thrift experts call the financial 
treachery partly responsible for the sampl crisis nationwide 
five government attorneys six fbi agents and several 
secretaries along with the defendants and their 12 attorneys have 
bivouacked in lubbock for the fraud conspiracy and racketeering 
trial expected to last six months 
as presented by prosecutors during opening statements faulkner 
and his codefendants saw their condo kingdom crumble with the 
collapse of the empire savings and loan association plundered by 
them to finance swank lifestyles that included rollsroyces 
designer wardrobes and posh parties 
theyre accused of conspiring to reap profits from an estimated 
500 million in loans primarily for condo developments along 
interstate 30 in the dallas suburb of garland the case has become 
known as the i30 condo trial 
the 85page 88count indictment issued by a federal grand jury 
in october 1987 said faulkner and codefendants recruited and 
corruptly rewarded heads of lending institutions and real estate 
appraisers for their participation 
according to the indictment the scheme worked like this tracts 
of land along i30 used as collateral for the loans were inflated 
in value through a series of sales known as land flips one 
parcel of land was sold among faulkner and codefendants as many as 
six times a day each time its value was inflated sometimes as much 
as fourfold 
then the land was sold in smaller sections to a prearranged 
buyer the buyer was paid money up front to sign for a loan that had 
already been arranged by the defendants 
the alleged conspirators got rich illegally prosecutors say 
from the loan proceeds and from the profits they made selling wildly 
inflated property to unsuspecting buyers 
the indictment describes one land deal where an 82acre tract was 
purchased for 52 cents per square foot by empires real estate 
subsidiary when an 186acre tract eventually was sold to a group 
of borrowers the land was assigned values ranging from 85012 
per square foot 
faulkners attorney contends her client was no more than a land 
salesman 
quite simply danny faulkner was the individual who began 
condominium development out in garland and sold the land to other 
developers said attorney cheryl wattley that was it 
numerous participants in i30 land deals are expected to testify 
in exchange for lighter sentences 
while the government touts its paper trail ms wattley said that 
wont corroborate the testimony of people who have essentially 
sold their souls to the government in order to try to get lighter 
sentences and compensate for what they have done 
faulkner 55 is the former owner of a paint contracting company 
he began developing condos along i30 and investing in savings and 
loan associations in the late 1970s 
in 1979 he was part of a group that bought empire prosecutors 
allege he pocketed at least 40 million in loan proceeds which he 
used to bankroll a life of luxury he owned a bell jet ranger 
helicopter and a box at texas stadium but also was known as a 
magnanimous giver 
god has blessed me and i like helping people he once said 
money isnt important people are important 
the criminal trial was assigned to us district judge sam 
cummings in lubbock after the 5th circuit court of appeals ordered 
judge joe fish in dallas to step down fish was related to someone 
marginally involved in the case the defense previously had asked 
for a change of location for the trial

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
saying a separately regulated thrift industry may not be needed in 
the future told congress on thursday that the fed will make it 
easier for bank holding companies to buy troubled savings and loans 
greenspan testifying before the senate banking committee also 
said the central bank and the treasury department have arranged to 
support the federal home loan bank system in the event of runs on 
sampls 
meanwhile the white house office of management and budget late 
thursday released figures showing the government spending 2646 
billion on sampl problems through the year 2018 
it breaks down as follows 522 billion to meet commitments in 
the rescue of 205 institutions last year 50 billion to shut down 
350 insolvent but still open sampls 734 billion to take care of 
additional sampls slipping into insolvency from 1991 through 2018 and 
892 billion in interest payments from 1989 through 2018 
even though the outline shows continuing sampl failures in the next 
century it assumes the sampl industry will be basically healthy and 
will be paying more than enough deposit insurance premiums to cover 
the losses 
greenspans comments came as opposition to president bushs 
333page sampl proposal grew among members of congress fighting to 
preserve a separate sampl industry 
at a hearing of the house banking committee rep richard lehman 
dcalif complained that bush would give banks preference in buying 
up sampls and turn the oversight and regulation of the thrifts over to 
bank regulators 
rather than heal the wounds your plan may actually put it the 
sampl industry out of its misery lehman told treasury secretary 
nicholas brady 
the secretary denied any intention on our part to deliver up 
the sampl industry to the banking industry 
earlier brady had said that sampls are an important part of the 
nations commitment to affordable housing and that the 
administration plan assures the emergence of a healthy and strong 
sampl industry 
sen donald w riegle dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee said bradys evaluation seems to conflict with comments 
by greenspan who said the administrations proposal does not 
prejudge whether the thrift industry will survive 
my own judgment is that at the end of the day thrifts will 
look a lot more like banks than they do now but there will still be 
thrifts greenspan said ultimately its going to be the markets 
that are going to determine the banking structure in this country 
specialized mortgage lenders will exist because they are 
profitable i dont think it really matters what kind of 
institutional structure we put around it he said 
but greenspan told the committee he was not saying that at this 
stage that we should do away with the thrift industry 
what will not survive he said is a thrift industry that relies 
on shortterm deposits to fund longterm fixedrate mortgages 
greenspan said his board attaches considerable importance to 
a planned treasury department study of broad questions not addressed 
by the bush plan such as the future of deposit insurance and of 
sampls 
riegle expressed concern that the study could be an opening for 
really doing away with the savings and loan industry he said that 
when taxpayers pay billions of dollars toward resolving sampl 
problems they will demand assurance the money is being spent on a 
system that serves a public purpose 
greenspan said it is vitally important for congress to very 
promptly enact the presidents sampl plan in the meantime 
greenspan said the federal reserve as the financial worlds lender 
of last resort has entered into a support arrangement with the 
federal home loan bank system which lends to sampls 
in november and december a record 15 billion flowed out of the 
nations sampls 
we stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the 
thrift institutions are met greenspan said 
any lending by the fed would be secured by property from the 
borrowing thrift and guaranteed by the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which ensures deposits in sampls although the fslic 
is technically insolvent its backed by the full faith and credit 
of the us government 
if the fed is called upon the treasury department would also 
participate by lending up to 750 million to the fslic under a line 
of credit thats been available since the 1930s 
meanwhile rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over sampls said he would offer 
legislation recreating an oldfashioned sampl industry he would 
restrict 80 percent of each thrifts future lending to financing 
onetofourfamily homes within a 50mile radius of the institution 
brady said the administration opposes that proposal because it 
would leave sampls too vulnerable to fluctuating interest rates 
in related topics greenspan 
said sampls failing to attract more private investment and meet a 
6 percent capital level by june 1991 would not be put out of 
business they would however be forbidden to grow 
sidestepped an opportunity to crticize the economic assumptions 
including a sharp drop in interest rates and steadily growing 
deposits underlying the bush sampl plan private analysts and members 
of congress have labeled the assumptions as too rosy 
said the presidents financing proposal should be adequate 
but conceded its conceivable that there would be the need for a 
minor midcourse correction in a year or two

grand metropolitan plc has agreed to pay about 
4 million to lawyers who represented former pillsbury co 
shareholders in litigation that played a part in grand mets 
takeover of the food and restaurant company a lawyer said thursday 
shareholders lawyers in the minnesota lawsuit against pillsbury 
will receive slightly less than 2 million and shareholders lawyers 
in a similar delaware lawsuit will receive slightly more than 2 
million said steve oestreich who represented shareholders in the 
delaware action 
they grand met acknowledged that we played a major role in 
getting the court to agree that pillsburys shareholders rights 
plan or poison pill should be invalidated oestreich said 
johnny thompson a spokesman for pillsbury said grand met had no 
comment on the terms of the settlement with the attorneys 
grand met a british liquor and specialty products conglomerate 
acquired pillsbury on dec 18 for 568 billion or 66 a share the 
agreement capped a 2month takeover battle in which pillsbury 
resisted the bid by keeping its poison pill in place and 
proposing to spin off its burger king subsidiary 
two days before the takeover agreement was reached justice 
william duffy of the court of chancery in wilmington del said he 
would issue preliminary injunctions sought by grand met and the 
shareholders to invalidate the pill and temporarily block the 
companys planned spinoff of burger king 
both the pill and spinoff could have made a takeover 
prohibitively expensive for grand met 
judge thomas carey in minneapolis also sided with the 
shareholders by agreeing to block the burger king spinoff and he 
said he would agree with duffy on the poison pill removal 
oestreich said the court action paved the way for a takeover 
i think the shareholders rights were well protected said 
charles zimmerman a minneapolis lawyer who was part of the 
minnesota lawsuit against pillsbury it the lawsuit did a great 
job for them 
the lawsuits were filed to encourage pillsbury to negotiate with 
grand met after pillsbury initially declined to bargain with the 
company 
zimmerman said none of the settlement money will go to 
shareholders 
if grand met had not reached a settlement on fees for the 
shareholders lawyers it would have been up to carey and duffy to 
award the money oestreich said

the nations two largest poultry producers 
were ordered thursday to stop spreading false information about each 
other in their spirited corporate contest to acquire holly farms 
corp 
senior us district judge richard e robinson issued a 
preliminary injunction against both tyson foods inc of springdale 
ark and conagra inc of omaha 
tyson is the largest poultry producer in the united states 
conagra is second and holly farms of memphis tenn is fourth 
tyson and conagra officers have accused each other in lawsuits of 
issuing false and misleading press releases about their efforts to 
acquire holly farms 
robinson said in a 27page opinion that both bidding companies 
probably would succeed on the merits of their claims against each 
other and each would suffer irreparable harm if the other continued 
to issue misleading statements 
conagra which has offered to merge with holly farms launched 
the legal battle when it filed a federal lawsuit jan 24 asking that 
tyson be prohibited from issuing false misleading inaccurate or 
incomplete press releases 
the company contended that tyson said in a press release jan 20 
that the holly farms board of directors would accept a tyson offer 
of 6350 a share for holly stock when tyson already knew its offer 
had been rejected 
tyson said it had no intent to defraud and that it issued a 
clarifying press release to correct what it said it perceived to be 
an erroneous headline issued by a financial wire service 
tyson later filed a countercomplaint contending that conagras 
press release of jan 24 concerning its merger offer constituted 
solicitation of proxies in violation of federal securities laws 
that press release said the real value of conagras merger 
agreement with holly exceeded 64 a share 
robinson said thursday that tyson established a reasonable 
probability that it would succeed in proceeding with its claim 
that conagra violated proxy solicitation rules 
it seems more than coincidental that conagra would cite in its 
press release a figure exceeding 64 of real value a figure 
greater than the wellpublicized 6350 price offered by tyson he 
wrote 
robinson said that because of the volatility of market activity 
in the wake of inaccurate or misleading disclosures another tyson 
transgression could irreparably hamper conagras efforts at 
obtaining a fair chance for shareholder approval of the merger 
agreement 
robinson ordered tyson to refrain from issuing any information 
which is false misleading inaccurate or incomplete about tysons 
proposal to acquire holly farms or about the conagraholly merger 
agreement 
he also ordered conagra not to solicit any more proxies without 
first complying with federal securities regulations 
conagra and holly farms officials have said their shareholders 
will meet late in march to vote on the proposed merger

the senate armed services committee voted 
thursday to recommend rejection of john towers nomination as 
defense secretary splitting 119 along party lines as it handed 
president bush the first major defeat of his young administration 
in tokyo presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush 
stands by the nomination which the democraticcontrolled senate 
plans to take up next week we now go to the floor of the 
senate fitzwater declared 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the committee opened the 
nearly threehour session saying towers record of alcohol abuse 
cannot be ignored in my view 
i have searched in vain for several weeks for the point in time 
when the nominee himself acknowledged this problem and dealt with it 
decisively the nominee made it very clear that he has never sought 
medical assistance for his drinking problem said nunn at a 
session that included an open discussion of towers drinking habits 
fitzwater said the committee had every right to look into 
allegations which included reports of heavy drinking and womanizing 
but fitzwater also complained we hear vague talk about concern 
about his personal habits and we think this debate ought to be on a 
slightly higher level than that 
if the full senate should turn down tower a former senator who 
used to chair the armed services panel it would be the first time 
in history a newly elected president had suffered a rejection of a 
nominee to his first cabinet in all eight cabinet nominations have 
been rejected the most recent 30 years ago 
tower in a statement said he was obviously disappointed with 
the outcome of the senate armed services committee vote but the 
statement said tower will continue to work at the pentagon and 
await the vote of full senate on his confirmation 
but sen robert byrd dwva urged bush to withdraw the 
nomination before a full senate decision 
it doesnt do the nominee any good it doesnt do the president 
any good byrd said its a tremendous burden for any nominee to 
go to the floor with a vote of no confidence 
fred mcclure the white house liasion to congress attended the 
committee vote and said the president told him prior to the panels 
action just hang in there and ill be back monday 
nunn opened the lengthy session by noting that in last years 
presidential campaign bush spoke about putting ethics at the 
center of his agenda and promised that higher standards would be 
required when he took office 
he said the committee also took the same steps to ensure high 
ethical standards sending a letter to bush and former democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis stressing the need for 
quality nominees 
tower according to nunn failed to meet that standard 
i cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the 
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking 
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing a 
sac bomber squadron or a trident missile submarine nunn said 
on the other side john warner of virginia the committees 
topranking republican said the allegations amounted only to a 
cobweb of fiction and fantasy and said he supported the 
nomination 
sen strom thurmond rsc said this committee ought to have 
the courage to do what is right he shouted perception should 
not control this committee it ought to be the truth 
other republicans on the panel alleged partisanship by their 
colleagues and suggested that tower was being held to too high a 
standard the majority believes we are confirming a defense god 
not a defense secretary said sen malcolm wallop rwyo 
added sen trent lott rmiss this is not a canonization 
following the vote gop sens john mccain of arizona and william 
cohen of maine indicated that the panels decision might create 
serious partisanship problems in the future 
this is going to make it much more difficult to put together a 
bipartisan coalition for defense and foreign policy i think its 
going to be very damaging to the committee the bruises deep and 
long lasting said cohen the emotions have been building on 
this i think its a bad storm rising 
mccain said the vote signals an incredible increase in 
partisanship john tower had a lot of friends on our side and they 
think hes been very badly treated 
as sentiment against tower mounted white house concerns 
increased sending vice president dan quayle and other 
representatives into highgear lobbying 
from tokyo the traveling white house kept tabs on the situation 
by telephone calling committee members and the gop leadership said 
a white house source speaking on condition of anonymity 
during the afternoon the panel met for more than two hours in 
closeddoor session then broke up briefly so democrats and 
republicans could caucus separately 
tower has been dogged by allegations of excessive drinking and 
womanizing as well as questions stemming from his consulting work 
for defense contractors before his nomination even his closest 
supporters concede he had a drinking problem in the 1970s but they 
say it no longer exists 
one democratic senator speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the fbi report contains material concerning an airplane flight from 
london to dallas in which at least one witness reported seeing tower 
drunk but fbi invetigators were told by an unnamed flight attendant 
aboard the flight that tower was not drunk at the time 
the panel had sought additional material from the white house as 
well as a transcript of a separate investigation by a house 
subcommittee looking into alleged security lapses in an arms control 
delegation in geneva that included tower in the mid1980s 
prior to the vote senate minority leader bob dole of kansas 
delivered an emotional appeal to his colleagues saying the 
nomination is a matter of minutebyminute concern to bush 
this is his nominee he didnt pick john tower up off the 
street he didnt do it without careful consideration dole said 
in a speech in the senate chamber 
the committee members who voted for the motion were sens sam 
nunn dga james exon dneb carl levin dmich jeff bingaman
