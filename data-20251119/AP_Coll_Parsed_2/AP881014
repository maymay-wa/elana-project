the stone landed just 
behind the police jeep it was a small one and the four border 
policemen in the vehicle glanced back only briefly 
its one stone two stones its nothing said lior one of 
the officers if its more we go after them with the jeep 
police and soldiers who patrol the gaza strip say the days of 
massive demonstrations that dominated the early part of the 
palestinian uprising are over 
now they say their time is taken up mostly with hurled rocks 
and barricaded roads in this coastal strip that 650000 
palestinians call home 
but fear is growing that objects more frightening than stones 
will become the norm in gaza and the west bank territories 
captured by israel from egypt and jordan during the 1967 middle 
east war 
on tuesday a grenade was hurled at an army jeep in gaza city 
injuring two soldiers a second grenade was tossed near a bus 
carrying soldiers not far away the following day 
fewer than a half dozen have been thrown in gaza during the 
uprising but soldiers say they worry there may be more as 
frustration with israeli occupation mounts 
if we have many more of these youll start asking yourself 
whats being thrown at you said a young army lieutenant now 
youre not supposed to fire if its only a stone not a 
lifethreatening situation it could get bloody 
under army regulations soldiers cannot be identified by name 
but the military commander of gaza maj gen tataluf zvi poleg 
also said the potential existed for palestinians to use weapons 
more dangerous than the trademark stones 
we havent seen that many hot weapons he said we believe 
they do have these weapons 
asked if he expected more grenades and guns poleg said 
history will tell we hope not since it would lead to more 
injuries on both sides 
since the uprising began dec 8 69 palestinians have been 
fatally shot by soldiers in the gaza strip according to army 
figures thirtytwo soldiers have been injured 
according to un figures 296 palestinians have been killed in 
the uprising in the occupied lands six israelis also have died 
including one soldier fatally stabbed in the west bank 
in august the army introduced plastic bullets that officials 
said were intended to cause fewer deaths than the standard 
steeltipped ones and be more effective than the rubber bullets and 
tear gas used to break up demonstrations 
poleg said the plastic bullets were proving effective and less 
lethal noting there have been only six deaths of palestinians in 
gaza since sept 1 
only officers and trained marksmen use the rubber bullets he 
said the average soldier still carries a clip of standard 
steeltipped bullets 
in the border police patrol thursday through gaza city none of 
the eight men in two jeeps carried plastic bullets 
the border police are said to be more feared than the army by 
palestinians many of are druse a moslem sect whose members are 
the only arabs allowed to serve in the israeli military they speak 
arabic and know arab ways 
as the jeeps crawled through darkening streets the police met 
only the lone thrown stone but many sullen looks from young 
palestinians walking the roadsides 
at one point a barrier of stones and debris had been set up on 
a dirt street the jeeps stopped and four palestinians at random 
were ordered to clear it 
policeman lior 19 pointed out spots along the way where stones 
were usually encountered he said he expected trouble the next day 
today the moslem holy day and even more difficulty the 
following wednesday 
then prime minister yitzhak shamirs hardline likud bloc is to 
sponsor a trip by 50 busloads of israelis to a jewish settlement in 
the arab gaza strip 
we know that will make a lot of noise said lior

federal attorneys charged reputed crime boss 
vincent chin gigante in a civil racketeering lawsuit thursday 
with exercising control over a teamsters union local through mob 
lieutenants 
the lawsuit also names a trucking company and a lawyer who 
performed legal services for members of the local which has been 
placed under trustee by a federal judge us district judge harold 
a ackerman found the local had been frozen under a quartercentury 
of mafia domination 
many of the allegations have surfaced before in the governments 
legal battle to wrest control of local 560 but the complaint was 
the first time that gigante reputed head of the genovese organized 
crime family has been targeted by the government regarding 
corruption in local 560 
in new york meanwhile a federal judge sentenced anthony fat 
tony salerno the former genovese boss who is already serving a 
100year sentence to 70 additional years in prison for a 
racketeering scheme that included construction bidrigging 
extortion and gambling 
the local 560 case comes during a year of stepped up efforts 
against the crime family one indictment was brought against seven 
reputed family members and associates in a businesstakeover scheme 
another indictment charged trucking company figure francis j 
walsh jr and other reputed crime family members of arranging a 
sweetheart labor deal with officials of the union citybased 
union walsh of saddle river has denied the charges 
the court papers filed thursday cite the same alleged scheme 
involving walsh as one of the reasons to take action against 
gigante 
what we hope is to get an injunction against gigantes 
involvement with 560 which the genovese family has controlled 
since the early 1960s said us attorney samuel a alito jr 
what he controls is the family and the family is still trying 
to control the union alito said 
the government is seeking to have gigante barred from directly 
or indirectly influencing the affairs of local 560 or any union 
gigante 60 of old tappan could not be reached for comment 
there was no telephone listing under his name and federal 
authorities did not know who his attorney is

george bush declared himself pleased with his 
debate showing thursday night but then looked ahead toward the 
homestretch of this campaign 
an instant abc poll said bush had won his second and final 
debate with democrat michael dukakis asked whether he thought he 
was victorious bush gave a thumbsup sign and said im happy 
with the way it came out 
i feel good about it the grinning vice president told 
reporters as he headed for a rally of 3000 supporters at loyola 
marymount university 
in the minutes after the debate bush took telephone calls from 
both reagan and quayle said bush spokesman sheila tate 
you done good ms tate quoted reagan as telling the 
republican presidential nominee 
she said quayle who holds the no 2 spot on the gop ticket 
told bush you hit it out of the park 
at the rally bush did not comment on his debate performance but 
california gov george deukmejian called the vice president the 
heavyweight debate champion of the world 
tomorrow we start the homestretch of this campaign the vice 
president told the crowd which included singer andy williams 
actors gabe kaplan and chuck norris actress zsa zsa gabor and 
other hollywood celebrities 
the vice president spent 15 minutes thursday morning walking 
through the pauley pavilion on the campus of the university of 
california at los angeles checking the lighting podium and sound 
system for the debate 
ms tate said he spent the afternoon in final debate 
preparations with his advisers after having lunch with his wife 
barbara aides peppered bush with questions they believed dukakis 
might ask 
before the debate his advisers expressed confidence that if 
bush managed to look relaxed and presidential and avoid any major 
misstatements he would emerge unscathed from the competition 
bush strategists said however they were braced for a possible 
surprise by dukakis without any idea what form it might take on 
the theory it was the massachusetts governors last chance to give 
his campaign a needed boost 
james lake a top bush adviser said the vice president was more 
relaxed going into thursdays debate than he was for the first one 
on sept 25 in winstonsalem nc 
he feels pretty comfortable lake said 
bush took part in mock debates last saturday and tuesday with 
former deputy treasury secretary richard g darman playing the part 
of dukakis darman and bushs primary debate coach media adviser 
roger ailes were with him during the final hours before the debate 
began 
lake said the bush campaign was looking for dukakis to do 
something desperate to get his campaign back on track but that 
bush was ready 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii said that if the 
vice president does what he did the first time that is appear 
presidential and draw the contrast between himself and gov 
dukakis thats what wed be looking for

here are excerpts of thursdays presidential 
debate between republican vice president george bush and democrat 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
q governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would 
you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer 
dukakis no i dont ive opposed the death penalty during 
all of my life i dont see any evidence that its a deterrent and 
i think there are better and more effective ways to deal with 
violent crime we have work to do to fight a real war and not a 
phony war against drugs and i want to call a hemispheric 
summit just as soon after the 20th of january as possible to fight 
that war 
bush i do believe that some crimes are so heinous so brutal 
so outrageous and id say particularly those that result in the 
death of a police officer those real brutal crimes i do believe 
in the death penalty 
q what have you to say about dan quayle becoming president in 
the event of bushs death 
bush id have confidence in him and i made a good 
selection and ive never seen a presidential campaign where 
the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee 
you know the american people are fair they dont like it when 
theres an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people they 
want to judge it on the record itself 
dukakis mr bush picked dan quayle and before he did it he 
said watch my choice for vice president it will tell all and 
it sure did it sure did 
q after income tax rates were cut in each of the last five 
years some federal taxes have gone up isnt the phrase no 
new taxes misleading the voters 
bush what i have proposed is something much better and 
its going to take discipline of the executive branch its going 
to take discipline of the congressional branch and that is what i 
call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the 
rate of inflation but does not permit the congress just to add on 
spending 
dukakis the vice president made that pledge hes broken it 
three times in the past year already so it isnt worth the paper 
its printed on and what im concerned about is that if we 
continue with the policies that mr bush is talking about here this 
evening flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as 
a kind of economic slurpee 
q do you think that a president has to be likable to be an 
effective leader 
dukakis i think im a reasonably likeable guy im serious 
though i think im a little more lovable these days than i used to 
be back in my youth when i began in my state legislature but im 
also a serious guy i think the presidency of the united states is 
a very serious office 
q the tenor of the campaign youve been running in terms of 
both the issues and your rhetoric has surprised even some of your 
friends 
bush what ive had to do is to define not just my position 
but to define his dukakis and i hope ive done it fairly 
im not the one that compared the president of the united states of 
rotting like a dead fish from the head down i didnt do that but 
i have defined the issues and i am not going to let gov dukakis go 
through this election without explaining some of these very liberal 
positions 
dukakis i dont think these labels mean a thing and i 
would hope that tonight and in the course of the rest of this 
campaign we can have our good solid disagreements on issues 
theres nothing the matter with that but lets stop labeling each 
other and lets get to the heart of the matter which is the future 
of this country 
q there has been a bipartisan consensus in favor of 
modernizing the landbased missiles now you have ruled out the mx 
and the midgetman what type of landbased missile would you 
consider 
dukakis there are limits to this nations ability to finance 
these weapons systems how can we build a strong america 
militarily thats teetertottering on a mountain of debt we 
cannot continue to tell the american people that were going to 
build all of these systems and at the same time invest in 
important things here at home 
bush you just dont make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that 
the soviets are going to behave themselves we have enhanced 
the peace and im proud to have been a part of an administration 
that has done exactly that peace through strength works 
q who are the heroes you would point out to young 
americans as figures who should inspire this country 
bush i think of a teacher right here largely hispanic school 
jamie escalante teaching calculus to young kids 80 percent of 
them going on to college i think of those people that took us 
back into space again rick hauck and that crew i also think 
we ought to give a little credit to the president of the united 
states because american people say he is our hero 
q is there anything nice you can say about dukakis 
bush the concept of the dukakis family has my great 
respect and id say i dont know whether thats kind or not its 
just an objective statement 
dukakis we may have different approaches we may think 
that you deal with them in different days but theyre basically 
american i believe in them george bush believes in them i think 
the vast majority of americans believe in them 
q why should a woman who discovers the baby will live at 
most two years and those two years in incredible pain be forced 
to carry the fetus to term and yet a woman who becomes pregnant 
through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus 
bush bar and i lost a child we lost a daughter if that 
child were here today and i was told this same thing that 
child could stay alive for 10 or 15 years or maybe for the rest of 
her life and so i dont think that you make an exception based on 
medical knowledge at the time it is personal and i dont 
assail him on that issue or others on that issue but thats the 
way i george bush feel about it 
dukakis we lost a baby lived about 20 minutes after it was 
born but isnt the real question that we have to answer not how 
many exceptions we make its who makes the decision who makes 
this very difficult very wrenching decision

listen you can come out from under your seat 
now the really gross parts are over 
yes masochists will shed a tear but the filmic fun of flying 
body parts exploding brains and chainsaw haircuts is fading 
todays horror filmmakers abandoning the pointblank plasma of 
recent years are returning to psychological thrillers with a 
wealth of lively style replacing heaps of dead teenagers 
dead ringers which opened to brisk business at the box 
office steers away from the entrails so prevalent in director 
david cronenbergs previous efforts the fly and scanners 
george romero who charmed us with cannibalizing zombies in 1979s 
dawn of the dead just delivered monkey shines a taut 
chiller with hardly any viscera 
while the splatter is gone the suspense is back both dead 
ringers and monkey shines critics agree are profoundly 
frightening 
theres been a lot of good scaring in the last 1520 years 
and you cant do the same old thing anymore said wes craven 
director of the acclaimed original nightmare on elm street 
the audience was bored they had seen it they were ready for 
something different 
hackandslash movies championed in the mid1980s by the 
blockbuster friday the 13th series and later installments of 
the halloween sequels arent producing the packed houses they 
once did in fact this summers grisly shockers the blob and 
phantasm ii both croaked at the box office 
if your film is all a butcherblock collection of death i 
dont think youre working with as large an audience as you could 
be said pen densham director and coproducer of the kiss a 
spooky supernatural thriller opening oct 21 the challenge now 
is to take the audience into your imagination 
few have succeeded at that better than cronenberg while his 
films have always been upsetting the shock value in dead 
ringers is in a twist as fancied as it is real among the most 
disturbing scenes in the movie a tale of psychotic twin doctors 
is the simple unveiling of a halfdozen malformed gynecological 
devices 
the instruments are physical things that im using to 
represent a state of mind cronenberg said its only an 
extrapolation from what we used to feel sitting in a dentists 
chair suddenly the tray of little instruments is wheeled up you 
know that technically they are to help you but experientially 
theyre going to hurt 
the challenge for todays fright masters is to snare the 
mainstream not just those who for lack of anything better to do 
love being scared to death toward that goal directors are 
concentrating on more traditional storytelling with a greater 
emphasis on inventive visuals tighter more logical plots and 
crative music and sound effects 
the directors who are committed to the genre are maturing 
said veteran horror specialist john carpenter director of 
halloween and the thing and the upcoming they live 
horror newcomers too are exploring unusual strategies to 
induce fear in the kiss director densham gives life to a 
swimming pool a wind chime and an escalator my goal is to try 
to fuse vision with emotion densham said in childs play 
coming nov 9 director and cowriter tom holland has created a 
fresh and sometimes funny white knuckler about a toy doll with a 
really bad attitude 
weve all become much more sophisticated in what weve grown 
accustomed to on the screen said richard rubinstein producer of 
stephen kings pet sematary due out early next year if the 
audience cares about the characters then they will care when they 
get into trouble if you introduce a group of teenagers who climb 
off a bus nobody cares when they get popped off 
furthermore the dead teenager movies focused on one fear 
fear of attack when manipulations of that emotion grew too 
frequent the genre lost its original snap when you got down to 
that level with anonymous children dying anonymous deaths what 
youre really doing is pornography carpenter said youre only 
setting the audience up for the meat 
said craven there are different kinds of terror one is just 
terror of having your body harmed something like friday the 
13th with jason coming after you with a machete but there are 
other kinds there is the terror of whether youre sane or not or 
whether your perceptions are accurate or not or whether your 
dreams are real 
those sorts of things to me are much more interesting and 
much more complex and have more of a potential for fright 
cravens new untitled movie scheduled for release next year will 
focus on premonitions hallucinations dreams religious trances 
and possession 
still there will be some gore 
unless you have one scene that really scares people that 
really makes them feel that not only is the killer beyond normal 
rational actions but the filmmaker is too then the audience is 
not really frightened craven said but once you do that you 
dont need to do it over and over again 
entrails enthusiasts however need not panic completely while 
there is room for style in hollywood there will always be a place 
for lowbudget sliceanddice coming soon to theaters near you 
death spa slaughterhouse rock and demented death farm 
massacre

john le carres world of intrigue is returning to 
television with a perfect spy a tale that offers the same 
themes of betrayal and human weakness that won acclaim for 
tinker tailor soldier spy and smileys people 
but this time its le carre with a difference a perfect spy 
is not so much a cloakanddagger thriller as a deeply personal 
exploration of what makes a traitor 
its a psychological story says peter egan who plays 
magnus pym the perfect spy in the sevenpart british 
broadcasting corp series launching the 198889 mobil masterpiece 
theater season oct 16 on pbs stations 
this is a whydunnit not a whodunnit he said in an interview 
the why pertains to why pym became a traitor the series 
moves from his birth in 1932 through his university days which 
launch him into espionage to his globetrotting career in 
intelligence and his final unmasking and suicide 
but the great undercover battles of east and west fought in 
earlier le carre novels are subordinated in a perfect spy to 
the central conflict between father and son the quiet restrained 
magnus and rick his roguish con artist father 
peter lennon in the listener called the show the 
outstanding serial of the year but most of the plaudits went to 
irish actor ray mcanally as rick and german actor rudiger weigang 
as axel the college friend turned communist agent for whom magnus 
betrays everything 
sandwiched between these two colorful highpowered roles is 
the 42yearold egan who had to play a man imploding quietly he 
described him as an empty vessel a receiver rather than a 
transmitter magnus doesnt know who he is he has no political 
beliefs and very few human ones 
egan acknowledges that critical reaction to his performance was 
tepid while producer colin rogers remarks i think the 
english probably underestimate acting on tv they recognize 
flamboyant characters they dont recognize the sheer quality of 
acting that i think peter gave 
whereas previous tv adaptations of le carre called on alec 
guinness to portray the owlish spymaster george smiley the magnus 
pym role called for a younger man with good looks superficial 
charm and an ability to express extreme stress without showing it 
for egan it was a chance to further his highvisibility work in 
television following appearances in such big british productions 
as paradise postponed and edge of darkness 
but although television has been good to him egan who left 
school at 15 to enroll at londons prestigious royal academy of 
dramatic art worries about the desperately minorityviewed 
status of most quality shows 
ultimately tv is aiming for a mass audience and doesnt want 
to disturb he said it wants to be palatable and digestible 
whats emotionally disturbing is not thought of as part of an 
international diet 
he warned against the switchonwatchit 
switchitoffandforgetit tv fare favored by the kind of 
american programming he called bubble gum for the eyes 
such a description is unlikely to apply to the tv movie he is 
now filming for yorkshire television based on a novel by j l 
carr a day in summer casts egan as a legless expilot who 
strikes up an alliance with a bank clerk intent on avenging his 
sons death 
egan said he looks forward to returning to the stage if he can 
find a good contemporary role 
there are parts of my artistic being that are not being 
used he said ive got to blow the tubes a bit and get my 
lungs working again

there is a generation gap in londons fashion 
scene for next summer a hippie revival for the young and a touch 
of hollywoodstyle glamour for the sophisticated lady 
but across the fashion divide there are some common threads 
color splashed back into the fashion palette a strong wind blew 
in from the east bringing indonesianstyle sarong skirts and 
takeoffs on indian saris fluid fabrics changed the tailored look 
to a sexier silhouette and the miniskirt dropped to the knee if 
not below and even fluttered around the ankle 
the summer of 89 divided into two camps however at about the 
age of 21 
on the younger side the revitalized hippie look for next summer 
will be shapelier than in the sixties and have an ethnic flavor 
therell be hiphugging pants transparent shirts nehrustyle 
collarless jackets in sharp colors and platform shoes 
its 20 years since it happened and the market has caught onto 
this especially among teens said david solomon managing 
director of the accessory and clothing firm pink soda which 
features acid house sequin tshirts and psychedelic smile badges 
the new hippies sophisticated elder sister can keep some of the 
lighthearted look like an arabella pollen strapless dress with a 
heartshaped bra or a sprigged 1930sstyle tea dress from edina 
ronay 
for summer nights there is chiffon and clinging silk for in 
short dramatic cocktail dresses with bare midriffs 
rifat ozbek who received the british fashion councils designer 
of the year award friday night at a fashion reception hosted by 
prime minister margaret thatcher took the bare midriff to its 
sexiest extreme 
the turkishborn designer drew on north africa showing loose 
djellaba tunics and bellydancer pants with tiny organza tops 
foreign buyers generally felt it was one of the few collections 
that bridged the generation gap because although it was youthful 
in spirit it had a sophistication that an international woman might 
relish 
jean muir and betty jackson also spanned the two fashion camps 
jackson featured maharajatunic jackets worn with draped sarong 
skirts and indiansequinned wideflowing pants for evening 
muir mixed perfect black dresses and psychedelic acidbright 
knits with minilengths following the milan look she also showed 
sophisticated jumpsuits in black silk jersey often with short 
sleeves and feminine ruffled organza collars 
anthony price who has a large showbusiness clientele and had 
american actress angelica huston in the audience for his show did 
a waspwaisted merrywidow silhouette his models came onstage 
draped in transparent chiffon boudoir robes which they peeled off 
to the whoops of photographers to reveal mae west pastel satin and 
silk longline corsets 
in a more fantastic vein he ruched and draped his hourglass 
silhouette into exotic dresses named after tropical birds 
including one with a bustle of feathers on the derriere and another 
with pterodactylstyle wings extending four feet on either side of 
the body 
london fashion week which ended monday attracted an estimated 
6000 buyers normally the british show is sandwiched between 
milan and paris but this year the paris readytowear decided to 
show a week later than usual leaving a weeklong gap after london 
some of the 300 exhibitors were worried that buyers would skip 
london but organizers said the attendance in london was very good 
arabella pollen said her american sales were up 30 percent but 
to old rather than new customers 
beth brett who designed an unusual line of sweaters inspired by 
fruits and vegetables was elated because the american customers 
she lost last season because of the sagging dollar had returned 
we dont know how or why but the americans are back in droves 
she said 
edina ronay said her american customers had also returned but 
she said other designers thought the show was a bit slow a bit 
less breezy probably because of this thing with milan and paris

presiding over her conservative partys 
convention this week margaret thatcher is looking unassailable 
but 10 years into her administration her complete control of 
the party government and political agenda is beginning to stir 
unease among some tories 
what little dissent exists at the convention in this english 
seaside resort comes across carefully coded and its recurrent 
theme is a feeling that after a decade of tough economic 
management the time has come to look at the problems of the 
thatcherite revolution 
peter walker secretary of state for wales and one of the few 
remaining liberals in mrs thatchers cabinet came closest to 
spelling it out 
if we ignore the problems of the economy we will fail he 
said at a fringe meeting off the convention floor if we ignore 
social problems we will fail the present political climate 
could create complacency and even arrogance we must see that our 
party is seen to be determined and understanding 
walkers remarks reflected the nervousness of some 
conservatives that having won office in 1979 and apparently 
heading for a fourth consecutive term in the 1990s their party is 
in danger of becoming arrogant 
it is very very hard to explain even to our own supporters 
that the conservatives dont hate sheffield said irvine patnick 
a rankandfile tory legislator from the economically depressed 
northern steel city 
they blame everything on her they dont like her but then 
they just see her with her handbag that sort of thing they dont 
know her said patnick speaking in an interview 
a 59yearold former builder whose north england accent 
contrasts with the plummy voices of many of the middleclass or 
newly rich tories from the prosperous south patnick was referring 
to a continuing paradox most britons dislike mrs thatcher as a 
person but like her as a leader 
in gallups latest sounding just 8 percent of voters questioned 
rated mrs thatcher likeable compared with a 44 percent rating for 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party but 61 percent 
saw her as the most suitable leader 
sheffield battered by the closure of steel plants and coal 
mines has one conservative legislator and six laborites 
in other great cities of northern england and scotland 
including manchester liverpool and glasgow the conservatives won 
not a single seat in the 1987 election which gave mrs thatcher a 
third fiveyear term 
the party liberals are increasingly concerned that while the 
traditional class structure is fracturing under the impact of the 
new thatcherite tories the northsouth divide is widening 
the nations nurses present a typical dilemma their pay demands 
enjoy popular support but clash with the imperatives of 
thatcherite curbs on public spending thus when health minister 
kenneth clarke announced a 235 million boost for nurses pay he 
was cheered by delegates who ordinarily have little time for 
generosity at the taxpayers expense 
but otherwise the liberals are a minority there is no 
challenge here to mrs thatchers ascendancy she continues to 
look imperishable said the liberal guardian and much of the 
convention has been spent lining up new targets for the thatcher 
treatment 
they range from plans to sell off british coal one of the last 
major industries to survive mrs thatchers privatization drive to 
handing the construction of highways to independent entrepreneurs 
economic danger signals a record trade deficit and inflation 
up to 57 percent and rising scarcely ruffled the atmosphere of 
wellbeing in the convention center adorned with the slogan 
leading britain into the 1990s 
but amid the series of congratulatory convention resolutions 
were occasional signs of unease that while mrs thatchers britain 
has gotten richer it is also more violent its industries are more 
efficient but its cities are more littered 
socialist opponents blame this on a greedy getrichquick 
mentality they say is fostered by thatcherism the thatcher remedy 
is not money but what her aides call active citizenship a 
stress on giving to charity joining neighborhood anticrime groups 
and curbing antisocial behavior 
but the respected conservative economist commented that while 
active citizenship would do as a theme for a party convention 
it would not be seen as a solution 
enough britons knew that they needed nurse thatchers economic 
medicine said the weekly nanny thatcher telling everybody to 
wash their hands before tea will be ignored

tests that found the shroud of turin to be no more than 728 
years old required less than a square inch of the linen cloth and 
were based on the fact that carbon is the basis for all living or 
formerly living things 
laboratories at the university of arizona the university of 
zurich and oxford university each received a 03squareinch sample 
of the shroud and two dummy cloth samples one carbondated and the 
other dated historically but not scientifically to see if they get 
consistent results for all three samples 
the labs were not told which sample was from the 14foot 3inch 
by 3foot 7inch shroud the vatican said the cutting was 
photographed and videotaped 
here briefly is how radiocarbon dating works 
carbon12 carbon13 and carbon14 are the isotopes of carbon 
different only in the number of neutrons in their atomic nuclei 
the first two are stable but carbon14 is radioactive and decays at 
a known rate its halflife is 5730 years the time it takes half 
of the isotope in a material to decay 
all living things absorb carbon and stop absorbing it when they 
die by measuring the proportion of carbon14 left in a sample 
scientists can tell how long ago the plant or animal it came from 
died 
to count the atoms a sample must be converted into carbon 
dioxide this is done by burning 
to study the shround a technique was used that is more advanced 
than original procedures used in the 1940s when carbondating was 
first applied the modern technique uses a nuclear atomcounting 
machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer it propels carbon 
dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed causing the various 
atomic particles to separate

former president richard nixon once 
suggested that elvis presley record some jailhouse rock at what is 
now a federal prison in an effort to discourage drug use 
nixon made the suggestion during a secret visit the singer made 
to nixon on dec 21 1970 when presley offered to help nixon 
protect america from drugs esquire magazine reports in this 
months issue 
a staff memo from nixon listed five suggestions for presley 
activities 
among them were record an album with the theme get high on 
life at the federal narcotic rehabilitation and research facility 
at lexington kentucky 
the facility became a federal prison in 1974 the same year 
nixon resigned in disgrace by then presley had a badge declaring 
him an honorary federal agent but lexington never got its album

researchers have found a clue to the enigma of 
how asbestos triggers cancer and it may lead to a way to screen 
asbestos substitutes for their cancercausing potential a 
scientist says 
testtube experiments showed that asbestos fibers can bind to 
genetic material outside a cell and insert the material into the 
cell damaging the genetic material in the process 
if that happens in people it may help explain why exposure to 
asbestos causes an increased risk of lung cancer and of a cancer of 
the chest lining called mesothelioma researcher edward johnson 
said thursday 
but an asbestos expert said she questioned how relevant the 
testtube findings are for human cancer 
the work is reported in the new issue of the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences by johnson and his colleagues at the 
mount sinai school of medicine in new york 
it dealt with deoxyribonucleic acid called dna which is the 
substance that makes up genes every cell of the body contains a 
set of genes which help direct its activities 
cancer can result if genes are damaged or if certain ones are 
activated inappropriately 
in a series of testtube experiments researchers found that 
asbestos fibers can bind to dna outside a cell and introduce the 
dna to the cells interior some of the dna inserted itself among 
the cells own genes and at least some of it reproduced itself 
a known cancercausing gene in the introduced dna was found to 
be active after entering cells and a second gene remained active 
18 days after entering 
johnson suggested that in people the introduced dna may trigger 
cancer when it is inserted among a cells genes or the dna itself 
may be damaged in such a way that it could trigger cancer since 
asbestos was found to damage the dna it inserted he said 
the insertion may also trigger the cells natural mechanisms for 
dna repair which may end up making mistakes in repair that lead to 
cancer johnson said 
the work was done with monkey kidney cells to aid in testing for 
reproduction of dna the experiments were not set up to show 
whether the cells would become cancerous 
brooke mossman of the university of vermont college of medicine 
said the experimental conditions are different enough from those of 
the human body that the findings may not pertain to human cancer 
experiments could be done with human cells instead she said 
mossman who was scientific chairwoman of a recent international 
workshop on the effect of asbestos and other mineral dust on cells 
also said she doubted dna for insertion is as available in the body 
as it was in the experiment 
johnson replied that monkey kidney cells are routinely used for 
cancer studies and that such dna has been found in lung fluid

michael dukakis claimed victory over 
republican george bush in their second and final debate telling 
partisan supporters that the race for the white house is going to 
get even closer after tonight 
a clean sweep the democratic presidential nominee 
referring to his first debate with bush and the vice presidential 
clash asked the crowd gathered for a postdebate rally at the 
beverly hills hilton they roared with approval 
i think we ought to have that third debate dont you 
dukakis said 
weve gotten the republicans out from behind the flag factory 
and the balloons and discussing the issues thats why debates are 
so important thats why we ought to have a third debate as was 
originally planned 
asked during the debate if he would take part in a third debate 
bush replied no and said the american people had seen enough 
debates through the primary and presidential campaigns 
recent polls have shown that dukakis faces an uphill climb in 
overcoming an apparent bush lead the democratic nominee said the 
race is very very close 
and its going to get even closer after tonight and its going 
to get closer still in the days ahead he said 
aides viewed the debate as vital to dukakis chances of winning 
the support of a majority of undecided voters while persuading some 
bush supporters to reconsider their choice 
after the debate dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said 
they didnt expect a knockout what we expected was a strong 
effort the governor spoke to people about the future tonight 
he showed he was ready to make the tough choices not to blame 
congress blame the press like bush 
dukakis joined by his wife kitty mother euterpe and his two 
daughters was attending two private functions with prominent 
fundraisers and democratic party officials 
earlier in the day dukakis keeping with his campaign ritual 
began his day with a power walk a brisk stroll during which 
the massachusetts governor carries hand weights 
he then had his favorite breakfast of raisin bran cereal before 
resuming briefings with aides and advisers 
dukakis has been in los angeles since tuesday night and has 
spent much of that time in briefings on issues and in 
questionandanswer sessions with his entourage which includes 
washington attorney robert barnett who plays the role of bush in 
mock debates with the candidate 
he planned to campaign in california and washington on friday 
including a joint appearance with his running mate texas sen 
lloyd bentsen at a noon rally in sacramento

democrat lloyd bentsen emerged from watching the 
presidential debate thursday night and declared that michael 
dukakis not only won he won big 
with all that pressure on him he stood up and delivered and 
he put the democratic party on the road to victory in november 
bentsen told reporters at a houston hotel where he viewed the 
proceedings on television 
the democratic vice presidential candidate said he and dukakis 
emerged the victors in two other debates with their republican 
opponents and now its threezip and on to nov 8 
texas state treasurer ann richards also on hand watched the 
debate as republican presidential candidate was critical of her 
comments about him in a speech she delivered to the democratic 
national convention in atlanta 
you think georges skins a little thin she said afterward 
earlier bentsen was on capitol hill to fire up congressional 
democrats telling them the party can still win the white house 
what were seeing is an allout effort on the part of 
senators the house members mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen the 
vice presidential nominee told reporters after his closeddoor 
sessions 
i was asking for their suppport and commitment and their 
leadership in their own states and we had a very enthusiastic 
response said bentsen speaking after his senate meeting 
i met with the house members over there and theyre ready to 
go to work and go flat out for the next 26 days 
later thursday bentsen was flying to houston to watch the 
presidential debate on television and to attend a postdebate rally 
the dukakisbentsen ticket is trailing george bush and dan 
quayle according to most polls but democrats hope campaigning by 
their majority in both the house and senate can help turn that 
around 
asked by reporters if there is enough time for the democrats to 
catch bush bentsen recalled the 1968 campaign 
i cant help but remember my friend hubert humphrey running 
about 10 points behind at this point and coming within seventenths 
of 1 percent of winning he said and most political pundits 
said if he had two or three more days hed have won it 
after bentsen spoke with senate democrats dale bumpers of 
arkansas said sen bentsen made one of the most compelling 
persuasive speeches about what the democratic members of the united 
states senate can do i can tell you that everybody that came out 
of that room had an entirely different idea about the winnability 
of this campaign 
i think there were some doubters there before the speech he 
said but i have never seen a response from a bunch of salty old 
senators that he got this morning 
sen paul sarbanes dmd said bentsen told them bushquayle 
is totally inadequate he talked aobut the winnability of the 
election and the role that members of the senate can play 
bentsen was introduced by senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva who with a slip of the tongue seemed to express the 
feelings of many senators 
my colleagues its my pleasure to present to you the next 
president the next vice president byrd said to roars from his 
fellow democrats 
in the house bentsen met with house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and then spoke at a meeting of house democrats he 
received loud applause several times in what attendees described as 
a fireemup address 
before he left rep dennis eckart dohio who played the role 
of quayle to help bentsen prepare for the vice presidential debate 
took the other lectern in the house chamber according to lawmakers 
and others who attended 
eckart went into his quayle imitation and when he demanded 
senator what are your qualifications bentsen pounced 
congressman i know dan quayle ive served with dan quayle 
and youre no dan quayle he said recalling his scolding of 
quayle in their debate after the indiana senator compared his 
experience with that of john kennedy in 1960 
it brought down the house said one lawmaker

q lets assume now you are president you are now facing that 
dreaded last resort increase taxes which tax do you decide is 
the least onerous 
dukakis we have had not one but two detailed studies which 
indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be 
collected that are not being paid in and that is just 
absolutely unfair to the vast majority of americans who pay their 
taxes and pay them on time 
q can you stand here tonight and look a whole generation 
in the eye and tell them that they should be financing the 
retirement of people like yourself like governor dukakis 
bush we came into office and the social security trust fund 
was in great jeopardy and the president took the leadership 
working with the democrats and the republicans in congress the 
social security trust fund was put back into sound solvent 
condition so i dont want to fool around with it and i 
will not go in there and suggest changes in social security i 
learned that the hard way 
dukakis george bush a few years ago said that social 
security was basically a welfare system and in 1985 he flew back 
from the west coast to cut that cola 
q would your nominees to the supreme court have to pass 
something that has been called a kind of conservative ideological 
litmus test and would you give us an idea of perhaps who two or 
three people on your short list are for the court 
bush well one i dont have a list yet and secondly i 
dont have any litmus test but what i would do is appoint people 
to the federal bench that will not legislate from the bench who 
will interpret the constitution 
dukakis if the vice president of the united states thinks that 
robert bork was an outstanding appointment that is a very good 
reason for voting for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen on the 8th of 
november 
q would you commit yourself to any of those hard choices such 
as which entitlements ought to be redrawn 
dukakis why do people who want to balance budgets or bring 
the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit 
people of very modest means im not going to go to 
entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit 
bush let me simply say for the record i did not vote to 
cut colas im going to keep the social security entitlement 
to keep that trust fund sound 
q governor originally you sought an exemption for social 
security colas in this national governors association vote 
but when you lost that vote you then endorsed the overall 
freeze proposal 
dukakis that is absolutely not true 
q arent you demagoguing the social security issue 
dukakis no i just have to correct the record that simply 
isnt true everybody knew that those of us who voted against 
the freezing of colas did so we did so emphatically 
q how do you square your campaign rhetoric with 
environental record 
bush i refuse to measure ones commitment as to whether 
youre going to double the spending that is the same old argument 
thatd gotten us into the trouble on the deficit side im not 
going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from 
massachussetts off the beaches off of new jersey i am an 
evironmentalist 
dukakis i dont know which george bush im talking about 
here or looking at the george bush who was a charter member of 
the environmental wrecking crew that went to washington in the 
early 80s and did a job on the epa or the one weve been seeing 
and listening to the past two or three months 
q would you agree to another debate 
bush no i will not agree to another debate the american 
people are up to here with debates i think we can all share 
in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out but 
its not getting out because theyre too few debates there will be 
no more debates 
dukakis i think if we get rid of the labels and im not 
keeping count but i think mr bush has used the label liberal 
at least 10 times if i had a dollar george for every time you 
used that label id qualify for one of those tax breaks for the 
rich that you want to give away 
q is nuclear weapons plant maintenance a priority that you 
feel has been ignored by this administration 
dukakis whats been going on whos been in charge whos 
been managing this system why have there been these safety 
violations now somebody has to bear the responsibility for 
this 
bush that is the closest ive ever heard the governor of 
massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear 
thats about as close as ive ever heard him will he join me 
in suggesting that we may need another plant maybe in idaho to 
take care of the requirements nuclear material requirements for 
our defense department i hope he will 
q if you become president will you lock that revolving 
door that has allowed some men and women in the government to come 
back and lobby the very departments they once managed 
bush yes and ill apply it to congress too i get kidded 
by being a little old fashioned on these things but i do believe 
in public service i will have an ethical office in the white 
house that will be under the presidents personal concern 
dukakis wasnt this the mr bush that supported mr meese 
called james watt an excellent secretary of the interior provided 
support for some of these people weve had dozens weve had 
dozens and dozens of officials in this administration who have 
left under a cloud who have left with a special prosecutor on 
their arm theyve been indicted convicted 
closing remarks 
dukakis our opponents say things are okay but i 
dont think we can be satisfied when were spending 150 billion a 
year in interest alone on the national debt much of it going to 
foreign bankers or when we have two and a half million of our 
fellow citizens a third of them veterans who are homeless and 
living on streets and in doorways in this country or when mr 
bushs prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway 
to the rich we can do better than that 
bush i do have respect for my opponent for his family for 
the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage but we have 
enormous differences i want to hold the line on taxes and keep 
this the longest expansion in modern history going until 
everybody in america benefits i want to invest in our children 
because i mean it when i say i want a kinder and gentler nation 
this election is about big things and perhaps the biggest is 
world peace and i ask you to consider the experience i have had in 
working with a president who has revolutionized the situation 
around the world i want to build on that

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen says michael dukakis won big in his final matchup with 
george bush he says the debate score is threezip favor of 
the democrats 
the texas senator who watched the debate on television in a 
houston hotel is flying out to sacramento today to introduce 
dukakis at a postdebate celebration at the california state 
capitol but he didnt wait to proclaim victory 
he gave reporters a thumbsup as he left his hotel after the 
debate for a latenight rally nearby 
before tonight we were twozero on the debates and now its 
threezip and now to november 8 he told a democratic crowd of 
about 500 who gathered at houstons convention center to watch 
dukakis battle bush on a big screen television 
he not only won he won big bentsen said 
bentsen was introduced at the rally by texas state treasurer ann 
richards the keynote speaker at the democratic national convention 
in atlanta although he didnt name her richards was one of those 
who bush during the debate accused of launching a dirty campaign by 
besmirching his name at the democratic convention 
well im that lady from texas with all that hair she said 
you think georges skins a little thin 
richards denied democrats did anything like the republican 
attacks that she said have tried to impugn the integrity and 
patriotism of dukakis 
all i heard in atlanta was that george bush will not make a 
good president of the united states she said 
and then george proved it himself by nominating dan quayle 
she said 
bentsen who before the debate was saying that dukakis did not 
have any more pressure on him than bush did credited the 
democratic nominee afterward for succeeding despite the odds 
with all that pressure on him he stood up and he delivered 
and he put the democratic party on the road to victory in 
november he said at the rally he won because he gave honest 
answers to the problems and concerns facing america

for the past few months the ohio lottery has 
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of cleveland stadium 
reminding fans that a 3 million lottery jackpot isnt chicken 
feed or chopped liver 
during an era when jackpots around the country are regularly 
topping 20 million the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir 
up interest in super lotto prizes that a decade ago would have 
made newspaper front pages 
we are looking for an expanded base of players said anne 
bloomberg ohio lottery spokeswoman we want the players to 
understand that 3 million is a lot of money while the giant 
jackpots get a lot of focus 150000 annual earnings for 20 years 
in a 3 million prize is a lot of money 
the explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play 
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by 
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars said paul 
dworin publisher of gaming and wagering business magazine in new 
york 
florida awards a 55 million jackpot and a lot of people are 
not going to get excited by lower numbers dworin said why 
play when its 10 million if it could be 50 million 
floridas 55 million prize awarded after a sept 3 drawing is 
the nations largest lottery jackpot to date six of the 10 largest 
jackpots have been awarded this year records show 
many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to 
trigger lotto mania described as the point when sales increase 
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize in 
most lotto contests participants try to guess a series of 
numbers to be drawn and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct 
match 
in illinois the attitude of players has changed since the state 
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a highpayoff lotto game 
in 1983 said kathy rem lottery communication director 
after a lottery has been around a number of years people get 
used to it our players have gotten more sophisticated ms rem 
said 
asked when lotto mania begins she added if you wanted a 
number id say 20 million 
new york recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to 
attract upscale casual players said russell gladieux acting 
director of the new york state lottery 
weve completely restructured our advertising to get the 
person who wouldnt play for 4 million but would play for 20 
million gladieux said weve begun featuring welldressed 
welleducated real people who share their dream of winning on 
television 
new hampshire vermont and maine operate a tristate lotto but 
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot 
of 96 million the contest may never generate lotto mania 
said rick wisler games manager for the new hampshire sweepstakes 
commission 
blaine lewis jr president of the north american association of 
state and provincial lotteries said newspaper coverage illustrates 
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars 
in 1983 with a 14 million winner in connecticut we got a 
front page story in the hartford courant said lewis who tracks 
lotteries in 28 states the district of columbia puerto rico the 
virgin islands and five canadian provinces he said the same 
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldnt make the front section of 
the newspaper 
people and the press are getting jaded but most people still 
realize a million dollars is a lot of money he said 
dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for 
lotteries to increase the odds of winning 
if you increase the choice of numbers the odds are much 
longer and therefore even if more people play theres a higher 
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots dworin 
said 
in ohio where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44 the 
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been 
32 million ms bloomberg said there are several points when sales 
increase 
ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some 
casual players come in said ms bloomberg at 13 million to 
15 million about 80 percent come in 
she said once the jackpot exceeds 15 million just about 
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who 
cant by law 
when we get the big jackpots the attention heightens 
visibility which heightens sales which heightens the jackpot and 
it just keeps going she said

a single mothers determined journey from 
welfare to work earned her a trip to the white house to see 
president reagan sign legislation designed to help other women do 
the same 
im a happy person now that im working and im not on 
welfare said evelyn vega 28 of stamford conn now that the 
government did all this it could be a chance to help a lot of 
women like me 
reagan signed a major welfare overhaul bill thursday that will 
offer education training and work programs aimed at putting 
welfare recipients to work ms vega whose trip to washington was 
funded by the united way said she considers herself a symbol of 
the gains other women can make 
three years ago ms vega was on welfare and could not read or 
write much less hold a job 
now with help from government and nonprofit groups she 
manages a fastfood store has her own car and says her goal is to 
send her three daughters to college 
ms vega whose parents separated when she was young said she 
largely raised herself after running away from home at age 10 she 
and an older sister traveled from puerto rico to several us 
states and ms vega became pregnant for the first time at age 15 
three years ago when all of her daughters were old enough to 
attend school ms vega went to her welfare caseworker and said she 
wanted to get off public assistance 
i was so lonely i was so scared she said i didnt want 
to sit there with my girls going to school and me doing nothing 
ms vega got a tutor page oristano from the literacy 
volunteers of america who began to teach her reading writing and 
basic skills such as how to look up a number in the telephone book 
eventually another nonprofit group agreed to help her find an 
entrylevel job in a fastfood store and the manager there decided 
to help her train for a management job 
she passed the management test a month ago with 98 of 100 
possible points several months earlier ms vega received her last 
welfare check 
im a single woman and im just taking care of my girls and 
im happy ms vega said sometimes i feel like im drowning 
but its ok 
she reads at the third or fourth grade level but higher when 
the material is jobrelated and she has a good chance of finishing 
high school ms oristano said 
ms vegas goal is to send her daughters to college get her 
high school diploma and eventually attend college herself 
ms vega said she is convinced other welfare mothers can get off 
public assistance 
theyve got to say im going to do it im going to stick 
with it and im not going to go back she said 
the family support act signed by reagan on thursday provides 
money to states and requires them to offer education and job 
training to women with children age 3 and over it also puts new 
pressure on absent parents to pay child support 
the incentive to get off welfare ms vegas said has to 
come from the person because the programs are there

a minor bill making a single federal 
appropriation ballooned 8700 percent into a 60 million pork 
barrel full of backhome booty for powerful lawmakers before the 
house finally scuttled it 
this is a disgusting piece of legislation rep robert 
walker rpa said thursday as he began the attack that ended in 
the house voting 256131 against even debating the bulging package 
rep thomas coleman rmo called the bill the perfect model 
of how congress is a pork farm there are so many little piglets in 
this bill it probably sets the guinness world book record about how 
a bill grew in conference 
the bill began life in the house earlier this year as a simple 
proposition authorizing the department of education to provide 
750000 to the taft institute which uses public and private money 
to run summer programs for high school civics studies teachers 
then the fattening process began 
added by the senate were 152 million in authorizations for 
federal grants to a library in the district of columbia the 
vermont council of higher education voorhees college in south 
carolina and the university of mississippi 
at least two of the addons pointed in the direction of two 
senior members of the labor and human resources committee which 
handled the bill robert stafford rvt and strom thurmond rsc 
as often occurs in these situations some insurance was added 
the mississippi money sen john stennis and rep jamie whitten 
both dmiss chair the appropriations committees that would have 
to free up the funds for the grants 
thats the way you get the money in the appropriations 
process said walker 
because of the senate amendments the bill had to go to a joint 
conference committee which upped the ante by authorizing another 
4515 million in grants to universities and other educational 
facilities 
walker and his allies said it was not coincidental that seven of 
the 12 grants tacked on in conference were headed for institutions 
located in states represented by conferees 
one of the conference leaders rep pat williams dmont 
snagged three of them worth 615 million the head senate 
conferee ted kennedy dmass got the single biggest hunk 10 
million for the massachusetts corporation for education technology 
stafford a senate conferee found a familiar face among the 
house conferees rep james jeffords rvt in the final package 
was a provision allowing a vermontnew england consortium to coax 
as much money as it needs out of the appropriations committees 
time for more insurance a grant for 500000 for the claude and 
mildred pepper scholarship program with provision for it to seek 
more money down the road through the appropriations process 
rep claude pepper dfla chairs the house rules committee 
which sent the bill to the floor thursday with a rule that 
prohibited walker amp co from lodging and easily winning challenges 
to the germaneness of the addons 
if americans want to know why budget deficits are so high all 
they have to do is look at this bill said walker successfully 
urging colleagues to kill the bill by voting against the rule 
rep jim kolbe rariz said that were famous for having 
gargantuan side show freaks grow out of nothing but this one tops 
them all 
if this were not so pitiful it would be funny said rep 
bill frenzel rminn 
walker said the bills authorized spending grew by some 8700 
percent ballooning into a clearly seen target because there was 
no need this year for a continuing resolution a type of massive 
catchall spending legislation that offers a perfect hiding place 
for addons 
opponents said some of the extras had already been spotted this 
year trying to ride through congress on other bills they said some 
of the money was aimed at educational programs that had had grant 
applications rejected at the education department 
defending the bill williams pointed out that not all the 
proposed grants were going to states and districts represented by 
conferees 
those of us on the conference committee really resent the 
implication were lining the pockets of our districts he said 
the house action left the taft institute without authorization 
to continue receiving federal money the future of that money 
however was in doubt because the reagan administration even 
before the addons occurred had threatened to veto the bill

advocates of expanded aids testing say they 
will try again next year to win congressional guarantees of the 
confidentiality of medical tests for people who might be suffering 
from the disease 
were going to offer it again next session and we will win 
but we will have lost precious time until then said rep henry 
waxman dcalif one of the chief authors of a package of health 
legislation approved thursday by congress 
the bill which now goes to president reagan for his expected 
signature includes up to 800 million a year for new aidsfighting 
programs both the house and senate approved it by voice vote 
plans to ensure the confidentiality of aids tests were dropped 
from the bill after objections from conservatives chiefly sen 
jesse helms rnc with congress trying to clear its agenda and 
heading for a yearend adjournment helms had threatened to use 
senate rules to block the measure 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said im obviously pleased the bill went through 
but im obviously saddened that the confidentiality provision has 
been taken out 
confidentiality is something we really need if were going to 
get at the highrisk groups for aids he said in a telephone 
interview from his san francisco office its going to be a 
priority for us next year 
morton halperin director of the local aclu office said 
while we applaud the fact that congress has passed threequarters 
of an aids package we are disappointed that the bill does not 
include the essential final section the testing counseling and 
confidentiality protections that had been part of the original 
package 
the bill authorizes 100 million a year for aids testing over 
the next two years another 100 million in each of the next two 
years for home health care of aids victims up to 300 million in 
new research funds in each of the next three years and 370 
million for aids education 
the testing provisions are the programs centerpiece but the 
100 million is only onequarter of the original 400 million 
program approved by the house last month despite the lack of an 
overall federal guarantee of confidentiality the program will be 
anonymous to the extent permitted by state laws 
waxman said its certainly less than we wanted but it will 
provide for testing for those highrisk individuals whom we most 
want to reach we are achieving part of our goal by providing 
anonymous testing 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
and human resources committee called the bill the first 
comprehensive federal response to the aids epidemic since it was 
identified at the beginning of this decade 
there is an overwhelming consensus in this congress that a 
plan of national leadership and commitment is necessary to combat 
the most important public health crisis of our time he said 
the legislation combined the two very different aidsrelated 
bills which had passed the house and senate separately earlier this 
year the senate version approved in april was more restrictive 
than the measure approved by the house last month 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease which attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of sept 26 aids had been diagnosed in 74447 americans of 
whom 41925 have died according to the centers for disease 
control no one is known to have recovered from aids

president reagan and the chief architect of 
the nations new welfare reform law are expressing hope it will 
transform many dependent on a government check into productive 
members of the work force 
this bill will lead to lasting emancipation from welfare 
dependency reagan said thursday as he put his signature on the 
most ambitious revision of the welfare system since it was created 
during the depression 
under the bill formally known as the family support act states 
are required for the first time to offer people on welfare a broad 
variety of education training and work programs 
the measure contains mandatory work provisions for some 
recipients and provides child care assistance to help them keep 
their jobs 
at the rose garden signing ceremony the president said the bill 
embodies a demand from the citizens who pay the bills that you 
will do your share in taking responsibility for your life and for 
the lives of the children you bring into this world 
also present was the chief architect of the bill sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny 
ive been waiting 20 years for this day said the exultant 
senator following the ceremony he said he hoped its features would 
take hold fully by the end of the century 
under the complex legislation various programs have differing 
starting dates 
if by the end of the century we havent changed this system 
it will be a big disappointment it has taken a generation to get 
here it takes at least a half a generation to get out of it 
moynihan said 
the legislation contains the most sweeping revision of the 
nations principal welfare program aid to families with dependent 
children since it was created in 1935 currently the 
federalstate welfare program serves 37 million families

homeless groups trying to obtain surplus 
government property are running up against reluctant federal 
officials despite a court order stopping the sale of real estate 
that otherwise might provide shelter 
witnesses before a congressional subcommittee testified thursday 
that efforts to gain 10 acres of surplus property in new jersey met 
with a string of refusals they said a crisis is brewing with 
working homeless camping in regional parks outside the nations 
capital 
members of the house government operations subcommittee on 
government activities and transportation scolded administration 
officials for failing to make surplus real estate and buildings 
available to the homeless and called for an investigation of the 
interagency council on the homeless which was set up to lead the 
effort against homelessness 
the hearing followed an order sept 30 by us district judge 
oliver gasch barring the sale of surplus federal buildings covered 
by the 1987 mckinney act until housing and urban development 
officials determine which ones can be used for programs to help the 
homeless 
maria fascarinis attorney for the national coalition for the 
homeless which filed the federal suit said homelessness has 
exploded around the country with the number increasing 25 percent 
to 3 million last year 
while pursuing policies that cause and exacerbate 
homelessness the current administration has refused to take any 
remedial action to address what is now clearly a national 
catastrophe ms fascarinis told the subcommittee 
rep cardiss collins dill subcommittee chairwoman told 
general services agency acting administrator richard g austin 
it seems to me that your results have been awfully awfully 
small 
the agency has identified only 12 properties that might be used 
by the homeless and some of those have since been withdrawn by the 
agencies controlling them austin acknowledged 
he said 335 properties making up 28936 acres are in the gsas 
excess and surplus property inventory and since the court order 
the agency has been reviewing them with hud to determine which 
might be suitable for the homeless the order requires that hud 
rather than agencies owning the surplus properties determine which 
might be used 
austin said a useable property would require available 
electricity plumbing heating and day and night access 
he acknowledged that some gsa officials had been 
overenthusiastic in turning down a homeless groups application 
for the 10acre plot in edison nj and said the issue would be 
taken up again with local officials who want the property for other 
uses 
robert nasdor spokesman for the middlesex interfaith partners 
with the homeless said about 90 families are being put up by the 
government in motels in the edison area at a cost of up to 2400 a 
month for room rent 
the effect of living in these facilities on families is 
devastating nasdor said 
gsa has scheduled a public meeting next tuesday in edison to 
consider proposals by the city and others for use of the property 
which has been declared surplus and is under gsa jurisdiction 
rep howard nielson rutah challenged austin to be more 
aggressive in seeking federal property for the homeless 
nielson said congress in passing the mckinney act last year 
clearly intended that the homeless problem be given high priority 
i would suggest that you be much more aggressive with other 
agencies put a little pressure on them to set some property 
aside nielsen told austin 
victoria luna of the metropolitan washington union of the 
homeless testified that scores of working homeless are living in 
parks in washingtons virginia suburbs she said many are 
construction workers from west virginia kentucky and ohio who make 
good money but not good enough to pay the washington areas 
inflated rents 
we have a crisis here the regional parks will be closing this 
month and winter is coming said mrs luna

organic farming can yield real and 
significant environmental and health benefits but the jury is 
still out on whether it pays farmers to adopt such a strategy two 
analysts write 
more research designed to increase the profitability of 
alternative agriculture deserves serious consideration wrote the 
analysts pierre r crosson and janet ekey ostrov 
farmers receive few of the environmental benefits of 
alternative agriculture because many of these such as improved 
water quality occur off the farm or like improved wildlife 
habitat cannot be captured in economic terms they wrote in a 
newsletter of resources for the future a washingtonbased 
environmental policy research organization 
consequently farmers decide to adopt alternative agriculture 
or stay with the conventional system by comparing the economics of 
the two 
organic farmers who tend more and more to call themselves 
alternative or lowinput farmers use few chemical 
pesticides and fertilizers and some use none at all 
endorsing the call for more research two prominent figures in 
the alterative farming movement said crosson and ostrov were too 
cautious about the economic benefits to farmers using lowinput 
techniques 
i have been on too many of these farms not to know that they 
can be very very profitable said garth youngbird director of 
the institute for alternative agriculture in beltsville md 
economists havent really looked at this 
at the rodale organization in emmaus pa editor george de 
vault gave a simple example instead of broadcasting a herbicide 
use it in strips a foot wide down the row fertilizer costs are 
cut by twothirds if the plant is in rows 36 inches apart you 
still cultivate between the rows he said 
the crossonostrov article said research was particularly needed 
on weed control since a main source of the disadvantages is the 
difficulty of controlling weeds without herbicides and on 
wildlife habitat which has not been systematically studied to 
compare conventional and alternative farming 
pesticide contamination of ground water by 73 compounds has been 
found in 34 states and there are many predictions that more will 
be found simply because people are looking for it more 
but crosson and ostrov said concentrations were seldom high 
enough to threaten health and data on surfacewater contamination 
were even scarcer than gound water contamination in light of the 
uncertainties it is therefore impossible to judge whether the 
reduced use of pesticides with alternative agriculture would 
generate enough water quality benefits to offset the higher 
economic costs 
however they said some offset seems likely 
they also noted that heavy use of manure can cause the same 
problems of excess nitrates in water supplies as the use of 
synthetic compounds however they said soil conservation 
practices typical of most alternative farming methods may reduce 
phosphorous runoff to surface water 
socalled conservation tillage now practiced by a third of the 
nations farms leaves a large fraction of the crop residue on the 
soil to keep it in place but is not generally counted as a 
lowinput technique because it relies on herbicides at least 
as much as and often more than conventional tillage its 
benefits might be bought at a higher environmental price 
there is little evidence that pesticide residues in food are a 
serious threat to health the article said a national research 
council study last year concluded that in the theoretical worst 
case pesticides in food increase the average chance of getting 
cancer by six in a thousand and more likely one in a thousand 
the greatest harm from pesticides falls on users deaths from 
pesticides by accident homicide and suicide are estimated to have 
been several hundred per year in the 1970s estimated illnesses 
from pesticide poisonings at that time were in the tens of 
thousands the fact that alternative agriculture would 
drastically reduce if not eliminate these human costs of handling 
pesticides probably is its most important environmental advantage

a twoyear effort by congress to pass the most 
sweeping restructuring of the nations financial system in 50 years 
has been killed by a jurisdictional dispute in the house 
the house banking committee chaired by rep fernand j st 
germain dri and the energy and commerce committee chaired by 
rep john dingell dmich had passed competing versions of 
legislation permitting bank holding companies to underwrite 
securities for the first time since passage of the depressionera 
glasssteagall act 
after three weeks of fruitless negotiations between the two 
committees st germain sought to persuade house speaker jim wright 
dtexas to permit the full house to vote on his version of the 
bill 
but wright in a private meeting thursday with democratic 
members of the banking and rules committees refused to settle the 
dispute congress is planning to adjourn next week 
its obvious were not going to be able to move much further 
on the banking bill in this congress st germain said 
however wright has agreed to define more specifically which 
sections of a banking bill would be sent to dingell next year 
since i do not anticipate any major changes on my committee 
i think its safe to assume we can act very expeditiously at 
the beginning of the next congress st germain said in a 
telephone interview its our hope that we do not have a 
repetition of the impasse 
rep doug barnard dga an advocate of expanded banking 
powers said i feel that a different direction will be taken 
next year 
meanwhile in the senate banking committee staff director 
kenneth a mclean said a strategy by chairman william proxmire 
dwis to bypass the jurisdictional tangle in the house is all but 
dead 
proxmire had hoped that repassing the senate bill approved in 
march and attaching it to an unrelated banking bill would have 
given his counterparts in the house a vehicle to circumvent dingell 
however his plan was thwarted by sen alfonse damato rny 
a strong advocate of the securities industrys views he threatened 
to tie up the bill in lengthy debate 
the deadlock means nearly two years of maneuvering and hearings 
have fizzled with no result 
the senate with only two members including damato voting no 
passed legislation in march broadly expanding banks securities 
powers and named it after proxmire who is retiring after 30 years 
in the senate 
the banking industry which strongly supported the senate bill 
began to lose interest when st germain in july added proconsumer 
provisions bankers considered too expensive including requirements 
that banks cash government checks for noncustomers and provide 
lowcost checking accounts for poor people 
dingells version adopted by his committee three weeks ago was 
even less appealing to banks and would not as st germains bill 
would permit bank underwriting of corporate bonds and mutual funds 
in the end more special interests were favoring no legislation 
rather than any likely compromise only the insurance industry 
stood to gain because under most of the proposals banks would have 
been hindered from entering their business 
some legislators fear that in the absence of congressional 
action the courts and regulatory agencies will grant banks new 
powers through loopholes 
the marketplace continues to change and evolve its clear the 
federal reserve will move ahead in the securities area and its 
clear the courts have already given the green light said edward 
yingling top lobbyist for the american bankers association 
wright in a letter thursday appeared to warn fed chairman alan 
greenspan against precipitous deregulation 
any change in the provisions of the law is rightfully a 
legislative concern wright said be assured that the 
legislative branch of the government will fulfill its 
responsibilities

classrooms libraries and laboratories at the 
nations colleges and universities are deteriorating and it could 
take 70 billion to shape up americas campuses a report says 
schools are facing repairs not just to older buildings but also 
to newer buildings that were not as well constructed said 
consultant sean rush who worked on the survey released thursday by 
two associations of school officials 
we know now that the cost of modernizing and maintaining 
higher education facilities is grossly misunderstood 
underestimated and underfunded said walter a schaw executive 
vice president of the association of physical plant administrators 
which cosponsored the study with the national association of 
college and university business officers 
schaw said in an interview that ordinary repairs in masonry 
electrical systems plumbing roofing and other parts of buildings 
urgently need attention on most campuses while some schools have 
outdated classrooms and laboratories that need to be replaced 
others have buildings with serious hidden problems such as 
termites he said 
the report the decaying american campus a ticking time 
bomb was prepared by the accounting firm coopers amp lybrand 
based on responses to a 16page survey sent to 702 institutions 
estimates of the total problem were extrapolated from 217 responses 
to the survey 
we are not allocating enough funds to properly maintain 
existing structures let alone renew the laboratories libraries 
and classrooms necessary to provide a quality education for our 
young people said schaw 
in some cases cost cutting has made problems worse he said 
as an example he cited doric columns at the university of 
maryland at college park which for want of 8000 worth of painting 
through the years will have to be replaced at a cost of 350000 
on the other hand he said the same university has paid for recent 
dormitory renovation with energysaving measures 
just like a car and house it costs more to repair if you put 
it off the longer you wait the worse the problem is he said 
the survey concluded that the policy of deferring expenses for 
needed repairs and maintenance has led to an estimated 20 billion 
backlog of urgently needed work 
potential need could reach between 60 billion and 70 billion 
the report said 
schaw said the survey estimates that based on 100 per square 
foot in replacement value facilities on the nations more than 
3300 institutions of higher education are worth 300 billion 
the capital renewal and replacement needs of our colleges and 
universities are a ticking time bomb said caspa l harris jr 
executive vice president of the business officers group the 
problem is here and now and it has to be addressed 
the study estimates that institutions budgeted 12 billion for 
repair and maintenance this year onefourth of the need 
it says that although the number of square feet of campus 
facility space has increased by more than 50 percent since 1970 
the share of university and college budgets given to the physical 
plant has remained almost constant

iran has not stopped and searched a 
merchant ship in the persian gulf since its aug 20 ceasefire with 
iraq shipping sources say a sign of easing tensions in the gulf 
after eight years of war 
it seems peace has finally come to the waters of the gulf 
said one official speaking on condition of anonymity 
iranian warships have continued interrogating vessels by radio 
demanding to know their cargoes and destinations but even those 
symbolic interceptions are now down to onethird of what they were 
immediately after the ceasefire took hold said the shipping 
monitors speaking on condition of anonymity 
both countries have reported efforts to reopen ports closed by 
the iraniraq war and iraq said about a dozen of the 18 vessels 
trapped in the the ports of umm qasr and khor alzubair since the 
start of the war have been able to sail out 
the shipping monitors said the iranians have not harassed any 
vessel in the strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf since they 
claimed to have intercepted the iraqi freighter khawla as it 
entered the waterway hours after ceasefire took effect aug 20 
after docking at umm qasr the freighter sailed out through 
hormuz without hindrance last month carrying a cargo of fertilizer 
several iraqi ships have sailed the gulf without interference 
since the ceasefire the official iraqi news agency has reported 
gulfbased officials of two shipping companies said their 
vessels have not encountered any iranian gunboats in recent weeks 
and believe that tehran has halted the stopandsearch 
interceptions 
shipping officials reported that traffic in the gulf has not 
noticably increased since the ceasefire while shippers wait to 
see what happens 
during the fighting iranian warships and gunboats intercepted 
hundreds of vessels entering the gulf through hormuz to determine 
if they were carrying warrelated materiel to iraq several were 
seized and inspected 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati said oct 8 that in 
an effort to break the deadlock in the peace negotiations iran has 
agreed to drop its right to search ships in the strait of 
hormuz 
officials at the united nations said that was part of a 
compromise proposed by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar who has said he expects the talks to resume in geneva 
sometime during the last week of this month 
the earlier negotiations in geneva and new york stalled over 
iraqs demand the iranians halt ship searches and iraqs insistence 
the shatt alarab which forms the southern boundary between the 
two countries be reopened 
iran has refused to agree to unblock the waterway iraqs 
primary outlet to the gulf until baghdad concedes that a 1975 
treaty drawing the border down the middle of the shatt alarab 
instead of along the eastern iranian bank is still valid 
iraqi officials have denied baghdad has agreed in principle to a 
compromise under which troops would be withdrawn to the prewar 
border and prisoners exchanged within 15 days 
the iranians recent actions have helped make the gulf through 
which onefifth of the noncommunist worlds oil supplies pass a 
safer place 
the two sides attacked nearly 550 merchant vessels in the gulf 
during the socalled tanker war killing more than 300 seamen 
us british and other western warships still patrol the gulf 
but the americans have halted closein escorts of convoys of 
usflagged vessels as the danger of iranian attack has receded

delfin perez for about 40 minutes 
algarin said he had offered to give the man a helicopter but

japan clearly has become a major investor in 
foreign countries but it is not clear how much this has increased 
its influence in those countries congress was told 
the japanese are well behind britain and the netherlands as 
direct investors in us real estate buildings and factories 
deputy assistant secretary of state william clark told a 
congressional panel thursday 
japanese hold 31 billion worth of such investments in the 
united states compared to similar us investments in japan of 
about 18 billion clark did not have the figures for british and 
dutch investments in the united states but noted that the total of 
us worldwide foreign investments far exceeds those of any other 
country 
potentially more worrisome than japanese direct investments 
clark said are japanese holdings of us treasury debt but 
actually one looks at that as a vote of confidence in a safe 
place to put your money he added 
asked by rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house of 
representatives asiapacific subcommittee if japan has or might use 
its us debt holdings for political influence clark replied 
there hasnt been any movement in or out to try to influence

security and democracy in the western 
hemisphere will be weakened unless action is taken against the 
increase in poverty according to a report prepared for secretary 
of state george p shultz and other diplomatic leaders of the 
americas 
a draft of the report from the economic and social council of 
the organization of american states made available to reporters 
this week in advance of the oas general assembly meeting scheduled 
in san salvador on nov 14 blamed increased poverty on 
adjustment policies adopted in many countries to deal with 
latin americas 415 billion foreign debt 
it said efforts by latin american governments to earn hard 
currency which is needed for interest on the debt and to reduce 
government spending has resulted in a sudden reduction of a 
series of social services which had benefited the poorest sectors 
and a dramatic reduction in public investment to ease the extreme 
poverty of the region in the medium term 
the report saw encouragement in a recent tendency of some 
financial institutions to make distinctions for the benfit of the 
poorest people it did not name the institutions the statement may 
refer to the international monetary fund and to the paris club 
of creditor governments which have been taking measures to ease the 
debt of the poorest countries

michael dukakis fingerjabbing sternness was 
gone and george bushs syntax was uncharacteristically ungarbled 
what the american viewers saw instead were two fellows who say 
they are optimistic about their country know the sorrow of losing 
a child and are committed to certain basic values of american life 
occasionally these rivals even acted nice to one another they 
appeared eager to be courteous each holding up a hand for silence 
when their supporters booed or clapped contrary to the predebate 
entreaties of the organizers 
both candidates went into their second facetoface debate with 
an avowed goal to show how personable they could be 
bush said his goal was to show people his heartbeat dukakis 
adviser rep tony coelho dcalif said his candidate had to 
undertake a conversation with the american people 
from the start of thursday nights presidential debate on the 
ucla campus the two candidates appeared to be making that effort 
bush demonstrating how relaxed he was and dukakis looking for ways 
to show that he cared about people 
in the affability category both candidates made strides over 
their performances in last months first debate in north carolina 
dukakis often accused of being grim and robotic smiled a lot he 
used gestures that were more expansive than his trademark jabbing 
thumb 
bush mangled his sentences less often than usual 
he smiled easily and often showing an aw shucks attitude 
he clearly took the honors in folksiness 
asked about the socalled sleaze factor in the reagan 
administration and whether he would work to ban people from 
lobbying government agencies they once worked in bush said he 
would 
then cocking his head and smiling as if telling a secret he 
added you see i am one who i get kidded by being a little old 
fashioned on these things but i do believe in public service 
the debate was short on the kind of slashing oneliners that 
characterized the north carolina faceoff the zingers were still 
there but they were repackaged and delivered with a smile 
when the issue of abortion came up both took advantage of 
opportunities to reveal themselves by talking about their children 
who had died bush who rarely discusses the leukemia death of his 
young daughter robin told matteroffactly how he learned the 
news 
the doctor said beautiful child your child has a few weeks 
to live he said after her parents took her to a new york 
specialist the child stayed alive for six months and then died 
dukakis said kitty and i had very much the same kind of 
experience the bushes had we lost a baby lived about 20 minutes 
after it was born 
but dukakis went on to say it should be the mothers choice 
whether to abort 
dukakis answered without visible emotion when asked whether he 
would favor the death penalty should his wife be raped and 
murdered he responded negatively passing over the chance to 
personalize the answer or mention his wife 
and bush in response to a question about whether he could think 
of anything good to say about his rival complimented dukakis for 
his pride in his family and greek heritage 
dukakis in reply managed to get in a dig about bushs favorite 
label for him saying that bush for once hadnt used the word 
liberal or left one time i thank you for that he said 
he went on to say that there are things which all of us 
believe in we may have different approaches we may think that you 
deal with them in different ways but theyre basically american i 
believe in them george bush believes in them

swarms of socalled killer bees will 
reach the united states within 1 years and they appear to be a 
more formidable threat than originally expected scientists report 
its going to keep coming at us no matter what we do 
university of kansas insect ecologist orley taylor said at the 
american bee research conference 
experts predict that the dreaded africanized bees making their 
way north through mexico will reach the brownsville area at the 
southern tip of texas in the early spring of 1990 and possibly 
reach california four years later 
the bees have killed at least 350 people in central and south 
america jim tew director of the international beekeeping program 
at ohio state universitys agricultural technical institute said 
earlier this year 
more than 50 bee experts from as far away as yugoslavia gathered 
in weslaco a city on the mexican border for the conference which 
concluded thursday 
scientists are trying to determine what substances can be used 
to repel the bees said anita collins of the us department of 
agricultures research office here 
collins said one motivation for her research was being chased 
for long distances by hundreds of bees while studying them in 
venezuela 
i reached the point where i wanted to say something besides 
run like hell she said 
scientists and beekeepers have been worried since the accidental 
release in 1956 of 20 to 30 swarms of africanized bees in brazil 
the bees tend to be more defensive around hives and tend to more 
aggressively attack and pursue people than the gentler bees of 
european descent raised in the americas 
that behavior has brought the popular nickname killer bees 
a term shunned by scientists and beekeepers the prospect of hordes 
of attacking bees inspired a 1978 horror film the swarm and 
comedy skits on saturday night live 
scientists had assumed the africanized bees would become 
europeanized by mating with the gentler variety and thus lose 
their propensity to sting in potentially deadly swarms 
but in the most surprising finding of the conference 
researchers reported that the dilution of africanized genes appears 
only to be temporary and that the bees genetic makeup eventually 
becomes almost purely africanized again in the wild swarms that 
have spread up through central america and southeastern mexico 
this african population is going to reach the us virtually 
unchanged taylor said 
the bees are spreading at the rate of about 300 miles a year and 
are expected to reach brownsville in march 1990 said jose villa of 
the agriculture departments agricultural research service in baton 
rouge la and juan labougle of the universidad autonoma de mexico 
villa said the bees first arrived in the southern mexican state 
of chiapas two years ago and should arrive in tampico within seven 
months tampico is about 280 miles south of brownsville 
taylor also projected the bees arrival in south texas by spring 
1990 but said climate distance and lack of suitable habitat will 
delay their arrival in arizona until about 1993 it would be 1994 
before they reached california he said adding he is only able to 
make coarse projections 
this african population is rapidly reproducing and truly 
selfsustaining taylor said 
researchers said one way to reduce the africanized bees 
influence is to kill colonies they have infiltrated 
but lowincome mexican beekeepers have resisted because they 
cannot afford to replace their bees said elba quintero of the 
mexico city office of the usdas animal and plant health inspection 
service 
that has created quite a problem convincing the beekeepers 
that they need to destroy the colonies she said

george bush is quitting the debate game and 
just when hes hitting his stride 
democrat michael dukakis was solid and smooth in the debate 
finale in los angeles even if his refrain of complaints about 
being called a liberal did take on a plaintive air 
but nothing the massachusetts governor managed during 90 crucial 
minutes on national television is likely to shake the republican 
edge in the public opinion polls that bush margin is magnified 
when translated into the electoral votes that will select a new 
president in 25 days 
the presidential rivals have heard so much negative reaction to 
negative campaigning that they even spoke kindly of each other 
bush acknowledging that campaigns sometimes do generate more heat 
than light 
neither man erred or misspoke bush seemed more assured and at 
ease than in the first debate on sept 25 dukakis remembered to 
be likable he smiled often and offered i think im a reasonably 
likable guy 
the vice president had slipped on his tongue now and then in the 
first debate not this time 
the instant pollsters had given dukakis the edge last time 
although it didnt translate into support in later surveys this 
time an abc news poll rated bush the winner 49 percent to 33 
percent with the rest calling it even a poll by the los angeles 
times also gave it to bush 47 percent to 26 percent with the 
remainder unsure 
and that was dukakis last chance to get at the vice president 
face to face he needed a breakthrough something to turn the 
campaign his way that will be even more difficult to find now as 
the candidates return to their solo campaigns and almost surely 
to accentuating the negatives about each other 
in politics nothing is forever so the debate produced only one 
certainty that there will be no more 
i will not agree to another debate bush said when asked 
whether he would meet dukakis again in order to deal with 
complaints that the campaign is trivial superficial and negative 
dukakis wanted at least three debates he wanted them closer to 
election day and he wanted them wide open with the candidates 
confronting each other directly the bush campaign limited the 
schedule and set the terms with the implicit threat that if 
dukakis balked there wouldnt be any debates at all 
ironically the forum the bush campaign insisted on limiting now 
appears to have worked to the vice presidents advantage although 
he went into the dual debates with more to risk but thats it for 
the season 
there will be no more debates bush said we dont 
need any more debates 
the rest of the way he will do it alone future dukakis campaign 
salvoes will be aimed from a distance and there is not much time 
for any new potentially telling democratic campaign themes to take 
root and produce the turn dukakis needs 
theres no evidence of any such weaponry in the dukakis arsenal 
anyhow he unveiled nothing new in the surprisefree debate 
instead like bush he retold old themes that included a 
predictable bush defense and a predictable dukakis attack on sen 
dan quayle the republican vice presidential nominee 
he accused bush of changing his tune on such issues as the 
environment and social security i dont know which george bush 
im listening to he said but it was hardly the kind of punch he 
needed 
bush spent a good share of his time depicting dukakis as a 
liberal too liberal to support the death penalty to assure a 
strong national defense to be trusted with supreme court 
appointments 
dukakis repeatedly complained about it i dont think these 
labels mean a thing he said at one point lets stop 
labeling each other 
at another 
mr bush has used the label liberal at least 10 times 
and again 
if i had a dollar george for every time you used that label 
id qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want 
to give away 
it certainly would add up because bush will be using it again 
and again all the way to the polls on nov 8

the couple whose troubles raising college 
money for their daughter were mentioned by michael dukakis in the 
presidential debate are white middleclass americans who have 
been left out says the mother of that 18yearold student 
in thursday nights presidential debate with george bush 
dukakis mentioned an unnamed family from longview texas two 
teachers a mother and a father who have a child thats a freshman 
in college whos an electrical engineering major a very bright 
student and they cant afford to keep that child in college 
having been alerted by dukakis aides that they might be 
mentioned bea and bill scantlin watched and waited to be 
mentioned daughter tracy had the event taped because she was 
pledging a sorority 
a firstyear student at tyler junior college tracy has been 
told repeatedly she does not qualify for financial aid my 
parents made too much money to get loans she said 
in fact last week she had an interview with a counselor 
mrs scantlin said he told her again there was no avenue open 
for the middle class 
there are scholarships available for straighta students 
she said shes a bplus student were not low income and were 
not minority so were going to just wing it 
eventually tracy wants to go to texas aampm said mrs scantlin 
but were saving money by going to tyler right now 
she estimated that the final cost for tracys college education 
would be about 25000 for five years 
she said the junior college was costing the family about 2000 
per semester a total that tracys parttime job as a secretarial 
assistant in the campus police department wont do much to defray 
i think its a reflection of the disregard of the needs of the 
middle class mrs scantlin said of her familys financial aid 
dilemma we found that we were not low income we were not black 
not hispanic were white middleclass americans who have been left 
out 
basically thats what i told gov dukakis because i felt 
middleincome america had been callously disregarded mrs 
scantlin said describing the letter she wrote him two weeks ago 
praising his student loan repayment program 
the dukakis plan that impressed mrs scantlin called the 
student tuition and repayment system allows students to pay back 
college loans through payroll deductions in their working years 
the plan would supplement not replace existing federal grants and 
loans at least at the start dukakis says students would get 
stars loans from banks 
bush proposes a taxfree us savings bonds program to help 
families pay soaring college costs this would eventually cost the 
treasury 200 million a year the tax break would be phased out for 
families earning 60000 to 80000 or above 
the scantlins have three other daughters all of them older than 
tracy two went to college one with federal assistance

custody today as police and federal agents continued sweeps across 
the country aimed at breaking up violent drug rings that 
authorities blame for 1400 murders

the verdict from barry goldwater richard 
nixon and jimmy carter was unanimous the 1988 presidential 
campaign has been a discouraging lowlevel affair 
but presidential candidates george bush and michael dukakis 
defended the conduct of their campaigns in the final debate 
thursday bush said the press has been more interested in the polls 
than the issues and dukakis said he hungered to talk about issues 
not labels such as the liberal tag which bush has repeatedly 
pinned on him 
as in nearly every other topic in their debate bush and dukakis 
didnt see the issue of negative campaigning in exactly the same 
light they did sound alike in one regard each suggesting the 
other was to blame for the mudslinging tone of the presidential 
campaign 
i dont want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard by saying 
he started it but take a look at the democratic convention 
bush said 
do you remember the senator from boston sen edward kennedy 
dmass chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady 
from texas state treasurer anne richards that was on there i 
mean come on this was just outrageous but ill try harder to 
keep it on a higher plane bush said 
and im not the one that compared the president of the united 
states rotting like a dead fish from the head down i didnt do 
that bush said 
but dukakis blamed the tone of the campaign on such things as 
bushs visit to a flag factory to revive attention to his criticism 
of dukakis veto of a pledge of allegiance bill and bushs repeated 
description of him as a liberal 
weve heard it again tonight and im not surprised the 
labels dukakis said i guess the vice president two or three 
times said i was coming from the left this is something 
republicans have used for a long time they tried it with franklin 
roosevelt and harry truman and john kennedy 
i dont think these labels mean a thing and i would hope that 
tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign we can have good 
solid disagreements on issues dukakis said 
im not keeping count but i think mr bush has used the label 
liberal at least 10 times if i had a dollar george for every 
time you used that label id qualify for one of those tax breaks 
for the rich that you want to give away dukakis needled later 
neither bush nor dukakis referred directly to the most negative 
television commercials the other campaign has been airing in recent 
weeks bushs ads on pollution in boston harbor or dukakis ads 
depicting backroom political packaging of bush but bush did 
cautiously criticize the news media for its role in setting the 
tone of the campaign 
responding to a question from nbc news reporter andrea mitchell 
who quoted nixons description of the presidential campaign as 
trivial superficial and inane and goldwaters complaint that 
bush wasnt discussing the issues the vice president said it 
wasnt that he and dukakis didnt discuss issues so much as the 
press was not reporting them 
i went all across central illinois and spoke about 
agricultural issues about seven stops bush said and not one 
thing did i see with respect on your network about my views on 
agriculture and not one did i read in any newspaper 
why because you are so interested in a poll that might have 
been coming out or because somebody had said something nasty about 
somebody else bush said we put out position paper after 
position paper he puts out position paper after position paper 
which get minimal coverage so i think we can all share with 
respect in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out 
bush did talk about agriculture during his illinois tour on 
sept 28 but he also stressed his opposition to the plans of 
dukakis an inexperienced liberal governor to beef up the 
internal revenue service to collect unpaid taxes 
he wants to squeeze another 35 billion bucks out of the 
taxpayers pockets bush said 
during that swing bush also noted democratic reaction to his 
attacks on dukakis veto of the bill to require public school 
teachers to lead students in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
saying the liberals hate it they cant stand it but i am right 
and i am with the american people on this

more than six dozen illegal aliens 
including three tearful children were found by authorities in a 
house that served as a debtors prison for immigrants who could not 
pay their smugglers 
ninetyone people were discovered in the house when it was 
raided by the us immigration and naturalization service and 14 
were suspected of being the smugglers authorities said 
all the aliens were from mexico and owed from 300 to whatever 
the market would bear to the smugglers known as coyotes tom 
gaines an assistant district director for the ins said thursday 
neighbors noticed the coming and going of strangers and numerous 
cars at the rental home beginning about three weeks ago said donna 
gimondo who lives next door to the threebedroom house in this los 
angeles suburb 
wed see three or four as many as five get in a car and it 
would be gone a half an hour and then just the driver would come 
back she said 
she said the household was mostly quiet but on trash days 
there would be just this humongous pile of trash outside 
twelve of those arrested were arraigned wednesday on conspiracy 
and illegal immigrant smuggling charges two are juveniles and will 
be deported authorities said 
ins officers raided the home sunday as part of a fourmonth 
investigation into an alleged alien smuggling ring gaines said 
some of them had just arrived some had been there a couple of 
days he said there were no guns found in the house the 
smugglers just had guards at every door it was plain intimidation 
to keep them there 
in similar cases illegal aliens who cannot pay their smugglers 
try to get word of their plight and need of money to relatives 
authorities say 
ms gimondo who witnessed the raid said the people in the 
house did not try to flee and she saw only two people in 
handcuffs she saw one family that included a mother father and 
three children 
one kid was 3 to 6 months old and the mother had him cuddled 
in a blanket she said one was about 2 to 3 years old and the 
oldest was a 4yearold boy all were crying 
while she thought there may have been as many as 30 people in 
the home i was quite shocked that there were so many in the 
house and quite relieved that it was cleared up she said 
helen sklar of the national center of immigrant rights in los 
angeles predicted such situations will continue 
her organization has been critical of the ins and immigration 
laws saying they dont address the social problems that make 
people desperate enough to try illegal entry into the united states 
the law considers the pull factor and not the push factor 
she said

night in los angeles between george bush and michael dukakis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
dukakis said any promise by bush not to raise taxes is not 
worth the paper its printed on because bush has gone along with 
tax increases under the reagan administration bush said the way 
you kill expansion is to raise taxes and in his final statement 
added that i want to hold the line on taxes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush said he would have no ideological litmus test for 
appointing supreme court judges but i dont want to see us going 
to a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the bench 
dukakis said he has appointed more than 130 people as judges and 
when bush praised president reagans appointments to the high court 
dukakis mentioned robert bork critically 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush strongly defended his vice presidential running mate dan 
quayle and said he could do the job if tragedy thrust him into 
the oval office dukakis replied that bush had said in advance that 
the selection would tell alland it sure did 
</TEXT>

we have to have modernization if were going to negotiate with 
the soviets bush said dukakis said military security and 
economic security go hand in hand and theres no way we can 
build all the weapons systems bush wants built 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
dukakis unequivocally opposed the death penalty even when he 
was presented with a hypothetical question in which his wife 
kitty was depicted as a crime victim bush said he supported the 
death penalty for heinous crimes and called this a big 
difference with his opponent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush talked about the loss of one of his children to leukemia to 
answer a question about abortions carried out because the mother 
knows the child would otherwise be born with a fatal illness i 
dont think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge 
at the time he said dukakis said he and kitty had a child that 
died 20 minutes after birth but he said the question is not what 
to do but who makes the decision 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush vowed hed never cut the federal pension program no matter 
what dukakis said the democrat cited reagan administration efforts 
to do just that and said im sure youll try to do it again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush said dukakis campaigned as a leftleaning liberal during 
the primary campaign and now is showing himself as more moderate 
he also said the highly personal attacks from both sides originated 
with the digs at bush during the democratic national convention and 
dukakis comment that a fish rots from the head first in 
reference to legal problems among reagan administration figures 
its not labels its our vision of america dukakis said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
i think this is a great country because weve always wanted to

surrounded by balloons toys and stuffed 
animals little jessica mcclure has recovered from her tumble into 
an abandoned well a year ago today which began a 58hour ordeal 
that touched millions worldwide 
shes doing beautifully said mcclure family spokesman pete 
snelson shes talking up a storm her foots fine and her 
forehead is looking great and shes an active 2yearold 
jessica now 2 suffered a pressure wound to her forehead and 
right foot that required the amputation of her right little toe and 
the tip of the big toe 
if she walked without shoes you would notice a difference in 
her walk but not much said orthopedic surgeon charles younger 
who performed the amputations after her rescue last oct 16 
jessica captured the worlds attention last year when she cried 
for her mother and softly sang nursery rhymes while volunteers 
drilled through 22 feet of hard rock to rescue her from the dark 
8inchwide well shaft 
the deluge of letters getwell cards balloons and dolls has 
long since stopped at midland memorial hospital where jessica 
spent five weeks recovering 
everybody adopted that child whether they were a parent or a 
grandparent or someone her age said kimberly modisett director 
of volunteers at the hospital 
the hospital also was inundated with phone calls from people the 
world over with tips on how to treat the 18monthold girl about 
50 doctors mostly from south america offered to send leeches 
which they said would increase circulation in jessicas endangered 
foot said hospital spokeswoman sue ristom 
during the first three weeks doctors feared they would have to 
amputate the entire foot which was wedged next to the toddlers 
head during the ordeal but after at least six operations and 
treatments in a pressurized oxygen tank with no leeches jessica 
went home less only 1 toes and with a small scar on her forehead 
snelson and younger said jessica doesnt appear to remember the 
ordeal and does not suffer from nightmares fear of the dark or 
other phobias 
jessica was playing with other children in her aunts back yard 
when somehow she fell down the well whose shaft had been covered 
by a large rock and became wedged 22 feet underground 
volunteers drilled a shaft parallel to the well their progress 
made agonizingly slow because the hard rock dulled even 
diamondtipped drill bits after two days of drilling they made a 
horizontal shaft just under jessica and plucked her out 
during the effort paramedics blew warm air into the shaft to 
keep the girl comfortable and a television crew lowered a 
microphone at times she cried for her mother and once she was 
heard softly singing winniethepooh 
jessicas plight distracted the oildependent city from its 
economic problems as hundreds of volunteers rushed to lend 
equipment drill the rescue shaft and feed journalists and others 
a group called the midland spirit committee organized a 
celebratory parade a few weeks after jessicas rescue and 
commissioned a bronze plaque that jessica is scheduled to unveil 
saturday at a downtown plaza to thank her rescuers 
jessicas parents chip and cissy mcclure both 19 are 
recognized just about everywhere they go snelson said people 
are nice to them but their privacy was taken away he said 
the mcclures have declined most interview requests 
the aftermath of jessicas ordeal was not without controversy 
some midlanders complained that the mcclures have not divulged the 
size of the trust fund for jessica set up to collect thousands of 
unsolicited contributions and mayor carroll thomas had to mediate 
a dispute involving a television movie 
a group of city officials and a group of volunteers tussled over 
the movie rights which the mcclures said they werent interested 
in 
thomas who got both groups to work with producer john cantor 
said he believed the movie was delayed by the hollywood 
scriptwriters strike and is being written now

novelist naguib mahfouz the first arab to 
win the nobel prize in literature is garnering both praise and 
criticism in his native land 
some said he should have received the award long ago others 
criticized his support of the 1979 camp david peace agreement 
between egypt and israel and his book attacking the late president 
gamal abdel nassers domestic and panarabist policies 
mahfouz the first arab writer to win the award in its 87year 
history has vividly portrayed poverty in egypt the swedish 
academy honored him in stockholm thursday with the 1988 prize for 
literature for advancing the art of the novel a relatively new 
genre in arabic literature 
one of his books children of gebelawi has been banned 
since 1959 in his own country because it offended religious 
leaders but the swedish academy cited the book as it awarded the 
prize sayingdifferent norm systems are confronted with tension 
in the description of the conflict between good and evil 
mahfouz 76 son of a cairo civil servant said he was very 
happy and thankful for the arab world for receiving the award 
worth 390000 and inevitable royalties and prestige 
i congratulate the egyptian people that one of its small 
people won a big award but its not too big for egypt he 
said i hope this will be the first step for our literary 
generations we have taken a lot and must now give 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and culture minister farouk 
hosni sent mahfouz congratulating telegrams in jerusalem israel 
television reported foreign minister shimon peres also sent mahfouz 
a congratulatory cable 
poet hamid saeed secretarygeneral of the general federation of 
arab writers and editorinchief of the iraqi newspaper althawra 
in baghdad said mahfouz has long deserved the prize 
farouk mustafa a professor at the university of chicagos 
oriental institute said he should have won it 20 years ago 
actually i think the committee was negligent in the first to 
ignore the longest literary tradition in the whole world which is 
the arabic literary tradition 
but fakhri kawar one of jordans bestknown novelists said he 
believed mahfouz was honored partly because of his relatively 
noncritical position toward israel 
i would like to point out that mahfouzs relationship with 
israel and his writings on camp david have contributed greatly to 
push zionism and help him win that award kawar said 
nevertheless kawar described mahfoud as a great writer a 
giant one he storified egypts history in his best sellers 
which studied carefully the different walks of life in egypt 
hosni frez president of jordans writers association attacked 
mahfouz for opposing egypts late president and advocate of arab 
unity gamal abdel nasser 
not for 1400 years did we have a single man who was equal to 
nasser and this man was always against him frez said 
in all mahfouzs works include 40 novels and collections of 
short stories many of them available in english and other 
languages 
the nobel prizes in medicine physics chemistry and economics 
will be announced next week un peacekeeping forces won the nobel 
peace prize announced sept 29 in oslo norway

george bush and michael dukakis jousted anew 
over the death penalty social security defense environment and 
the merits of robert bork in their final debate of the presidential 
campaign 
neither gave ground or broke any on major issues 
from thursday nights first debate question when dukakis 
reiterated his opposition to the death penalty even if his wife 
kitty were raped and murdered to the close when bush said dukakis 
had his own sleaze to deal with in massachusetts both stuck 
closely to their standard campaign lines 
for the democrat that meant reiterating his allegation that the 
only way bush can pay for new pentagon weapons cutting the capital 
gains tax and keeping other promises is to raid the social 
security trust fund 
but bush insisted he learned the hard way the political 
peril of advocating any cuts or changes in social security and i 
dont want to fool around with it 
maybe down the line youre going to have to look at it 
in the first or second decade of the next century he said but not 
on his watch 
bush accused dukakis of raiding his own states pension fund for 
29 million to balance massachusetts 1988 budget dukakis denied 
the charge and said he was the first governor to move to fully fund 
the states pensions however he did recently use that much in 
surplus pension funds to help balance the states accounts 
on the death penalty dukakis said he is convinced there are 
better deterrents and he said his state of massachusetts boasts 
the biggest drop in crime and the lowest homocide rate of any 
industrial state 
but bush said the death penalty was one of the questions of 
values that separates him from dukakis he said capital 
punishment is especially needed for copkillers 
on taxes bush denied that he was misleading the public with his 
pledge never to raise taxes i want to keep this expansion going 
i dont want to kill it off he said 
dukakis accused bush of breaking his notax pledge three times 
in the past year he derided bushs flexible freeze proposal as 
an economic slurpee but refused to discuss what taxes he would 
raise in a bind 
dukakis who has said he would entertain tax increases only as a 
last resort claimed tougher tax collection could bring in up to 
50 billion a year from cheats and scofflaws without overburdening 
honest taxpayers 
bush asked to name a single military program he would scrap 
singled out an 850 million heavy truck program that he said had 
been forced upon the pentagon by an influential congressman 
bush again depicted dukakis as a liberal and said he ran on 
the left in the democratic primary he also charged the democrats 
started the mudslinging with their personal attacks on me at 
the democratic convention 
dukakis said he would not rule out modernizing the us 
landbased missiles but he defended his opposition to the 
strategic defense initiative and the mobile mx missile there are 
limits to what we can spend he said 
asked about his links to a boston group jobs with peace 
that supposedly favors shifting 25 percent of the military budget 
to domestic programs dukakis at first said i dont happen to 
share that goal but then added that down the road after 
negotiations with the soviets it may be possible to reduce 
military outlays 
bush defended his support of a constitutional amendment to 
outlaw nearly all abortions saying adoption not abortion is the 
alternative for mothers of handicapped children dukakis said the 
woman in the exercise of her own conscience should make that 
decision 
asked if he had a litmus test for who he would appoint to the 
supreme court bush said he would not appoint judges who would 
legislate or give the high court a liberal majority when he 
praised president reagans appointees as outstanding dukakis cited 
robert bork the controversial jurist whom the senate rejected last 
fall 
bush accused dukakis of supporting supply maintenance or 
production controls on farmers and implied dukakis might impose 
a grain embargo on the soviets as jimmy carter once did dukakis 
said he opposed both that grain embargo and the reagan 
administrations pipeline embargo and he said the government 
already has supply management in the form of crop setasides 
dukakis denied that he regards stronger conventional military 
forces as a substitute for the nuclear triad of landseaandair 
missiles 
asked about the serious production problems at the nucler 
weapons plant in savannah river sc dukakis said it was 
another example of misplaced priorities under the reagan 
administration it could cost 25 billion to 100 billion to remedy 
and somebody has to bear the responsibility for this he said 
bush shot back that that was the closest dukakis had ever come 
to supporting anything nuclear he challenged the democrat to 
support construction of a second weapons plant in idaho and to 
back civilian nuclear generating plants 
on the socalled sleaze factor in the reagan administration 
bush said dukakis own former education secretary is in jail in 
massachusetts on corruption charges and some scandalplagued 
college presidents arent exactly holier than thou he said 
ethics in government isnt a partisan issue and he promised to 
seek tougher laws for both the executive and legislative branches

there are two sure ways to find out how many 
friends you really have 
one is to win the lottery 
the other is to be selected as a presidential debate panelist 
nbc white house correspondent andrea mitchell received her 
debate invitation tuesday said yes and then came a duffelbag full 
of question suggestions from all her friends and friends she didnt 
know she had they kept coming at her until thursday night when 
mitchell and three other reporters sat down in front of george bush 
and michael dukakis 
and once the debate started the two behind the podium had the 
easy part 
mitchell was operating on four hours sleep really needed to 
blow her nose with no kleenex in sight and to cap it off nobody 
was answering those wonderful queries she had so slaved over 
this was the toughest thing ive ever been through she said 
afterward the candidates had all week to prepare for this i had 
24 hours 
for mitchell the chance to sit on stage for the last 
presidential debate was a career opportunity yet in accepting 
mitchell also plunged herself into the journalists equivalent of 
the lawyers bar exam having to prove yourself in the space of six 
questions 
these candidates have been asked and have deflected so many 
questions these past many months she said it is a challenge 
to be original you have to try to think of the questions that 
will not elicit the stock answers 
afterward tom brokaw her anchorman hugged her saying you 
were just great abcs david brinkley in his televised debate 
analysis praised the panel for asking thoughtful questions and a 
los angeles policeman came up and asked her for her autograph 
still mitchell wasnt completely satisfied 
going in to the debate she thought she had built a better 
mousetrap coming out she admitted both mice got out alive 
they didnt answer anything she said of bush and dukakis 
i had this terrible letdown because they didnt get off their 
program answers 
she said she was nervous when the cameras started rolling at 
602 pm not only was she representing all of the other hundreds 
of reporters on the campaign trail but she was also sitting as a 
surrogate for millions of voters 
if you screw up youve screwed up in front of 70 million 
people mitchell said and youve missed a great opportunity to 
help the voters understand the men they are voting for 
if mitchell didnt put enough pressure on herself an nbc 
colleague helped telling her dont worry about a thing kid 
the entire election is hanging in the balance 
mitchell didnt back down adding a rare moment of confrontation 
during the debate when she posed a hypothetical question about the 
deficit to dukakis 
dukakis may i disagree with the premise of your question 
mitchell for the sake of argument no

one of the scientists who determined the shroud of 
turin is not christs burial cloth predicted there will still be 
believers church officials said the cloth remains a symbol of 
faith 
cardinal anastasio ballestrero announced in turin on thursday 
that he accepted the results of radiocarbondating tests by three 
laboratories that determined the shroud was made between 1260 and 
1390 not at christs death in about 33 ad 
what remains a mystery is how the shroud came to bear the image 
of what scientists have called a real human form of a whipped and 
crucified man 
professor edward hall who directed the tests at oxford 
university called the cloth a forgery 
all we were doing was simply dating it and once youve dated 
it you know that its a forgery he told a news conference 
thursday undoubtedly there will be some people who will fight 
for its genuine nature still as indeed there are still members of 
the flat earth society 
luigi gonella scientific adviser to the cardinal said the 
church was particularly angered by claims that since the shroud 
dates to medieval times it must be a fake 
believers will be hurt much more by the comments about the 
results than by the results themselves gonella said 
a forgery means it was made for the specific purpose of 
deceiving people this is possible but there is no proof of that 
he said it could be a medieval icon we dont even know how it 
was made 
ballestrero stressed that for the roman catholic church the 
linen cloth remains a venerated object and a powerful symbol of 
faith 
the church believes in the image and not in the history 
because this image of jesus christ is very interesting and the 
people believe very much in jesus he told a news conference at 
the headquarters of his archdiocese 
the sheet 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a 
man with a thorn mark on the head lacerations from flogging on the 
back and bruises on the shoulders 
us scientists who subjected it to rigorous chemical computer 
and photographic analysis in 1981 concluded that it was a real 
human form of a whipped and crucified man and not the product of an 
artist

portauprince haiti ap thousands of demonstrators danced 
and chanted to protest an order by roman catholic church leaders to 
transfer a radical priest out of the country 
also thursday the government said it will close fort dimanche 
haitis most dreaded prison and a symbol of the repressive duvalier 
regime 
for three hours thursday a crowd about 6000 people mostly 
youths from urban slums danced and chanted its way from the 
charred ruins of the st jean bosco church to the headquarters of 
the bishops conference in pacot a wealthy hillside suburb they 
dispersed peacefully 
the church the rev jean bertrand aristides parish was the 
scene of an attack sept 11 by thugs who killed at least 12 people 
wounded 70 and burned the church 
rankandfile soldiers who ousted ruler lt gen henri namphy on 
sept 17 said they were outraged by the attack and blamed namphy 
and former portauprince mayor franck romain for masterminding it 
the demonstration is an opportunity for the haitian people to 
make known that they will not permit the enemies of democracy to 
remove aristide from the battle for the liberation of the 
country the leftist democratic unity confederation one of the 
organizers of the march said in a communique 
aristide in a statement read by the catholicrun radio soleil 
said monday that a messenger from rome brought him a letter 
ordering him to leave haiti by oct 17 stephane francisque a 
social worker and close friend of aristide said the letter ordered 
aristide to report to the parish of sainte claire in montreal 
the haitian bishops conference on sunday condemned the radical 
wing of the church headed by aristide for allegedly preaching 
violence and class warfare 
aristide has received two other transfer orders in the past two 
years but both were canceled following public protests he also 
has been the target of several assassination attempts 
a short communique issued by the armys high command said orders 
were given to shut down fort dimanche located in a marshy area on 
the northwest side of the capital radio stations said the 
communique said soldiers at fort dimanche will be transferred to 
another unit in portauprince 
former political prisoners and human rights groups in haiti say 
hundreds and possibly thousands of people were tortured to death or 
mistreated in the prison under dictator jeanclaude duvalier who 
fled to france in february 1986 dozens have also disappeared 
behind the prisons walls since duvalier left 
the commander of fort dimanche maj isidore pongnon has denied 
he and his men are guilty of human rights violations

studies showing that accutane an acne drug 
derived from vitamin a is as serious a cause of birth defects as 
thalidomide have raised concerns that vitamin a itself might cause 
birth defects a researcher says 
dr edward lammer of the california birth defects monitoring 
program reported thursday that accutane is as hazardous as 
thalidomide causing 40 percent of women to miscarry and 25 percent 
to have children with severe birth defects if the women take it 
early in pregnancy 
thalidomide caused an epidemic of birth defects in europe in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s before it was withdrawn from the market 
in a separate report earlier in the meeting lammer said that 
another drug related to accutane called tegison also appears to 
cause birth defects 
tegison or etretinate made by hoffmannla roche of nutley 
nj additionally has the unfortunate ability to remain in the 
body for as long as two years after women stop taking it lammer 
reported 
it poses a risk of birth defects even for people who stop 
using it before they conceive he said the drug is used to treat 
psoriasis 
both accutane and tegison are derivatives of vitamin a lammer 
said that raises the possibility that vitamin a itself might cause 
birth defects 
that is especially troubling because many multiple vitamin 
supplements intended to be taken during pregnancy contain vitamin 
a lammer said he said there is little evidence that vitamin a has 
any benefits in pregnant women 
since accutane was approved in the united states in late 1982 
it has been linked to cases of miscarriage or birth defects in 25 
states lammer said 
in a presentation in new orleans at the annual meeting of the 
american society of human genetics lammer reported that 
miscarriages occurred in 12 of 30 women studied or 40 percent 
major birth defects occurred in 12 of 48 women studied or 25 
percent he said 
these unusually high risks are comparable to those posed by 
the thalidomide exposure lammer said 
dr neil holtzman a pediatrician and geneticist at johns 
hopkins university in baltimore said i dont think theres any 
doubt that its a real danger he agreed that the risks 
associated with thalidomide and accutane also called isotretinoin 
are comparable 
accutane also made by hoffmannla roche is now marketed with 
strong warnings about the risk of birth defects and women of 
childbearing age must sign a consent form before it can be 
prescribed to them said paula frakes spokeswoman for hoffmannla 
roche 
holtzman said existing precautions are not enough im not 
sure the way the drug is prescribed now is sufficiently 
protective he said 
lammer said that in some european countries the distribution of 
the drug is sharply restricted a proposal to restrict its 
distribution here was not adopted by the us food and drug 
administration lammer said 
frakes noted that additional requirements have been placed on 
doctors and patients when the drug is to be used in women of 
childbearing age the women must have a pregnancy test before 
taking the drug for example and must agree to use contraceptives 
frakes said the company has offered to pay for the pregnancy test 
and for counselling on contraceptive use 
we want to do everything in our power to make sure the drug is 
never taken during pregnancy she said in a telephone interview 
lammer said that the birth defects associated with accutane 
include abnormalities of the brain the skull and face the heart 
and the thymus gland which governs the immune system 
an important difference between accutane and thalidomide is that 
accutane was known to be a cause of birth defects before it as 
approved thalidomide was not furthermore thalidomide was meant 
to be prescribed during pregnancy accutane is not 
thalidomide used as a tranquilizer and to control nausea was 
never approved in the united states

the texas court of criminal appeals and a federal district judge 
turned down a request for a reprieve earlier this week 
ms harrington a university of texas law school capital

the average soviet citizen soon will be able to 
sample a sprinkling of western newspapers giving them a rare 
glimpse of publications that have been strictly forbidden since the 
1920s 
this is just a beginning said viktor pukalov head of 
foreign publications for the soyuzpechat news agents that will sell 
the newspapers if the sale goes well the question of increasing 
the purchase of these publications will be raised 
the sales have been approved by the council of minister or 
cabinet the official news agency tass reported thursday 
with the appearance of the international herald tribune soviets 
will discover such foreign notions as doonesbury and stock 
tables 
moscow is the last remaining major capital where the 
international herald tribune has been sold in hotels but not on the 
street according to robert farre a circulation executive in 
paris where the newspaper is based the publication sells 177000 
copies daily in 164 countries 
the decision is especially significant because the newspapers 
will be sold for rubles many precious western products have been 
offered for sale in moscow recently but only for foreign currency 
which citizens still are forbidden to hold without authorization 
tass said increased shipments of western newspapers began oct 
1 it said the exact date for public sale has not yet been 
determined but that it will happen soon 
prices will vary from about 150 to 2 more than 20 times the 
price of pravda but only about double the cover price of the 
international herald tribune 
the venture will start out with fewer than 1500 copies of the 
international herald tribune west germanys die zeit the british 
newspaper the guardian and others to kiosks in republic capitals 
across the country which has a population of nearly 285 million 
lee huebner publisher of the international herald tribune said 
the 250 copies of his newspaper will be sold in hotels and on the 
street 
i was surprised and gratified that they were going to sell 
them at regular soviet newsstands huebner said in a telephone 
interview from new york city it is symbolic but it is an 
encouraging symbol and i have hope that it is just the beginning 
the western publication that will enjoy the largest circulation 
in the soviet union under the plan is die zeit with 500 copies 
tass said 250 copies of the guardian will be delivered daily 
the only western newspapers readily available on the street are 
communist publications like lunita of rome the morning star of 
great britain and the peoples daily world of the united states 
as part of president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness the soviets stopped jamming broadcasts of the voice of 
america and the british broadcasting corp last year

cbs newsman walter cronkite resigned from the 
advisory board of a group that promotes government use of english 
only and the former white house aide who is the organizations 
president says she may follow suit 
in a letter to us english president linda chavez cronkite 
said he was afraid that an arizona proposal the group supports 
could hurt minorities 
the letter dated oct 6 was released by cronkites office in new 
york on thursday 
ms chavez a former aide to president reagan and us senate 
candidate in maryland also said she was considering resigning 
unless us english chairman john tanton steps aside due to a 
controversy over a 2yearold memo she termed repugnant 
in his letter cronkite said he regretted not being able to 
devote much time to us english but believed its use of his name 
in its campaign for a referendum to make english arizonas official 
language has proved embarrassing the measure proposition 106 
is on the november ballot 
cronkite said he remained opposed to bilingualism but said he 
cannot favor legislation that could even remotely be interpreted 
to restrict the civil rights or the educational opportunities of 
our minority population 
he asked that his name be removed from us englishs letterhead 
and other organization material 
the arizona measure would change the state constitution to 
designate english as the states official language and forbid state 
and local governments from using foreign languages except when 
needed to protect safety and health 
also exempt are such things as the use of interpreters in 
criminal cases and compliance with federally mandated programs such 
as multilingual ballots and some bilingual education programs for 
children 
opponents say the measure would hamper courts reduce 
opportunities for schools to teach english to adults and make it 
difficult for state tourism and commerce programs to be marketed 
overseas it would also be impossible for those who speak no 
english to have interpreters in civil court proceedings opponents 
contend 
backers of proposition 106 say approval would unify the state 
encourage integration of minorities into the mainstream and save 
money 
ms chavez said she had not spoken with cronkite but believed 
that tantons memo also gave him great pause as it does me 
the memo written while tanton was participating in an 
immigration conference raised the specter of an america doomed to 
racial conflict between a minority of educated welloff anglos 
outnumbered by uneducated poor immigrants consisting of other 
ethnic and racial groups 
tanton added that many of the immigrants would be catholic and 
that could reduce the separation between church and state 
tantons assertions were antihispanic and anticatholic 
and fuel the fire for opponents of us englishbacked campaigns in 
arizona colorado and florida ms chavez said thursday from 
denver where she was preparing for a debate on a measure us 
english backs in colorado 
they were repugnant and i have told him so she said the 
board of us english is scheduled to meet this weekend and 
tantons future may be on the agenda she added 
i would recommend if asked that he resign she said 
ms chavez said tantons position as chairman was largely 
honorary 
tantons political stands first surfaced in 1986 in a los 
angeles newspaper report on an official english campaign in 
california it resurfaced early this month with reports in miami 
and phoenix papers detailing the memo 
tanton an opthamologist from michigan has insisted he is not a 
racist

a buoyant republican george bush says hes 
ready for the home stretch after a debate performance his camp 
is rating as a decisive win 
the vice president cleaned his dukakis clock declared 
bushs campaign chairman james a baker iii 
you hit it out of the park running mate sen dan quayle 
told bush by phone 
the republican presidential nominee was more restrained in 
words telling reporters only im happy with the way it came 
out 
but that restraint did not extend to gestures as he grinned 
broadly and repeatedly poked the air with a double thumbsup as he 
boarded his motorcade to leave the debate site at the university of 
california at los angeles thursday night 
i feel good about it bush added 
his aides rejoiced in the generally favorable reviews bushs 
second debate had received including a quick abc poll that showed 
americans who were surveyed thought he had won by a 4933 margin a 
los angeles times poll gave bush the win 4727 
bush told more than 3000 cheering supporters at a postdebate 
rally tomorrow we start the home stretch of this campaign 
and i believe we can do anything we set our sights on 
for the next few days at least the campaigns sights will stay 
on california with its harvest of 47 electoral votes and where 
the race is viewed as especially close by both sides 
bush was to speak at a midday rally in the los angeles suburb 
of cerritos then fly to san diego for a speech at the university 
of californias scripps institute 
on saturday he will visit a string of agricultural communities 
in the states central valley a bus motorcade campaign that will 
take him to stockton modesto merced and fresno 
at thursdays postdebate rally at loyola marymount university 
bush vowed to work hard and win in california 
and he asserted that with a california victory i will be the 
next president of the united states 
bush did not comment on his debate performance at the rally 
other than to note that it gave him more of a chance to discuss 
world peace issues than did the first debate and to say that he 
had continued to stress differences with his opponent 
however california gov george deukmejian introduced bush as 
the heavyweight debate champion of the world 
the audience which included entertainer zsa zsa gabor actors 
chuck norris jaime farr gabe kaplan singer andy williams and 
tennis player tracy austin roared its support for bush and saluted 
him with a blizzard of confetti 
shortly after the debate bush received phone calls from both 
quayle and president reagan according to bush spokeswoman sheila 
tate 
reagan told bush you done good ms tate said 
baker bushs campaign chairman said bush came across as 
presidential in control relaxed and likable in the debate 
its a clear win for the vice president baker said the 
bottom line is he reinforced his position with voters already 
committed to him and he closed the sale with those undecided 
dukakis by contrast projected a pessimistic view of the 
future of this country baker said 
as in the first presidential debate the bush campaign was quick 
to parade officials such as baker before reporters to put a 
positive spin on their candidates performance just as the 
dukakis camp was doing 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman another member 
of the bush spin patrol said that on the issue of personality 
on the question of likability he dukakis didnt help himself and 
probably he hurt himself 
were very encouraged darman said

a lawyer for parents of a man 
killed in a hitandrun accident said there is a fleeing felon 
out there who is laughing because a judge refused to force the 
drivers attorney to reveal his clients identity 
palm beach circuit judge timothy poulton on thursday denied a 
motion to force defense attorney barry krischer to give the name of 
his client on grounds the attorneyclient privilege of 
confidentiality blocked the disclosure 
the plaintiffs case has tremendous emotional appeal and it is 
difficult to rule against the plaintiffs poulton said who 
delivered the ruling after weeks of review but i am convinced 
the law requires it 
joseph farish jr an attorney for the parents of mark baltes 
described the driver as a cat with feathers hanging off his 
mouth following the ruling 
i respect the judges decision farish said but he 
maintained the attorneyclient privilege of confidentiality was 
abused when the judge denied his motion to have the drivers 
identity revealed 
we have a fleeing felon out there who is laughing at all of 
us farish said 
the victims mother mildred baltes said the family will 
appeal if we have to to the supreme court 
i feel i must do it not only for my son but for victims and 
families of victims in the future she said 
krischer was approached by the driver the day after the march 9 
1986 accident and was asked to seek a plea bargain arrangement 
without revealing his clients name 
no deal was struck with prosecutors and baltes parents mildred 
and her exhusband joseph filed a 6 million wrongful death civil 
suit in february against the unknown driver 
the public has gained from this litigation a greater insight 
into and appreciation of the importance of the attorneyclient 
privilege krischer said on thursday 
the public can be assured that they can meet with an attorney 
and confide in him openly and frankly without fear that their 
conversations will be repeated in open court 
according to police baltes a 28yearold electrician was 
intoxicated and quarreled with his fiancee as she drove home from a 
night out baltes got out of the car and staggered down the road 
and was hit by a car and dragged nearly 60 feet 
he was pronounced dead at the scene 
detectives using car fragments at the scene and paint chips 
found on baltes skull theorized the vehicle was a 1984 or 1985 
white buick riviera but hundreds of police interviews and a reward 
failed to yield any firm suspects

administrators at six catholic colleges plan 
to fight an attempt by playboy magazine to recruit women for a 
pictorial but they say many students seem apathetic about the 
women of the big east article 
we were shocked to learn that theyre planning such a 
feature said martin healy a spokesman for st johns university 
in new york were the largest catholic university in the united 
states and public nudity is against our morals 
they will not be permitted on campus he said thursday 
playboy spokeswoman elizabeth norris said the mens magazine 
doesnt seek the cooperation of administrators at any of the 
colleges it visits instead it advertises its search offcampus 
and in student newspapers 
we dont do our interviews on campus we do them in hotels 
that are convenient to the students ms norris said in a 
telephone interview from playboys chicago headquarters the 
administrations should have no part in this 
scott donaton editor of the st johns student newspaper the 
torch said he doubts the paper will editorialize against 
playboys search 
donaton said an article about the pictorial was scrapped at the 
last minute when the newspapers faculty adviser persuaded him to 
wait until he heard what the administration thought of the search 
it was our decision to pull it but we did feel some 
pressure he said other colleges have the right to endorse or 
condemn visits from the mens magazine healy said but roman 
catholic institutions have a special obligation because of their 
religious teachings 
we may communicate with the student body and point out to them 
that this would be offensive to everything we stand for he said 
this really is designed to exploit women and thats another 
reason were unalterably opposed to it 
at seton hall university in south orange spokesman michael 
mcgraw said the magazines representatives would be banned from 
campus 
were not supporting them because its not consistent with the 
teachings of the catholic church he said we doubt theyll be 
very successful here most of the students who go to school here 
have strong values 
playboy said some women in the feature will appear nude some 
seminude and others fully clothed magazine officials said they 
visited only one big east school so far the private

biologists held out little hope for 
three gray whales trapped by 6inchthick arctic ice off the 
alaskan coast as temperatures plunged and their food supplies ran 
low 
the california gray whales continued to swim several hundred 
feet offshore thursday near point barrow using two holes in the 
ice to breathe said geoff carroll a wildlife biologist for the 
north slope borough 
carroll who made an observation flight estimated the holes 
were about 15 by 30 feet giving the whales barely enough room as 
they rose to breathe every four minutes or so open water lay more 
than four miles away 
biologists believed time was running out for the grays as 
nighttime temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero 
threatening to shrink the whales breathing space 
they eat a lot and they have to keep moving carroll said 
im sure theyre going to eat everything thats there before very 
long he said the whales eat plankton from the ocean floor 
the only answer would be an icebreaking ship to free the whales 
carroll said but renewed efforts to contact an icebreaker thought 
to be in the area failed 
biologists believe the whales were migrating from the beaufort 
sea to their winter grounds off the mexican coast when they were 
trapped 
several vessels including a coast guard icebreaker were 
delayed by arctic ice this month and last 
greenpeaces anchorage office received several telephone calls 
asking if the organization could help the whales said chapter 
director cindy lowry protecting whales is one of the groups 
bestknown causes 
but lowry said theres not much we can do we dont have a 
boat 
the whales presence in the arctic ocean this far into the fall 
is unusual said steve swartz a marine mammalogist for the center 
for environmental education in washington dc 
swartz said he did not know of another incident in which 
california gray whales have been icebound 
about two years ago some 200 beluga whales trapped off the 
siberian coast were freed by an icebreaker he said a blue whale 
the largest animal in the world occasionally gets caught in ice 
near newfoundland he said

literary glasnost is turning a new page in 
publishing in the soviet union with the appearance of books 
formerly found only under the table say organizers of a 
superpower book swap 
the display of 1000 soviet books at the boston public library 
features everthing from russian science fiction to dr zhivago 
boris pasternaks classic that was banned for many years in the 
soviet union 
for our country which was closed so to say for a long time 
this process has a tremendous influence on the whole population of 
the country evgueny g semenikhin who is traveling with the 
display said thursday 
censorship still exists in the soviet union but now its 
absolutely incomparable with what it was two to three years ago 
said semenikhin deputy chief of the soviet state committee for 
publishing and printing 
the committee and the us information agency are cosponsors of 
the exchange with 1000 us books traveling through the soviet 
union 
the display in boston is called the ussr perestroika and 
glasnost referring to the liberalizing reforms initiated by 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev communist party general secretary 
georgy ginzburg an art photographer and publisher also 
traveling with the exhibit pointed to pasternaks books and other 
previously banned novels as tangible evidence of glasnost or 
openness 
theyre publishing all of this which was under the table he 
said 
many notable works however remain forbidden such as alexander 
solzhenitsyns the gulag archipelago the brutal story of life 
in stalinist prison camps recent reports however have indicated 
soviet journals may begin publishing the works of the nobel 
prizewinning author a harsh critic of the soviet regime 
glasnost also has opened doors for many artists ginzburg said 
we have a group of artists who used to be considered 
nonconformists now were publishing books on these new artists 
he said 
marshall goldman associate director of harvard universitys 
russian research center called the exchange an interesting 
development 
in the old days you would have these exchanges and it would be 
mostly propaganda thats different now theres some substance 
he said 
the us side of the superpower book swap is called 
manybooked america and is a big success currently showing in 
minsk in the central soviet union semenikhin said 
he said there are no official visitor tallies but interest has 
been constant at the soviet exhibit which opened tuesday in boston 
after a visit in washington dc the exhibit makes a final stop in 
los angeles oct 31nov 11

doctors should explain to the elderly and to 
gravely ill patients in the hospital that if their hearts stop 
reviving them with cpr will probably buy them little time and may 
be traumatic researchers say 
onethird of americans who die in hospitals undergo 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or cpr at some time the procedure 
is futile for some patients and should be eliminated for them 
research suggests 
the point is to give informed consent you need to know what 
the outcomes are going to be or the chances are said dr george 
e taffet who led a study of 399 cpr procedures at a houston 
veterans administration hospital over a oneyear period 
patients should be informed about their survival chances before 
they decide whether to be candidates for the physically and 
emotionally traumatic procedure taffet said 
of 77 cpr efforts in patients 70 years or older 24 percent were 
successful but none of the patients lived long enough to leave the 
hospital he and his colleagues reported in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
younger patients were involved in 322 cpr efforts but outcomes 
were poor in patients who had cancer most of whom had spreading 
cancer and in those with sepsis or blood infections the study 
found 
among the 89 with cancer cpr succeeded 37 percent of the time 
but none of the patients survived to be discharged and in the 73 
patients with sepsis cpr worked 45 percent of the time but only 
one patient made it home the researchers reported 
we want to make absolutely clear we are not recommending cpr 
be withheld from all patients over 70 age itself is really 
only a marker it should be a flag to the physician that this 
should be discussed with the patient before a crisis occurs 
taffet said 
a separate article in the journal argued in favor of allowing 
doctors to withhold cpr for nursinghome patients without the 
patients or familys consent if the physician believes the effort 
would be futile 
dr donald j murphy of harvard medical school in boston said 
doctors should be able to issue donotresuscitate orders on their 
own authority for patients who are very old chronically ill or 
severely demented 
he argued that the procedure is rarely effective and in many 
cases futile in this population 
most informed patients in longterm care institutions do not 
want resuscitation he said adding that physicians are not 
required to provide or discuss useless therapy with patients and 
recent court cases support the withholding of useless therapy 
murphy said his experiences with patients support his view he 
said after providing them with detailed information about their 
conditions cpr and the intensivecare experience afterward 23 of 
24 opposed resuscitation 
but other doctors said the patient should still participate in 
the decision 
its their own life its the end of their own life said 
dr david l schiedermayer of the center for the study of bioethics 
at the medical college of wisconsin in milwaukee 
if they dont get cpr they are going to die if they do they 
still may die but they may live he said in a telephone interview 
thursday we dont know we cant predict 100 percent 
the government has estimated that 370000 to 750000 hospital 
patients undergo cpr annually schiedermayer said no one knows how 
much each procedure costs but equipment staff time and the 
necessary hospitalintensive care afterward would put the figure in 
the thousands of dollars he said 
cpr performed in the hospital may involve equipment and drugs 
not used when the procedure is performed on an emergency basis 
outside a hospital

president mikhail s gorbachev announced that 
government collective farms will be leased to private individuals 
to expand production and curtail massive subsidies 
gorbachev said late thursday that the soviet leadership will 
extend to the whole of agriculture an experiment that leased 
collective farmland to small groups and families who choose their 
own crops and keep most of the profits 
the nation needs solid dependable results already in the 
near future for the food supply problem to be eliminated not 
just blunted he said 
for decades the large collective and state farms have been run 
like factories with detailed orders from moscow on what and when 
to plant handed down to the workers on the fields 
we have made them from masters of their land into day 
laborers gorbachev complained in his speech 
he said farmers must be restored as complete masters of the 
land and paid only for what they can produce to ease the soviet 
unions decadeslong food shortages 
the soviet leaders speech to a partial session wednesday of the 
central committee and farmers was the first broadcast of any such 
meeting it was edited and broadcast a day late 
the move was another step to dismantle a 50yearold system of 
centrally controlled farming gorbachev did not say if collective 
and state farms would be eliminated but said the continuing 
practice of paying them unearned money was hindering the 
leasing program 
gorbachev said farm leasing is critical because it offers solid 
improvements in productivity 
by contrast the soviet union has poured much money into 
collective and state farms in the past 20 years with only a 
minimal level of production capital investment rose 140 percent 
during that time but production rose just 41 percent gorbachev 
said 
the newspaper pravda said on the day of the conference that 
soviet agriculture now wastes nearly 100 billion a year 
gorbachev who is also head of the communist party said further 
farreaching plans will be considered at a special meeting on 
agriculture to be held by the partys policymaking central 
committee in february a new landuse law is being prepared 
notably absent from the meeting wednesday was yegor ligachev 
the former ideology chief was bumped to head agriculture in a 
kremlin shakeup two weeks ago in what was widely seen as a 
demotion 
asked about ligachevs absence at a news briefing foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said ligachev was on vacation 
for how long he did not know 
but that does not mean that when comrade ligachev is on leave 
we should not handle agriculture issues gerasimov said the 
official news agency tass carried gerasimovs reply as a separate 
story 
gorbachev also admitted that he underestimated the difficulties 
involved in his drive for perestroika or restructuring 
we should honestly admit to ourselves that when launching 
perestroika we did not apparently realize all that it entails 
he said

relief groups have begun flying tons of 
usfunded food and medicine into southern towns where thousands 
of war refugees some with no food at all face starvation 
officials said 
us officials say antigovernment rebels have in the past 
attacked civilian planes and truck convoys bringing such supplies 
however government and us officials hinted that guerrillas had 
agreed to let the material pass without interference 
asked if organizers of the airlift which began thursday had 
contacted the peoples liberation army about safe conduct for the 
flights a un official said wed rather not comment on the 
issue 
when reminded that rebels threatened three weeks ago to shoot 
any plane flying in the south the un official said on condition 
of anonymity that was another time now it is something else 
the government has also resisted past efforts to send supplies 
into rebelheld areas however it agreed after a meeting between 
prime minister sadek mahdi and us officials 
the un official said this airlift aimed to send 12 planes 
daily with supplies to the towns of mairam kadugli muglad and 
abyei where food was reported to have run out wednesday 
the situation in abyei is very bad its now the rainy season 
and the airport is only a strip of sand and stones we dont give a 
time limit but we would like to carry out the relief operation as 
quickly as possible the un official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press 
the operation is paid for by the us agency for international 
development and it also involves un and private relief groups 
abyeis population of 10000 shot up to 40000 as people in 
rural areas fled the fierce fighting to the towns relative safety 
an ap reporter saw a government report covering the last few 
months which indicates that dozens of people in abyei have been 
dying each week 
the southern revolt began five years ago with the mainly 
christian and animist rebels demanding autonomy and administrative 
and economic reforms from the moslemdominated government in the 
north 
the rebels claim to control 90 percent of the southern 
countryside fighting has forced more than 820000 southerners to 
flee to army protection in southern towns northern cities and also 
into neighboring ethiopia 
the new airlift is the first major foreign civilian relief 
effort in two years since operation rainbow a problemplagued 
un program that finally got off the ground in october 1986 
a major stumbling block to those efforts was a threat from the 
rebel sudan peoples liberation army to shoot down relief planes 
claiming the government would use them for military purposes more 
than 70 people died when rebel gunners shot down two planes at that 
time

catfish have won the battle of hyatt lake 
and one fisherman wants to call out the national guard 
after hauling an estimated 32000 catfish out of the lake 
volunteers on thursday gave up their plan to use traps and nets to 
purge the southwest oregon lake of the pesky fish 
we just dont have the manpower said medford angler jim 
summers we need the national guard for this 
biologists had warned summers and others their effort would be 
an exercise in futility but the volunteers said they wanted to do 
what they could to reduce the booming brown bullhead catfish 
population in the lake about 20 miles east of ashland 
earlier this year local opposition caused the state fish and 
wildlife commission to back off a plan to treat the lake with 
poison 
summers and several other poison opponents said they would haul 
the fish out of the lake themselves using live traps and seine nets 
the volunteers decided to rethink their plans after working 16 
hours wednesday hauling 5 tons of catfish out of the lake summers 
said 
the fish were hauled into the woods by the pickup truckload and 
buried said state fishery biologist al smith 
smith estimated there are 75 million catfish in the lake so 
many that the fishs growth has been stunted they are feeding on 
their young and are crowding out most other fish 
im not ready to admit defeat but i am ready to apologize to 
the department said jim ross a medford angler who joined the 
effort they told me it wouldnt work and i said it would

school requirements result in most young 
americans getting needed immunizations but the us centers for 
disease control says older americans at risk for pneumonia and flu 
are shirking their shots 
in its weekly report thursday the cdc cited progress in key 
areas toward its 1990 goals for childhood immunization 
the cdc said 97 percent of the children entering kindergarten in 
1986 had been immunized against diphtheria measles mumps 
whooping cough paralytic polio rubella and tetanus the goal was 
95 percent 
for children 2 and under the goal was 90 percent immunization 
against the same diseases it appears likely that this objective 
will not be met the report said 
it said the incidence of measles among preschoolers indicated 
the immunization level in that age group is inadequate 
cdc figures show mumps in 1987 at the highest level since 1979 
with 12848 cases illinois and tennessee with the most cases did 
not enforce preschool mumps immunization until 1987 and 1988 
respectively 
the report said the 1990 target for reductions in diphtheria and 
polio appear to have been met and that there is substantial 
progress toward goals for tetanus and rubella 
school is the most forceful instrument we have now to assure 
immunization said phil horne program management officer for the 
cdcs immunization division but laws differ from state to state 
they are not consistent 
he said some states waive some student immunizations on medical 
or religious grounds 
for adults there is a different problem he said 
there is a general perception by the adult population that 
immunizations are childhood activities horne said there is a 
feeling that if they were immunized as a child they do not need to 
be immunized as adults 
he said only about 20 percent of the target population for 
influenza vaccines get the needed annual vaccinations and that 
about 10 percent of the target group has the onetimeonly 
pneumonia shot 
the target groups for both shots he said include people over 
65 or adults with any debilitating illness 
horne said the national coalition for adult immunizations 
formed out of concern over the adult vaccination figures is trying 
to get the word out through volunteer organizations and hopes to 
include its pitch with social security checks 
but he said it is difficult to measure success 
with school enterers we can require a statement of proof of 
immunization for entry into school he said most industries 
would not require a similar statement for example for new 
employees 
vaccinations of target groups for hepatitis b he said range 
from an estimated 5 percent to 4050 percent with the high end 
including health care professionals such as dentists and people who 
handle human blood products 
the report identified users of illicit injectable drugs and 
homosexual men as target populations less likely to be vaccinated

flames and smoke leaped from the broken 
walls of the ancient fort of masada as the israel philharmonic 
orchestra performed a work symbolizing the resurrection of the 
jewish state 
the show was staged thursday night at the foot of the 1300foot 
mountaintop where jewish zealots committed mass suicide rather than 
surrender to the romans it capped yearlong celebrations marking 
the 40th anniversary of the rebirth of the jewish state 
their refusal to yield became a symbol and legacy of courage 
for the state of israel in its revival president chaim herzog 
said in a speech before the concert 
about 4300 guests many of whom dressed in tuxedos or formal 
gowns traveled by bus into the negev desert 100 miles south of 
jerusalem tickets ranged from 150 to 950 
security was tight with cars banned from the site and shuttle 
buses taking people to the staging area 
israeli generals and politicians including political rivals 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister shimon peres 
mixed with 2800 foreign visitors 
the whole mystique of masada is beautiful said janet 
heckler an elementary school teacher from new york city 
zubin mehta conducted the 120member orchestra and a choir of 
170 in peforming gustav mahlers second symphony known as the 
resurrection 
as the music filled the chill night air light traced the broken 
line of ruined fortifications along the top of the mountain 
including pillars from king herods palace 
to recreate the final hours of the twoyear siege of masada 
flame and smoke rose behind the ramparts as part of the 
soundandlight show 
later fireworks burst from the walls and a blue laser tatooed 
the menorah candlabra on the moutainside where the earthern ramp 
the romans used to breach the walls can still be seen 
the men first cut the throats of their wives and children then

a letter written to president reagan by a 
schoolgirl asking him to help a girlfriend who was being beaten by 
her father took nearly two years to reach the proper authorities 
officials say 
delaware county childrens services workers were investigating 
the letter mailed jan 7 1987 after it arrived tuesday via the 
white house and the national center for missing amp exploited 
children in washington 
i mean it sounded pretty serious and we get the letter almost 
two years later said donna bukovec a childrens services social 
worker 
it was sent to reagan by a girl who was an eighthgrade student 
at the time said ms bukovec she would not divulge details on the 
girls identity 
ms bukovec said social workers talked to the girl thursday and 
were trying to determine whether an abuse case still exists but 
bukovec said she was certain abuse was occuring when the girl wrote 
the letter 
the letter read in part ive got a friend who is beaten by 
her dad she doesnt want me to say anything but i think she really 
needs help i dont know what i should do what would you do shes 
really scared of her father and she thinks if i tell someone then 
her father will find out and beat her more 
i think youve been a great president i cant think of anyone 
to ask but you please write back i have no one else to turn to 
if you cant help who can the letter concluded 
the letter was forwarded to delaware officials by elizabeth a 
braun an intern at the national center for missing amp exploited 
children in her cover letter ms braun said the letter was 
forwarded to the center from the presidents office asking them to 
look into the matter 
she said the letter was probably misfiled at the center causing 
the delay 
another official at the center charles pickett said the 
allegation of child abuse fell outside of matters covered at the 
organization since it is a private nonprofit agency that 
specializes in tracking down missing and exploited children 
a white house press office spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the white houses policy is to forward such letters 
to social service authorities in the area where the alleged 
incidents are occurring 
it would be impossible to track the letter in question without 
knowing who wrote it he said he did not explain why the letter 
went to the center but he noted the white house receives about 
10000 pieces of mail daily

the latest on the longest the biggest and the fastest with todays 
publication of the 1989 edition of the guinness book of records 
the annual edition is published early each year to catch early

the latest 312page volume lists milestones in sports business

to the book often fall into the more subjective category of the

drug abuse at the olympics is listed the worlds fastest man with 
his 100meter run of his time of 983 seconds at the world

korea came too late to be included and will go into the 1990 
edition subject to them not being beaten said guinness book of

federal attorneys have filed a civil 
racketeering lawsuit against alleged mafia boss vincent chin 
gigante accusing him of controlling teamsters local 560 through 
mob lieutenants 
the lawsuit filed thursday also names a trucking company and a 
lawyer who worked for members of the 8500member local which has 
been placed under a trustee by a federal judge 
it was the first time that gigante has been targeted by the 
government regarding corruption in local 560 
however many of the allegations of control by the genovese 
crime family have surfaced before in the governments legal battle 
to wrest control of the union and during recent efforts to stop 
previously barred local 560 officials from regaining office in 
elections this fall 
earlier this year an indictment was brought against seven 
reputed family members and associates in a businesstakeover scheme 
another indictment charged trucking company figure francis j 
walsh jr and other reputed crime family members of arranging a 
sweetheart labor deal with officials of the union citybased 
union walsh of saddle river has denied the charges 
the court papers filed thursday cite the same alleged scheme 
involving walsh as a reason to take action against gigante 
what we hope is to get an injunction against gigantes 
involvement with 560 which the genovese family has controlled 
since the early 1960s said us attorney samuel a alito jr 
the government is seeking to have gigante barred from directly 
or indirectly influencing the affairs of local 560 or any union 
gigante 60 of old tappan could not be reached for comment 
there was no telephone listing under his name and federal 
authorities did not know who his attorney was 
in cleveland where a teamsters international vice president and 
a local union official are facing trial jury selection paused 
while a federal judge took up several pretrial motions 
the defense has asked judge george w white to admit as evidence 
statements made in 1985 by two former cleveland fbi agents 
the jury selection process begun wednesday is expected to last 
into next week 
harold friedman 66 is charged with two counts of labor 
racketeering two of embezzlement and two of making false 
statements to the labor department 
friedman is president of the 5000member teamsters local 507 
an international vice president of the union since 1983 president 
of the ohio conference of teamsters and president of teamsters 
joint council 41 in northeast ohio he also is president of bakery 
workers local 19 in cleveland 
codefendant anthony hughes 52 local 507s recording 
secretary is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and one 
count of embezzlement 
until recently both friedman and hughes were overshadowed by 
the defense of jackie presser teamsters president from 1983 until 
he died of brain cancer on july 9 presser was also indicted on 
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement

the government announced plans to 
ease an unpopular austerity program newspapers reported today as 
leaders tried to battle runaway inflation and to quell social 
unrest 
over the past several months street protesters and strikers 
have demanded an overhaul of the ruling party hierarchy and 
earlier this month they forced out leaders of vojvodina one of the 
nations two autonomous provinces 
changes in the program include wage increases for workers in 
profitable companies and more funding for hardpressed social 
services such as health and education the changes were announced 
thursday by the federal government belgrades staterun dailies 
said 
austerity measures imposed in may to curb a 21 billion foreign 
debt and annual inflation of 217 percent resulted in hefty wage 
cuts and substantial price increases the changes will be adopted 
by yugoslavias parliament by the end of october the reports said 
in the first nine months of this year salaries in yugoslavia 
fell by 25 percent in real terms they have reached the level of 
the mid1960s in comparative purchasing power official estimates 
say 
belgrade newspapers said that the international monetary fund 
had approved the governments proposed amendments they gave no 
details 
todays reports also failed to give the exact increase in 
salaries which now average 100 a month in yugoslavia 
adoption of the unpopular austerity program was a precondition 
set by the monetary fund and other western creditors for 
rescheduling payments on yugoslavias foreign debt and obtaining 
new credits 
the policy switch follows a government announcement last weekend 
of emergency imports to alleviate shortages 
worker protests and strikes increased markedly after the may 
program took effect prompting angry crowds to march into 
parliament in july to protest low wages 
the national communist party under pressure to respond to the 
unrest with more effective leadership has announced plans to make 
a series of personnel changes at a meeting of its policysetting 
central committee on monday 
party leaders in the troubled province of kosovo and the poor 
southern republic of montenegro where major antigovernment 
protests broke out last weekend met today to consider their own 
personnel changes the state news agency tanjug said 
kosovo an autonomous province in yugoslavias largest republic 
of serbia is wrought with tension between the ethnic albanian 
majority who make up 90 percent of its 2 million people and a 
slav minority that complains that daily harassment by the albanians 
is driving them out of the region 
slobodan milosevic the serbian communist party leader has 
spearheaded a serbian drive for more control over kosovo and 
serbias other nominally autonomous province vojvodina 
his push backed by mass rallies in recent weeks has launched a 
power struggle between serbia and communist leaders of yugoslavias 
other five republics particularly the northern industrial regions 
of slovenia and croatia 
the split broke into the open thursday when milosevic clashed 
for the first time publicly with national communist party chief 
stipe suvar 
suvar accused serbian leaders of not doing enough to stop 
attacks by serbian intellectuals on the late josip broz tito who 
ruled without challenge for 35 years until his death in 1980 
milosevic retorted that serbia had been among the first to 
condemn the attacks on tito whose legacy is officially sacrosanct 
in the party 
milosevics opponents contend he is trying to amend the current 
yugoslav constitution bequeathed by tito in order to gain more 
power for serbia

china will institute an unemployment insurance 
program to aid the millions of workers who may lose their jobs as 
the nation reforms its inefficient labor system an official daily 
said today 
the china daily quoted labor minister official ma dingchang as 
saying enterprises will be required to pay 1 percent of their 
payrolls into the fund and jobless workers will receive relief 
payments for up to two years 
ma said the system is now being tested in several cities and 
that in hangzhou the capital of coastal zhejiang province 1800 
unemployed people have already received a total of 32000 in 
benefits 
the official xinhua news agency said on thursday that the 
northeast china industrial city of shenyang has set up what is 
probably chinas first unemployment offices it said people without 
work can receive 50 percent to 75 percent of their former wages and 
free medical care for a maximum of 24 months 
the reports said the main reason for unemployment were 
bankruptcies of companies sackings for poor performance and the 
decision of workers not to renew labor contracts 
in 1986 in an attempt to end the lifetime employment system 
that has led to overstaffing and low worker motivation the 
government decreed that all newly hired workers in stateowned 
factories must sign contracts 
the china daily said most of the contracts are for five years 
and that in 1991 many workers will be looking for jobs increasing 
the need for a system to look after the unemployed 
china for many years refused to acknowledge that unemployment 
existed and referred to the idle as those waiting for work it 
now puts the unemployment rate at about 2 percent and chinese 
economists say the nation has 20 million surplus workers out of an 
urban work force of 130 million

recent laboratory tests on thawedout tissue 
samples taken from a youth who died almost two decades ago confirm 
that he was infected with a virus closely related to or identical 
with the aids virus a report today said 
the authors of the report which appeared in the journal of the 
american medical association said their findings suggest that a 
virus related to the aidscausing human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv was introduced to the united states on at least one occasion 
before the late 1970s 
the findings raise important implications about the evolution 
of the aids epidemic in the united states said the report 
written by dr robert f garry of the tulane university school of 
medicine in new orleans and colleagues 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first clinically 
diagnosed in the united states in the early 1980s 
it has been suggested by researchers that the aids virus was 
imported from africa to the caribbean and from there to the united 
states in the late 1970s 
however the report said the issue of when hiv was introduced 
into the highrisk populations of homosexuals intravenous drug 
users and hemophiliacs in the united states remains unresolved 
its authors raise the possibility that a virus related to hiv 
may have been present in the united states africa or elsewhere 
for several decades 
the researchers based their conclusions on the case history of a 
15yearold sexually active black youth who was admitted to st 
louis city hospital in 1968 he died after being treated for 16 
months 
there have been been previously published reports in the 
scientific and popular press about the case because the youth 
exhibited several symptoms characteristic of aids 
using recently developed laboratory tests for the presence of 
antibodies specific to hiv garry and his colleagues examined serum 
and autopsy specimens from the youth which were frozen in 1969 
it appears likely that the patient from 1968 was infected with 
a virus closely related or identical to strains of hiv1 that are 
currently in the united states the report said citing the test 
results 
hiv1 is the most prevalent strain of the aids virus in the 
united states and other countries a newly isolated type of the 
virus hiv2 has been found in people living in western africa 
what is suggested with this new finding is that the virus has 
been around a long time said one of the reports coauthors dr 
marlys h witte of the university of arizona college of medicine 
who helped treat the patient at the st louis hospital 
the authors suggest the aids virus may have been present in the 
united states and elsewhere for several decades but the current 
epidemic may be the result of genetic changes in the virus or 
sociocultural factors involving sexual practices or the number of 
sexual partners 
they said more detailed tests on the autopsy specimens of the 
st louis teenager are needed to compare the virus from the late 
1960s with todays hiv strains 
aids destroys the bodys defenses against disease leaving a 
person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain cancers 
there is no known cure

a federal judges ruling that a franchise 
fee assessed by the city against a cable television company is 
unconstitutional is a victory for freedom of the press the 
companys lawyer said 
such a fee puts the government too much in control of the 
press harold farrow lawyer for century federal said thursday 
us district judge eugene lynch in a decision issued 
wednesday declared that the franchise fee charged by the city of 
palo alto discriminated against cable operators in violation of 
constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression 
the city argued that the fee 5 percent of a companys gross 
revenue was justified as rent for use of the citys rightofway 
to place cables 
lynch said pacific bell which uses the same rightofway for 
its telephone lines is not charged any fee as its access is 
guaranteed by state law pacific gas amp electric co is charged only 
a 2 percent fee for use of a public rightofway by the neighboring 
city of atherton also a defendant in the cable case 
the 5 percent fee is aimed exclusively at cable television 
operators engaged in speech protected by the first amendment 
lynch said 
the judge said the citys legitimate goal of raising money could 
have been met by a nondiscriminatory fee 
jerome falk a lawyer for palo alto and several neighboring 
communities that joined in assessing the franchise fee said he 
believed the ruling was the first in the country in which a 
franchise fee was held to be straightforwardly and without any 
question unconstitutional a federal appeals court in 
philadelphia had ruled to the contrary he said

prime minister rajiv gandhi today said 
he would not lift the ban on the satanic verses the latest 
novel by salman rushdie which was outlawed after moslems objected 
to it 
the united news of india quoted gandhi as saying he had not read 
the book and would not reply to a letter rushdie sent to gandhi 
urging that the ban be lifted 
the prime minister spoke to reporters while touring four flooded 
states in northern india 
rushdie 41 is a british citizen of indian descent and lives in 
london he won the booker prize britains most prestigious 
literary award for his first book midnights children a 
broad satire on india after independence his second novel 
shame also earned him acclaim 
the satanic verses has been nominated for the booker prize 
which is announced oct 25 
on oct 5 the finance ministry barred importation of the novel 
or sale of it within india 
moslems including members of parliament said they feared 
moslem militants might use the book to incite riots 
rushdie a nonpracticing moslem is sharply critical of 
religious fundamentalism and makes thinly veiled references in the 
book to the prophet mohammed and the koran 
in his letter which was published on the front pages of major 
indian dailies thursday rushdie accused gandhi of denying him the 
right to free expression at the behest of religious zealots 
according to uni gandhi told reporters the ban was imposed 
because the government believed the book might hurt the feelings of 
moslems who make up 11 percent of indias 880 million people 
uni quoted gandhi as saying that his government supports press 
freedom but that this does not warrant encroachment on sentiments 
of certain communities 
if writers do not show adequate restraint he said the 
government must take measures which we generally do not want to 
take uni said 
indian newspapers have been particularly outspoken in opposing 
the ban 
even the times of india which usually supports the government

dealers gambling ring operators pimps and others in return for 
protection officials say 
the officers were snared in an undercover sting run by the fbi 
and the police departments internal affairs division us 
attorney anton valukas said thursday 
the investigation which merged the investigative resources of 
the chicago police department and the fbi should serve as another 
reminder that corruption of law enforcement agents simply will not 
be tolerated valukas said 
in exchange for bribes the police 10 patrol officers and two 
sergeants allegedly warned the pushers and gamblers about planned 
raids and selectively enforced the law against their competitors 
in those illegal trades the indictment charges

conspiracy as are 21 alleged narcotics dealers and gamblers who 
paid bribes totaling more than 160000 valukas said 
valukas said the fbi set up the sting using an apartment 
equipped with hidden cameras and microphones after two police 
officers told federal authorities they had been offered bribes 
police officer cynthia white posed as a corrupt patrolwoman and 
accepted payoffs from january 1986 to september 1987 and 
distributed the money to the accused officers valukas said 
when the opportunity to infiltrate a payoff conspiracy 
developed officer white stepped forward for 19 months she played 
the demanding and dangerous undercover role of a cop who was 
receiving and distributing payoff money valukas said 
cmdr mardren johnson who is in charge of the south side 
district in which the indicted police worked also worked 
undercover for the fbi valukas said

a former associate of political extremist lyndon 
larouche has begun serving a threeyear conspiracy sentence after 
he was arrested and charged with violating bail by illegally 
possessing six handguns 
roy frankhauser convicted last year in the larouche conspiracy 
case was ordered thursday to begin serving the sentence by us 
district judge robert e keeton 
the order came after federal prosecutors charged frankhauser 
violated terms of his release when he was arrested by fbi agents 
last week at a house where six guns were stored 
federal prosecutors also said frankhauser beat his girlfriend 
and elderly mother and left pennsylvania twice to attend ku klux 
klan rallies however those allegations were not cited by keeton 
in revoking bail 
frankhauser 49 of reading pa was escorted out of court by 
us marshals and was being held until assignment to a federal 
prison 
he had been free on bail pending appeal of his conviction last 
december of conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury 
investigation into allegations that larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign raised more than 2 million through credit card and loan 
fraud 
frankhauser a former member of the kkk and the american nazi 
party was a larouche security consultant for seven years until he 
left in late 1986 about the time the first indictment in the 
larouche case was returned 
he was arrested at the home of his girlfriend anne traczyk in 
reading where he had been staying for several months after the 
woman told the fbi he had beat her about the face and back and 
then placed a gun against her head and told her im going to kill 
you according to court documents 
under the terms of his release frankhauser was barred by keeton 
from possessing any guns or being in a house where guns were kept 
and from traveling outside reading he was arrested on charges of 
being a convicted felon illegally possessing a firearm 
in court documents federal prosecutors charged that frankhauser 
crossed state lines at least twice since his february sentencing to 
attend kkk meetings and rallies in maryland and was armed each time 
the fbi found two handguns a fully loaded 38caliber with a 
twoinch barrel and a replica of a germanmade weapon in 
traczyks house according to the documents three more handguns 
and a rifle were found in a locked metal box opened after 
authorities obtained a search warrant 
uniforms bearing nazi emblems knives brass knuckles 
ceremonial swords and 22caliber ammunition also were found in the 
house the documents said 
traczyk also told the fbi that frankhauser physically and 
verbally assaulted his elderly mother the papers said at the 
time of his sentencing franhauser pleaded for leniency saying he 
had to care for his mother and planned to get married 
frankhauser was the first defendant in the complex larouche 
fraud and conspiracy case and was tried separately because his 
defense was to accuse larouche of a coverup 
testimony during frankhausers trial indicated he advised 
larouche to order fundraisers to leave the country burn documents 
and refuse to cooperate with investigators attorneys claimed 
larouche workers thought frankhauser was working for the cia 
frankhauser was convicted in connection with a school bus 
bombing in pontiac mich in the 1970s he also has served as a 
government informant working closely with the fbi 
a new trial of larouche six aides and five political 
organizations is scheduled to begin in january after the first case 
ended in a mistrial in may three other defendants are fugitives 
larouche who has accused world leaders of being soviet agents 
and who is running for president for a fourth time is charged with 
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with

the general manager of the savannah river 
plant is leaving but his departure has no connection with safety 
problems at the nuclear weapons fuel plant a spokesman for du pont 
says 
john t granaghan is taking a leave of absence pending his 
retirement after 38 years with du pont because of medical reasons 
spokesman jim felder said thursday du pont operates savannah river 
for the department of energy 
its a personal matter mr granaghan had surgery earlier this 
year felder said 
concerns about safety at the plant arose dramatically at a 
congressional hearing last month when a list of what du pont 
considered the 30 most serious reactor incidents at the 38yearold 
plant was made public 
srps three reactors were reduced to half power last year when 
experts questioned whether the emergency cooling system could 
handle a problem at full power 
since april all three reactors have been shut down entirely for 
maintenance and testing amid additional safety questions one 
reactor was restarted for less than a week in august 
when it was shut down srp was the sole producer of radioactive 
tritium and plutonium used in nuclear weapons the only other 
producer the hanford nuclear reservation in washington state has 
been shut down for more than a year the rocky flats plutonium 
processing plant near denver also is closed 
meanwhile democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
criticized the reagan administrations record in dealing with 
problems at savannah river 
dukakis said in a statement thursday that president reagan and 
vice president george bush his opponent have ignored the 
serious safety and environmental problems at our nuclear production 
facilities 
bush agreed that savannah river needs to be made more safe 
westinghouse electric co is scheduled to assume operation of 
the plant on april 1 and company officials say they are planning 
for what should be an orderly transition 
westinghouse executives have met with officials from the federal 
department of energy and du pont in washington concerning plans to 
restart srps reactors 
we still dont run the reactors but we have a lot of advice 
and counsel were going to be living with them whatevers 
done said westinghouse spokesman jack herrmann

government reports today on wholesale prices retail sales and 
industrial production presented a picture of moderate inflation and 
economic growth 
the federal reserve board said production at the nations 
factories mines and utilities was unchanged in september the 
weakest performance in seven months 
however that weakness was almost entirely attributable to the 
good news that summers heat had passed causing a large drop in 
utility production 
prices at the wholesale level rose a 04 percent in september as 
the biggest gasoline price decline since january offset a sharp 
rise in food prices caused by the summer drought according to the 
labor department 
food prices rose 12 percent but energy prices fell 33 percent 
because of a battle among oilproducing nations over production 
quotas department analysts said 
retail sales fell an unexpected 04 percent in september the 
commerce department said it was the second consecutive monthly 
drop and the first backtoback decline since septemberoctober 
1987 
the decline in retail sales indicated consumer demand is slowing 
down and that should ease inflationary pressures 
the nations trade deficit widened in august as it did in the 
same month one year earlier but this time the report did not 
trigger a sharp drop in the stock market like the one that preceded 
last years oct 19 collapse 
the commerce department reported on thursday a 122 billion 
merchandise trade deficit for august up sharply from a 95 
billion deficit in july and higher than analyst predictions of 
about 113 billion 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 712 points 
to 213336 bond prices which fell sharply immediately after the 
news finished the day only slightly lower 
the widerthanexpected august 1987 trade gap triggered a 
95point drop in the dow jones industrial average just days before 
the oct 19 stock market collapse 
on thursday the dollar fell following the trade report 
continuing a string of declines this week 
the markets still not totally sure about it but the 
first reaction is weve got to sell the dollar said rimmer de 
vries chief economist of morgan guaranty trust co 
by late in the day the dollar was down to less than 1275 
japanese yen and 182 west german marks compared to more than 129 
yen and 183 marks on wednesday 
hopes for big reductions in the trade deficit had helped push 
the dollar higher through june july and august the dollar peaked 
around sept 1 then drifted slowly downward before falling steeply 
this week toward its level of early summer 
some analysts said thursday they believed the underlying trend 
in the dollar still was for a stable or higher currency 
this is not a sufficiently bad number to change the 
psychology said lawrence krohn senior economist for shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
dollar traders and speculators have plenty of room to interpret 
the latest trade figures because economists have sharply 
conflicting projections for how much the trade deficit will shrink 
in coming years 
de vries said the dollars decline is needed because it will 
make us goods more competitive in world markets and help shrink 
the trade deficit

jurors at the divorcefixing conspiracy trial of 
former miss america bess myerson will be allowed to hear a key bit 
of testimony from the prosecutions star witness the judge ruled 
today 
us district judge john f keenan decided over defense 
objections that sukhreet gabel can describe a conversation she had 
with her father after learning her mother was the judge presiding 
over the divorce of miss myersons lover 
miss myerson the citys cultural affairs commissioner at the 
time is charged with giving ms gabel a city job to influence the 
rulings of her mother former supreme court justice hortense gabel 
in the divorce of millionaire contractor carl andy capasso 
ms gabel testified about the conversation with her father 
milton with the jury out of the courtroom thursday because defense 
lawyers objected to the testimony as hearsay 
she said that when she learned from capassos housekeeper that 
her mother was the judge in the capasso divorce she confronted her 
father and that he told her your mother knows all about it 
and advised her dont get involved 
mrs gabel 75 miss myerson 64 and capasso 43 are all 
charged with conspiracy mail fraud and briberelated charges for 
an alleged scheme to reduce capassos temporary support payments to 
his estranged wife 
in regular testimony thursday ms gabel said miss myerson went 
out of her way to cultivate a friendship with her but tried to 
keep their socializing secret she said miss myerson told her not 
to give her real name when she accompanied miss myerson to a party 
ms gabel 39 described how miss myerson sought out her company 
in the summer of 1983 after they met at a dinner party given by ms 
gabels parents 
ms gabel said she twice made weekend visits to capassos long 
island estate in westhampton at miss myersons invitation but on 
one visit her hostess fretted about whether to take her along to a 
party 
i dont know whether i ought to be doing this ms gabel 
quoted miss myerson as saying adding andys against it 
miss myerson asked ms gabel who was divorced what her married 
name had been 
when ms gabel replied revis she said miss myerson put one 
hand to her brow and pointed the other at her saying you tell 
them your name is revis 
ms gabels reenactment of the scene provoked chuckles in the 
packed courtroom but miss myerson looked on tightlipped 
ms gabel said she gave a noncommittal answer to miss myersons 
idea but it turned out no one at the party asked her name anyway 
prosecutors maintain that miss myersons interest in ms gabel 
developed only after the younger womans mother began handling 
interim rulings in capassos divorce

drugmoney laundering scheme told senate investigators that he 
managed an account for gen manuel antonio noriega that was used to 
pay panamanian politicians 
amjad awan an officer of the bank of credit and commerce 
international told a subcommittee of the senate foreign relations 
committee on sept 30 that he paid cash from the account after 
receiving notes signed by noriega

before the arrival of the notes awan said he got telephone 
calls telling me to expect the person to come in to get these 
funds 
when asked to whom the money was paid awan replied 
politicians this was during the time of the elections in 
panama 
noriega who as head of the military effectively rules panama 
has been indicted by two us grand juries on charges of drug 
trafficking and the reagan administration has pressed for his 
ouster as defense chief 
awan said the balance in noriegas account fluctuated but at one 
point reached a high of 20 million maybe 25 million he 
added that he made monthly trips to panama to report to noriega on

national boy scout officials will review 
their neutral policy on killing animals for food as part of 
wilderness survival training in light of complaints by animal 
rights groups 
national spokesman frank hebb initially said thursday national 
scout officials would take a look at it and see whether we should 
ban this sort of thing its not necessary 
he said there was no timetable for making a decision 
at a campout in nearby perry county earlier this fall scouts 
were shown how to kill a rabbit and then prepare it for eating 
five to 10 scouts then accepted an invitation to test their 
skills on rabbits and the same procedure was done with four or 
five chickens said william j hawkins executive director of the 
keystone council the local scout affiliate 
we looked at the wilderness survival merit badge phamplet and 
it put food at the very bottom for survival hebb said 
h clay criswell executive director of the humane society of 
harrisburg area inc said the most important things in survival 
are finding shelter and water you dont have to have meat to 
stay alive 
hawkins said he will recommend discouraging troops in the 
11500scout keystone council from killing animals in future 
survival programs 
if we discourage it at the council level it wont be done

republicans celebrated george bushs debate performance some 
even declaring the election won but democrats said today that 
michael dukakis had made points too in the candidates final 
nationally televised encounter 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan said today that bush 
was the clear winner in the debate and he added it seems to 
me george bush is going to win this election and hes going to win 
it by a big margin particularly in the electoral college 
on the democratic side senate majority leader robert byrd of 
west virginia said of bush id say he won the debate if it were 
a race for high school cheerleader 
byrd said dukakis had substance to his responses i thought he 
made some good points with his responses to the deficit he 
added im not sure these debates really amount to much 
i think bush can start measuring the curtains for the white 
house delawares gop gov michael castle said thursday night 
after the debate 
i think we got it said republican rep lynn martin of 
illinois ive coached him bush and ive never seen him that 
good he walked off that stage the president of the united states 
democrats generally claimed victory for dukakis on the issues 
but officials in both parties questioned whether he had done enough 
to thaw his icy image 
sen bill bradley dnj did say today on nbcs today 
program that dukakis came across as someone who understands the 
problems american families experience out there the problems of 
living from paycheck to paycheck in many cases one illness away 
from financial disaster 
but james baker iii bushs campaign chairman said on cbs 
this morning that dukakis had too much to handle in trying to 
warm up his image while trying to score a breakthrough that would 
overcome bushs lead in the polls 
its pretty hard to attack in a debate and at the same time 
appear more likable baker said 
pennsylvanias democratic lt gov mark singel said dukakis was 
at least partly successful in breaking his image as a cold 
technocrat 
i dont think hes ever going to be henny youngman singel 
said but he was certainly more likable tonight and i think he 
approached many of the questions with good humor i think he showed 
himself to be capable of warmth and i think the people will 
appreciate that 
william cunningham a former adviser to democratic gov mario 
cuomo who is now working on sen daniel moynihans reelection 
campaign summed it up this way dukakis was dukakis bush was 
loose chipper magnanimous it worked out well for him 
dukakis should have been more like zorba and less like plato 
more like kojak and less like socrates 
and at least one democrat gave the decisio to bush 
the one home run i heard was bushs said former sen thomas 
eagleton of missouri who was george mcgoverns running mate in 
1972 until he withdrew from the ticket after it was revealed that 
he had undergone shock treatments for psychiatric problems 
when they asked who their heroes were dukakis was wandering 
all over the stage eagleton said bush with two minutes to 
think about it came up with some solid candidates and ended up 
with the president 
most observers from both parties agreed that the two candidates 
seemed more at ease than they had during their first encounter 
it was a better debate than the first one there was a little 
more spontaneity said former white house chief of staff howard 
baker from his home in huntsville tenn 
but baker called bush the clear winner principally because he 
took advantage to sharpen the issue differences between them in 
defense and taxes his general demeanor was the most effective 
thing he was very presidential he was calm and selfassured his 
answers were direct 
even republicans who didnt rate bush a clearcut winner said it 
was enough that he avoided a poor showing 
dukakis had to do something dramatic and i dont think he did 
it i dont think he laid a glove on bush said ellen sauerbrey 
a gop delegate from maryland i think barring some unforeseen 
gaffe in the next couple weeks or a major worldshattering event i 
think the election is over this was dukakis last chance to really 
turn public opinion 
heading into the debate most polls gave bush a narrow lead 
among voters nationwide and a strong lead for electoral votes 
democratic rep john dingell of michigan disputed the notion 
that it was a doordie test for his partys candidate 
it was not really necessary for mr dukakis to deliver a 
knockout blow dingell said there are 26 days left in the 
campaign a lot can happen and a lot will the dukakis campaign is 
coming together and hell do well

democrat michael dukakis characterized the 
white house race as still very close as his chief political 
adviser said today were down a little bit but its well 
within range 
dukakis prepared for a rally here while his campaign scrambled 
to put the best face on a thursday night debate performance that 
left the candidate short of a breakthrough to even up a contest 
that shows signs of a growing republican advantage 
the democratic campaign unveiled two new televison 
advertisements that will begin airing today and top aide john sasso 
said 13 million to 14 million would be spent on commercials in 
the final weeks 
sasso conceded a george bush edge in the instant public opinion 
polls but said we scored with undecided and swing voters last 
evening thats what we were looking for 
were down a little bit theres no question about that but 
its well within range sasso told reporters 
sasso also brushed off queries about whether a bush win was 
inevitable as surveys point to an increasing electoral college 
advantage for the vice president 
i dont agree with that he said you campaign as hard as 
you can you continue to talk about the things that are important 
to you you continue to make the case for change 
dukakis ended the debate night with a call for a third debate 
i think we ought to have that third debate dont you 
dukakis asked a postdebate rally attended by about 2000 
supporters thursday night the crowd cheered wildly 
dukakis said debates enable the democrats to get our opponents 
out from behind the flag factory and the balloons and people get a 
chance to see how they stand on the basic and fundamental 
challenges that face the country 
but the second debate according to some democrats did not 
prove to be dukakis forum for delivering a knockout punch and 
overcoming bushs lead in recent nationwide polls 
dukakis was dukakis bush was loose chipper magnanimous it 
worked out well for him said william cunningham a former 
adviser to new york gov mario cuomo who is now working for new 
york sen daniel patrick moynihans reelection campaign 
dukakis was so much better on the issues but he wasnt as 
warm as bush was said democratic sen dennis deconcini of 
arizona 
instant polls conducted by abc news and the los angeles times 
declared bush the clear winner 
the abc poll of 639 registered voters who viewed the debate 
found 49 percent calling bush the winner 33 percent saying dukakis 
won and 18 percent rated the debate a tie the survey had a margin 
of error of plus or minus four percentage points 
the times survey scored bush the winner 47 percent to 26 percent 
with 27 percent undecided the poll of 522 registered voters who 
saw the debate had a margin of error of five percentage points 
at the postdebate rally dukaks boasted of a clean sweep in 
the debates and ridiculed bushs selection of a running mate 
saying it demonstrated poor judgment that should not be allowed to 
spill over to supreme court selections 
if one question tonight demonstrated the stakes in this 
election it was the question about the supreme court of the united 
states dukakis said 
remember this the people who are appointed to the supreme 
court of the united states by a president are there long after that 
president leaves dukakis said george bush supported the 
nomination of robert bork george bush demonstrated his commitment 
to standards and quality and strength by picking as his running 
mate the senator from indiana 
dukakis told supporters he was entering the all important 
final 25 days in the race for the white house as the underdog but 
within striking distance 
i dont have to tell you that this race is very very close 
he said and its going to get even closer after tonight and its 
going to get closer still in the days ahead 
dukakis who also attended two private receptions following the 
debate was campaigning in california and washington today 
including a joint appearance with running mate lloyd bentsen in 
sacramento and an evening stop at a birthday party for jesse 
jackson 
at the postdebate rally dukakis said he would welcome a third 
showdown with bush 
the vice president whose campaign refused to participate in a 
third debate ruled out another encounter when asked thursday night 
if he would agreee to debate dukakis again 
dukakis began the rally by asking what did you think and 
a clean sweep 
both questions were met with rousing applause

a british publisher today asked 
bookstores to refrain from selling the book occupation nazi 
hunter because a judge refused to lift an ordering banning 
publication 
anton gecas who is mentioned in the book in connection with 
alleged war crimes was granted the order last month 
gecas 72 of edinburgh is one of 17 people in britain being 
investigated by the home office in a war crimes inquiry gecas a 
former lithuanian platoon commander has denied committing war 
crimes 
lord cowie today dismissed a challenge to the banning order by 
publishers ashford press publishing of hampshire at the court of 
session in edinburgh 
he said the book could seriously prejudice a defamation action 
against times newspapers by gecas which is due to be heard by a 
scottish court 
the publishers had argued that the terms of the order were too 
wide and a scottish court had no power to ban a book in england 
lord cowie said that as long as a scottish court had 
jurisidiction in a case it could make an order that might apply 
anywhere 
he refused to grant a similar court order against the author of 
the book efraim zuroff of the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles saying the ruling against the publishers already protected 
gecas the center is committed to pursuing world war ii nazis who 
have escaped prosecution for war crimes 
after the hearing ashford press sent letters to booksellers 
throughout britain informing them that the court order effectively 
barring the firm from publishing the book worldwide and asking that 
it should not be put on sale monday as planned

a jury has found that the group women 
against rape libeled a man when it circulated a flier that falsely 
accused him of assault and attempted rape 
steve carney who was never charged was awarded 7500 for pain 
and suffering and 25000 in punitive damages by the sevenman 
fivewoman panel 
i feel a lot better but i cant say i really won because 
there may be people out there who saw it the flier and formed 
their own opinions carney 23 said after hearing thursdays 
verdict 
i think it will teach them to be a little more careful about 
what accusations they choose to print about people he said 
carney of scotts valley sued women against rape of santa cruz 
claiming the group publicly humilated him in a 1984 leaflet that 
said he assaulted and attempted to rape karen winkler 24 
during the libel trial in santa cruz county superior court it 
was brought out that winkler never went to police and swore in a 
deposition that she didnt know what happened the night she went 
out drinking with carney and another coworker 
representatives of war testified that they based the flier 
solely on winklers word and by observing her behavior which they 
said was consistent with a profile of women who have been sexually 
assaulted 
representatives of the organization earlier declined an offer 
from carneys lawyer that the suit would be dropped in exchange for 
an apology and a retraction 
deanne pernell and jan shirchild both war directors said they 
would discuss an appeal with the organizations lawyers 
war has said it is 500 in debt and is unlikely to be able to 
meet the jurys verdict but carneys lawyer david sabih said 
money wasnt the paramount issue 
during closing arguments on wednesday sabih told the jury that 
the issue was whether we as a society tolerate groups of 
vigilantes who impose themselves as judge jury and executioner 
winkler who did not testify at the trial originally was named 
in the suit but settled out of court with an apology for 
participating in the publication of the flier

the mcmartin preschool molestation case 
contributed to the deaths of two witnesses and has poisoned 
everyone who had contact with it says the judge who is presiding 
over the longrunning trial 
the bleak comments by superior court judge william pounders came 
thursday one day after he dismissed 27 prosecution charges against 
raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey he spoke in 
response to a news media request to make public the prosecutors 
original trial witness list 
the weekly newspaper the easy reader joined by the los 
angeles times sought the names of more than 100 prospective 
witnesses who never testified the prosecution ended its 
presentation of witnesses last week and the defense is to begin 
next week 
the judge angrily refused to disclose the names saying those 
witnesses have privacy rights pounders said he refused to subject 
people on the witness list to the embarrassment and harassment 
that plagued others 
this case in my view has poisoned everyone who had contact 
with it pounders said 
weve had two deaths in connection with this case he said 
referring to a mother who died in 1986 from the side effects of 
alcoholism and an investigator who committed suicide the day before 
he was to testify in 1987 
kevin cody a reporter for easy reader who has covered much 
of the trial told the judge that the case has been the subject 
of rumors and innuendo and added anything thats left unsaid 
at the end of the case is going to weaken public confidence in the 
verdict 
youre acting as a censor on a case which has repercussions 
across the country cody told the judge 
you are a good one to talk about this pounders shot back 
you knew paul bynum fairly well and saw him suffer in this 
courtroom he said of the investigator who committed suicidei 
understand you had dinner with him the night before this happened 
cody did not respond to that comment but told the judge it was 
foolish to base his rulings on who might die in this case 
bynum 39 a former police officer who had worked as a defense 
investigator on the mcmartin case shot himself in the head last 
dec 10 the day before he was to testify a year before that judy 
ann johnson the mother who first brought the mcmartin case to 
police died of alcoholrelated liver disease 
the mcmartin case has been in the courts for five years and the 
trial has been under way for a year and a half 
buckey 30 and his 61yearold mother were charged with 100 
molestation and conspiracy counts until wednesday when the judge 
at the behest of prosecutors dismissed 27 counts nearly a third 
of the case prosecutors said they would seek dismissal of eight 
more counts the defendants are accused of molesting children at 
the now defunct mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach 
in another ruling thursday the judge agreed to make public 
written transcripts of videotapes that were played for jurors 
during the trial the tapes showed children being interviewed about 
alleged molestations by therapists the judge said he would delete 
the childrens names from the transcripts

the biggest gasoline price decline since 
january offset a sharp droughtcaused rise in food prices as 
inflation at the wholesale level rose a moderate 04 percent in 
september the government said today 
food prices skyrocketed 12 percent three times the august 
rate and notice to consumers that the effects of the summer drought 
have not yet played themselves out 
much of the momentum for the gain in food costs came from 
escalating beef prices as producers ended the herd liquidations 
that had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle 
countering that was a 33 percent drop in energy prices which 
reflected declines for all major fuels gasoline prices up 38 
percent in august fell 33 percent last month natural gas prices 
fell 25 percent in september home heating oil costs were down 46 
percent 
labor department analysts said these declines which sent 
energy prices down at their steepest clip since january reflected 
the current battle among oilproducing nations over production 
quotas 
the 04 percent september increase in prices for goods one step 
short of the retail level represented a moderation from the overall 
06 percent august advance 
the september gain translates to an annual rate of 45 percent 
for the first nine months of 1988 wholesale prices rose at an 
annual rate of 43 percent nearly double last years 22 percent 
gain 
many private economists believe that americans will benefit from 
the world oil glut and say that for all of 1988 inflation will 
average around 34 percent 
the basic balance is fairly clear we have lower energy prices 
offsetting higher food prices said david wyss an economist with 
data resources inc of lexington mass 
wyss said falling energy prices along with a slowdown in the 
general economy should help put a damper on inflationary pressures 
for the rest of the year 
two other reports released by the government today provided 
evidence that the economy was slowing from a fasterthanexpected 
pace turned in during the first half of 1988 
the commerce department said that retail sales fell for a second 
consecutive month dropping by 04 percent in september indicating 
some slowing in consumer demand 
in the other report the federal reserve said that industrial 
production remained unchanged in september the first time it has 
failed to increase since february 
the wholesale price report showed higher prices for a variety of 
goods not all the result of the drought 
in addition to the 42 percent gain in beef prices fruit costs 
jumped 100 percent and vegetable prices jumped 165 percent 
prices also rose for coffee and dairy products both up 15 percent 
prices fell however for eggs down 85 percent pork down 42 
percent and rice down 36 percent 
department analyst craig howell said beef prices should rise 
through the coming months as depressed supplies will keep costs 
high 
in fact prices paid to farmers for live cattle the first stage 
at which wholesale prices are tracked rose 11 percent in 
september after a 15 percent august gain 
another factor pushing prices higher in september was a 18 
percent increase in new automobile prices analysts said this 
reflected lower endofthemodelyear incentives to buyers than 
would normally be the case 
the september changes put the labor departments producer price 
index for finished goods at 1086 meaning that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 at wholesale in 1982 would have 
cost 10860 last month 
unlike the percentage changes the index numbers are not 
adjusted for seasonal variations a process designed to remove 
periodic predictable effects from the calculations of price 
movements 
the government will release on oct 21 its report on price 
changes at the consumer level through august consumer prices were 
rising at an annual rate of 46 percent only slightly higher than 
the 44 percent gain for all of 1987

rockwell international has acknowledged for 
the first time that three people were exposed to plutonium last 
month in an incident that led to the shutdown of part of the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant 
two rockwell employees and a department of energy employee were 
exposed to waste tainted by the radioactive element when they 
entered an area of building 771 where plutonium reprocessing is 
done 
rockwell officials had said previously there was no release of 
any radioactive material in the building and no contamination 
rockwell said a warning sign was blocked from view and the three 
were unaware they should have been wearing respirators to protect 
their lungs rockwell officials said 
rockwell operates the facility 16 miles northwest of denver for 
the department of energy which ordered the building closed 
rockwell officials said the shutdown of the building will have 
little shortterm effect on the plants production of plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons but a longer shutdown would cause a 
production cutback 
the shutdown of building 771 and of reactors at the savannah 
river plant in south carolina have raised safety questions about 
government nuclear weapons plants 
rockwell issued a statement thursday saying laboratory test 
results available this week revealed the three people had been 
exposed to small amounts of plutonium 
results of those tests indicate the employees were exposed to 
detectable amounts of plutonium well below all applicable safety 
standards rockwells statement said 
none of the three is expected to have health problems as a 
result of the incident the rockwell statement said 
colorados annual background radiation level is 350 
millirem the statement said this means the maximum exposure 
to the three employees involved was nine100000ths of the average 
colorado residents annual exposure to natural background radiation 
exposure 
plutonium is considered dangerous even in minute quantities 
because of its high radioactivity researchers have said it has the 
potential to cause cancer and brain tumors when inhaled or ingested

burmas military government announced 
today that general elections will not be held before early 1989 and 
that the date will be set after talks with political parties 
eighteen parties have taken up the governments call to register 
with an election commisson but none has said whether it will take 
part in elections 
following weeks of bloody antigovernment protests hardline 
gen saw maung seized power from a civilian government sept 18 
ordered his troops to shoot protesters and promised to hold general 
elections within three months 
staterun radio rangoon said troops killed four people today 
bringing to more than 450 the official number slain by security 
forces since sept 18 
the chairman of the fivemember election council ba htay said 
registered parties could open branches throughout the country after 
consultation with law and order restoration councils which 
were set up by saw maung

their own premises although a ban on public meetings of more than

since president reagan took office in 1981 
his policy of financing the contra rebels in their war against 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government has been one of the most 
divisive foreign policy questions facing congress and the nation 
here is a chronology of the ups and downs of that policy 
1981 congress late in the year approves 19 million in 
covert military aid to the rebels the money to be managed by the 
cia is part of a classified intelligence bill 
1982 a second infusion of 19 million again part of a 
classified bill is approved this time restrictive provisions are 
added that prevent any of the money from being used to overthrow 
the sandinistas there are reports as well that the cia has used 
an additional 10 million from its contingency fund 
1983 the house votes to end contra aid but a later compromise 
results in the appropriation of 24 million for the rebels this 
time the money is appropriated openly and the cia is barred from 
using any money from its contingency fund to supplement the new aid 
1984 in april reports surface that the cia has supervised the 
mining of three nicaraguan ports and congress votes to cut off aid 
to the rebels but at the end of the year lawmakers vote to set 
aside 14 million for the rebels to be released after feb 28 
1985 if congress approves in a separate vote at that time 
congress adds new restrictions saying the cia and the pentagon may 
not use the money to support paramilitary operations in nicaragua 
unless specifically authorized by congress 
1985 in april the senate votes to release the 14 million 
but the house disapproves the resolution denying the money to the 
rebels that summer congress approves 27 million for the contras 
but restricts its use to food clothing medicine and other 
humanitarian aid the money is directed to be used by the 
administration as leverage to promote peace negotiations and the 
cia and defense department are barred from any role in distributing 
the money 
1986 in the fall congress approves 100 million its largest 
single appropriation for the rebels the bulk of it for military 
aid restrictions on the cias role are lifted except that the 
agency remains barred from using its contingency fund 
1987 in march the house passes a moratorium on contra aid in 
an effort to hold up the final 40 million of the aid bill approved 
in 1986 but the measure dies in the senate at the end of the 
fiscal year on sept 30 congress begins a series of stopgap 
funding measures that include money for nonlethal aid for the 
rebels totaling 20 million 
1988 the house on feb 3 kills president reagans request for 
36 million in rebel aid and a month later it rejects a democratic 
alternative of 30 million the rebels reach a negotiated truce 
with the sandinistas on march 23 and congress votes to provide 48 
million peace talks break down in june and us ambassador richard 
melton is expelled from nicaragua a month later although the truce 
remains in effect a 471 million aid proposal fails to win 
congressional approval in the summer on friday after reports that 
reagan had given up on obtaining new military aid before congress 
adjourned the president says he would not hesitate to call a 
special session later in the year if he decided military aid was 
needed

first conviction and for five years for additional convictions 
if youve got a license to operate a radio station and youre 
smoking marijuana youre going to be subject to losing that 
license and clearly our intent is to say here that we are not 
going to tolerate the use of marijuana said the provisions 
sponsor sen phil gramm rtexas 
liberals mounted a fight against the proposal arguing that it 
was too harsh 
why not adopt the moslem way of doing things asked sen dan 
evans rwash cut off a hand for a first conviction cut off the 
other one for a second conviction that would be a deterrant 
lawmakers who feared earlier that the wideranging measure might 
be stillborn because of a torrent of more than 100 amendments began 
feeling more optimistic thursday after a mixture of private 
bargaining sessions and floor debates eased several potential 
logjams 
i believe the end is in sight now senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan told his colleagues as they ended their work 
thursday evening 
congress which had hoped to adjourn for the year today was now 
expected to return next week to try to finish the measure with 33 
senate seats and all 435 house seats being contested on election 
day many incumbents would like to have bragging rights to a tough 
crimefighting package 
senators still had more than 50 amendments to wade through the 
suggested changes vary from strengthening child pornography laws 
and encouraging states to confiscate the drivers licenses of 
drunken motorists on the spot to requiring warning labels on 
containers of alcoholic beverages 
but many of the testiest disputes some of them constitutional 
issues that pitted liberals against conservatives seemed to have 
been soothed by compromises or were resolved when one side simply 
outmuscled the other 
conservative lawmakers prevailed when senators voted 6425 to 
retain a provision that would allow capital punishment for people 
involved in illegal drug activities who kill or order the death of 
civilians or law enforcement officers 
death penalty supporters such as sen alfonse damato rny 
argued that the sanction was needed to combat the incredible 
butchery drug dealers were committing on the streets 
its long overdue that that punishment be available damato 
said 
but liberal opponents from both parties arguing that capital 
punishment is barbaric offered an amendment that would substitute 
mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for death 
sentences 
why is it that the senates resolve to fight drug abuse and 
drugrelated crime hangs on whether we will flip the switch on the 
electric chair asked sen mark hatfield rore 
with the house having passed an even harsher version of the bill 
last month containing a somewhat broader death penalty provision 
enactment of the legislation will almost certainly mean a new 
federal death sentence statute 
senators also voted 880 thursday to add a provision allowing 
fines of up to 10000 to be levied against people found to possess 
even small amounts of illegal drugs 
the twoyear legislation uses a shotgun approach to dealing with 
illicit drugs showering 60 percent of its money on prevention and 
treatment programs and 40 percent on law enforcement 
it would add 676 million to federal agency budgets to hire 
3287 new law officers and purchase new equipment and distribute 
275 million to state and local authorities 
a cabinetlevel drug czar would be created to oversee 
federal antidrug efforts penalties for dealing drugs near schools 
would be increased and public housing authorities would be allowed 
to hire investigators to gather evidence of druguse by tenants 
in addition 1 billion would be provided for treatment programs 
across the country including money to build facilities and train 
counselors and teachers and airline railroad and trucking 
industry workers would be subjected drug and alcohol testing 
left unanswered is where money to pay for the measures 
initiatives would come from some senators and their aides said 
thursday that legislators might pass separate legislation to 
provide the funds and add to the deficit either next week or 
after the 101st congress convenes in january 
the house and senate would have to work out their differences 
before sending a bill to president reagan for his signature

with the help of relatives he dug down about two feet and used 
a metal rod to probe another four feet into the grave no sign of a 
casket or vault for andrew carlisle was found 
i dont think were going to find any casket said ola 
carlisle whose husband was buried in 1982 the family said they 
would have a funeral home exhume the body friday 
mrs carlisle said she had trusted wilks completely and was not 
suspicious at the funeral when he asked family members to leave the 
grave site before the coffin was lowered 
the robertson county health department had issued 19 
disinterment permits by thursday afternoon secretary paulette 
cowan said 
wilks who resigned as a robertson county commissioner the day 
he was charged was admired and respected by the community mrs 
clinard said 
ive known him all my life she said there wasnt nothing 
he wouldnt do for nobody people didnt give him nothing but a 
good name for him to do something like this is crazy 
betty ruth jones whose parents husband and daughter were 
buried by wilks said she had no intention of checking the graves 
i think its a disgrace she said god laid those to 
rest

thousands of visitors streamed into the refurbished

a giant glass pyramid destined to be the museums new entrance 
president francois mitterrand cut a tricolored ribbon leading to 
the cour napoleon a vast esplanade between the museums two main

the pyramid 71 feet tall and costing 15 million was designed 
by im pei also on hand for the inauguration 
surrounded by three smaller glass pyramids and set off by seven 
triangular basins in deep blue granite the pyramid seemed to 
change with the weather dull gray when clouds blocked the sun

its like a jewel a diamond sparkling in the outdoors said 
christiane weiler a visitor from toulon its much more 
beautiful than i expected 
the louvre built by king philippe auguste in 1200 as a

its inhabitants over the centuries before it became a museum after 
the french revolution in 1789 
the pyramid had been the subject of heated debate since the

twentyseven students returned to a 
seventh grade class friday after a fourday boycott and picketing 
to demand assignment of a permanent teacher to end a string of 
substitutes and temporaries 
on thursday teacher thad williams had only one student for his 
first day at charles b murphy elementary school the other 27 
either picketed outside the hancock county school board offices or 
stayed home 
theyre confusing us because one teacher comes and tells us 
one thing then another comes and tells us something else 
student ronnell randle said 
the class has had only one english test and two science tests 
this year and only one homework assignment said student daniel 
mcguire 
the substitutes just make us write the chapter copy the book 
how can you learn writing the book jamie bennett asked 
cheryl bennett one of about five parents who marched with the 
youngsters said more students would have picketed had they been 
able to get transportation 
its been seven weeks she said nineweek tests are 
coming up if theyre going to give the kids grades theyre going 
to have to have papers at home to justify the grades 
she said school officials have never contacted us to try to 
work it out we never received any information saying were trying 
to get you a teacher were having trouble 
bennett said the students returned friday because they were 
willing to give williams a chance we dont want to make a 
spectacle we just want to make a point she said 
school superintendent terrell randolph said six teachers had 
left charles b murphy this year for various reasons and the 
seventh grade teacher moved to eighth grade he said a new seventh 
grade teacher was employed but had problems obtaining certification 
for that grade level 
he said a certified teacher was then hired evaluated and let 
go in the interim substitute teachers have been used 
randolph said williams a certified teacher with a masters 
degree in elementary education will be paid as a substitute until 
he is evaluated sometime next week to determine if he can keep the 
job 
he said he had searched nearby mississippi and louisiana school 
districts for qualified teachers but not many wanted to commute to 
pearlington on the gulf coast 
he said others werent interested in a job that required 
teaching math english science and social studies in a 
selfcontained classroom in larger schools seventh and eighth 
grades are departmentalized with different teachers teaching 
different subjects 
bennett said she understands the districts problems 
but thats not our problem our problems are our kids thats 
why these people are elected by us why theyre paid good salaries 
we just want what every other school in hancock county has she

washington and managua may be at odds 
but how important can that be when the los angeles dodgers 
described here admiringly as a bunch of guerrillas have made 
it to the world series 
come october beisbolcrazed nicaraguans think more about 
the arms in the bullpen than the arms to the contras 
baseball defeated the ideologies said juan navarro sports 
editor of the opposition daily la prensa 
hundreds of nicaraguans packed bars at tourist hotels during the 
american and national league playoffs paying about 14 almost 
the equivalent of a monthly minimum wage for three drinks and the 
right to sit and watch satellite transmissions on a large screen 
when the new york mets howard johnson looked at a called third 
strike from the orel hershiser on wednesday night to end the 
national league playoffs nicaraguans shouted approval in sympathy 
with the underdog 
latins have always liked the dodgers because the dodgers have 
always had latin players navarro said besides they always 
played the yankees 
the regular antius tone of newspapers changes during the 
postseason play in el norte 
barricada the government newspaper had a oneword headline to 
explain the the dodgers triumph guts 
barricada sports editor edgardo tijerino wrote that the win over 
the mets by tommy lasordas gang ratifies the greatness of 
baseball where everything is possible including having an apparent 
flyweight beat a heavyweight 
local columnists write about the dodgers mets athletics and 
red sox with authority 
one writer reflecting on a subject nicaraguans are familiar 
with called the dodgers a bunch of guerrillas 
the sandinista government started as a guerrilla movement that 
overthrew dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 since then the united 
states has supported contra guerrillas who want to overthrow the 
sandinistas 
baseball arrived in nicaragua in 1891 and grew in the early part 
of the century boosted by the presence for many years of the 
marines during the many us interventions in nicaragua 
nicaragua has hundreds of amateur teams and an organized 
national baseball league the championship in april pitted a team 
from the englishspeaking and often rebellious east coast against a 
sandinista army team from the capital of managua 
the army team supported by members of the sandinista party 
directorate came back from a 31 deficit to win in seven 
one of the most tragic moments in the american film under 
fire which depicted the triumph of the sandinistas in 1979 came 
when an aspiring pitcher turned grenadethrower is killed by an 
american mercenary 
baseball fanaticism doesnt stop at the border only last month 
a us philanthropist delivered a load of vital supplies to 
nicaraguan refugees who have fled to honduras bats balls and 
gloves 
several nicaraguans have made it to the majors the best known 
currently is pitcher dennis martinez of the montreal expos 
an economic crisis and a us embargo make seeing the playoffs 
in nicaragua difficult but not impossible international hotels 
pick up the television picture with satellite dishes for their 
closed circuit transmissions 
the high cost of tv rights and problems caused by the us 
embargo rule out general television broadcasts but correspondents 
stationed in the hotels relay playbyplay and color commentary in 
spanish on at least four radio stations

prime minister margaret thatcher 
winding up the annual conference of her conservative party today 
pledged she will be as staunch an ally to the new american 
president as she has been to ronald reagan 
she was speaking in a keynote address received with thunderous 
applause and chants of 10 more years from the 4500 delegates 
mrs thatcher also urged britons to maintain a generous 
society in what was widely seen as an initiative on social 
issues following nearly a decade of her rightwing economic 
policies 
millions of britons have become richer as a result of thatchers 
policies but unemployment has more than doubled and critics 
charge she has encouraged a materialistic greedy and uncaring 
society 
at the end of the 45minute address delegates waved union jacks 
and the blue flag of the conservative party as the convention 
center in this south england resort echoed with more chants of 10 
more years 
mrs thatcher 63 flanked by the party hierarchy declared 
the conservative party occupies the common ground of british 
politics and so it has fallen to us to lead britain into the 
1990s and who knows beyond 
the delegates joined in a traditional chorus of the national 
anthem god save the queen and the favorite tory anthem 
land of hope and glory 
on britains particularly close relationship with the united 
states in the 1980s while she and reagan have been in office mrs 
thatcher said reagan has rebuilt the strength and confidence of 
the west not without a little help and inspired the democracies 
to go out and win the battle of ideas 
it is vital that britain and america should always stand 
together so the next president of the united states too will have 
the united kingdom as a staunch ally 
on social issues mrs thatcher said her economic policies were 
encouraging not greed but the best in human nature 
she urged britons to give more to charity assist in crime 
prevention and promised new efforts to preserve the environment 
the fact is that prosperity has created not the selfish 
society but the generous society said mrs thatcher 
she also said the founding concept of the european economic 
community was under attack from those who see european unity as a 
vehicle for spreading socialism 
referring to a speech last month in which she ruled out a united 
states of europe and stressed the separate identities of the 12 eec 
countries mrs thatcher said it stirred criticism because it 
wasnt at all convenient for those who want to bring about a 
federal europe by stealth 
we havent worked all these years to free britain from the 
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door 
of central control and bureacracy from brussels she said of the 
eec headquarters in the belgian capital 
mrs thatchers domestic theme of civic responsibility in the 
keynote speech reflected official anxiety about rising crime 
including street violence and hooliganism by soccer fans in a 
period of growing prosperity 
on thursday chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson the 
treasury chief said the government was determined to hold down 
spending a cornerstone of mrs thatchers policy 
with inflation up to 57 percent and rising lawson in his 
address avoided a timetable for a government pledge to cut basic 
income tax from 25 to 20 percent he promised tax cuts when 
prudent and forecast a drop next year in inflation 
despite signs of trouble in an economy where earlier tax cuts 
and huge borrowing by consumers has fueled growth mrs thatcher 
retains a comfortable lead in polls over the opposition labor party 
labor which held its annual conference last week is tussling 
with a policy overhaul aimed at moderating its leftwing platform

parliament approved a new 
communistdominated cabinet today that failed according to prime 
minister mieczyslaw rakowski to broaden the base of the government 
by including opposition members 
however rakowski insisted that poland will be able to achieve 
political reform without participation of the banned trade union 
solidarity 
i dont limit democratization to the recognition of 
solidarity i dont think that the restoration of solidarity may be 
proof of the fact that our country is becoming more democratic 
he said at his first news conference as prime minister 
i think the democratic processes which are being implemented 
in poland for several years now are accelerating at present and it 
is all happening without the participation of solidarity 
rakowski said 
rakowski made his remarks at a 90minute session broadcast live 
on national radio just after polands parliament the sejm 
approved the new cabinet by a 3631 vote 
a new generation of young party members rakowski nominated 
thursday assumed posts to oversee economic affairs but senior 
communist party members retained the key interior defense and 
foreign ministers 
andrzej wroblewski 38 became the head of the important 
ministry of finance and dominik jastrzebski 46 took charge of the 
ministry of foreign economic cooperation 
mieczyslaw wilczek a wealthy private businessman who is also a 
communist party member assumes the post of minister of industry 
rakowski reserved four spots in his government for what he 
termed the constructive opposition but said the unidentified 
candidates for the posts have turned them down 
on thursday solidarity leader lech walesa said whether the 
opposition accepts the posts depends on whether the government 
could bring about change and accept the banned union 
the cabinet changes are aimed at ending a political and economic 
crisis in poland with an annual inflation rate of 60 percent 
rakowski bumped several senior officials responsible for the 
governments failing economic reform program deputy prime minister 
czeslaw sadowski the economic planning chief and deputy prime 
minister zbigniew szalajda the industry chief lost their jobs 
rakowski proposed nine new ministers five belong to the ruling 
polish united workers party or communist party one is from the 
peasants party and two are from the democratic party both 
parties are allies of the communist party 
izabela planetamalecka the designated minister of health and 
social policy was the only nonparty member and only woman 
nominated 
rakowski had proposed the four opposition members who he didnt 
name as deputy premier minister of labor and social policy 
undersecretary in the housing ministry and a newly created post as 
minister without portfolio in charge of contacts with various 
communities 
in his speech thursday rakowski said he hoped coming talks 
between the government and the opposition including walesa could 
lead to change 
we approach it with the best of will we are aiming for 
reasonable compromise which would ensure the maximum of possible 
change he said 
authorities promised the talks following widespread strikes in 
august polands worst labor unrest in seven years 
the talks to begin next week will discuss the political and 
economic crisis and consider the future of solidarity which was 
the soviet blocs only recognized trade union until it was 
suppressed in 1981 and banned in 1982 
us deputy secretary of state john c whitehead at the end of 
a threeday visit to poland today urged patience in the talks and 
said he hoped they would lead to the relegalization of solidarity 
rakowski former party propaganda chief was approved sept 27 
to replace zbigniew messner whose cabinet resigned sept 19 after 
fierce criticism for mishandling the partyapproved economic reform 
program it was the first time the entire government stepped down 
in postwar poland

a newspaper reported today that teams 
representing the united states and iran have recessed talks aimed 
at releasing american hostages in lebanon because of news leaks 
about the negotiations 
but the nation a new englishlanguage weekly that has run 
several articles on the subject said skeleton delegations 
remained in switzerland ready to resume talks 
the united states has denied repeatedly that any official 
negotiations are under way with iran to try to secure freedom for

remain in capitivity 
leaders of the us and iranian negotiating teams returned 
home for consultations this week leaving skeleton delegations 
ready to resume contacts the nation said 
it added the delay in resumption of negotiations is 
attributed partly to the reports on the talks 
the recess came after the talks reached a crucial phase 
following singhs release the paper said it did not elaborate 
the paper also quoted an unidentified iranian diplomat in geneva 
as saying iran has been disappointed with the us stance in the 
talks 
all the us and britain are offering to date is longterm aid 
for restoring irans wardamaged economy and only through a 
friendly third world nation the diplomat was quoted as saying 
in its first story on the reported talks two weeks earlier the 
nation said the united states struck a secret deal with iran 
promising economic aid renewal of arms sales the release of 
billions of dollars of frozen iranian assets in us banks and 
resumption of diplomatic relations 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists anglican envoy terry waite 
journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man 
with dual british and irish nationality whose release is also 
sought by the irish government

collett a new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian 
abductors claim they killed him his body was never found 
at the white house today presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater again denied that negotiations with iran were taking 
place 
no one is authorized to talk for the us government no one

as we have said before there are all kinds of people around 
the world freelancing on this situation he said fitzwater also 
predicted there would be more such stories although he did not say 
why 
suffice it to say we find them the news reports mostly 
detrimental he said what they do is build up peoples 
expectations when they are not warranted

verses saying he supports free expression but not if it insults 
others a news report said 
gandhi was responding to protests of his governments banning of 
salman rushdies latest novel the book has been nominated for 
britains highest literary award the booker prize 
the united news of india quoted gandhi as saying he had not read 
it and would not reply to a letter from rushdie urging gandhi to 
end the ban the prime minister spoke to reporters while touring 
four flooded states in northern india

broad satire on india after independence his second novel

on oct 5 the finance ministry barred importation of the novel 
or sale of it within india 
moslems including members of parliament said they feared 
moslem militants might use the book to incite riots 
according to uni gandhi told reporters the ban was imposed 
because the government believed the book might hurt the feelings of 
moslems who make up 11 percent of indias 880 million people

freedom but that this does not warrant encroachment on sentiments 
of certain communities

in his letter which was published on the front pages of major 
indian dailies thursday rushdie accused gandhi of denying him the 
right to free expression at the behest of religious zealots

said in an editorial today that the demand for the ban was 
unjustified 
the satanic verses was published sept 22 in britain and is

prosecutors may use a suspected lebanese 
terrorists confession as evidence when he stands trial on charges 
of leading a 1985 airline hijacking in the middle east a federal 
appeals court ruled friday 
a threejudge appeals panel reversed the decision of a lower 
court judge that the fbi had illegally obtained the signed 
confession from fawaz younis about the june 11 1985 hijacking of 
a royal jordanian airliner 
younis was arrested sept 13 1987 after being lured aboard an 
fbichartered yacht off cyprus by the prosepct of making a drug 
deal he is awaiting trial in us district court on charges he led 
a group of five men who hijacked the airliner in beirut 
the appeals panel said it found no evidence to support us 
district judge barrington d parkers finding that younis 
recurrent bouts of seasickness had impaired his understanding when 
he was advised by the fbi of his right to remain silent 
the panel rejected as clearly erroneous parkers finding 
that during the interrogation sessions aboard a navy ship younis 
suffered throbbing and numbing pain from wrists that were 
fractured when fbi agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht 
the interrogation of younis hardly qualifies as a model for 
law enforcement behavior circuit judge abner mikva wrote for the 
panel of the us circuit court of appeals here but the 
constitution does not require pictureperfect routines 
younis physical circumstances at the time that he waived his 
miranda rights may well have been uncomfortable and his sudden 
arrest no doubt took him by surprise the court said 
the fbi agents might well have used less force in arresting 
younis so as not to have fractured his wrists they could have 
also been more solicitous of younis welfare following arrest for 
example by giving him medication against nausea right away 
but discomfort and surprise by themselves have never 
sufficed to render a waiver unknowing and involuntary provided 
that police administer proper warnings and do not engage in 
intimidation coercion or deception mikva said in an opinion 
joined by circuit judges james l buckley and douglas h ginsburg 
parker who sharply criticized the fbis tactics had suppressed 
the confession as evidence last february prompting an appeal by 
federal prosecutors that has delayed the trial now scheduled to 
begin nov 14 
the appeals court concluded that the fbi properly advised younis 
of his constitutional rights under the procedure mandated by the 
supreme courts landmark miranda decision in 1966 
each time younis complained of seasickness the interrogation 
was stopped so the suspect could rest the court noted 
younis not only said that he understood the warnings and 
agreed to waive the rights contained therein but proceeded to 
recount his participation in the hijacking the court said 
assessing the totality of the circumstances we cannot 
conclude that younis waiver was invalid the court said 
following his arrest aboard the yacht younis was transferred to 
the uss butte on which he was interrogated during a fourday 
voyage before he was flown to washington 
younis a former member of the shiite amal militia is accused 
of leading the group of five men who stormed the royal jordanian 
airliner with ak47 assault rifles at beirut international airport 
the hijackers forced the airliner to fly to several locations in 
the mediterranean including cyprus and sicily before the plane 
returned to beirut 30 hours later 
after the airliners 74 passengers and crew members were 
released the hijackers blew up the plane on the runway 
besides the confession federal prosecutors have a videotape of 
a man identified as younis reading a statement to reporters at the 
airport the tape shows the plane being blown up in the background 
the hijackers seeking to force the arab league to remove 
palestinian refugees from lebanon ordered the plane to fly to 
tunis tunisia where the organization was meeting tunisian 
authorities refused to allow the plane to land there

and capped on both ends while investigating a house fire one of 
the tubes contained several hundred dollars said another police 
spokesman art wright 
these had the appearance and dimensions to make people think 
they were a bomb when in fact they werent jacobson said our 
concern was safety of people and property first 
police summoned an army bomb squad which used explosives to 
destroy the tubes 
wright said the pipes apparently were left behind by a previous

with just three and a half weeks to go until 
the presidential election democrat michael dukakis may have lost 
his last best chance to overtake vice president george bush 
the opportunities and potential surprises of the debates are 
over and the 1988 campaign entered its final phase on friday with 
the guideposts from now until election day clearly marked 
from now on campaign packaging will assert an even stronger 
hold with schedules and rhetoric more tightly controlled than 
before and that should benefit bush and make it even harder for 
dukakis to find an opening to turn the tide of the campaign 
even dukakis people conceded after thursdays encounter at ucla 
that the massachusetts governor did not deliver the leveling blow 
that some had hoped for 
we didnt expect a knockout what we expected was a strong 
effort said campaign manager susan estrich 
but whether that effort will be enough to make much difference 
in the dwindling days remaining for a campaign that has been 
lagging in the polls since late august seemed questionable 
the vice president described by aide sheila tate as good at 
dodging and weaving might have gloated that dukakis didnt lay 
a glove on him the phrase he had used after his onair spat with 
cbs dan rather last winter 
instead bush merely said he was very happy about the way 
things went he had aides pronounce the victory for him 
for bush the stakes werent as high as for dukakis in 
thursdays jousting he only had to avoid making serious mistakes 
most analysts seemed to agree that bush looked more comfortable 
dukakis stiffer in the final debate with no major gaffes on either 
side 
for his part dukais was supposed to try to look warmer more 
human 
and in fact both candidates seemed to be seeking 
lessnegative moreopen images although bush aides denied that 
dukakis had scored many points in the miss congeniality contest 
i think im a reasonably likable guy dukakis told an 
audience estimated at a bit more than 60 million but im also a 
serious guy i think the presidency of the united states is a very 
serious office 
bush who polls show has overcome most of the earlier perception 
of him as being aloof and wimpish had his own words on the 
issue of likability 
i dont think its a question of whether people like you or 
not to make you an effective leader i think its whether you share 
the broad dreams of the american people i think its a question of 
values not likability or lovability 
bush aides before the debate said they expected some kind of 
surprise assault from the democrat but it never materialized 
and what may have been dukakis harshest thrust his criticism 
of republican running mate sen dan quayle who polls have shown is 
hurting the gop ticket brought what may have been a neutralizing 
parry from bush 
ive never seen a campaign where a presidential nominee runs 
against my vice presidential nominee he said 
from now on dukakis will have to look even harder for something 
dramatic to turn around his campaign in a year in which even bush 
contends political activity so far has generated more heat than 
light 
with no more debates planned and with polls suggesting bush is 
in good shape to win an electoralcollege majority dukakis work 
appears to be cut out for him

a campaign commercial featuring an interview 
with plo leader yasser arafat was banned friday by an election 
official on the grounds it violated antiterrorism laws the 
producer of the advertisement said 
the twominute commercial for the leftwing progressive list for 
peace shows arafat saying i accept israels international 
legitimacy i accept un resolutions 242 and 338 
israel has said it will not negotiate with the plo unless it 
accepts the two un resolutions which recognize the jewish 
states sovereignty and call for israel to withdraw from territory 
occupied in the 1967 middle east war 
the progressive list for peace will appeal the decision to the 
supreme court on sunday party spokesman adam keller said 
its nonsense to say that showing a palestinian speaking about 
peace violates a law against terrorism keller said noting that 
the rightwing likud party was permitted to use an ad showing a 
1970 film of arafat with a machine gun 
its unreasonable that the likud can show him as a warmonger 
and we cant show the other side of the coin keller said we 
had hoped to break the monstrous image given to the plo by the 
official propaganda in israel 
israels law against terrorism forbids public identification 
with a terrorist organization 
under israeli election laws all campaign commercials must be 
approved for airing by the central elections committee the 
committee has representatives of all parties but its chairman 
always a supreme court judge rules on the ads 
eyal sivan the commercials producer said he was told by the 
office of judge eliezer goldberg the committee chairman that 
portions of the ad with interviews of arafat and other plo members 
were banned 
sivan said the party will air the ad saturday night with all but 
the last 30 seconds blacked out 
from our point of view this is more proof that israeli 
officials are not interested in peace with the palestinian 
people sivan said 
keller said the commercial which shows a closeup of arafat 
sitting on a sofa was taped a few weeks ago but he would not say 
where 
the ad also quotes khaled el hassan a member of the plos 
parliamentinexile as saying we dont want to throw anybody 
into the sea we want peace 
the progressive list which currently holds two seats in the 
israeli parliament favors negotiations with the plo and advocates 
a withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
israeli policy in the occupied territories where more than 290 
palestinians have been killed in a 10monthold uprising is a key 
issue in the nov 1 national elections 
rightwing parties lead by prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
likud bloc are trying to convince the supreme court to disqualify 
the progressive list from the elections on grounds it threatens 
israels existence

three television networks have filed suit 
against wyomings restrictions on voter canvassing arguing they 
unconstitutionally hamper coverage of the political process 
nbc cbs and abc charge the law unfairly prohibits them from 
reporting on how and why people voted the way they did according 
to the lawsuit 
the networks also are prevented from identifying and commenting 
on social and political trends said the suit filed thursday 
in federal court 
state officials were unsure this morning how they would respond 
a similar lawsuit filed in washington state three years ago 
resulted in a similar restriction against exit polling being 
overturned 
wyomings law adopted in 1983 bans voter canvassing within 100 
yards of buildings holding polling stations it also prohibits any 
kind of campaigning within that zone and carries a possible 1000 
fine or sixmonth jail sentence for those who violate the statute 
but such restrictions violate the first amendment to the 
constitution as made applicable to the states through the 14th 
amendment the networks lawsuit contends 
unless the law is overturned the networks claim they will be 
prevented from gathering and reporting truthful and significant 
information about the political process to the public 
the law was designed to minimize distractions at polling places 
according to secretary of state kathy karpan who along with 
wyoming attorney general joe meyer was named as defendant in the 
case 
you want to have adequate voting you want to have that line 
moving along you want to neutralize that zone she said 
karpan who received notice of the suit this morning wasnt 
surprised by it 
im aware of challenges in other states its been something 
that we were rather braced for she said 
karpan did not however know how the state would respond to the 
lawsuit since she had not consulted with the attorney general

george bush and michael dukakis headed into 
the stretch run of their white house campaign today the vice 
presidents advisers ecstatic with his highly rated debate 
performance and dukakis conceding the road ahead of us is going 
to be tough 
we have 25 days dukakis said 25 of the most important 
days in the political history of this country he spoke today to 
a group of black ministers after an introduction by former 
democratic rival jesse jackson who urged the ministers to help get 
out the vote for dukakis 
instant debate polls gave a clear edge to bush after his 90 
minutes on stage with dukakis thursday night 
an abc news survey called the vice president the winner by 49 
percent to 33 percent and a los angeles times poll had it 47 to 26 
with the rest unsure an associated press panel of debate judges 
also rated bush the winner reversing the judgment from the first 
debate sept 25 when dukakis was perceived the victor 
bush supporters used the morning tv talk shows to declare the 
battle all but won 
sen phil gramm rtexas said on nbcs today program if 
i were working for michael dukakis id be sending out resumes this 
morning 
not so fast countered dukakis closest aide john sasso 
he said the massachusetts governor scored with undecided and 
swing voters last evening in the second and final debate of the 
campaign thats what we were looking for 
sasso conceded that the democrat trails in the polls but he 
said its well within range and announced new television 
advertisements featuring the candidate talking in his shirtsleeves 
about campaign concerns 
dukakis and bush both arranged to campaign during the day in 
california the biggest electoralvote state and a tossup in all 
the polls the democrat with running mate lloyd bentsen at his side 
bushs republican running mate dan quayle showed the gop 
elation say good night mike he said at a thursday night rally 
neither candidate was up and out in public early today after 
attending postdebate rallies 
im happy with the way it came out a grinning bush said 
thursday night en route to a postdebate rally democrats were 
guarded in their assessments and acknowledged that dukakis did not 
land a knockout blow 
however dukakis claimed victory and said the race was very 
very close and its going to get even closer after tonight 
dukakis had gone into the debate on the ucla campus hoping to 
shorten bushs lead in the polls while the vice president was 
looking to move further ahead 
once and for all bush declared there would not be a third 
debate saying people have had it up to here with debates 
dukakis told a postdebate rally i think we ought to have 
that third debate dont you weve gotten the republicans out from 
behind the flag factory and the balloons and discussing the issues 
thats why debates are so important 
before a primetime television audience of tens of millions of 
people bush and dukakis traded blows over social security 
abortion the death penalty the qualifications of their running 
mates and national defense 
amid the battle over issues there also was a contest to 
demonstrate personal warmth and likability 
dukakis who has been criticized as being too controlled and 
unemotional was asked to address the question of his affability 
i think im a reasonably likable guy he said im serious 
though i think im a little more lovable thse days than i used to 
be back in my youth when i began in the state legislature 
bush sparring with the panel of debate questioners was playful 
at times reacting in mock horror when asked if his running mate 
dan quayle were qualified to take over if bush were assassinated 
more seriously bush said id have confidence in him and i 
made a good selection polls indicate that quayle has been a drag 
on the republican ticket 
there also were moments of poignancy both men talked of losing 
a child bush a daughter to leukemia and dukakis a child 20 minutes 
after it was born 
defending himself against charges he was running a negative 
campaign bush said i have defined the issues and i am not going 
to let governor dukakis go through this election without explaining 
some of these very liberal positions hes the one a liberal 
traditional liberal a progressive liberal democrat 
dukakis shot back in 1980 president reagan called you a 
liberal for voting for federal gun control but lets stop 
labeling each other and lets get to the heart of the matter which 
is the future of this country 
accusing bush of changing positions of social security the 
environment and ethics in government dukakis said i dont know 
which george bush im listening to 
bush promised that e would never cut social security dukakis 
noted that the administration had tried to do just that and said 
im sure youll try to do it again 
bush said that as president he would not have any conservative 
litmus test for supreme court justices he also noted that he 
supported president reagans controversial selection of 
conservative judge robert bork for the supreme court which was 
rejected by the senate 
dukakis responded if the vice president of the united states 
thinks that robert bork was an outstanding appointment that is a 
very good reason for voting for mike dukakis on the 8th of november 
challenging the administration on foreign policy dukakis said 
lets go to work and end this fiasco in central america a failed 
policy which has actually increased cuban and soviet influence 
responding bush said that the policy in central america 
regrettably has failed because the congress has been unwilling to 
support those who have been fighting for freedom 
on national defense dukakis said theres no way that we can 
build all of the weapons the vice president says he wants to build 
within the defense budget bush criticized dukakis for supporting 
a nuclear weapons freeze in the early 1980s and in a slap at his 
rivals inexperience in foreign policy said you just dont make 
unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the soviets are going to 
behave themselves

the awarding of the nobel prize for 
literature to egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz is being interpreted 
as a boost for arabisraeli relations and a good omen for middle 
east peace 
the 76yearold author who on thursday became the first arab 
writer to win the award has been attacked in the past for 
supporting the usbrokered camp david agreement between egypt and 
israel 
egyptians compare mahfouz with englands charles dickens and 
frances victor hugo 
but he calls himself only a thirdrate writer naming 
william shakespeare and leo tolstoy as firstrate writers and 
dickens and george bernard shaw as secondrate 
mahfouzs admirers laud his stubborn advocacy of the ideals of 
democracy 
while his critics speak out openly his supporters seek 
anonymity saying the movement for peace in the middle east remains 
largely defenseless against terrorist violence and political 
maneuvering 
mahfouzs glorious gain will fire the minds of generations of 
arab writers to emulate his example and stress arabjewish peace 
said one admirer a highly placed arab official 
the swedish academy said that mahfouzs work which includes 40 
novels had advanced the art of the novel a relatively new genre 
in arabic literature 
several arab writers contended that mahfouz was favored for the 
prize because of writings that allegedly are proisraeli jordanian 
novelist fakhry kaawar insisted that mahfouz had contributed 
greatly to push zionism 
many arab intellectuals believe the swedish nobel prize 
committee comes under a strong jewish influence 
bahrains information minister tariq almoayyed said mahfouzs 
award was a source of pride for egypt and all arabs 
after decrying the monarchy of king farouk and the british 
occupation of egypt in his early books mahfouz resorted to 
allegory to condemn dictatorial practices in his country that were 
being justified on nationalistic grounds 
he never accorded the late king farouk any praise 
at one point mahfouz lamented egypts loss of identity 
depicting the nation in a novel called the road as an 
illegimate boy moving from a small town to the crowded capital in 
search of his father the boy aimlessly roams through cairo turns 
into a criminal and ends up dying on the gallows 
in another novel miramar mahfouz took a more obvious swipe 
at dictatorship portraying egypt as a maid at a boarding house 
called miramar with a clientele of suitors representing former 
feudalists emerging revolutionaries counterrevolutionaries and 
opportunists 
the maid rejects all the suitors as deceitful and awards her 
favors to a poor but honest newspaper delivery boy 
after the defeat of the arabs in the 1967 war with israel 
mahfouz almost totally shed his allegory and confronted gamal abdel 
nassers police state more directly 
alkarnak a novel about arrests and torture of decent 
egyptians by hated intelligence officers has a theme that carries 
echoes of the gestapo in nazi germany 
one novel cited by the nobel judges is children of gebelawi 
written in 1959 and still banned in egypt the characters are based 
on adam and eve moses jesus mohammed and a modern scientist 
the swedish academy described it as an allegory of humanitys 
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of 
religion 
mahfouzs firm belief in the oneness of humanity is the basis of 
his support for ending centuries of arab hatred of the jews 
but he also insists that the palestinians should be allowed to 
carve out their own destiny in an independent state

us military officials outlined 
plans friday for turning rocket launchers into scrap under the 
ussoviet treaty eliminating intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
starting wednesday torches and electric saws will cut in half 
the first nine of the pershing 2 launchers at a us army site in 
the hausen section of northwest frankfurt 
work crews will don welding suits and helmets safety glasses 
leather gloves and safety shoes said chief warrant officer richard 
moore 
us and soviet experts wearing hards hats and goggles will 
watch from behind a glassedin partition about four yards away the 
site supervisor told a news briefing 
late friday the us european command in stuttgart said the 
team of soviet inspectors would arrive in frankfurt monday it did 
not say how many soviets were expected 
all 114 of the pershing 2 rocket launchers stationed in west 
germany will be destroyed in hausen within a threeyear period 
said site commander christopher evans 
the launchers themselves are flatbed trucks outfitted with beams 
designed to raise the missiles into a vertical position for firing 
the launchers were designed for both transport and firing of the 
mobile rockets and each is about 31 feet long 
evans a civilian employee of the army stressed that the 
missiles themselves were being taken back to the united states 
i would like to emphasize that this facility has nothing to do 
with the actual missile and never has had evans told reporters 
invited to the predestruction briefing this facility only works 
with the launchers and ground support equipment 
evans said the launchers will be brought one by one into a 
covered work area where the trailer part and the erector mechanism 
will be cut in half 
the work will take about two days for all nine launchers and 
the remains will be taken to a facility in suburban frankfurt to be 
used as scrap metal he said 
all personnel involved have the proper training and 
certification and there is no i repeat no adverse environmental 
impact evans said 
the first nine launchers to be destroyed were stationed at a 
base near stuttgart and were hauled away along with the missiles 
sept 1 that was the first us missile removal under the 
intermediaterange nuclear force treaty signed by president reagan 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in december 
us officials said in september the remaining 420 
intermediaterange us missiles will be removed from western 
europe over a 36month period of the missiles deployed 108 
pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruise missiles were stationed at four 
bases in west germany 
stationing of the missiles had sparked massive protests in 
western europe including a coordinated demonstration in several 
cities that drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets in 
october 1983 deployment of the missiles began the following month 
the soviet union began removing its missiles from czechoslovakia 
and east germany in february before the us senate ratified the 
treaty 
under the treaty the soviet union and the united states agreed 
to eliminate all landbased intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
which have ranges of 300 to 3000 miles

mike and debi herren wanted to be 
farmers but were looking to raise something different and 
something simple that would allow us to get on our feet 
they settled on snails or escargot if you meet one in a 
french restaurant 
the herrens both 26 also tend buffalo on their 176acre farm 
raising snails in illinois is tricky because of the weather 
herren said 
cold weather is the biggest problem he said in 
california they can be raised in the open or in greenhouses but 
here you cant do that 
the herrens raise their snails in a limestone basement of a 
farmhouse where they can keep the temperature constant between 
70 and 80 degrees is the optimum temperature he said 
snails are deaf and blind but need sunlight to reproduce 
herren said artificial light fortunately also gets their juices 
flowing 
the snails have been a piece of cake herren says well 
maybe i shouldnt say that because we both grew up on farms and so 
were used to working hard

retail sales in september dropped for the 
second consecutive month the government said friday confirming 
economists view that the confidence of american consumers is 
slipping 
the commerce department said sales fell 04 percent last month 
to a seasonally adjusted 1337 billion that followed a dip of 01 
percent in august and was the first backtoback drop since 
septemberoctober 1987 
the government data is consistent with a survey earlier this 
week for the conference board a business research organization 
finding that consumer confidence last month suffered the sharpest 
decline since the october stock market crash 
consumers are just very cautious theyre worried about where 
the economy is going and theyre probably right said michael k 
evans an economic consultant in washington i think higher 
interest rates are a factor and i think fear of the future is a 
factor people are wondering what the next administration will 
bring 
the september drop suprised many economists who were expecting 
a modest increase of between 03 and 05 percent but they say the 
declines are a welcome development because weaker consumer demand 
eases inflation pressure on prices 
bond market in early trading friday reacted favorably to the 
sales report traders believe weak sales mean less inflation and 
thus less upward pressure on interest rates 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer in new york said slower economic 
growth means the federal reserve board should be able to keep 
interest rates stable over the next month or two earlier this year 
it had been pushing up rates to fight inflation 
theres been a pause in the economy but it could be the pause 
that refreshes and extends the expansion he said 
however some analysts such as robert brusca of nikko 
securities co international inc note that early estimates of 
retail sales are frequently revised 
brusca said the government figures showing that both auto and 
food sales declined are suspect auto manufacturers reported strong 
sales in september and food sales ought to have risen in a 
reflection of droughtcaused price increases he said 
this report is one great big candidate for revision he said 
the commerce department said auto sales fell 19 percent in 
september to a seasonally adjusted 287 billion following a 22 
percent tumble in august 
excluding the automotive category which tends to make wide 
monthly swings sales were unchanged following a 05 percent rise a 
month earlier 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores 
rebounded in september by 06 percent to 152 billion august 
sales were off by 04 percent mostly because of unusually hot 
weather 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years were down 10 percent entirely because of the 
automotive decline 
furniture sales were up 04 percent in september after holding 
steady in august sales at building supply hardware and garden 
stores were up 11 percent following a 04 percent rise a month 
earlier 
sales of nondurable goods were unchanged in september with 
declines at food stores and gasoline stations offsetting gains 
elsewhere 
food and grocery stores posted a 04 percent drop and gasoline 
sales were off by 02 percent a reflection of price declines 
however sales at restaurants and bars rose 08 percent at 
specialty clothing shops 07 percent and at drug stores 05 
percent 
for the first nine months of the year overall retail sales rose 
59 percent over the same period in 1987 barely better than the 
46 percent rate of inflation

the yen is strong and the dollar is weak and 
salmon fanciers in the northwest are paying for this lesson in 
international economics at the fish counter 
its outrageous said john russell of pure food fish in 
seattles pike place market where fresh chinook or king salmon 
steaks and filets that sold a year ago for 495 and 595 a pound 
now run 795 to 895 russell said 
i think you can safely say that japan is setting the market 
for the species that are valued over there especially the reds or 
sockeye and chum sometimes called keta or brites said lee 
alvorsen of northwest resources consultants 
the bad news for consumers has been good news for northwest 
fishermen who have been netting many more dollars for the same 
amount of work 
with rising demand but no increase in the harvest the japanese 
have begun buying other species as well raising the possibility 
that salmon could be priced off many tables in the northwest in 
other parts of the country where salmon are shipped price 
increases could be even higher alvorsen said 
theyre basically buying them for 50cent dollars said alec 
brindle president of ward cove packing co inc 
kings frequently 20 pounds or larger and the darker sockeye 
usually around six pounds are prized for their oily succulent 
flesh 
coho or silver range from small to intermediate in size and 
are less oily while chum intermediate in size are drier still 
pinks or humpys the smallest run around four pounds and have the 
driest and lightest colored flesh pinks and sockeye are the most 
numerous 
some restaurants renowned for their fish dishes have dropped 
certain kinds of salmon 
at rays boathouse executive chef wayne ludvigsen said he quit 
buying sockeye rather than boost the menu price to 18 or 19 he 
had charged 13 or 14 the past few years 
i dont know of anybody else who has it on the menu 
ludvigsen said 
its become a bad value he said its almost that the 
market was so strong that quality was not the thing just 
getting the fish was the thing 
were reaching price levels that weve never seen before so 
nobody really knows what the ceiling is said bruce gore 
ludvigsens supplier of king salmon that runs 1695 a plate 
gore who fishes cleans and flashfreezes fish at sea from 10 
other boats and sells about 200000 to 250000 pounds a year to 
retailers and restaurants predicted topquality frozen salmon 
would reach 10 to 12 a pound at the counter this winter 
a growing percentage of people are just going to buy chicken 
instead he said 
salmon has probably escalated as fast or faster than any 
seafood said tom dehn special seafood merchandizer at pacific 
fish co 
japanese buying was the main reason for the record 705 million 
paid to commercial fishermen for a soso alaska salmon catch of 
995 million fish this year 
salmon hauled aboard boats from washington state brought fishing 
crews about 240 million and processors 525 million for 67000 
metric tons of fish this year compared with 135 million and 297 
million respectively for 66000 tons in the previous season 
alvorsen said 
alvorsen said salmon prices pretty much rose with the rise of 
the yen coupled with a falloff from record catches of the 
mid1980s and declining frozen and canned inventories 
chuck meachum alaska department of fish and game research 
supervisor for the bristol bay region said the transition from 
canning chiefly for european countries to freezing overwhelmingly 
for the japanese had resulted in a very very strong correlation 
between the price us fishermen are paid and the usjapan 
exchange rate 
fishermen received an average of 140 a pound for 158 million 
bristol bay reds in 1986 when the yen was worth about 170 per 
dollar and 2 a pound for 166 million fish this year with the 
yen at 133 per dollar as of friday

americans sympathize with aids patients but 
only if they got the disease through some means other than 
homosexual activity or drug use according to a poll published 
friday 
seventyfive percent of those surveyed for a new york timescbs 
news poll said they have a lot or some sympathy for people with 
aids while only 19 percent said they had not much or no sympathy 
but when asked about the two groups that comprise the majority 
of aids patients much of the sympathy evaporated apparently 
reflecting public dislike of homosexuals and drug users 
only 36 percent said they had a lot or some sympathy for those 
who got the disease through homosexual activity and only 26 
percent had sympathy for those who got aids through intravenous 
drug use 
homosexuals and drug users make up the overwhelming majority of 
people with aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
a total of 1606 respondents were interviewed by telephone sept 
8 to 11 the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3

president reagan said friday he would not 
hesitate to call congress back in special session if the contra 
rebels are threatened a statement apparently designed to keep the 
rebels hopes alive until a new president can take up their cause 
reagans message to capitol hill had been anticipated for days 
following acknowledgments from both white house officials and gop 
lawmakers that prospects were nil for obtaining a 165 million 
cache of weapons for the rebels in the waning days of the 100th 
congress 
a special session is considered very unlikely 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration wanted to send the message that one of reagans most 
passionate causes is not being abandoned in the final days of his 
administration 
fitzwater said the purpose of the letter was to reassure those 
who are concerned about the contras 
the conclusion was that we didnt have the time we may not 
have had the votes and there was not a crying need to seek the 
military assistance at this time he said 
we want to reassure everyone that we stand behind the 
resistance as the president has often repeated and were prepared 
to call congress back if its necessary the spokesman added 
earlier in the week fitzwater had said administration officials 
had come to the realization that we will just have to wait until 
there is a new president and new congress to see what happens next 
on aid to maintain the resistance as a fighting force 
at present the dwindling contra forces are subsisting on 27 
million in food clothing and medical supplies approved by congress 
last month as part of a pentagon money bill 
they have received no weaponry from the united states since 
february when lethal aid was suspended in deference to efforts at 
reaching a peace accord between the rebels and the leftist 
sandinista government 
the mood in congress remains strongly opposed to sending new 
military aid but under the defense appropriations measure a 
complicated process was established for reagan to request the 
release of the 165 million in weapons if certain conditions were 
met 
but congress would again have to approve the release meaning 
that a special session would be necessary if the request came after 
congres adjourns which is expected next week 
in his statement reagan warned the nicaraguan government 
against taking advantage of the fact that us lawmakers were 
leaving town soon and would be unable to send any aid until a new 
congress convenes in january 
in the event the sandinistas attempt to capitalize on this 
situation they should know i would not hesitate to call the 100th 
congress back into session to consider emergency assistance to the 
freedom fighters reagan said 
fitzwater said the white house would prefer not to call a 
special session particularly since any other subject could be put 
before the lawmakers 
asked about the threat on wednesday house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said 
i hope the president doesnt try to grandstand and make a 
political football out of central america its a bit of show 
biz to come around after we have gone home surely he wont do 
that 
reagans statement also contained the expected pledge of 
continued support for the contra rebels 
america must stand with those who fight for freedom in 
nicaragua reagan said we have an obligation to share the 
blessings of our liberty with those who yearn for freedom in 
nicaragua their struggle is our struggle and together we can 
achieve democracy in nicaragua 
fitzwater denied that reagan was abandoning the contras saying 
the decision against pushing the military aid issue at this time is 
a long way from backing off from the contras 
the president will stand with this until the end of his term 
in january the spokesman said

george bushs campaign has protested to the 
sierra club that the club is unfairly criticizing one of his 
actions in delaying a reduction in the lead content of gasoline 
seven years ago a club lobbyist said friday 
the lobbyist blake early said bush aides said the regulation 
in question went into effect after a period of review and we 
shouldnt be hitting them up on it he did not say who lodged the 
complaint 
mark goodin a spokesman for the bush campaign said he did not 
have information immediately at hand on such a protest asked if 
the campaign believed the criticism unfair goodin replied we 
sure do 
bush as vice president headed an administration task force that 
forced agencies to reexamine and in some cases delay or cancel 
hundreds of regulations just after president reagan took office in 
1981 
one of these was a planned reduction in the lead content of 
gasoline fourteen months later in july 1982 the environmental 
protection agency went ahead with a rule closely paralleling its 
original plan 
lead is a deadly poison in high concentrations and can cause 
brain damage in children used for decades in gasoline to boost 
octane it can disable exhaust pollution control equipment on 
post1975 cars epa said thousands of children probably were 
suffering slight iq reductions because of lead in their blood from 
auto exhausts and other sources 
since then the agency has ordered a further 90 percent 
reduction in the lead content of gasoline which bush claimed 
credit for in thursday nights debate with michael dukakis 
the reconsideration ordered by the bush task force in 1981 was 
prompted by complaints from small refiners that they would lose 
money if they had to meet the new standards 
early said it was not clear that the administrations 
eventual support was not the result of the large public outcry 
that followed news of epas decision to reconsider the lead 
reduction program 
early spoke at a news conference where the club released a 
report critical of another action of the task force that led epa to 
drop its requirement for double liners under 1078 existing surface 
impoundments of hazardous waste liquids a requirement that 
congress wrote into the law in 1984 and which becomes effective 
next month

bill harding is a different kind of tailor 
crafting clothing that conveys a message about the environment a 
message that grows because his fashions are made of grass growing 
on fabric 
harding an artist began growing grass on clothing and other 
objects about nine years ago now he has decided to see if theres 
a market for grass clothing 
ill be selling long grasscovered robes for 150 he says 
and im putting together an 85 grassgrowing kit whichll 
contain a onesizefitsall robe already seeded a hanger a 
plastic bag a plant mister and an instruction booklet 
harding 29 recently taught a class on growing grass clothing 
at expressways childrens museum on the north side and two weeks 
later his students wore their green outfits in a parade around the 
museum 
wearing one is a unique experience he says its the only 
instance besides being in the womb where youre enclosed in a 
living thing its heavy and damp a robe may weigh 15 pounds but 
after wearing the suit for an hour you feel relaxed and energized 
it retains your body heat and stays at body temperature too 
its your own portable environment if everyone took care of 
their environment like people take care of their grass clothes 
wed be on a path to survival 
concern about the environment prompted harding to plant his 
first grass seeds on fabric growing miniature lawns on a suit of 
clothes including shoes tie and hat for an art show 
after it was grown i put it on then came onstage and had 
someone chase me with a lawn mower the idea was that our 
environment is being pursued mowed down by technology 
harding says 
he says his social and political statements with grass arent 
difficult or expensive to grow and he buys the garments that 
support the wearable lawns from thrift shops 
grass is especially good for my purposes since it doesnt take 
as long as most plants to germinate if its sufficiently watered 
he says 
i grew three grass suits a robe and two jackets in my damp 
basement for a wedding recently he adds i used 1 gallons of 
water a day for each suit and the robe plus a gallon a day for 
each jacket it took 11 days they came out pretty good

the miami news an afternoon newspaper that has won 
five pulitzer prizes will be closed by the end of the year if no 
buyer can be found parent company cox enterprises said friday 
the facts concerning the condition of the news are clear 
said miami news publisher david kraslow we have given this 
community our best as professionals the news is a good newspaper 
with a rich and proud tradition 
it is damned painful to contemplate the likely demise of a 
newspaper that has given this community so much for so long 
the staff of the news which was founded in 1896 was informed 
of the decision friday morning 
everyones in shock said city editor paul kaplan we were 
offered what was called a generous severance plan im not 
surprised this has happened i guess when you look at it from the 
outside were a dying newspaper 
cox officials said the news was losing too much money 
quite simply the miami news despite an outstanding editorial 
presentation is not supported by advertisers or readers david 
easterly president of the cox newspaper division said in a 
statement released in atlanta 
daily circulation has declined from 112000 in 1966 to below 
48000 today while dade county households have grown by 80 percent 
in the same period this means that the miami news now serves fewer 
than 8 percent of dade county households 
the miami news has operated since 1966 under a joint operating 
agreement with the miami herald owned by knightridder inc 
under the 30year joa the herald a morning newspaper is 
responsible for providing advertising circulation production and 
promotion services to the news atlantabased cox owns the 
newspaper and manages only the editorial department of the news 
cox enterprises will profit on a nonexistent newspaper under 
the terms of an agreement negotiated more than a year ago with 
knightridder inc cox officials said 
under the new agreement knightridder will pay cox enterprises 
a percentage of the heralds profits based on a sliding scale 
through the year 2021 even if the news ceases publication 
the profit percentage which was 15 percent under the old 
agreement will decline to 10 percent over the next five years 
under the new deal and will remain at that level until 2021 
easterly said 
that means cox could earn 165 million from the herald by 
conservative estimates based on current figures over the next 33 
years easterly said 
james c kennedy chairman and chief executive officer of cox 
made the announcement with a deep sense of sorrow and regret 
the miami news has a long and proud history as an 
outstanding crusading newspaper it has been home and continues to 
be home to a number of distinguished reporters and editors and a 
vital voice in miamis history kennedy said 
one of its staff is editorial cartoonist don wright twotime 
pulitzer prize winner whose work is syndicated in newspapers 
across the country 
the news won three other pulitzers the first in 1939 for a 
series of stories about three miami city commissioners promoting 
pet projects at city hall in 1959 for reporter howard van smiths 
series on the plight of south floridas migrant workers and in 
1962 for reporter hal hendrixs coverage of the cuban missile 
crisis 
easterly said that since 1966 knightridder and cox have lost 
more than 90 million in operating the news he said the net cost 
of publishing the miami news is running about 9 million a year and 
would be expected to worsen over time 
the first edition of the miami metropolis the original name of 
the miami news was printed on creamcolored paper on may 15 
1896 just a few months before the pioneer development now known as 
miami was incorporated 
on april 18 1923 the paper was bought by publisher james m 
cox the exgovernor of ohio and an unsuccessful presidential 
candidate in 1920

missions for reckless hikers in new hampshires white mountains 
the state has brought its first criminal charge against a hiker who 
had to be rescued after getting drunk on a mountaintop 
jeffrey morgan 30 of atlanta was charged thursday with 
reckless conduct after rescuers were rousted in the middle of the 
night to help him off snowy mount moriah outside gorham he pleaded 
guilty in gorham district court and was fined 500 half of which 
was suspended 
the executive director donald normandeau made the decision 
to get tough with this business its gone too far so we 
charged him maj henry mock head of fish and game department 
law enforcement said friday 
we did it to make a statement and the statement is that we 
are no longer going to tolerate this kind of activity on the part 
of the hikers mock said whenever we see something that is 
this flagrant we will be considering these charges 
morgan mock said had been hiking the appalachian trail for six 
months and three days he hiked from georgia to maryland then took 
a bus to maine where he turned around and began hiking south 
authorities said 
when he hit the north country he did not like cold weather 
so he went into gorham bought himself a fifth of vodka and decided 
that would help him finish the trail mock said 
he said morgan was found violently ill at the top of mount 
moriah at 8 pm wednesday by two hikers from massachusetts one of 
whom was a doctor 
the doctor could see that he was also extremely hypothermic 
and was not going to make it unless something was done for him 
mock said 
he said the two pulled morgan from the summit to some shelter 
put him in his sleeping bag and wrapped him in a space blanket 
before heading down the mountain for help 
at 2 am they reached a farmhouse and called authorities 
a fish and game officer and volunteer headed up the mountain at 
3 am and reached morgan at about daylight mock said meanwhile 
a sizeable crew was mobilized to help carry morgan down based on 
the report from the doctor 
when the two rescuers reached morgan he had gotten out of the 
sleeping bag and was stumbling down a trail with no memory of how 
he had gotten where he was mock said 
the reckless conduct charge a misdemeanor can be applied in 
cases in which a person knows his actions will place the lives or 
safety of others in jeopardy mock said it specifically mentions 
alcohol use 
mock said other recent rescues also could have been considered 
for charges and that more will be brought in the future 
we have to make that fineline difference between 
foolhardiness stupidity lack of good judgment and recklessness 
and thats not always easy to do he said in this case it

a spokesman for the nations meat industry on 
friday pledged support of a new agriculture department rule that 
will require identification and recordkeeping on all swine sold 
across state lines 
the new regulation will go into effect on nov 14 as a 
longsought method of tracing the source of diseased hogs or those 
with harmful drug or chemical residues 
we intend to cooperate very closely with the department to 
work out all the technicalities of this program so that it will be 
as effective and efficient as possible said manly molpus 
president of the american meat institute we are delighted usda 
has made this a mandatory requirement 
his comments followed usdas final rulemaking procedure that 
will put the new regulation into force within 30 days the proposed 
rule was announced last feb 3 
the regulation will require each hog to be identified 
individually which can include eartags tatoos and backtags 
record on each animal must be kept for two years and must include 
the serial number of other approved identification appearing on the 
swine 
every person who handles swine is responsible for the 
identification as soon as it moves into interstate commerce said 
assistant secretary kenneth a gilles if the identification is 
already on the hog the next person in the chain is only required 
to make and keep a record of it 
pressure for swine identification came from congress and the 
national research council of the national academy of sciences 
besides the american meat institute support also came from a 
number of other trade and professional associations such as the 
livestock conservation institute and the national pork producers 
council

a driver who caused a crash that killed 
three members of a wedding party last year was sentenced to prison 
friday and the judge complained that he could not make the 
sentence longer than seven years 
in setting the sentence of two and onethird to seven years the 
maximum permitted by law judge richard delin said defendant 
vincent laezza had made his automobile a lethal weapon in a 
blatant disregard for human life 
laezza 21 was convicted of three counts of criminally 
negligent homicide and one count of assault in a jury trial last 
month but acquitted on the more serious counts of manslaughter 
delin said he found it ludicrous that he could give the 
defendant no more than up to seven years for the deaths of three 
people 
he used a public highway of our county as a racetrack delin 
said noting that witnesses said laezza was drag racing at speeds 
of up to 100 mph at the time of the collision he said laezza had 
shown no remorse 
i feel terrible for what happened a sobbing laezza said in 
pleading for leniency speaking in a barely audible voice he 
added it is something i have to live with for the rest of my 
life 
police said laezza was speeding down lido boulevard when his car 
smacked into a stretch limousine carrying the wedding party on 
april 3 1987 
killed instantly was the groom peter phillips 27 of north 
massapequa and his brother and best man john 29 of islip the 
bride carol zagorski phillips 24 died of her injuries 18 days 
later without ever knowing of her new husbands death 
the brides sister and maid of honor debra zagorski was

two american indians charged in the takeover 
of a newspaper to protest alleged corruption and the treatment of 
minorities in their rural county were found innocent friday of all 
charges against them 
eddie hatcher 31 was acquitted of federal hostagetaking and 
weapons charges in connection with feb 1 incident in which up to 
20 people were held hostage for 10 hours at the robesonian 
newspaper in lumberton in southeastern north carolina no one was 
hurt in the takeover 
timothy jacobs 20 was acquitted of weapons charges us 
district judge terrence boyle had dismissed the hostagetaking 
count against him earlier this week 
the jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict a 
verdict that people will remember hatcher said as he left the 
courthouse for the first time in two weeks without wearing 
shackles i dont think people realize yet how important this 
verdict is 
im just glad that timothy and eddie did something to draw 
attention to the conditions in our county said eleanor jacobs 
jacobs mother i hate they used guns but they did draw 
attention to something that was needed the jury had compassion 
they understood things 
robesonian editor bob horne who was one of the hostages said 
he had no immediate comment on the verdict 
the jury deliberated for less than a day before acquitting the 
two tuscarora indians of making and possessing illegal firearms 
conspiring to make those weapons and conveying false information 
about explosives hatcher also was acquitted of hostagetaking 
in his closing statement thursday hatcher argued that his life 
and that of jacobs were in jeopardy because of information they had 
linking law enforcement officers to drug trafficking in the county 
assistant us attorney john bruce talked about the 
constitution this morning and how it allows peaceful protest he 
said 
when those sworn to uphold the constitution wont what do you 
do he asked in a closing statement partially written by his 
attorney william kunstler 
kunstler could not appear at the trial because he was handling a 
case in new york 
bruce argued that even if the defenses allegations of 
corruption among officials in robeson county were true their 
actions at the robesonian were not justified 
if everything in this whole scenario they have spun out is 
true it still does not justify their putting innocent people in 
terror of their lives bruce said 
what can start out as just a kernel can get some people 
agitated upset and carried away into doing something criminal 
he said and maybe they just become a little too convinced of 
their own importance i suggest to you thats what happened here 
bruce also argued that allegations of racial injustice were 
irrelevant to the case 
boyle ruled that defense attorneys could not argue that the 
hostagetaking was justified because hatcher and jacobs feared for 
their lives and believed they had no alternative instead defense 
attorneys argued that hatcher and jacobs did not have criminal 
intentions in the takeover 
defense lawyer lewis pitts said taking hostages was a drastic 
action he was not trying to minimize but that the intentions of 
hatcher and jacobs were critical to the case 
if you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals at 
the newspaper what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mind 
or evil intent he said

the marine corps has returned to operation its 
fleet of ch53e super stallion helicopters after a onetime 
inspection prompted by the discovery of a defective nut officials 
said friday 
the heavylift transport copters almost all of which are based 
inside the united states were temporarily grounded ast sunday 
after mechanics at a training squadron at the tustin calif 
marine corps air station found a scratch on a main transmission 
gearbox nut 
the 1inch nut subsequently judged to be defective was one of 
12 used to secure the main transmission inside the ch53e allowing 
it to deliver power from the engines to the copters rotor blade 
lt col fred peck a marine spokesman in washington said all 
93 of the super stallions were returned to service after the 
emergency inspections failed to turn up any other defective nuts 
the naval air systems command has concluded however that some 
of the transmission barrel nut assemblies purchased by the 
defense logistics agency for the super stallions are defective and 
they are being removed from the inventory peck added 
william armstrong a spokesman for the naval air systems 
command declined immediate comment on the matter or to say what 
company had manufactured the nut assemblies 
the temporary grounding was the third for the super stallions in 
the past two years prompted by a transmission problem 
the fleet was grounded in february 1987 because of a defective 
gear that forced an emergency landing the following july another 
grounding was ordered because of three bearing failures one of 
which resulted in an emergency landing 
in a related development local officials at the tustin base 
said thursday that a super stallion had been damaged on sept 27 
when one of its three engines caught fire while taxiing base 
firefighters extinguished the flames and none of the four marines 
on board was injured

president mikhail s gorbachev has signaled that 
the new hope for producing more food is in the hands of farmers 
not the collective system built with the blood of millions of 
soviets 
in a major speech published friday on the front pages of soviet 
newspapers gorbachev didnt say outright that collectivization was 
a mistake and should be scrapped 
but his stress was no longer on the collectively run farms or on 
those owned and operated by the state they have been the backbone 
of soviet agriculture since josef stalins bloody drive in the late 
1920s to collectivize farms by forcing individual farmers into 
stateowned and run enterprises 
gorbachev wants a system in which families or small groups can 
lease land choose their own crops and keep most of the profits 
there have been experiments along these lines and he made clear he 
wanted the nations whole agrarian sector to move along that path 
he did not mention stalin in his speech which was delivered 
wednesday to farmers and communist party officials but praised 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin for recognizing the value of 
peasants and giving them more control over the land under the new 
economic policy in the early 1920s 
without blaming collectivization by name gorbachev said the 
agricultural system had torn the man from the land from the 
means of production he said people were driven away from farms 
and into the city in search of more consumer goods and better 
housing 
gorbachev the son of a southern russian peasant and the 
communist partys top agriculture official before being named 
general secretary in 1985 made clear however that there are no 
plans to do away with staterun farms 
through the lease contract we must open up the potential of 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes he said 
a persons desire to own land and resources to create his own 
family farm does not contradict socialism comrades such an owner 
will work on land which is public property he said 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
speech showed that in agricultural policy ideological restraints 
are giving way to pragmatism 
on the political level the diplomat said gorbachev is showing 
his finesse at calming conservatives who think his reforms are 
going too far in essence he is moving away from 
collectivization without saying he is doing this said the 
diplomat 
gorbachevs implicit criticism of collectivization has become 
more obvious in his recent speeches a year ago he acknowledged 
that excesses marred the transition from private farming to 
collectivization of agriculture but he added it was in the 
final analysis a transformation of great importance 
in march he said the possibilities of cooperative farms were a 
brilliant discovery of lenin that had been underused and even 
despised by subsequent rulers 
gorbachev increasingly impatient with the pace of reform made 
clear that he wants improvements and wants them by the spring 
harvest 
the speech appeared designed to address the increasingly open 
anger of citizens who complain that perestroika the plan to 
restructure soviet society has had little effect on the quality 
of their lives 
the uproar swelled up around the 57yearold soviet leader 
himself last month in the siberian city of krasnoyarsk when 
residents surrounded him and shouted that there was no meat in the 
stores and that fruit and vegetables were scarce 
gorbachev said in his speech that the agricultural reforms 
using new forms of management and new technology are designed to 
reduce losses from poor processing storage and transportation and 
to improve incentives for farmers to produce more and better crops 
and livestock solving the infrastructure problems alone could 
add 25 percent to 40 percent to the amount of food that reaches 
peoples tables gorbachev said 
so far he admitted the billions of rubles the state has been 
pouring into state and collective farms have not solved chronic 
food shortages 
wednesdays meeting raised eyebrows not only for its talk of 
radical changes in soviet agriculture but also by the absence of 
some key officials 
among those who would have been expected to attend but didnt 
were yegor ligachev who was put in charge of a new party 
commission on agriculture sept 30 and the head of the state 
agency overseeing agriculture vsevolod murakhovsky 
no official explanation was given for murakhovskys absence but 
government spokesmen said ligachev gorbachevs main conservative 
rival was on vacation 
the western diplomat said it was too early to tell whether 
ligachevs absence meant his input into agricultural reform would 
be minimal and that he was losing power at gorbachevs expense in 
general

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle predicted friday that he will now become a background 
issue in the campaign and he said democrat michael dukakis is the 
real political liability 
quayle who polls have suggested has been a drag on george 
bushs republican campaign commented during his first news 
conference since sept 15 
he criticized dukakis for failing to say anything nice about 
bush after each candidate was asked during the debate to praise the 
other 
george bush was very complimentary to michael dukakis on a 
personal basis quayle said dukakis he said did lack the 
common courtesy to say something nice 
quayle held the news conference in fort smith ark before 
touring an electric plant and traveling to louisiana for a rally 
and fundraiser he then flew to albuquerque nm 
at a rousing rally at the university of southwestern louisiana 
quayle released a list of what he called dukakis debate 
failures 
he said dukakis dodged the issue of taxes failing to commit 
himself to opposing tax increases he also faulted dukakis for his 
shortsighted and obstinate opposition to the death penalty and 
for a shocking lack of knowledge on defense issues he said 
dukakis would appoint liberals to the supreme court 
in a series of interviews with fort smith media quayle was 
asked about polls indicating substantial percentages of likely 
voters view him negatively dukakis negative ratings in recent 
polls have rivaled or surpassed quayles 
governor dukakis negatives have gone up and ours have 
actually switched to the better quayle said he called dukakis a 
drag on his ticket and added the political liability happens 
to be governor dukakis 
quayle predicted a race that would go right down to the 
wire but he said he would become less of an issue 
obviously theres going to be continued interest in me and 
the reason for that is theres been so much interest in me up to 
now quayle said but it will be very much of a background 
issue because the american people are trying to make up their minds 
on the top of the ticket 
quayles news conference included no major stumbles during his 
last one a month earlier he called the holocaust an obscene 
period in our nations history and then added i didnt live in 
this century 
he was asked friday whether he would like to take another shot 
at giving his opinion of the holocaust the killing of millions of 
jews under adolf hitler 
i dont think its necessary to get in and have a history 
lesson on the holocaust he said but let me say this if we 
make the right decisions and we stay committed to peace and human 
rights and if we can work with our allies and if we have good 
intelligence hopefully we can avert anything like the holocaust 
hopefully we have a learned a lesson about a very tragic event 
in world history hopefully we will not repeat or allow things 
that were truly tragic to happen again

the daily le monde said that after thursday nights presidential 
debate vice president george bush retained his lead over gov 
michael dukakis 
already favored in presidential polls george bush seems to 
have had success in passing the last perilous obstacle on the road 
to the white house in the second and last televised duel of the 
campaign he managed at least to deprive his adversary of 
the victory that he dukakis badly needed 
the frontpage article added that dukakis failed to defeat bush 
or to improve his image to one of a man open and inspired 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the budapest evening journal esti hirlap said friday that the 
debate pushed bush toward victory 
bush argued in an amiably lighthearted manner and his 
downtoearth approach to the subjects is likely to have driven 
home his points among the voters onethird of whom are yet to 
make up their minds which way to vote 
michael dukakis noted for his seriousness made no small 
efforts to look winsome at this last facetoface occasion but his 
very concrete definitions of the nations cares and worries and 
the need for unpopular measures that he deemed unavoidable may 
have acted the opposite way in the bid to win voters 
as to the arms issue dukakis endorsed faster development of 
conventional weapons while bush accusing him wrongly of backing 
unilateral disarmament stressed the reagan administrations 
achievements in promoting world peace while upholding the peace 
from strength principle

the independent daily verdens gang said friday that dukakis had 
his last chance in the debate and misused it 
despite doing one of his best tv appearances ever he never 
managed to run over george bush it said dukakis entered his 
final 90minute tv round knowing that this final debate was his 
biggest chance to pick up the 14 percent he was behind in public 
opinion polls but regardless how earnest and sincere he was his 
opponent george bush was too good for him to succeed

george bush says he did not vote to cut social 
security costofliving adjustments and michael dukakis says he 
went on record at the national governors association against cuts 
in social security 
but both candidates shaded the truth in their final debate 
thursday night in los angeles 
let me simply say for the record i did not vote to cut 
colas bush said and i voted the same way that he did three 
months before in a national governors conference 
but bush did cast a tiebreaking senate vote on may 9 1985 for 
a senate budget freeze that included a oneyear delay in a social 
security costofliving increase 
dukakis for his part described a losing battle at the national 
governors association to exempt social security from a federal 
budget freeze that the governors including dukakis eventually 
endorsed 
the democrat never quite acknowledged that he voted for the 
final resolution in february 1985 backing a oneyear freeze 
including social security payments everybody knew that those of 
us who voted against the freezing of colas did so 
emphatically he said 
bushs tiebreaking vote allowed senate republicans to pass 
5049 a oneyear budget freeze that included social security 
colas but president reagan later withdrew his support and the 
freeze never took place 
at the governors meeting dukakis was in a 2617 majority who 
voted to exempt social security from their recommendation of a 
federal budget freeze but they lacked the twothirds majority 
needed to amend the freeze resolution the governors eventually 
approved 
bush promised i will not go in there and suggest changes in 
social security i learned that the hard way 
dukakis charged you did it in 1985 the administration tried 
to do it repeatedly in 81 82 and im sure youll try to do 
it again he said bush had no way to pay for new weapons and a 
cut in capital gains taxes unless you raid the social security 
trust fund

president reagan borrowed a phrase from vice 
president george bush on friday to hail the five discovery shuttle 
astronauts as americas heroes 
giving the men a hearty white house welcome the president 
appeared with the astronauts at an affectionate rose garden 
ceremony as many nasa employees and some of their family members 
looked on 
thank you for taking us into space and welcome home 
reagan said evoking a round of applause from the crowd of several 
hundred observers 
the president told the fivemember crew that he agreed with a 
statement made by the vice president during his debate thursday 
evening with democratic rival micheal dukakis 
the vice president was right last night you are americas 
heroes you are his heroes and mine what you have done for the 
program and the country will be long remembered reagan said 
you and the entire team that made the mission of the 
discovery a success deserve the praise of a grateful nation 
although reagan mentioned that the space program had had 
setbacks he did not specifically mention the tragic fate of 
the shuttle challenger 
the discovery flight which began on sept 29 was the first 
shuttle mission since the challenger blew up on liftoff killing 
all seven aboard 
reagan asserted that the discovery mission symbolized a return 
to space for the country and america intends to stay there 
we just want to say thanks again for this mission and for all 
that it has meant to this country reagan said 
the president also saluted the astronauts wives telling them 
they were just as brave as these gentlemen 
the shuttles commander frederick h hauck presented the 
president with a blue astronauts jacket complete with patches 
from the mission that had been taken into space aboard the shuttle 
reagan beamed as he held the shiny royal blue jacket aloft 
in contrast the five astronauts appeared a bit out of their 
element dressed in business suits and ties 
the crew had met with reagan at the johnson space center in 
houston late last month just days before their space mission 
began at that time the astronauts had pledged to bring the jacket 
and its patches back to the president at the white house 
this is a great team that we work with hauck told the 
president adding the team is only as good as its leader and as 
far as were concerned youre the captain of the team 
hauck and his crew pilot richard o covey and mission 
specialists john m lounge david c hilmers and george d nelson 
were completing a twoday capital tour on thursday they visited 
the house gallery where they were met by the applause of members 
on the floor

president reagan on friday signed into law a 
bill aimed at spurring the manufacture of vehicles that can run on 
fuels other than gasoline 
this bill is a landmark in the quest for alternative forms of 
energy reagan said the legislation has been billed by its 
supporters as providing a means of lowering us dependence on 
foreign oil cutting pollution and curbing the trade deficit 
the forms of energy encouraged by this bill are already in 
use the president said methanol for example is used in the 
indianapolis 500 and in other race cars because it simultaneously 
enhances performance and safety 
and cars that run on methanol have the potential to reduce 
emissions by an amazing 50 percent and improve efficiency reagan 
added 
the aim is to switch motorists from gasoline to methanol 
ethanol and natural gas by creating incentives for manufacturers to 
develop vehicles to run on these substances either alone or in at 
least a 5050 blend with gasoline 
each alternativefuel car produced and sold would earn a 
manufacturer large credits that would make it easier for the 
company to meet the governments minimum fuel economy requirements 
for its entire fleet 
a further incentive would be authorization for the department of 
energy to begin spending 18 million in october 1989 to buy and 
test alternative fuel cars trucks and buses 
advocates of the fuel switchover say the united states has 
abundant supplies of natural gas the coal used to produce methanol 
and the grain that is distilled and blended into gasoline to 
produce ethanol 
in the roosevelt room signing ceremony at the white house 
reagan said this legislation also opens up new markets for 
natural gas and coal our two most plentiful energy resources in 
this country 
he also said it takes advantage of existing government 
programs and mechanisms to assist alternative fuels and that 
its not intended to create massive new bureaucracies or new 
taxpayer subsidies 
i believe we will look back on this as the single most 
important act of the 100th congress rep bill alexander dark 
said when lawmakers concluded action on the bill

the number of illegal aliens apprehended on 
the southern us border has reached a sixyear low but the 
numbers of nonmexican aliens arrested increased over fiscal 1987 
immigration officials said friday 
the decline in apprehensions confirms the downward trend that 
began immediately after passage of the immigration reform and 
control act and shows that the law is working as it was intended 
said alan c nelson commissioner of the immigration and 
naturalization service 
apprehensions totaled more than 940000 in the fiscal year 
ending oct 1 while there were 112 million apprehensions in 
fiscal 1987 and a record 162 million in 1986 
at a news conference nelson acknowledged that temporary 
reassignment of some border control agents during the fiscal year 
may account for some of the decline he said other factors are the 
decreased number of illegal aliens in the united states because of 
mass legalizations under the 1986 immigration act and the fact that 
drought conditions contributed to less demand for farm laborers 
the number of nonmexican immigrants apprehended increased last 
fiscal year to 39000 from 37000 in 1987 other officials said 
with about a fourth of those each year from el salvador and the 
rest from more than 100 other countries 
nelson said the fact that the trend has not been the same for 
nonmexicans is probably a function of distance he said people 
who have to travel greater distances from other countries to the 
border are more likely not to be deterred by aggressive enforcement 
or changes in immigration laws 
nelson said the ins increased its border patrol forces to record 
numbers during the year with plans to have 1400 new agents on 
duty by next june bringing the total along the southern border to 
4300 investigation staff has increased 75 percent since last 
fiscal year he said 
this has resulted in apprehension of 50000 criminal aliens up 
from 33500 a year earlier nelson said 
these figures show we are making more effective use of our 
enforcement resources by concentrating them on the most serious 
problems of illegal immigration that is we go after the aliens 
who are causing the most harm to society he said 
border patrol seizures of narcotics along the southern border 
increased from 2751 cases to more than 3000 last year increasing 
in value by 100 million to 6811 million for the fiscal year 
nelson said 
he said the ins has received 265 million applications for 
temporary resident status under the immigration law including 
nearly twice as many as expected under the less restrictive program 
for special agricultural workers more than 890000 
nelson said 975 percent of regular applications and 92 percent 
of those under the agricultural program are approved farmworker 
applicants have to show only that they worked on a us farm for 90 
days during the previous year to get legal status 
officials say there are some cases of obvious fraud in the 
program including applicants who obviously are too well manicured 
to be farm workers and some who claim such things as having picked 
strawberries from trees 
of pending cases 168000 are suspected to be fraudulent 
applicants including 136000 for the agricultural program said 
nelson he said fewer than 51000 applications have been denied 
under the immigration act with 2844 involving fraud

even democrats acknowledged friday that 
michael dukakis race was made no easier by his final debate with 
george bush leaving the democrat with a little over three weeks to 
make up a lot of ground and to hope for a mistake by the vice 
president 
the first polls suggested a victory for bush while both sides 
pushed the view that their man had won 
but the next days judgment by leaders in both parties seemed to 
be that the debate was a lost opportunity for dukakis that he 
failed to recast the presidential race on his issues and did not 
appreciably warm his cool and detatched personal image 
i expected a very aggressive dukakis and i didnt find it 
said republican senate leader bob dole of kansas 
im not sure these debates really amount to much said 
senate majority leader robert byrd of west virginia in a remark 
that may have reflected democratic disappointment dukakis made no 
gains 
top dukakis aide john sasso acknowledged the vice president had 
the edge in instant polling taken after the two presidential 
nominees met in los angeles thursday night for their second and 
final debate he maintained however that dukakis performance was 
good enough 
we scored with undecided and swing voters last evening thats 
what we were looking for sasso said 
were down a little bit in the polls theres no question 
about that he added but its well within range 
an abc news survey called the vice president the winner by 49 
percent to 33 percent a los angeles times poll had it 47 to 26 
with the rest unsure 
with dukakis trailing at least slightly in most national polls 
and by larger amounts in electoral college handicapping the 
question was how the democrats could turn things around 
he has to get on the offensive and put george bush on the 
defensive said norman ornstein analyst at the conservative 
american enterprise institute and then hope bush makes a mistake 
he added 
nowhere was the debate watched more closely than in the big 
battleground states where bush and dukakis fates lie new york 
democratic chairman laurence kirwan said dukakis did everything 
he thought he could do and performed well but he acknowledged 
bush may be seen as winning the encounter 
bush may have exceeded expectations kirwan said a lot of 
people say he has difficulty in a lengthy format putting two 
sentences together that obviously was not a problem for him last 
night he came out quite well 
in cleveland former cayahoga county democratic chairman and 
county commissioner tim hagan said dukakis won the debate on issues 
but bush won on likability 
he said dukakis likely remains well short of the 60 percent 
support a democrat usually needs in cleveland if he is to carry the 
state 
sure its disappointing he said we have to pitch a 
perfect game between now and nov 8 
democratic consultant ann lewis said hopes for a breakthrough by 
either candidate werent realistic she said dukakis now must run 
a ground strategy pounding on a few economic themes and 
relying on organization to produce a high democratic turnout 
we really are where we were yesterday at this time she said 
bush campaign manager james baker iii saw a conflict in dukakis 
objectives going into the debate dukakis needed to appear more 
warm and likable since his dour demeanor was judged to have hurt 
him before but also had to be on the offensive as the races 
underdog 
its pretty hard to attack in a debate and at the same time 
appear more likable said baker so it was a very difficult 
situation for him i think 
some neutral political observers judged dukakiss performance 
and the outlook for his candidacy harshly 
id say the road to the election for dukakis is rougher today 
than it was yesterday said larry sabato university of virginia 
political analyst he simply wasnt near his best he missed 
so many chances to redefine himself to pull the heartstrings

us industrial production in september failed 
to rise for the first time in seven months the government said 
friday suggesting to economists that the overheated manufacturing 
sector is cooling a bit 
the federal reserve board said output at the nations facories 
mines and utilities was unchanged last month after increasing a 
slight 02 percent in august and an unusually large 12 percent in 
july 
the production index has gone 12 months without a decline but 
september was the first time since february that it did not rise 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm said the weakness in september was almost 
entirely due to cutbacks at electricity plants 
there was a 43 percent drop in utility production because 
people werent using their air conditioners as much he said 
utility output shrank to nearly the may level before the summer 
heat wave 
but even without the drop at utilities production expanded 
slowly last month it was up only 02 percent at manufacturing 
plants following a 01 percent rise in august mining output 
which includes oil and gas drilling was up 02 percent following a 
08 percent decrease 
manufacturing has been the star of the economy this year the 
lower value of the dollar has made american goods less expensive on 
overseas markets and fueled an export boom 
the boom was so vigorous that analysts this summer began 
worrying that factories wouldnt be able to keep up leading to 
shortages and price increases 
however wyss said the fear that the economy was overheating 
proved to be rather overheated 
michael k evans an economic consultant in washington said 
us export sales in 1989 will not be able to sustain the rapid 
growth of this year 
a survey released by dun amp bradstreet corp earlier this week 
showed that plant managers expectations for increased orders 
declined for the second quarter in a row 
manufacturers see their orders shriveling up and theyve 
decided hey its time to cut back evans said 
within the manufacturing sector production of durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last three or more years was up 
03 percent while nondurables were up 02 percent 
auto production jumped to 74 million units from 70 million in 
august 
business equipment particularly machinery purchased by 
manufacturers seeking to gear up for the export boom has been one 
of the strongest sectors of the economy production in september 
rose 04 percent to a level 10 percent higher than a year ago 
there was also strength in nonelectrical machinery and 
chemicals but steel production fell for the second consecutive 
month after rising sharply in july 
total output of factories mines and utilities in september left 
the feds index at 1383 percent of a 1977 base and 55 percent 
higher than a year ago

hundreds of northwest airlines passengers 
have been stricken with an illness that state health officials said 
friday may be linked to contaminated food served aboard at least 
four flights 
we have cases all over the country said state 
epidemiologist michael osterholm this morning we were dealing 
with a family as far away as germany 
the one common phrase being reported to investigators is 
people thinking they have never been so sick that they thought 
they were going to die osterholm said 
four reports were confirmed thursday as cases of the bacterial 
illness shingellosis and osterholm said he expects more than 100 
additional cases to be confirmed in the next several weeks 
the people who were confirmed with the illness were on stretches 
of a northwest flight that originated in minneapolisst paul and 
went to nashville detroit and seattle as well as on a minnesota 
vikings football team charter flight to miami osterholm said the 
flights were between sept 25 to oct 4 
we have no reason to believe it is happening now osterholm 
said 
the outbreak first came to light after 21 players and staff 
members of the football team became acutely ill two to five days 
after their game in miami oct 2 
all the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food 
prepared in marriott corps airline kitchen at the minneapolisst 
paul international airport the facility serves 100000 meals a 
week for the airline 
marriott has taken extraordinary measures to see its not 
happening now osterholm said 
alan munchaster vice president of corporate relations for 
northwest said preliminary tests on marriott employees who may 
have handled the food were negative additional tests were being 
conducted by marriott to pinpoint the source of the bacteria 
munchaster said 
theyre looking at cold food and the lettuce munchaster 
said those seem to be the culprits 
shigellosis is an intestinal infection that causes intense 
diarrhea and other symptoms that can last for five to seven days 
the illness spreads easily from person to person

a study of children in nine british towns suggests 
that blood pressure problems are rooted in childhood researchers 
reported friday 
but they also found a baffling variation in blood pressure 
levels in the different towns 
writing in the lancet the prestigious british medical weekly 
doctors from the royal free hospital school of medicine in london 
said they measured blood pressure on 4186 children aged 5 to 7 in 
southern england wales and scotland 
when the results were compared with earlier surveys of adults in 
the same towns the researchers reported it was found that the 
average blood pressure patterns of the children followed those of 
the grownups 
blood pressure has always been regarded as a problem of middle 
age and what were suggesting is that the roots of the problem 
could be in childhood or earlier dr peter whincup one of the 
researchers said in an interview 
but the variations among different towns was inexplicable i 
think weve unearthed a mystery said whincup 
the average systolic blood pressure sbp of children was lowest 
in guildford southern england between 96 and 97 and highest in 
carlisle northern england and merthyr tydfil wales where it was 
between 99 and 101 the study showed 
one hypothesis for variations in blood pressure levels is 
regional differences in diet and environment such patterns did not 
show up in the latest study however 
guildford in southern england showed an sbp average much lower 
than the other towns studied but maidstone and exeter which are 
also in southern england registered six units of sbp higher than 
guildford 
all three towns are affluent and have no recognizable 
differences of diet and environment to explain the disparity 
other studies have shown higher blood pressure among children in 
migrant families suggesting change of environment plays a part 
but these conditions did not apply in the british towns that were 
studied whincup said 
he stressed that the study did not suggest the children had 
blood pressure problems in all the towns the average sbps were 
well within normal limits for that age group whincup said

students clad in military fatigues 
created a traffic jam friday in this village of 3000 by stopping 
motorists at concrete block berlin walls to hand out 
getoutthevote pamphlets 
but feelings ran so high over the congested traffic and the 
check point charlie atmosphere that the vocational education 
students had to tear down the walls by late morning 
we dont want to harass anyone said herb locy the masonry 
teacher from the ashtabula county joint vocational school who 
organized the effort he said the walls were supposed to give 
residents a better feeling for what it would be like to live in a 
police state thus increasing interest in voting 
if theyre provoked as it is how would they feel if it was 
the real thing locy said he said that by the time the decision 
was made to dismantle the walls the students had handed out most 
of the 1000 pamphlets that encouraged residents to vote nov 8 
the walls were 4 feet 6 inches high and made of stacked 
concrete blocks one had red stars and the words stop ussr and 
check point charlie painted on it more than a dozen students 
wearing green fatigues borrowed from a national guard unit in 
youngstown manned the check points that simulated those in 
communist east berlin 
police officer dwayne patrick said police received at least 100 
complaints from drivers about the walls at three main intersections 
but it was approved by the village council so unless we get a 
bad accident theres really nothing we can do he said 
some complained because only one car at a time could pass 
through a narrow opening and other complaints were from people 
getting the wrong idea because of what was written on the walls

democrat lloyd bentsen said friday 
that debating george bush is like trying to eat jello with a 
fork but that he thought michael dukakis had managed the task 
well 
still he said polls suggesting dukakis lost thursday nights 
debate and indicating he is trailing in the presidential race mean 
we have a tough fight down to the end 
bentsen who watched the debate on television in his home state 
of texas flew to california friday to greet dukakis at a 
postdebate rally at the state capitol 
hes a real pressure player he stepped up and delivered for 
america bentsen told the sacramento crowd 
debating george bush is just like trying to eat jello with a 
fork he said it keeps slipping off sliding off and when you 
finally get a bite theres not much substance to it just a lot of 
sugar water and artificial ingredients 
bentsen told reporters aboard his campaign jet on the trip from 
texas that he thought dukakis did an excellent job in the 
debate i think he was warm he was friendly he was precise he 
spoke to the issues he gave answers to the questions 
he was feeling pretty good about it so was i said bentsen 
describing a postdebate conversation between the two democrats 
bentsen objected to a question from one reporter on what it 
meant to the campaign that dukakis failed to score a knockout punch 
against bush 
i never said he had to get a knockout punch that was you 
folks you were buying the republican line he said when 
youre three or four points behind what you want to do is speak to 
the issues and i think that those issues keep repeating them 
theyll sink in and well win it 
you know middleincome america that is who dukakis is 
talking to he said real concerns such as home ownership and 
college costs 
i think those things finally get across i think thats why 
were still in the running he said 
i dont think he dealt with issues that are going to have 
voters jumping up on their chairs he said but he dealt with 
the real concerns about their futures and i think that is a more 
lasting approach to the issues 
bentsen did have some criticism agreeing in part with comments 
by house speaker jim wright this week that dukakis needed to speak 
directly to voters and dump his tv ad package 
when it comes to the expenditure of funds and all more 
time on radio to discuss the issues so youre not 30second bites 
i believe would be more effective frankly he said 
the texas senator called the opening question of the debate 
when dukakis was asked what hed do if someone attacked and killed 
his wife a horrible question almost an outrageous question 
he declined to criticize dukakis for being unemotional in his 
response 
he is against capital punishment he thinks thats not a 
deterrent to crime he said im sure he would have done what 
he could to put that fellow in jail for a lifetime to rot 
asked if he would have responded the same way bentsen said 
im not going to try to second guess him

new jersey sen bill bradley lashed out friday 
at what he called an offensive television attack on democratic 
colleague frank lautenberg by peter dawkins the republican 
challenger to lautenbergs senate seat 
this makes me angry its offensive to me bradley said of 
the dawkins commerical depicting lautenberg as motivated by greed 
dawkins a retired army general and investment banker is seeking 
to deny lautenberg a second term 
the ad which ran on new york and philadelphia television this 
week ends frank lautenberg hell deny anything to get elected 
as long as he can make some money on the side 
bradley who is chairing lautenbergs reelection effort said 
that the ad goes beyond the line of propriety the news 
conference was held at democratic national headquarters 
the 30second commercial accuses lautenberg a multimillionaire 
of conflicts of interest between his office and his investments of 
greedily voting for a senate pay raise and of accepting campaign 
money from toxic polluters 
bradley said lautenberg former top officer of the worldwide 
automatic data processing corp took a gigantic pay cut in 
coming to the senate and has no motive to use his office for

both lautenberg and dawkins have been engaging in increasingly

a triumphant margaret thatcher wound up 
her conservative partys annual conference friday rejecting the 
notion of a politically unified western europe and pledging to 
support the next us president 
to thunderous applause and chants of 10 more years from the 
4500 delegates the prime minister also declared her conservatives 
will hold power into the 1990s and who knows beyond 
we are all too young to put our feet up i include 
myself said mrs thatcher who turned 63 thursday 
mrs thatcher came to power in 1979 has won three elections in 
a row and already is the longestserving leader in the western 
world 
on the subject of the european economic community mrs thatcher 
charged that advocates of closer political union wanted to use the 
12nation trade bloc as a vehicle for spreading socialism and 
sought to bring about a federal europe by stealth 
in remarks widely regarded as setting a new agenda to focus on 
social issues the prime minister also urged britons to maintain a 
generous society and exercise civic responsibility 
millions of britons have become richer through nearly a decade 
of mrs thatchers rightwing economic policies but unemployment 
at 8 percent is twice as high as in 1979 and critics charge 
britain has become a greedy materialistic and uncaring society 
at the end of the prime ministers 45minute address delegates 
waved union jacks and huge blue party flags while mrs thatcher 
her grip on the conservatives unchallenged stood with arms raised 
acknowledging the cheers 
as mrs thatcher left the hall in this south england resort to 
the strains of the favorite tory anthem land of hope and 
glory some delegates waved signs declaring bushthatcher 88 
and bushquayle 
mrs thatcher did not mention by name republican presidential 
candidate george bush and his running mate dan quayle or 
democratic contender michael dukakis 
of president reagan with whom she has developed a particularly 
close relationship through the 80s mrs thatcher said he has 
rebuilt the strength and confidence of the west not without a 
little help and inspired the democracies to go out and win the 
battle of ideas 
it is vital that britain and america should always stand 
together so the next president of the united states too will have 
the united kingdom as a staunch ally she added 
mrs thatchers blunt remarks on the eec followed a 
controversial speech last month in which she rejected moves for 
closer political or monetary union after 1992 when all trade 
barriers among member nations are to be dismantled 
we havent worked all these years to free britain from the 
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door 
of central control and bureacracy from brussels mrs thatcher 
said 
the chief bureaucrat at the eec headquarters in the belgian 
capital commisssioner jacques delors is a french socialist 
the remarks were mrs thatchers clearest rejection yet of what 
she sees as unrealistic talk of some form of political union in 
western europe 
on the irish republican army which blew up her hotel here in an 
assassination attempt during the 1984 party conference mrs 
thatcher said her government would never compromise with terrorists 
at home and abroad 
if they ira think they can weary us or frighten us they have 
made a terrible miscalculation she said of the guerrilla 
movement fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
as she headed back to london police dismantled the biggest 
security operation ever mounted around a british party convention 
the fourday gathering was the tories first in brighton since 1984 
mrs thatcher 16 months into her third term holds a fivepoint 
lead of over the opposition socialist labor party 
but she is sensitive to charges by labor that the well off have 
benefited from big tax cuts while the poorest have been hit by her 
rein on state spending

a university academic senate here 
spent 90 minutes wrangling over a decision to expel stray cats from 
the campus 
when some professors groused that the issue was not lofty enough 
for the senates attention the cat fight began in earnest thursday 
at california state university 
i think this is not frivolous i think it is paramount 
bristled english professor gerald locklin but not because of the 
cats i am not a cat lover cats hate me i add vodka to their 
water dishes and they still hate me i am not an animal rights 
advocate i love bullfights 
in the past few years weve had a new era of collegiality 
here the mutual respect has been glorious but now i begin to hear 
contempt and this takeitorleaveit attitude 
the expulsion decision by the campus animal welfare board was 
undemocratic and could result in a rat infestation said kathy 
billing a thesis reviewer 
our contention is the board made a resolution which it had no 
right to make she said 
university vice president john beljan was unbending and the 
stray cats must be gone by nov 28 
the board is required by law to set protocol for all animals on 
campus including pets beljan said

the pentagon still doesnt talk officially 
about its stealth aircraft but defense secretary frank c carlucci 
is not above discussing some of the men who fly the planes 
carlucci appearing in beverly hills calif on friday to 
deliver a speech before the society of experimental test pilots 
identified by name two pilots who flew in the earliest days of 
stealth aircraft development 
the secretary lauded men like bill park and ken dyson as 
unsung heroes and the backbone of our nations defenses 
although for now your achievements must remain private the 
results can be seen in the successes america is realizing 
throughout the world carlucci declared the time will come 
when history will fully record your accomplishments 
a copy of carluccis speech was released in washington 
norman kenneth dyson is the chief test pilot for the rockwell 
international corp and william m park is director of flight 
operations for advanced development projects at the lockheed corp 
although dyson was described in a recent book as a test pilot 
involved in flying experimental stealth aircraft the pentagon and 
air force never have acknowledged the work of either man on such 
programs 
rockwell was the prime contractor on the b1b bomber an air 
force plane that incorporates some stealth or radarevading 
design features but it was not clear whether carlucci was 
referring to work by dyson while employed by rockwell 
mike matthews a rockwell spokesman said friday that dyson did 
not join the company until 1983 he was unable to say where dyson 
had worked previously 
lockheed meantime developed and produced a stealth fighter for 
the air force starting in the late 1970s and extending into the 
1980s defense sources have said 
jim ragsdale a lockheed spokesman said friday he was not at 
liberty to discuss the work of park that prompted the mention by 
secretary carlucci 
carlucci who recently scuttled a plan to unveil lockheeds 
stealth fighter before the presidential election said friday the 
united states must not falter in its commitment to developing 
stateoftheart weapons systems 
our latest generation of aircraft with their stealth 
technology represent the pinnacle of american scientific 
leadership not since the manhattan project to develop an atomic 
bomb have we seen a program cloaked in such secrecy and a 
technology with such enormous potential to guarantee the security 
of our nation 
however he continued we must not forget that the success 
of weapon development programs like these requires the hard work 
sacrifice and dedication of many individuals men like bill park 
and ken dyson who flew in the earliest days of stealth aircraft 
development

the government on friday prepared to 
lift a monthlong state of emergency imposed after hurricane gilbert 
ravaged jamaica but a nighttime curfew to prevent looting was to 
remain in force 
prime minister edward seaga said in a nationwide radio address 
thursday that the state of emergency covering four eastern 
parishes including the capital of kingston was no longer 
necessary and would be lifted at midnight friday 
but he said the nightly curfew would remain in effect until 
electricity is sufficiently restored 
this is necessary because many homes and places of businesses 
are damaged and still insecure seaga said 
the government ordered the state of emergency on sept 15 three 
days after the hurricane struck the caribbean island with 145 mph 
winds killing 45 people and causing damage estimated at between 
800 million and 1 billion 
under the emergency order police were empowered to force 
businesses providing essential services such as gasoline stations 
to open if they could the government was allowed to requisition 
trucks and heavy equipment for distributing supplies and cleanup 
work 
the order included a curfew because of looting of warehouses and 
stores in the first days after the hurricane seaga said the curfew 
sharply reduced the looting 
the emergency order covered the parishes of kingston st 
andrew st catherine and st thomas an area housing about half 
of jamaicas population of 23 million

both george bush and michael dukakis are 
committed to openness in government and support the freedom of 
information act the candidates said in answer to questions put by 
the american society of newspaper editors 
the editors association released on friday the presidential 
candidates answers to a series of questions regarding the first 
amendment openness of their administration attitudes toward press 
conferences and other press issues 
in the answers dukakis pledged opposition to the use of 
mandatory lie detector tests to track down the source of government 
leaks to the press 
bush said access to the president is absolutely vital for a 
press secretary and that he and his spokesman should have a 
close personal working relationship 
both candidates were given written questions in early august 
and they responded in writing in september and october 
both were asked their views regarding the conduct of government 
business in the open 
bush responded within the limits of national security 
government should be open to scrutiny by the media and the public 
the information process from a news conference to the freedom 
of information act is an appropriate and integral part of ensuring 
that accountability 
dukakis responded a dukakis administration would fully comply 
with the freedom of information act the fundamental premise of 
this statute is that american citizens have the right to know about 
he activities of their own government the current administration 
claims that complying with the foia is too time consuming too 
expensive and too bothersome these are excuses for government 
secrecy and they could serve as a cloak for incompetence 
mismanagement illegality or corruption 
both were asked if they would hold regular frequent news 
conferences and how often they would be held 
bush said he would hold a combination of press conferences 
interviews and news conferences with regional media by satellite 
he declined to say how many 
dukakis said that as governor of massachusetts i have been 
accessible to statehouse reporters several times a week as 
president i would hope to continue this pattern 
each was asked if they would continue the practice of arranging 
for press coverage by a small pool if necessary to go into 
military operations with us forces 
dukakis said he would require the secretary of defense and the 
joint chiefs of staff to develop policies which ensure that members 
of the press are able to provide coverage of military operations 
bush stopped short of such a pledge he said the public has a 
right to know details of military operations in an appropriate 
time frame and in a way that does not risk national security but 
the safety of the troops and success of the mission must be 
paramount and i will risk neither 
both were asked if they would use lie detectors to track down 
the source of leaks 
bush left open their use responding that his administration 
will be open but that doesnt mean every staff member will be 
authorized to serve as an administration spokesman or interpreter 
of events and policies 
dukakis said i am strongly opposed to mandatory lie detector 
tests to determine the source of leaks to the press 
dukakis denounced efforts to amend the freedom of information 
act by the reagan administration as excuses for government 
secrecy 
bush said disagreements over the scope of the act will be up to 
the courts 
dukakis said he opposed the use of press credentials as cover 
for covert operations by intelligence agencies bush asked about 
the use of credentials did not state a view but said the cia and 
other agencies must obey the law 
the full questions and answers are published in the

a federal appeals court friday upheld the 
dismissal of a lawsuit by americans living in nicaragua to stop 
us aid to the contras on the ground their lives and property are 
endangered by rebel attacks 
but the decision appeared to leave open the possibility that 
courts could entertain welldocumented claims by americans living 
abroad that their lives were endangered by foreign policy 
initiatives of congress and the president 
the threejudge panel said a federal district judge should not 
have refused to examine claims of injury and property damage on the 
ground that foreign policy issues cannot be adjudicated in courts 
instead the us circuit court of appeals here dismissed the 
claims on the basis there was no proof that the government was 
aware the contras were targeting american citizens in nicaragua for 
harassment or attacks 
there must be a much stronger allegation of deliberate 
targeting of americans by the contras and of congressional 
awareness of that targeting before the possibility of due process 
violation would arise the court said in an opinion by judge 
abner mikva 
the decision was made on a 1986 lawsuit by the committee of 
united states citizens living in nicaragua to stop military aid to 
the contras on the ground that it violated international law and 
the due process rights of liberty and property 
the appeals court said us district judge charles r richey had 
improperly invoked the political doctrine to dismiss claims on 
the ground they raised foreign policy issues that courts cannot 
address 
richey may have applied the doctrine correctly to claims that 
us aid to the contras violated a finding of the international 
court of justice 
but richey erred the court said when he dismissed the 
dueprocess claims on the same basis the court said 
given the care with which the political question doctrine 
should be applied and given the variety of claims encompassed by 
the present case we find the trial courts blanket invocation of 
the political question doctrine to be inappropriate the court 
said in the opinion joined by judges spottswood robinson iii and 
myron l gordon

morocco and the polisario independence 
movement in the western sahara remain at odds over most major 
issues despite having agreed in principle on a regional peace plan 
a polisario official said friday 
the official bachir m sayed said polisario and morocco so far 
have agreed only on the wording of a referendum on the future of 
western sahara an arid northwest africa coastal territory and on 
how voter eligibility will be decided 
outstanding issues in dispute include the presence of 185000 
moroccan troops in the territory the moroccan administration the 
tens of thousands of moroccan settlers who have moved into western 
sahara and the key issue of direct negotiations still opposed by 
morocco sayed told reporters 
morocco still refuses to shake our hand for peace he said 
it is proof of their lack of political will 
a moroccan official speaking on condition anonymity said 
they want to renegotiate everything but we say we did come up 
with a peace plan that was agreed to by both parties 
we are not going to preempt the population by giving anybody 
legitimacy the moroccan official added the people of western 
sahara will decide who shall lead them and whether these people 
polisario will lead them 
on sept 20 un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told 
the security council that morocco and polisario had agreed to 
proposals including the framework for a ceasefire in the nearly 
13yearold guerrilla war and a referendum on whether the territory 
will become independent or be affiliated with morocco 
when the spanish colonial administration withdrew from their 
former possession in 1975 moroccan troops occupied the western 
sahara and the marxistled polisario began the fight for 
independence 
more than 10000 people have died in the war which has cost 
morocco up to 2 million a day to fight 
the phosphaterich desert territory covers about 110000 square 
miles and its population at the last spanish census in 1974 was 
only 76000 
polisario and morocco have agreed on that census as the basis 
for voter eligibility in the upcoming referendum said sayed 
the united nations plans to send about 2000 peacekeeping troops 
to the western sahara to monitor the referendum

boleslavs maikovskis an 83yearold who was 
awaiting deportation to the soviet union on charges that he 
committed nazi atrocities in his native latvia has secretly left 
the country and is believed to be in west germany government 
sources said friday 
maikovskis had been living in mineola ny since 1951 and was 
sentenced to death in absentia by the soviet union in 1965 he had 
been awaiting deportation since 1986 when the supreme court turned 
down his appeal jewish groups in new york had recently been 
calling action on maikovskis case long overdue 
the order of deportation has been accomplished neal sher 
director of the justice departments office of special 
investigations said friday 
osi had had lost track of maikovskis several months ago sher 
said but we just found out a day or so ago that he had left 
the country sher declined to say how osi learned this or where 
maikovskis might have gone 
but a government source speaking on condition that he not be 
identified said maikovskis was in west germany 
we have no way of knowing how he got there the source said 
maikovskis had no passport or other travel documents 
maikovskis leaving came to light friday because the 
antidefamation league issued a press release calling on attorney 
general dick thornburgh for an immediate investigation into 
maikovskis whereabouts and prompt action to bring him to justice 
the whole thing is a little bit strange adl national 
director abraham foxman said from new york we are baffled why 
the secrecy around this issue 
foxman said the adl confirmed thursday that maikovskis was 
missing from his mineola home and called the justice department to 
report it 
they said in confidence they know that hes missing and they 
know where he is foxman said so we said why dont you tell 
the american people they said they cant do that 
sher suggested that the adl deal with the german authorities 
his being brought to justice is out of our hands he said 
maikovskis had been a chief of a nazicreated police force in 
latvia during world war ii he is accused of having ordered the 
mass arrest of residents in the latvian village of audrini and then 
burning the town the 200 villagers were later killed by the nazis 
deportation proceedings against maikovskis began in the united 
states in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals 
maikovskis had designated switzerland as the country to which he 
wanted to be deported but that country refused him and he faced 
deportation to the soviet union 
in fact osi filed papers on oct 7 redesignating the soviet 
union maikovskis deportation destination sher said but 
maikovskis was apparently already gone 
he saw the handwriting on the wall sher said pointing to 
the case of karl linnas who was accused of nazi collaboration and 
was deported last year to the soviet union linnas also of long 
island died before he could be tried

the environmental protection agency has 
decided not to make a decision for now on a petition asking it to 
determine that us pollution forms acid rain hurting canada the 
agency said friday 
the petition was filed in april by the six new england states 
new york new jersey minnesota and four environmental groups in 
addition the canadian province of ontario filed a separate 
petition 
don clay epas acting assistant administrator for air 
pollution wrote the states and environmental groups saying it 
would be premature to rule on your petition at this time the 
agency announced 
a similar letter was sent to ontario 
in the last days of the carter administration in 1981 epa 
administrator douglas costle wrote secretary of state ed muskie 
that sulfur dioxide emissions originating in the united states were 
endangering canada 
these emissions help form acid rain which environmentalists say 
is killing aquatic life in lakes in sensitive watersheds of the 
northeast the upper midwest and in eastern canada 
the reagan administration did nothing about the letter though 
the states environmental groups and canada argued that it 
triggered an obligation under the clean air act for epa to force 
states to rewrite their air pollution control plans to reduce the 
emissions harming canada 
a federal appeals court ruled against the states holding that 
costles letter was not a formal enough finding of harm to canada 
to trigger a requirement forcing states to act such a finding must 
be arrived at through regulations requiring notice to all parties 
involved and a chance to comment and the states could request such 
a proceeding the court said 
some of the states in july lost a separate but related suit 
claiming that sulfur dioxide originating in power plant and 
industrial smokestacks of the midwest made it impossible for them 
to meet federal clean air standards in their own territories 
i do not believe that epa presently has sufficient information 
to undertake the regulatory program required if the petition were 
granted including the endangerment finding requested in your 
petition clay wrote 
clay said his letter does not necessarily reflect the position 
of the administrator but i cannot recommend that the 
administrator take the discretionary action of making the 
findings 
in new york city david wooley assistant state attorney 
general said clays assertion of insufficient information was 
pure rubbish 
wooley said the letter appears to be formal enough to be the 
basis of another lawsuit and thats what im going to recommend 
to the nine states wooley said

the publishers of spycatcher said friday they 
will not print the book in britain despite a court ruling allowing 
british newspapers publish extracts instead copies will be 
imported from australia 
prime minister margaret thatchers government fought a long 
legal battle to ban the book by former intelligence agent peter 
wright claiming he had violated his oath of secrecy 
william heinemann ltd the books publishers said british 
booksellers have ordered more than 70000 copies of spycatcher 
printed by its sister company in australia last june mrs 
thatchers conservative party government lost its court bid in 
australia to ban the book there wright 73 now lives in australia 
if the book were printed in britain the government might take 
court action to seize the profits the company said 
it would be quixotic of us to rush out and incur another 
injunction said helen fraser spokeswoman for william heinemann 
ltd the government has shown every sign of never being weary of 
legal action 
tim godfray director of the booksellers association said 
friday after consulting lawyers we have been advised that 
booksellers can sell any edition of spycatcher provided it was 
originally purchased or invoiced abroad and imported by them 
londons daily telegraph said friday the government was 
considering new moves in its threeyear struggle to suppress 
wrights book it said government lawyers think the copyright for 
the book may rest with the government because of wrights 
descriptions of the mi5 counterintelligence agency 
on thursday the law lords the nations highest court lifted 
orders that had barred three london newspapers the guardian the 
observer and the sunday times from publishing extracts from 
spycatcher 
british newspapers called the ruling a triumph for freedom of 
the press but the government claimed a moral victory because the 
five judges also said wright violated the secrecy oath he took as 
an intelligence officer 
miss fraser said william heinemann originally intended to print 
200000 copies of the book in britain but now she said 
distributors in the netherlands and west germany were sending 
directly to british booksellers 33000 paperback copies of 
spycatcher printed in australia and have taken orders for at 
least 40000 more copies 
no bookshop is now in contempt of court because there are no 
court proceedings pending miss fraser said the whole thing is 
finished 
she added william heinemann ltd of britain will play no part in 
the importation or distribution of the book in britain 
to take action against the imported copies the government 
would have to go against heinemann australia and that is a 
jurisdiction where they have lost and lost and lost she said

a confident george bush launched his stretch drive for the white 
house on friday on the wings of a highly acclaimed debate 
performance democrat michael dukakis vigorously attacked his rival 
but conceded the road ahead of us is going to be tough 
bush campaigned in california beneath a large helium balloon 
reading say goodnight mike party leaders radiated optimism 
about his chances for victory while aides warned against 
overconfidence in the final three weeks of the race 
dukakis campaigning with running mate lloyd bentsen ripped 
into bush with a vigor unseen in his debatenight performance he 
cited bushs record on the environment drugs taxes and a variety 
of other issues and said think of where well be four years from 
now if we try to get by on mr bushs diet of old chestnuts new 
baloney and the same old voodoo stew 
a presidential preference poll by the los angeles times 
immediately following the debate found bush leading dukakis 52 
percent to 42 percent 
a cbs news survey echoed two earlier surveys thursday night that 
found bush had beaten dukakis in the debate the cbs survey found 
bush the victor 4825 and found he was supported for the 
presidency by a margin of 5443 
a larger sample was examined than just the debate viewers and 
of those who did not watch the debate there was no change in their 
support cbs said the last cbs poll found the republican ticket 
leading 50 percent to 46 percent 
said senate republican leader bob dole once the vice 
presidents harshest primary campaign critic it seems to me 
george bush is going to win this election and hes going to win it 
by a big margin particularly in the electoral college 
sen phil gramm rtexas told a television interviewer on nbc 
if i were working for michael dukakis id be sending out resumes 
this morning 
sen dan quayle the man who would be vice president also 
touted bushs performance and took a shot at dukakis he said the 
democrat lacked the common courtesy to say something nice about 
bush when given an invitation to do so by a debate questioner 
for his part bentsen said he thought dukakis had done well in 
the debate then added the race would be a tough fight down to 
the end 
bush took the morning off after his debatenight labors then 
sought votes in california i believe that i moved my campaign 
forward by what happened last night he said but he told 
reporters theres no overconfidence at all i can remember how 
these polls can change 
campaign manager lee atwater said much the same thing adding 
these big states are all still very close 
dukakis was up early for a rare joint appearance with former 
primary opponent jesse jackson 
he seemed subdued but later in the day with running mate 
bentsen at his side dukakis attacked bush as a candidate of 
complacency he also replied in personal terms to the vice 
presidents campaignlong criticism of dukakis record on crime 
now i didnt learn about crime as mr bush did from a clint 
eastwood movie i learned about it when my father a doctor 77 
years old was gagged beaten and robbed by a thief looking for 
drugs in his office i learned about it when my brother was struck 
down in the prime of life by a hitandrun driver 
confidant john sasso said the massachusetts governor scored 
with the undecided and swing voters last evening in the second 
and final presidential debate of the campaign thats what we 
were looking for 
sasso conceded that the democrat trail in the polls but he 
said its well within range and announced new television 
advertisements featuring the candidate talking in his shirtsleeves 
about campaign concerns 
in one ad dukakis says that as a nation america is getting out 
of shape instead of doing the right thing we began doing the 
easy thing and now were in danger of falling behind im not 
going to let that happen 
there was little to argue with dukakis own postmortem that the 
final 25 days would be tough for him and the democrats 
he went into the debate needing a breakthrough to transform the 
race in the final three weeks 
but republicans were swift to claim victory after a clash in 
which bush repeatedly pinned the liberal label on dukakis citing 
stances on crime national defense and arms control as evidence 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii said bush clearly 
won the debate 
he said that dukakis faced a seemingly impossible task to 
appear more likable to the voters and at the same time attack bush 
so it was a very difficult situation for him i think and it 
enabled the vice president pretty much to keep him on the 
defensive for most of the evening 
while both campaigns awaited polling information that could show 
how the debate influenced the race the available results pointed 
to an advantage for bush 
an abc news survey called the vice president the debate winner 
by 49 percent to 33 percent and the los angeles times poll had it 
47 to 26 with the rest unsure an associated press panel of debate 
judges also rated bush the winner reversing the judgment from the 
first debate sept 25 when dukakis was perceived the victor

a top aide to massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis was dragged from a nuclear regulatory commission meeting 
friday after he tried to speak out as commission officials 
discussed a reactor in his state 
peter agnes the governors chief aide on atomic power issues 
stood up as nrc staff members told the commission the pilgrim plant 
in plymouth mass was ready to open after a 2year shutdown even 
though it lacks an approved emergency evacuation plan 
agnes an assistant massachusetts public safety commissioner who 
has been working to help create acceptable evacuation plans for 
nearby towns immediately was approached by several nrc security 
guards 
he was pulled from his row in the audience and dragged from the 
hearing room as he yelled that he was tired of hearing 
halftruths he was not arrested but was barred from the 
rockville md building 
if thats the way they treat people public safety officials 
then thats a commentary on the fairness on this process agnes 
said after the hearing 
my concern was that we were reaching a decision point and that 
the commissioners ought to know that at least one public safety 
official from the commonwealth took exception with what they 
said he said 
dukakis and other state officials have urged the nrc to keep the 
670megawatt reactor shut down until an acceptable emergency 
evacuation plan is in place and tested 
but nrc officials said the management and equipment problems 
that triggered the shutdown on april 12 1986 have been resolved 
they added that evacuation planning while not completed is 
greatly improved and should not halt the plants reopening 
the commission made no immediate ruling nrc chairman lando w 
zech jr said the commission needed time to review testimony 
presented earlier in the day 
zech said later he did not know agnes was a dukakis 
administration official an nrc spokesman said the chairman had 
drafted a letter expressing his regrets about the unfortunate 
incident

opposition parties appealed friday for 
talks with the military junta on legal changes that would pave the 
way for a transition to full democracy one junta member said he 
welcomed some negotiation 
the 16party opposition coalition in its sixpage proposal 
for a national consensus also vowed to remain united and to 
present a single presidential candidate in next years elections 
no opposition candidate has been agreed upon but most 
speculation has centered on christian democratic party president 
patricio aylwin who read the proposal at a news conference 
the document was critical of military president augusto pinochet 
for taking a hard line since his resounding defeat in an oct 5 
plebiscite on whether to extend his rule to 1997 
gen pinochet has insisted there will be no bargaining with the 
opposition and that the constitution will be strictly followed 
the opposition document said instead of assuming the 
political consequences of his defeat he pinochet opted to anchor 
himself to power and adopt a position of total intransigence 
pinochet is the obstacle to dialogue and accord among chileans 
it made no specific demand for pinochets departure saying only 
that he must step aside to facilitate national reconciliation 
under terms of an 8yearold constitution drafted by pinochets 
administration he remains in power until march 1990 when he is to 
hand over power to a successor chosen in an open election scheduled 
for dec 14 1989 
the document said the military juntas willingness to negotiate 
will determine in large part the success of a consentual path 
we believe to be indispensable for chile 
the armed forces have an immense responsibility before the 
people and the future in this important hour it said it is 
their patriotic duty to join in the chilean peoples decision to 
make urgent changes that allow an effective transition to 
democracy 
the fourman junta acts as a legislature in the absence of 
congress disbanded when pinochet led a 1973 coup and took power 
junta members include a pinochetdesignated army representative 
gen humberto gordon the navy commander adm jose merino the 
director of the national police gen rodolfo stange and air force 
chief gen fernando matthei 
in remarks to foreign reporters matthei said friday that he 
would accept negotiations on some constitutional reform 
yes yes matthei said in enlgish we junta members have 
discussed it quite often i myself would welcome some of it 
matthei added however that the junta would never accept 
changes in the constitutions main frame meaning clauses 
protecting private property rights and an economy based on free 
enterprise 
the opposition proposal called for several constitutional 
changes saying the amendment procedure as outlined in the 
constutution is too restrictive 
it also demanded a fully elected congress the constitution 
calls for congressional elections at the same time as the 1989 
presidential vote but would reserve at least nine of the senates 
36 seats for governmentdesignated representatives 
other opposition demands include eliminating a clause forbidding 
marxist parties and increasing the number of civilians on the 
powerful national security council currently dominated by military 
representatives 
matthei speaking at the air force academy said i would be 
very happy to have a change that makes it easier to reform some 
things and harder to reform other things for example private 
property rights and the economy 
he refused to elaborate 
any constitutional reform would have to be approved in a 
national referendum but would be assured of passage if it were 
backed by both the rightwing junta and the opposition coalition 
whose parties range from the centerright to the socialist left 
many observers see such a referendum as a tool for reconciling 
chileans divided in the oct 5 ballot in which 55 percent of 
voters cast no ballots on a proposal that pinochet stay in 
power until march 1997 
of the vote result matthei said we will abide by it it is 
for us mandatory what the people said they said no we say 
all right no 
we dont want the armed forces involved for a long time or 
forever in a military government he said that is bad for the 
country and bad for the armed forces 
right from the beginning we said all right it is easy to 
take power it is not as easy to get graciously out of power he 
added

shifting ice may offer a glimmer of 
hope for three gray whales trapped in the iceclogged waters off 
point barrow in the arctic ocean a national marine fisheries 
service official said friday 
the whales have been stranded 18 miles northeast of barrow by 
new ice for more than a week they are in shallow water only a few 
hundred feet offshore the three an adult and two smaller whales 
have been rising to the surface every four minutes or so to 
breath through two 15by30foot breaks in the ice 
they are five miles from open water 
biologists this week said they feared the breathing holes could 
freeze over or be slammed shut by shifting ice 
but the seaice vectors and seaice analysis show there is 
some hope said ron morris the fisheries services field office 
supervisor in anchorage were not closed in for the winter with 
pressure ridges and things havent gotten to the point where its 
all gloom and doom 
were not in the position where they are going to go belly up 
they are not that stressed 
he said a 96hour forecast showed a strong potential for ice 
movement parallel to the arctic coast there is the possibility 
that this ice will move and open up he said 
an ice analysis showed that only 70 percent of the ocean in the 
whales immediate vicinity was frozen he said much of the ice is 
new and is 6 to 8 inches thick 
geoff carroll a wildlife biologist from the north slope 
borough flew over the california gray whales thursday he said he 
planned to use a snowmobile to reach them late friday 
were going to use hydrophones to try to record sounds from 
the whales and perhaps use that later on as an attracting device to 
get them to open water he said were coming up with several 
different schemes for knocking holes in the ice 
one option is the use of explosives to blow holes in the ice 
another involves the use of an icebreaking hovercraft at prudhoe 
bay some 210 miles southeast of the whales he said efforts to 
obtain the services of an icebreaker were unsuccessful by friday 
afternoon 
thats where it stands right now theres nothing definite 
he said 
carroll said bowhead whales which grow up to 60 feet long 
would be able to break through the relatively thin ice and that 
the slightly smaller gray whales at 4050 feet might be able to 
also if they left their tiny patch of open water 
bowhead are used to it theyve got more mass theyre bigger 
around carroll said they have their blowhole way up on top of 
a big bow on their head im sure these whales could push up 
through theres plenty of mass and strength 
i just dont know if they would apply the force theyve 
probably never done it before they spend their winters in sunny 
california they arent used to being up here in the arctic ice 
carroll said 
the whales prospects for survival would be bleak if their 
breathing holes closed and they could not force their way to the 
surface 
if the ice pushed in and closed the hole they might be able to 
hold out for a halfhour or an hour if they already are exhaused 
they are not going to last very long carroll said 
the population of endangered california gray whales numbers 
about 20000 and has been growing at an annual average of 25 
percent for the past decade

two presidential preference polls conducted 
after the final debate between george bush and michael dukakis 
found the vice president leading by similar margins 
a survey of 529 debate viewers by the los angeles times found 
the republican bush was favored over the democratic dukakis 52 
percent to 42 percent a cbs survey of 442 viewers showed bush was 
preferred by a margin of 5443 
both national surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus 
five percentage points 
a times survey after the vice presidential debate a week ago 
gave bush a 4441 lead a cbs news survey before the debate showed 
bush leading 50 percent to 46 percent 
the times survey also found indications that bush was beginning 
to attract voters who consider themselves undecided said ia 
lewis director of polling for the newspaper 
the newspaper surveys results thursday night just after the 
debate in los angeles suggested that bush had won the debate 47 
percent to 26 percent with 27 percent unsure who had won fridays 
cbs poll said bush won the debate by a 48 percent to 25 percent 
margin 
the bottom line is there isnt very much good news here for 
dukakis said lewis in a telephone interview 
there are indications that the undecideds are breaking for 
bush lewis said and there was almost nothing that bush 
supporters were disappointed about in bushs performance in the 
debate 
the undecideds are going twotoone for bush but the numbers 
arent enough to make a full blown prediction about it he said 
lewis said bush pleased his supporters thursday night in all 
areas except his responses on questions about the environment 
the cbs survey did have some good news for dukakis among debate 
watchers dukakis favorable ratings rose to 43 percent after the 
debate from 34 percent beforehand bush also benefited in that 
category receiving a 58 percent favorable rating after the debate 
compared with 44 percent before 
bushs early defense of running mate dan quayle may have had 
some impact he was seen as qualified by 41 percent of the viewers 
compared with 32 percent beforehand 
the cbs survey noted that less than twothirds of the probable 
electorate viewed the debate meaning the real impact of the debate 
on voter preferences wont be known for about a week 
cbs found its sample by reinterviewing 729 of the 1009 
probable voters interviewed oct 810 for a cbsnew york times poll

the senate voted approval friday of 11 of 
president reagans judicial appointments but at least 15 others 
have virtually no chance of approval before the chamber adjourns 
for the year 
the voicevote decision was the latest chapter in a longrunning 
fight in the 100th congress involving the treatment by the 
democraticcontrolled judiciary committee of the nominees picked by 
reagan to move the federal courts in a conservative direction 
the nominees approved late friday had been passed by the 
committee last week 
but 15 other judicial nominees have not yet had confirmation 
hearings before the committee and their nominations will die when

democrats defeated reagans nomination to the supreme court of 
robert h bork after charges he was too much of a conservative 
ideologue

stalling reagans nominees and gop legislators responded last month 
by using senate rules to block other legislation 
of the 110 judicial nominations made by reagan in the past two 
years the judiciary committee had acted on 95 according to 
figures compiled by the panel 
approved friday were richard l voorhees gastonia nc for 
us district judge for the western district of north carolina 
state common pleas judge richard l nygaard of north east pa for 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals us district judge john m 
duhe jr of lafayette la for the 5th us circuit court of

gabel said at miss myersons divorcefixing trial it was plain 
that she was very put out she added 
ms gabel the prosecutions star witness was special assistant 
to miss myerson in 1983 when she headed the citys department of 
cultural affairs 
prosecutors claim miss myerson gave the 19000ayear post to 
ms gabel to influence her mother former state supreme court 
justice hortense gabel who was then hearing the divorce case of 
miss myersons lover carl andy capasso 
miss myerson 64 capasso 43 and the former judge 75 are all 
charged with a bribery conspiracy in which ms gabel got a job 
while her mother slashed capassos temporary alimony and child 
support payments to his estranged wife nancy 
ms gabel described how her work and personal relationship with 
miss myerson cooled drastically after an oct 18 1983 newspaper 
report noted her mothers involvement in the capasso divorce she 
said her boss had to write a letter to mayor edward i koch 
claiming there was nothing improper about ms gabels hiring 
ms gabel who had accompanied miss myerson to various social 
functions found their contacts limited and her own public 
appearances curtailed 
i was told to lay low for a while said ms gabel 
ms gabel said she began working for miss myerson in august 1983 
and just a few months later found a telephone message from new york 
york post reporter richard johnson on her desk 
miss myerson told her not to return the reporters call until 
after lunch she testified and then to do so from miss myersons 
office where she and her top assistant richard bruno could listen 
in on extension phones 
but ms gabel returned from lunch five minutes early and called 
the reporter from her own desk thinking he had some routine 
question about the department she said 
instead he proceeded to ask me a series of questions and i 
answered them about her background education and whether i was 
friendly with miss myerson outside the office 
when miss myerson passed her desk and realized who she was 
talking to said the witness she didnt say anything but she 
looked very very angry 
after she got off the phone with the reporter said ms gabel 
miss myerson summoned her to her private office and questioned her 
about what she had said 
she was frowning her brow was furrowed said ms gabel but 
miss myerson did not ask her why she disobeyed orders 
shortly after that the new york post reported the coincidence 
that cultural affairs had hired the daughter of the judge whos 
handling the divorce of bess myersons boyfriend

more than 350 amazon indians 
wearing loincloths and warpaint protested friday outside a 
courthouse where their chief appeared for a hearing on alleged 
illegal political activities a lawyer said 
federal judge iran velasco do nascimento canceled the hearing 
because chief kubei appeared before the court in a loincloth 
which the judge said was disrespectful said kubeis lawyer jose 
carlos castro 
kubei chief paulo paiakan both of the kayapo tribe and us 
anthropologist darrell posey of henderson ky are accused of 
breaking brazils foreigners law which bans foreigners from making 
political statements or interfering in brazils internal affairs 
during a trip to the united states earlier this year the three 
complained about the white mans encroachment upon indian lands 
the trial which began in late august has caused a sensation 
because it is the first time native indians have been legally 
considered foreigners 
at the hearing in belem 2140 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
in the northern amazon jungle state of para kubei told the judge 
that as chief of his tribe he has never worn a suit and tie and 
refused to begin doing so now castro said 
the judge then said kubeis decision to wear his tribal 
clothes to the hearing was disrespectful and said the hearing was 
no longer necessary castro said 
outside the courthouse castro said more than 350 kayapo 
indians in loincloths and green and yellow warpaint danced chanted 
tribal songs and shot arrows into nearby trees as they protested 
the hearing they were surrounded by heavily armed federal police 
and more than 1000 onlookers 
castro said he would file a petition to drop charges against the 
two kayapo chiefs on the grounds that they are brazilian indians 
and cannot be tried as foreigners 
brazils 220000 indians including 5500 kayapos are wards of 
the state and do not enjoy the full rights accorded other citizens 
posey however said in a telephone interview that he wanted to 
see the trial continue because if its shelved it could be 
brought against others in our situation 
this is a real aggression against myself the indians the 
scientific community in general and we want to see justice done 
posey and the kayapo chiefs were charged with illegal political 
acitivites after they appeared at florida international university 
in miami to speak about forest conservation 
later the chiefs spoke at the world bank in washington dc 
where they criticized the deforestation of the amazon erosion 
mercury pollution from gold mining and hydroelectric projects that 
displace indian tribes 
the world bank later suspended funding for the xingu 
hydroelectric project which will inundate about 188 million acres 
of mostly indian land 
many brazilians believe the kayapo chiefs were responsible for 
blocking the project but posey said funding already had been 
suspended because of financing problems with the government power 
company eletronorte 
posey 41 an anthropologist and biologist is an outspoken 
critic of the governments indian policy he has lived in brazil 
since the late 1970s and already has been threatened with expulsion

anxious relatives opened kinfolks 
graves friday after several families discovered that their loved 
ones had been buried with trash in their coffins or with no coffin 
at all 
some families who hired funeral director bobby wilks have found 
bottles newspapers discarded flower arrangements and bags of hair 
in caskets some caskets were not protected by vaults that had been 
paid for 
one corpse had an old metal flower pot on top of his head 
it was like he wilks was mad at them all said gravedigger 
darrell dowdell 
wilks was charged friday in nearby springfield with six counts 
of obtaining money under false pretenses authorities said 
arraignment is scheduled monday 
the family of ollie carter watched while his grave at pleasant 
grove united methodist church was uncovered revealing that a 
protective vault bought by his survivors was not installed over his 
casket 
they said their case was similar to those described by other 
customers of barber funeral home who say wilks asked them to leave 
the gravesite before the caskets were lowered into the ground and 
covered 
honey would drip out of his mouth said ann carter 
daughterinlaw of ollie carter he would come over and put his 
arm around you and say it would be best if the family didnt see 
the casket put in the ground and the dirt thrown on top 
at least 14 graves in robertson and sumner counties north of 
nashville had been opened authorities said 
at least two caskets were found buried on their sides and one 
was left open with an arm hanging out witnesses said at least 10 
caskets contained trash and one body was uncovered with no casket 
at all 
the robertson county health department issued 23 disinterment 
permits by early friday afternoon and had calls inquiring about 
permits secretary paulette cowan said that does not necessarily 
reflect how many graves were being opened she said a permit is not 
required if relatives seek disinterment 
wilks who served as a robertson county commissioner several 
years ago was admired and respected by the community bonnie 
clinard of springfield said as she watched exhumations in the cross 
plains cemetery 
ive known him all my life she said there wasnt nothing 
he wouldnt do for nobody people didnt give him nothing but a 
good name for him to do something like this is crazy 
dowdell the grave drigger said wilks had been burying about 60 
people a year in robertson and sumner counties for about 20 years 
wilks from milldale in robertson county was first arrested 
oct 7 after survivors of danny pitt told authorities wilks buried 
the body without the 375 vault they purchased to cover the casket 
family members became suspicious when wilks asked them to leave 
before pitts casket was lowered into a grave donald flatt told 
authorities he and other pallbearers left but stayed out of sight 
nearby they said wilks tossed flower pots into the grave and never 
put the vault on the casket 
wilks was charged with fraud and attempting to commit a felony 
and was released on bond his son gary wilks also was arrested 
then and charged with larceny authorities said 
since then at least 10 more families have filed complaints 
robertson county sheriff bill norman said 
wilks 52 was arrested again friday by robertson county 
sheriffs deputies when he checked out of the tennessee christian 
medical center in madison robertson county chief deputy milton 
frederick 
we had made arrangements to make the arrest when he was 
released frederick said center officials refused to discuss why 
wilks was there wilks did not reply when asked for comment while 
being led away 
after his arrest friday wilks was held in lieu of 82500 bond 
in robertson county 
but if he posts bond he will quickly be back in custody 
sumner county chief of detectives george farmer said wilks is 
charged there with one count of larceny by use of false pretenses 
and that his officers would pick up wilks as soon as they are 
alerted by robertson county authorities that wilks has made bond 
sheriffs detective ed nicholson said it was possible that more 
charges would be filed against wilks in robertson county because 
more relatives of people he had buried had discussed filing 
complaints

federal regulators on friday pledged 13 
billion to rescue 11 insolvent savings associations in texas 
selling them to a cable television company 
the federal home loan bank board said the adam corporationgroup 
of bryant texas a cable television station operator owned by don 
a adam is investing 65 million now and an additional 15 million 
by the end of 1990 to acquire the 11 institutions 
they are being merged under the name of olney savings and loan 
association all deposits even those over the insurance limit of 
100000 are transferring the bank board said 
so far this year regulators have closed or merged 135 insolvent 
sampls nationwide 53 of them in texas and oklahoma those states 
were hard hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986 and a 
subsequent break in real estate prices 
many of the failures in texas have been blamed on fraud and the 
abuse of the states regulatory system 
rep doug barnard dga said a study to be published next week 
by his house government operations subcommittee shows that 
threequarters of all sampl insolvencies appear to be linked in 
varying degrees to misconduct 
at the end of june there were 7350 pending federal criminal 
investigations involving 357 failed institutions and thousands of 
open institutions barnard said in a statement released by an aide 
the adam corporation transaction is the ninth large rescue 
package in texas since may bringing total federal assistance to 
institutions in the state to 153 billion 
the accelerating pace of sampl closings and forced mergers by the 
bank board which regulates the nations 3000 thrift institutions 
has spurred new debate in congress on how to restore the industry 
to health 
the bank board has not acknowledged that it needs more money 
but nearly all private analysts say its insurance fund will have to 
be bailed out very possibly with taxpayer funds so far all of 
the money used in rescues has come from fees charged the industry 
legislation creating a blueribbon commission to study the 
problem and recommend a solution early next year is expected to 
pass congress before it adjourns next week 
the government aid in the latest package is coming in the form 
of a 303 million 10year promissory note and an additional 1 
billion in various kinds of guarantees against loss on the failed 
institutions bad loans 
regulators said the 13 billion was the present value of 
the assistance meaning that over time more could be paid out by 
the government but it would be worth about that much if it were 
paid out all at once 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp will have a 20 
percent ownership stake in the new olney at least 80 percent of 
any gains from the bad loans will go to the insurance funds in 
addition to 60 percent of any tax benefits from the deal 
the 11 institutions being acquired by the adam corporation are 
olney savings association olney first federal savings and loan 
association amarillo san angelo savings association san angelo 
odessa savings association odessa southwest savings and loan 
association abilene banc home savings association midland 
southern savings and loan association brownwood heart o texas

an iranian official said both 
presidential candidates have asked iran for help securing the 
release of hostages held in lebanon 
hussein sheikholeslam a deputy foreign minister for arab and 
african affairs spoke at a news conference late thursday in dubai 
the united arab emirates where he stopped en route to kenya 
he said republican candidate george bush and democratic 
candidate michael dukakis made contact with iran through third 
parties including governments and individuals 
bush has denied this and officials in washington insist the 
united states has no direct or indirect contacts with the iranians 
sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is a 
touchy question and that he did not want to get involved in the 
election games of the united states 
but he said the contacts were not at the level of those 
conducted in 1986 that led to the irangate scandal in which arms 
were secretly sold to iran he did not elaborate 
sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with the 
united states should be separated from the issue of the hostages 
held in lebanon 
iranianbacked shiite moslem militants are believed to hold most 
of the 14 westerners missing in lebanon nine of the captives are 
american 
the longest held is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
sheikholeslam said iran also was concerned about four iranians 
who have been missing in lebanon for six years 
he said that while iran was appealing for the release of its 
nationals it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the 
14 westerners 
former iranian president abolhassan bani sadr who lives in 
exile in paris said recently that richard lawless a former us 
official negotiated with iranian government representatives on 
behalf of bush for the release of the american hostages 
in washington on friday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
denied again that the us government was negotiating with iran 
fitzwater took issue with a report friday in the nation a 
jerusalem weekly that talks on the hostages were held but recessed 
because of news leaks 
no one is authorized to talk for the us government he 
said as we have said before there are all kinds of people 
around the world freelancing on this situation 
fitzwater also predicted more such stories although he did not 
say why 
suffice it to say we find them the news reports mostly 
detrimental he said what they do is build up peoples 
expectations when they are not warranted

democrat michael dukakis confronted 
by disappointing poll results after his final debate with 
republican rival george bush went on the offensive friday 
denouncing mr bushs diet of old chestnuts new baloney and the 
same old voodoo stew 
at a rally in front of the california state capitol dukakis 
invited several thousand partisans to declare him the winner of the 
debate 
the republicans have been up to the plate three times during 
this campaign dukakis told the crowd 
he went on to contend that the first debate was strike one for 
mr bush he said that in the vice presidential debate republican 
dan quayle swung and missed 
and last night here in california well you be the umpire 
and the crowd responded strike three 
dukakis said that in the final debate we defined whats at 
stake in this election george bush is satisfied i know we can do 
better george bush is complacent we want to move forward 
dukakis was introduced at the rally by his running mate texas 
sen lloyd bentsen who asked the crowd did you watch the debate 
last night didnt you think mike dukakis was wonderful the 
partisan crowd roared its agreement 
drawing a contrast between where he would take the country and 
where bush would lead it dukakis said think of where well be 
four years from now if we try to get by on mr bushs diet of old 
chestnuts new baloney and the same old voodoo stew 
dukakis flew later to seattle where thousands of people waited 
more than an hour in the rain to hear his call for clean air clean 
water a clean coastline and clean government 
the crowd at the seattle waterfront was one of the largest of 
dukakis campaign he addressed them from an open platform as a 
steady windblown rain fell 
earlier in the day in los angeles dukakis appeared much more 
subdued when he appealed for support from a group of black 
ministers 
after the sept 25 debate dukakis opened every speech by 
declaring his session with bush was the best 90 minutes of this 
campaign 
but this time quick polls after the debate said people named 
bush the winner by a substantial margin 
deputy campaign chairman john sasso insisted at an early morning 
briefing that the poll numbers did not tell the true story 
it was the swing voters we connected with last night he 
said 
were obviously very pleased we felt the governor made a 
very compelling case for change he said 
it was the first time sasso briefed reporters since his return 
to the campaign just before labor day 
long considered dukakis most important political adviser 
sassos return to the spotlight appeared to signal the campaigns 
realization that it had little time left to get its strongest case 
before the voters 
sasso had left the campaign after admitting he was responsible 
for leaking a videotape that demonstrated that sen joseph biden of 
delaware then a dukakis rival for the democratic presidential 
nomination was using as his own a political speech of british 
labor party leader neil kinnock 
were poised for a very strong last three weeks of the 
campaign said sasso who cited recent economic statistics 
including a widening trade deficit and a report of declining 
consumer confidence 
sasso said that in the debate dukakis connected throughout the 
evening in a very personal way 
our best messenger is our candidate he said and showed two 
new dukakis commercials in which the candidate delivers his message 
in a relaxed conversational tone 
in one of the commercials dukakis is sitting in shirtsleeves on 
a couch and says that despite republican claims of prosperity if 
i were a young father today id want to know my government wasnt 
blind to the changes in my life 
in the other dukakis is standing behind a chair and says the 
country is falling behind in the competition with other nations 
im not going to let that happen he says 
dukakis was introduced to the black ecumenical leadership 
breakfast by jesse jackson who told the ministers that what was at 
risk in the elction was everything weve gained the last 25 
years 
there is hope in michael dukakis he said and urged them to 
work to get out black voters on nov 8 
he or she who would be free must strike the first blow he 
said 
he told them to work for one who has integrity intelligence 
not based upon smile style profile but substance sincerity 
and the will to make a difference 
dukakis sounded many of themes he used in the debate including 
citing former federal judge robert h bork as an example of the 
sort of appointment bush would make to fill supreme court vacancies 
he said bushs use of the case of willie horton a massachusetts 
prisoner on furlough who raped a woman in maryland was an effort 
to divert attention from his own pathetic record on drugs 
and crime 
he called the horton case a terrible human tragedy i accepted 
the responsibility for it 
he made passing reference to the style issue theres a new 
word in our lexicon likeability

republican presidential candidate george 
bush boasted friday about his debate peformance against democrat 
michael dukakis and said i believe that i moved my campaign 
forward by what happened last night 
bush and his campaign strategists combined optimism with 
cautiousness about nov 8 as the race for the white house entered 
the home stretch just 25 days remained friday before the election 
although polls showed bush the clear winner in thurday nights 
debate with dukakis the vice presidents campaign manager lee 
atwater said there was no room for complacency 
this election is going to be won or lost in the last three 
weeks he said were not going to take anything for granted 
 
if the campaign gets smug or overconfident were going to be 
in trouble in a matter of days these big states are all still very 
close 
plunging back into the campaign bush appeared at a rally in the 
los angeles suburb of cerritos amid nearly a dozen air balloons 
tethered on a high school field 
he was introduced by california gov george deukmejian as the 
new heavyweight debate champion of the world 
however in brief exchange with reporters bush said theres 
no overconfidence at all i can remember how these polls can 
change 
later bush delivered an environmental speech in san diego at 
the scripps institution of oceanography with waves of the pacific 
ocean crashing behind him 
for the first time bush said we should take a very close 
look at environmental concerns before proceeding with ocean 
drilling in southern california in the santa monica bay and 
adjacent areas 
previously bush supported a delay in any drilling in a scenic 
tract in northern california pending study of environmental factors 
environmentalists a key voter block in this crucial state 
oppose drilling in either site 
bush also said that one of his first priorities if elected would 
be winning passage of stronger cleanair laws 
he called air quality perhaps the most pressing environmental 
concern in southern california claiming that the areass recent 
growth had not come without a price a price commonly described 
with four letters smog 
he also promised to convene a global conference on the 
environment claiming that most of the major environmental 
problems including acid rain warming of the earth and 
deterioration of the oceans are truly international in nature 
speaking with reporters aboard air force 2 bush was reluctant 
to place too much emphasis on a pair of polls that showed thursday 
nights debate increasing his lead over dukakis 
youre talking to a guy who when the polls were going the 
other way i said it wasnt over bush said it wasnt so why 
should i now suddenly have the luxury of changing my position 
but when asked how he felt about thursdays performance bush 
said read my smile 
in cerritos he addressed a crowd of several thousand from a 
stage overshadowed by a balloon reading good night mike a 
nottoosubtle message to the democratic candidate 
im glad that that last debate is over and now we have three 
weeks to take our case to the american people in rallies like this 
and in events all over this country bush exclaimed i mean to 
run hard to campaign hard to stand on the issues and i mean to 
win this election on nov 8 
the vice president said last night the american people had a 
chance to watch two candidates in action we were specific on the 
issues we came at each other pretty hard and when the smoke 
cleared it was pretty clear where we stood and i believe that i 
moved my campaign forward by what happened last night 
brushing aside criticism he was waging a negative race bush 
said im glad we can wage an upbeat campaign about america id 
hate to be dragging myself around this country trying to convince 
american people that everything is bad it isnt a lot of things 
are good about our country and this recovery and i want to keep the 
expansion going until every man and woman that wants a job has a 
job

the photograph which appeared in the aug 27 1945 issue of 
life magazine showed a nurse and the sailor kissing passionately 
as crowds of people gathered in new york citys times square to 
celebrate japans surrender to the united states 
george mendonsa 64 sued time which owns life magazine for

opposition lawmakers said friday the 
ramstein airshow disaster and constant military manuevers show 
west germany has relinquished too much of its internal affairs to 
its nato allies 
those responsible among the nato partners must understand that 
during peacetime conditions here should not be like those of a 
front nation on the eve of war said walter kolbow of the social 
democratic party during a debate in the west german parliament 
the debate centered on concern about west german sovereignty 
following a series of nato warplane crashes earlier this year and 
the aug 28 accident at the us ramstein air base that left 69 
people dead hundreds of people were injured in the ramstein 
tragedy that occurred when three planes in an italian stuntflying 
team collided and one smashed into the crowd and exploded in flames 
many west germans have complained about property damage caused 
by frequent ground maneuvers by us military forces and lowlevel 
flights of nato planes 
media commentators opposition politicians and others have 
called on the federal government to control what the us military 
and other north atlantic treaty organization nations are allowed to 
do on west german soil and in the countrys skies 
kolbow said the ramstein disaster and deafening lowlevel nato 
training flights have infuriated the west german population 
in peacetime that which is meant to be defended and protected 
should certainly not be damaged or destroyed he said concern 
indeed anger is increasing among those affected 
nato military jets flying at treetop levels are a common sight 
in west germany 
the social democrats are demanding the government tell the 
united states and other nato members with warplanes in west germany 
to halt the lowlevel flights 
florian gerster another social democrat also spoke of west 
german sovereignty 
americans britons and french would not themselves accept such 
a burden for very long the allies should respect the political 
wishes of the german federal lawmakers said gerster 
kolbow demanded the federal government and nato immediately 
develop a defense concept that finally makes possible a ban on 
military lowlevel training flights 
our view is that an immediate halt to lowlevel flights is 
possible because of the development of modern military technology 
and because of the relaxed situation between east and west he 
said 
chancellor helmut kohls government has said lowlevel flights 
are necessary to train pilots but it is pressing for a reduction 
in those flights 
west germany is considered one of the most militarized regions 
in the world almost 250000 us forces are stationed in the 
country

italy and the soviet union signed an agreement 
friday for italy to provide the soviets with a 680 million loan to 
help produce consumer goods the tass news agency reported 
it also said an accord was reached that could include italian 
participation in the soviet space program 
scarcity of some basic commodities has been a chronic problem 
for years in the soviet union 
a consortium of italian financial institutions will provide the 
government guaranteed export credit loan so the soviets can buy 
italian machinery to produce consumer goods italian officials said 
without elaborating 
the agreements were reached during a state visit to moscow by 
italian premier ciriaco de mita 
italy and other north atlantic treaty organization countries 
suspended intergovernmental credit concessions to the soviet union 
after it sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
marxist government battle anticommunist rebels the soviet troops 
are withdrawing from afghanistan under a timetable that will have 
all of the forces out by early next year 
italy is the soviet unions thirdlargest western trading 
partner 
tass said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
italian foreign minister giulio andreotti signed an accord on 
cooperation on outer space 
it did not say if the pact included provisions for an italian to 
join in a flight aboard a soviet spacecraft but quoted soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as telling de mita maybe some 
time in the future an italian national will keep soviet cosmonauts 
company in a joint expedition in orbit 
several foreigners have participated in soviet space flights 
most recently in august when an afghan national was in a crew sent 
to the space station mir the next foreign guest to visit the mir 
station is scheduled to be a frenchman in a launch set for nov 21

pakistan will release a report on monday 
regarding the plane crash that killed president zia ulhaq two 
months ago the white house said friday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to discuss the 
contents of the report saying it was up to pakistani authorities 
to reveal the document about the aug 17 crash that killed 30 
people including us ambassador arnold raphel 
rumor and speculation have flourished in the absence of any 
official report on the case which is widely assumed to have been 
an assassination 
they range from speculation that a bomb missile or tampering 
with the planes engines caused the fiery crash those blamed in 
the reports and rumors have included the soviet union 
fundamentalist moslems and afghan and indian agents 
us officials have refused to make any disclosures about the 
investigation in which american experts took part citing the 
sensitivity of the case 
zia was a military strongman viewed as a bulwark of stability in 
the volatile region 
the soviet union objected to his continuing arming and support 
of afghan rebels accusing zia of violating the april pact for the 
pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan it repeatedly warned him 
to cease his backing of the guerrillas who are based in pakistan 
and also aided by the united states 
zia who took power in a bloodless 1977 coup also faced 
opposition at home from moslems who felt he was too lax in imposing 
religious laws on his country and from political groups seeking 
free elections 
pakistan is committed to holding elections on nov 16 for a new 
leadership

new york states highest court said friday 
that a woman debilitated by a series of strokes should be fed 
despite objections of her daughters who said their mother didnt 
wish to be kept alive by artificial means 
the 52 ruling which reversed decisions by two lower state 
courts gives doctors at the westchester county medical center in 
valhalla the authority to feed mary oconnor 77 through a tube 
lawyers for mrs oconnors two daughters helen hall and joan 
fleming had fought attempts to use the tube arguing that the 
woman made it clear she didnt want to be kept alive by artificial 
or mechanical means prior to a series of incapacitating strokes 
starting in 1985 
but the majority of court of appeals judges said it wasnt clear 
what mrs oconnor had in mind when she talked about disliking 
lifesupport systems they said she may well have meant the 
mechanical means used to keep alive people facing terminal 
illnesses such as the cancer that killed two of her brothers and 
her husband 
the prospect of dying of starvation or dehydration by 
intentionally not getting proper nutrition is something the woman 
probably didnt envision the court said 
in the absence of proof that clearly and convincingly 
indicates what a patients preferences would be in such cases the 
court said artificially feeding the woman is the right thing to do 
mrs oconnor a former hospital administrator was said in 
court papers to be able to respond to simple commands and to 
carry on limited conversations however she is unable to care 
for herself and is largely paralyzed 
doctors familiar with her case testified that she has also 
become mentally incapacitated by her strokes and will never 
regain sufficient mental ability to care for herself 
the medical center proposed using a feeding tube in june when 
the womans gag reflex failed and she lost the ability to eat on 
her own she has been receiving intravenous feeding since her 
daughters challenged that move but doctors said they cannot keep 
that method up indefinitely because it doesnt provide sufficient 
nutrition and because patients veins tend to deteriorate over time 
wayne spector an attorney who helped represent mrs oconnors 
daughters said the women were very disappointed and distraught 
friday but would not comment on the substance of the decision 
because he hadnt read it 
barry bowman a spokesman for the westchester county medical 
center applauded the ruling 
bowman who reported that oconnor was awake and alert said 
the decision by the court to allow feeding through a tube meant 
that we can provide more nutrients and it should minimize any 
risk of infection

a group called women against rape 
libeled a man when it circulated a flier that falsely accused him 
of assaulting and trying to rape a coworker a jury ruled 
steve carney who was never charged was awarded 7500 for pain 
and suffering and 25000 in punitive damages thursday 
i feel a lot better but i cant say i really won because 
there may be people out there who saw it the flier and formed 
their own opinions said carney 23 
carney of scotts valley sued women against rape of santa cruz 
claiming the group publicly humiliated him in a 1984 leaflet that 
named him as having assaulted and attempted to rape a coworker 
testimony indicated during the libel trial that the woman never 
went to police and swore in a deposition that she didnt know what 
happened the night she went out drinking with carney and another 
coworker 
representatives of women against rape testified that they based 
their information solely on the womans word and by observing her 
behavior which they said was consistent with a profile of women 
who have been sexually assaulted 
women against rape directors deanne pernell and jan shirchild 
said they would discuss an appeal with the organizations lawyers 
they war stated over and over again that the effect of the 
publication on steve carney was not considered we found that to be 
wanton disregard for his rights said jury foreman ken fein 
jurors felt that associating someones name to such a crime 
without investigation was absolutely despicable he added

a nicaraguan rebel leader on friday 
said it is impossible to defeat the leftist sandinista government 
militarily and announced formation of a new group to push for 
peaceful alternatives 
alfredo cesar said the new coalition called the democratic 
center will try to persuade other members of the nicaraguan 
resistance known as the contras that the military solution will 
not bring peace to their central american nation 
the military fight is not viable what is viable is the 
political battle cesar said at a news conference 
he said the coalition was formed because rightwing contra 
leaders have have not shown the capacity or imagination to generate 
a quick solution to the nicaraguan conflict the leftist sandinista 
government has been in power since 1979 
cesar said the coalition made up of the nicaraguan 
conservative party the nicaraguan democratic movement the 
nicaraguan democratic christian party and the social democratic 
party plans to present a peace plan within 30 days to the 
sandinistas other central american governments involved in the 
peace process and the united states 
once the proposal is accepted including the release of 
political prisoners the coalition will return to nicaragua and 
within less than 120 days reincorporate itself into the nicaraguan 
political process and participate in elections of a central 
american parliament as well as municipal legislative and 
presidential elections cesar said reading a statement 
one of our biggest fears is that whatever new us 
administration takes office in 1989 will reach an agreement with 
the sandinistas and we will be left out of the political 
picture said a coalition source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the source also said coalition members perceived guarded 
interest in the sandinista government when they spoke with 
government representatives during a meeting at the united nations 
cesar said the new democratic center coalition is not breaking 
away from the nicaraguan resistance but will try to win other 
members over to its ideas

the operator of the san onofre nuclear power 
plant said friday it found 20 instances of workers using marijuana 
and will begin performing random drug tests on its employees 
the testing plan announced by southern california edison co 
closely matches one under consideration by the federal nuclear 
regulatory commission for imposition industrywide 
at san onofre the first plant in the nation where a reactor 
operator was suspended by the nrc because of a positive drug test 
trained dogs found marijuana residue in four spots edison said in 
a news release the utility said followup sweeps found drugs or 
residue in 16 more spots around the plant which is on the coast 
north of san diego 
the searches took place after the remains of marijuana 
cigarettes turned up in littleused rooms in reactor buildings 
where security clearances are required said nrc spokesman greg 
cook 
there was no way to determine if anyone who actually operates 
the reactors was high on drugs he said 
they couldnt identify who brought it on site cook said 
theres a heck of a lot of employees who work out there and a 
lot of contractor personnel 
edison released few details of the searches other than to say 
they had been conducted in recent weeks 
edison said it didnt believe drug use at the plant had ever 
endangered the public multiple levels of control and other 
safeguards protect plant operations from miscalculations by a 
single employee the company said 
edison which since 1984 has been testing potential hires for 
drug use said that on nov 7 it would begin random unannounced 
drug tests of most workers at san onofre after one positive test 
an employee will be offered a choice of dismissal or counseling a 
second positive test will result in dismissal 
the edison plan is nearly identical to one that will be 
considered by the nrc at a public hearing monday in maryland cook 
said no specific timetable has been set for adoption of the 
national plan 
under the nrc proposal an employee who fails a second drug test 
would be barred from sensitive areas of nuclear plants for a 
minimum of three years and a third positive test would bring 
permanent denial of access 
we have good reason to believe that the rate of illegal drug 
use among nuclear plant employees is well below the level of the 
entire population cook said i dont think well consider it 
satisfactorily low until it is zero

an air force colonel arrested for his 
role in last years attempted coup was shot and killed early 
saturday while trying to escape from a military prison it was 
announced 
military officials said lt col francisco baula died at a 
military hospital about nine hours after guards at the suburban 
camp crame stockade shot him when he refused to halt and ignored 
warning shots 
maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary said baula was shot and wounded three times 
officials at the armed forces of the philippines medical center 
said earlier that baula underwent surgery and was expected to 
recover the stockade commandant later said the renegade officer 
succumbed to his wounds 
i was informed that at 910 this morning he died of his 
wounds col percival adiong said in a telephone interview we 
were hoping that he would survive 
baula was arrested oct 3 along with two other military men 
sought in connection with the aug 28 1987 coup attempt against 
president corazon aquinos government 
the uprising was led by former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan baula was operations officer of the air forces 420th 
supply wing and directed the takeover of the villamor air base in 
manila 
at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in the 
revolt the most serious of about six armed attemps to oust mrs 
aquino since she took office feb 25 1986 
baula fled after the coup attempt and remained at large until he 
was arrested with the two other suspects while having lunch at a 
restaurant in suburban pasay city this month 
montano said baula slipped into a dark corner of the 
stockade shortly after midnight and tried to climb over the wall 
with a makeshift ladder 
guards saw him ordered him to halt and fired warning shots 
montano said they then fired at the colonel and he fell to the 
ground according to montano 
our investigation shows that there were no others who tried to 
help him montano said 
he added that security would be reinforced at the stockade 
located at the headquarters of the philippine constabulary

effort to free former gov orlando dulay jailed in connection with 
the killings of several volunteers who had worked for mrs aquino 
during her 1986 election campaign against president ferdinand 
marcos 
the raiders failed to free dulay but fled with a large number of 
weapons 
mrs aquino became president after marcos was ousted by a 
civilianmilitary uprising in february 1986 
at the time of baulas arrest the military reported police 
found 5000 in his car and said the money was to be used to 
finance a new coup attempt 
arrested with baula were constabulary capt roque maranon and 
trainee inocencio cuyuca 
they are among nearly 80 military rebels and rightwing 
militants reported to have been arrested in recent weeks manila

iraq shipping sources say a sign of easing tensions in the gulf 
after eight years of war 
iranian warships have continued interrogating vessels by radio 
demanding to know their cargoes and destinations but even those 
symbolic interceptions are now down to onethird of what they were 
immediately after the ceasefire took hold said shipping monitors 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
both countries have reported efforts to reopen ports closed by 
the iraniraq war and iraq said about a dozen of the 18 vessels 
trapped in the the ports of umm qasr and khor alzubair since the 
start of the war have been able to sail out

gil a veteran newsman whose role model was 
edward r murrow still yearns to say something important even if 
its just on a local morning talk show that nobody watches 
gil has been given a new cohost len len is on an 80s fast 
track having just moved up to the small east coast network 
affiliate from an independent station in utah len is quick len is 
funny len is now 
they make a perfect team lens head is as wooden as gils 
delivery 
paul dooley as gil and griffin dunne as len star in the wicked 
bit of fun lip service a onehour hbo showcase presentation 
premiering tonight with additional playdates oct 20 23 26 and 
29 
the film was adapted by howard korder boys life from his 
play the project is the first television venture by the producing 
team of playwrightscreenwriter david mamet the untouchables 
glengarry glen ross and mike hausman it was directed by wh 
macy a stage actor and colleague of mamet 
gil well aware hes being edged out monosyllabically fends off 
lens guileless attempts to make him a mentor len tries to engage 
gil in discussions of deep subjects such as the fame thing or 
the careerpersonal life thing len goes through the motions of 
stabbing his coanchor in the back pitching new ideas to the 
producer behind gils back making fun of gil on the air but 
seems blithely unaware of the inevitable effect 
the trap would be to make him a very onedimensional 
sonofabitch that hes got an ulterior motive from the very 
beginning said dunne in an interview hes a guy that really 
idolizes gil hes not a guy whos just out to get his job he just 
thinks the guy is the greatest man in the world and hes always 
loved his work even though he doesnt even know his work hes 
just an old guy whos been in the industry for a long time and he 
must have interviewed nixon and he mustve done all that serious 
journalistic stuff and his lens idea of what the medias 
supposed to and gils are quite different but he goes into it so 
innocently 
his shallowness the nice thing you can say about it is its 
sincere thats what i loved about the part the guy did crack me 
up 
lip service is a satire on the tv biz but its clash of 
values could apply to any milieu reassuringly if perhaps not 
realistically gil triumphs in the end 
dunne who starred mostly recently in after hours and 
whos that girl is a movie producer as well as an actor he 
and amy robinson produced the current running on empty the 
critically praised film starring river phoenix as the son of 60s 
radicals on the run from the fbi 
dunnes first production was the 1979 joan micklin 
silverdirected chilly scenes of winter originally released as 
head over heels 
he robinson and another underemployed actor friend mark 
metcalf had loved the ann beattie book we thought it would make 
a great movie we optioned it and for some reason never doubted 
that wed get it made because thats how much we knew about making 
movies we actually thought wed get it made thats how much we 
knew 
dunne and robinson produced after hours and have a new 
project with swedish director lasse hallstrom my life as a 
dog starring holly hunter broadcast news 
paul dooley a veteran of robert altman movies is probably best 
known for playing the dad in breaking away he currently stars 
in the cbs sitcom coming of age 
hes a hilarious man as a comedic actor and also as a clown 
i mean like a clown in the true sense said dunne he knows 
everything about juggling he taught me how to fall up the stairs 
hes knows all that stuff

attempting to forecast the stock market on the 
basis of which candidate is elected and which policies will be 
followed may be a futile exercise 
the reason what the candidates say is not always what they 
might do 
in 1980 ronald reagan campaigned against the budget deficits of 
jimmy carters administration and promised to reduce and finally 
eliminate deficit spending 
but events didnt follow the script whereas carters deficits 
averaged around 63 billion for four years reagans rose to 175 
billion a year for the next eight years 
in 1978 carter proposed an increase in the capital gains tax 
but a congress dominated by his own party cut the tax instead 
earlier richard nixon had expressed his belief in free markets 
and then instituted a price freeze 
in short positions taken in pursuit of power arent always used 
in its exercise documentation can be found in the careers of 
almost all leaders including such agents of change as franklin 
roosevelt and mikhail gorbachev 
but if patterns of recent history have meaning there is an 
indicator that does offer some guidance that indicator suggests 
that no matter who is elected the stock market isnt inclined to 
surge in the following year 
since 1948 the market has suffered a median loss of 82 percent 
in the year following a presidential election the result of 
declines in five years and advances in four 
it doesnt seem to matter which party wins while republicans 
usually are viewed as probusiness the stock market doesnt offer 
clear substantiation 
democratic victories in 1948 1960 and 1964 led to stock market 
advances in the following year in 1976 democratic victory 
preceded a decline republican victories in 1952 1956 1968 1972 
and 1980 preceded declines in the standard amp poors 500stock index 
did such movements have everything to do with politics very 
little or perhaps nothing at all nobody really can say but what 
is certain is that the stock market has its own cycle one that 
doesnt always coincide with politics 
securities prices that is are as cyclical as the economy bull 
markets follow and precede bear markets just as the larger economy 
grows and shrinks in a series of recessions and expansions 
while sometimes the cycles seem to have little relationship to 
politics that doesnt mean there is no cause and effect at all 
wright investors service which supplied these figures 
believes that recent stock market strength may be linked with the 
assumption that george bush will be elected the next president 
expectations of republican victories it seems do have a 
positive impact on the market at least the figures show that the 
market has risen every year in which the republicans have won since 
1952 
its the year after in which the republicans have done poorly 
for the stock market and that leaves a puzzling question 
in those postelection years did the market decline because of 
the republicans or had it risen so much in anticipation of a 
republican victory that it really had no other direction to go but 
down

robert sabala takes the vertical drop into 
the concrete bowl then zooms up and down the inside of an adjacent 
concrete pipe his skateboard making wings for his feet 
theres no other feeling he says later awaiting another 
turn at the 20foottall pipeline the primary attraction at a 
skateboard park here its like defying gravity 
skateboarders from california to massachusetts are finding they 
need to defy more than gravity these days to enjoy their sport in 
many cities they defy the law 
communities fed up with skateboarders who dash between cars 
scar concrete and plow down pedestrians increasingly are closing 
their streets and sidewalks to the sport 
in southern california sheriffs deputies chase skateboarders 
out of the huge mount baldy drainage pipe 
in washington dc they are shooed from dry fountains in 
freedom plaza 
across the country skateboarders also called rippers brave 
trespassing fines to sneak into backyard pools of vacant homes and 
drain them for skating 
its making criminals out of kids says jason danziger 17 
who took up the unicycle when his hometown of northampton mass 
banned downtown boarding a year ago 
in april 1987 palm beach fla police arrested three 
skateboarding teens as they were performing stunts in violation of 
the citys 31yearold antiskateboarding ordinance the boys ages 
14 15 and 16 were handcuffed and taken to the police station 
then later released to their parents 
there is a duty to protect these kids from becoming 
paraplegics now retired assistant police chief richard w wade 
said at the time 
in issaquah wash reckless skateboarders face fines of up to 
250 under a 1985 ordinance 
to cut down on reckless riders in rosman nc adlermen in 
february passed a law requiring them to have a drivers license or 
be supervised by a licensed adult 
they just took over the roads said lois terreri town clerk 
of clinton nj where a skate ban prompted in part by the 
skating death of a 15yearold boy carries a 50 fine 
some of these kids consider themselves fairly skilled she 
said tell that to the little old lady walking down the street 
with someone coming barreling at her 
all the bad press prompted santa cruz skateboards among the 
largest manufacturers of skateboarding equipment and transworld 
skateboarding magazine to give out hundreds of thousands of 
bumperstickers with the message skateboarding is not a crime 
skateboarding just doesnt receive the social acceptance 
says carl west associate editor of transworld based in escondido 
calif for a long time skateboarding was associated with punk 
rock it was more of a statement than a sport 
not so now a recent revival in interest has made skateboarding 
a multimillion dollar industry with shopping mall fashion shows 
and espn coverage for competition that earns winners thousands of 
dollars and lucrative professional contracts 
bob denike production manager for santa cruz estimates the 
soquel califbased company and two large competitors vision and 
powell peralta pull in 150 million a year between them just for 
skate hardware boards cost an average of 100 
if youre a young kid you buy a bike and you buy a 
skateboard its part of your life he said 
since skateboarding evolved in the 1960s as an alternative to 
surfing when the waves were flat it has developed its own culture 
skateboarders have their own vocabulary words like lame 
uncool poser a kid who pretends to be a good skater but isnt 
and ollie a trick that involves popping the board up in the air by 
bearing down on the tail 
the clothing also is a skateboarders own hightop sneakers 
long colorful shorts emblazoned oversized tshirts shirt 
graphics tend toward the bizarre freaked out rippers with zapped 
hairdos and bugged eyes 
one tshirt advises think fast skate fast and dont look 
back 
skaterboarders say the sport is popular because it allows them 
to develop skills at their own pace without letting down a team 
or even dad who probably has never been on a board 
avid skaters support three magazines whose photos show kids 
skateboarding on everything from pools to banisters but all that 
free flying can be hard on surfaces one reason for antiskate 
sentiment 
just a few blocks away from the white house the pershing park 
memorial dedicated to americans who served overseas in world war 
i lost a chunk of granite to the boards the freedom plaza 
fountains have been scarred and chipped by boards said lt hugh 
irwin of the us park police 
riverside calif banned skateboarding in business districts 
after skaters turned bus benches into ramps broke windows knicked 
walls and knocked over little old ladies said city 
councilwoman jean mansfield 
skaters say theyve been unfairly stereotyped as bad boys 
like bikers says gabe roth 13 who fought the riverside ban 
danziger says its not uncommon for motorists to shout 
profanities at him while he is skateboarding just like two days 
ago someone threw a beer can at me he said 
maybe theres some resentment of skateboarders highly 
individualistic ways 
take for example steve alba 25 of ontario a professional 
skateboarder for the santa cruz co 
at the pipeline in upland one of four concrete skate parks in 
the nation alba is wearing two dangling earrings one a crystal 
one an evil eye from mexico his converse hightops dont match 
either one is gray one red 
dotting his forehead is a reminder of the 90 stitches needed 
after catching his board on the edge of a pool he plunged to the 
bottom his fiberglass helmet shattering into his forehead 
alba known simply as salba on the professional circuit is back 
from an illicit skating session at the mount baldy pipe just north 
of here authorities have flooded the concrete with tar and 
surrounded it with barbed wire trying in vain to deter 
skateboarders 
sessions at baldy and others in backyard pools have left alba 
with 500 in fines so far this year but like a skier he seeks 
untouched territory 
weve got like a little team called team virgin to find places 
nobodys ever skated before he said 
alba was skating a backyard pool the day stan hoffman stopped by 
to ask what it would take to get local skateboarders out of 
backyards and into a skate park that was the beginning of the 
pipeline a 2acre site dotted with concrete bowls and anchored 
with a 20by40 pipe 
but sometime this fall hoffman 59 and his wife jeanne 62 
plan to close the park and rip up the concrete to be replaced with 
an industrial park free from the liability associated with 
skateboarders 
i feel bad said mrs hoffman watching dozens of skaters 
zoom around because there isnt any place for these kids

for each impressive skateboard move there is probably an 
equally impressive scar 
last year 91644 injuries were treated in hospital emergency 
rooms as the result of accidents involving skateboards about 
onesixth the number caused by bicycle mishaps according to the 
us consumer products safety commission 
the number rises as the sports popularity increases although 
industry spokesmen like bob denike of santa cruz skateboards say 
pads and other safety equipment are improving 
the late fred astaire at age 80 reportedly fell and broke his 
arm while maneuvering a board to impress his grandchildren 
inxs drummer jon farriss had to cancel the australian rock 
groups european tour this summer after a skateboard spill 
aggravated his arthritis 
angelo rocky krakoff who played sylvester stallones son in 
the film rocky iv needed surgery for injuries suffered when 
hit by a car while skating in los angeles 
weve all had our share of accidents but its worth it 
says brian kahn a frecklefaced 14yearold from riverside not 
if like your tooth is on the ground and your eyeballs are over 
there we learn how to fall 
some are less fortunate 
in santa rosa in february 16yearold daniel vargas fell off 
his board as he was traveling to the hospital to see a friend who 
had damaged his liver in a skateboard accident vargas was in a 
coma four days and required brain surgery it was just a struggle 
to give him the will to live his mother connie said 
in the hospital a month and rehabilitation another month 
vargas missed the rest of the school year 
the august issue of the magazine transworld contains a eulogy of 
sorts for reece ramirez a 16yearold sierra madre boy who was 
struck by a vehicle while skateboarding with a friend in january 
when the friend went to get help reece apparently was struck a 
second time the account said he died the next day 
while we are skating and having fun he will be watching over 
us to make sure we dont have another tragic accident such as what 
happened to one of my best friends wrote chris jurebie

portugal will send a new but wrecked 
ship and its cargo of 5400 japanese cars to the bottom of the 
atlantic whatever the outrage of ecologists because no 
practical alternative is available 
that was the comment of adm silva horta chairman of the 
portuguese national council against marine pollution after 
returning last week from london where he reported on the case to 
the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping 
the 58000ton reijin ran aground april 27 in shallow water off 
the northern city of oporto the first stop on its maiden voyage 
from japan to ireland one sailor was killed 
emerald shipholding sa a japaneseowned panamanian company to 
which the ship belongs said july 13 the reijin was not recoverable 
and assumed responsibility for the wrecks removal the new cars 
must be scuttled because they could be unsafe to drive 
horta said the company insisted on sinking the ship and its 
100million cargo at sea and threatened to abandon the wreck if 
portugal refused to cooperate that would leave the portuguese with 
disposal project costing millions of dollars 
environmentalists in portugal and elsewhere say the 173 tons of 
copper and lead 115 tons of paint 28 tons of oil and more than 
1000 tons of rubber plastic and textiles could seriously damage 
marine life 
salvage workers are dismantling the reijins top decks and 
ferrying the scrap metal and some cars ashore the rest of the ship 
will be refloated towed out and sunk in at least 6000 feet of 
water horta said in an interview 
cars now being unloaded will be dumped 40 miles off the coast 
and the wreck with the remaining cargo will be scuttled 150 miles 
out by midnovember the admiral said 
the robin wood association an ecology group based in paris has 
called the decision an ecological crime and further criticism 
has come from the oslo convention which monitors sea pollution 
portuguese environmentalists want action from the european 
economic community of which portugal has been a member since jan 
1 1986 
it is indeed a crime dangerous to the whole world not just 
to portugal mike weber a german lecturer at oportos institute 
for biomedical science said in a telephone interview any 
ecology schoolbook will tell you that one liter of oil pollutes one 
million liters of water 
marine authorities feel they have no choice 
if the government tried to salvage the wreck it not only would 
have to pay the estimated cost of 15 million but might also face 
claims from japanese automakers contending that their images were 
tarnished by the sale of potentially unsafe cars to bargainhunters 
we could not take over the task of removing the ship ourselves 
because we did not have the technical financial or even legal 
means to do so before the autumn bad weather horta said 
coast guard officials say the first storm of the winter season 
probably would destroy the grounded vessel and spread the wreckage 
in portuguese coastal waters so the admiral said we consider 
the plan to dump at sea the lesser evil 
removal of another ship the tollan grounded in the tagus 
estuary off lisbon in 1980 cost the government more than 14 
million and officials want to avoid a far larger bill for the 
reijin 
owners are required by portuguese law to remove wrecks declared 
to be dangerous but horta said it is unfortunately wellknown 
that this obligation very often cannot be enforced 
shipping companies that operate under the panamanian flag of 
convenience often have little capital other than their vessels 
horta said the reijin apparently was the only valuable asset of 
emerald shipholding 
insurers are reluctant to talk about the case but one based in 
lisbon speaking privately said he was mystified that such a 
modern wellequipped ship could sink in shallow waters after 
making a long tough voyage from japan 
one theory is that the computerized selfleveling system 
overreacted when about 200 cars were unloaded in oporto and the 
crew was unable to adjust it

the stockbrokers plea once this week is over 
can everybody stop thinking and talking so much about the crash of 
1987 
that may be asking quite a bit the memory of a 1 trillion 
disaster dies hard 
the recollections will certainly be intense wednesday which 
marks the first anniversary of black monday and that days record 
508point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
but after that ritual observance is over say some of wall 
streets optimists maybe a few of the customers will stop looking 
backward and start thinking ahead 
for a year since the debacle the stock market has been beset by 
fear of the other shoe dropping in the words of jay donnaruma 
an analyst at first albany corp in albany ny 
the market reacts to bad news but yawns at the pluses if a 
stock isnt a takeover candidate it hardly moves except when poor 
results are announced or predicted 
cash continues to pile up and mutual funds continue to 
experience redemptions 
donnaruma says this atmosphere can be used to build a positive 
case for buying stocks it reminds us of 1982 when all the 
smart money was in money market mutual funds he says 
indeed some marketwatchers who have been wary about the 
outlook for months have lately moved tentatively toward a more 
positive view 
background conditions have improved analysts at standard amp 
poors corp said in a report citing both technical market 
indicators and recent evidence that economic growth was slowing to 
a more moderate pace 
while we dont regard the upside potential as large the stock 
market should be able to work its way higher in the period ahead 
but other bears are sticking resolutely to their views even as 
the dow climbed early this month to its highest levels since the 
crash 
without any new developments odds are extremely high that the 
federal reserve will tighten its credit policy another notch 
within four weeks after the election contends james stack 
editor of the investech investment advisory service 
the fed has raised the discount rate within three months 
following four of the past six presidential elections 
if they follow suit this time youll be surprised at how fast 
higher interest rates will send investors scrambling toward the 
exits 
a good many other observers say the market might well continue 
to frustrate both the bulls and bears after the crash anniversary 
and the nov 8 election are past 
anthony tabell at delafield harvey tabell inc in princeton 
nj argues that the market is in a period of base formation 
the trouble with finding oneself in the midst of such a 
process is that it is usually impossible to tell when that process 
is likely to complete itself he says 
there have in the past been base formation periods which have 
extended for close to three years he observes the logical 
expectation for the market at the moment then appears to be more 
of the same 
wherever the market is headed the atmosphere approaching the 
first anniversary of the crash contains some stark contrasts with 
the mood of a year ago 
complaints these days focus more on inaction rather than 
volatility and the amount of scared money in stocks seems much 
less than it was last year 
on oct 14 1987 as the market was heading for collapse the 
government reported a largerthanexpected trade deficit for the 
previous august and the dow plunged 95 points 
on oct 13 this year the government again reported a 
largerthanexpected august trade deficit this time the dow rose 7 
points

a leaflet distributed in michigan carries a 
boldface headline here is george bushs distinguished record as 
43rd vice president of the united states the four pages are 
blank a campaign gimmick from the state democratic party 
even some republicans have wondered about bushs record senate 
minority leader bob dole during his futile quest for the gop 
presidential nomination tried to make the point that although bush 
has a long resume hes made little impact dole cut an 
advertisement that showed a man walking through a snowcovered 
forest but leaving no footprints 
where was george the democrats cried gleefully at their 
atlanta convention hoping to show that bush had been out of the 
loop or on the wrong side when major white house policy decisions 
were made protesters raise the same wherewasgeorge question with 
placards at every bush campaign stop 
it is a gambit that arguably has failed the democrats and 
dole before them have not been able to exploit bushs record to 
significant advantage 
of course bushs record at least as vice president is ronald 
reagans the president gets the credit or the blame for the past 
eight years 
as reagans understudy bush got the bit parts and the 
supporting roles accepting the presidents assignments but always 
relinquishing the spotlight to him 
its the curse of the vice president to remain in the shadows 
the office is not a crucible for grand schemes 
look at past vice presidents and ask what did they do i 
dont think very much says duke university presidential scholar 
james david barber 
the vice presidency boxes up someone and makes it unlikely 
that they can be a public leader in any manner because of the 
necessity that they resonate what the president wants barber 
said 
leo ribuffo a specialist in political history at george 
washington university said the job is in a way a wimpy job 
like walter mondale before him bush enjoyed exceptional 
privileges for a vice president he had an office in the west wing 
not far from the oval office and unfettered access to reagan 
he attended daily intelligence briefings with the president and 
met with him privately once a week over lunch usually for tacos on 
thursday the papers that went to reagans desk also crossed bushs 
the vice president served as a member of the national security 
council he headed a crisis management team for reagan he attended 
cabinet and subcabinet meetings 
yet his role in each position is largely a mystery 
participants at cabinet meetings say the vice president rarely 
spoke and when he did only to ask questions 
bush and reagan have refused to disclose the nature of their 
discussions or say what advice the vice president offered on any 
subject including the embarrassing irancontra affair that wounded 
reagans presidency 
theres a lot of secrecy there barber said the things he 
could have done were inside baseball but theres no evidence 
that he acted as secretary of state george shultz or 
thendefense secretary caspar weinberger during the irancontra 
affair and told reagan youre playing the fool mr 
president 
a close observer of the inner workings at the white house 
former communications chief tom griscom said bush was kind of a 
sounding board for reagan and didnt go out and say hey 
guess what i told the president today 
reagan called him an executive vice president he reagan 
really turned to him for his advice and counsel and understood that 
george was a team player griscom recalled ultimately when 
its all said and done a vice president is going to give his 
input but it is up to the president to decide what it is he is 
going to do 
griscom said i dont think ronald reagan and george bush had 
major policy disagreements i think president reagans footprints 
have george bushs footprints alongside them or inside them 
from reagan himself comes this assessment george played a 
major role in everything that we have accomplished in these eight 
years 
white house aides privately credit bush with encouraging reagan 
to make overtures to the soviet union and to withdraw us marines 
from beirut after the 1983 bombing that killed 241 american 
military personnel 
they say bush was a persuasive voice within the administration 
for preserving tax breaks for the oil industry acting at reagans 
behest bush delivered a warning in el salvador that helped curb 
violence by rightwing death squads 
r gordon hoxie president of the center for the study of the 
presidency says bush has quietly done as much or more than any 
of his predecessors i compare him in his foreign policy expertise 
with nixon 
speaking of bush hoxie said people say all he has is a 
resume well you can laugh at it but there it is its a resume 
in which he did well in all these positions 
william schneider a political analyst at the american 
enterprise institute a conservative think tank offers a different 
view of bush 
i give him lots of points for loyalty and very few points for 
judgment schneider said 
there is no evidence that he turned the president around on 
any issue and on the one issue where he definitely should have 
exercised some judgment the irancontra affair he did not serve 
the president well he should have been the guy who said mr 
president this is a terrible idea theres no evidence he did 
that which is a major failing 
in two areas where bush played visible roles the campaigns 
against drug trafficking and terrorism schneider said theres 
not much evidence he did much in either area there was a lot of 
noise and smoke but the results arent very dramatic

bush came to the white house with a background as a texas 
oilman congressman un ambassador republican party chairman 
envoy to china and cia director 
over eight years reagan entrusted bush with several 
highprofile assignments 
at the republican national convention in august reagan cited 
bush for two achievements leading a task force to reduce excessive 
government regulations and red tape and traveling to europe in 
1983 on a mission to persuade nato leaders to deploy pershing 
missiles 
the deployment of the pershings agreed to during the carter 
administration and executed during the reagan administration is 
usually regarded as the crucial factor in the series of events that 
led to the landmark 1987 agreement between the united states and 
soviet union to abolish intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
the regulatory task forces recommendations resulted in a sharp 
cutback in the growth rate of new regulations and the weakening of 
many existing rules resulting in what the administration says is a 
more productive and efficient economy 
reagan boasts that the paperwork burden imposed by government on 
citizens businesses and other levels of government has been 
reduced by 600 million manhours a year 
overall the administration estimates the savings in regulatory 
costs will total 150 billion by 1993 
critics argue that the savings are exaggerated 
michael fix senior research associate for the urban institute 
said the administration overstates the savings by onethird to 
onehalf because the panel takes credit for achievements that 
belong to others or because regulatory costs sometimes were merely 
shifted from one group to another 
for example fix said the task force claimed consumers saved 3 
billion when the government cut in half the 5mph bumper collision 
standard for automobiles 
although the material costs for bumpers was lower and fuel 
consumption was reduced by using lighter bumpers fix said we 
contend that consumers paid higher insurance costs as a result 
others charge that bushs task force also endangered americans 
by weakening or eliminating safety regulations 
in only eight years george bush has undermined a system of 
health and safety standards that has taken america over 80 years to 
achieve said joan claybrook president of public citizen a 
consumer group founded by ralph nader 
public citizen charges that bushs group was responsible for 
eliminating or obstructing 20 lifesaving safety standards 
among them was a proposal to relax or rescind the program to reduce 
lead in gasoline lead the chief source of a poison that stunts 
mental and physical growth of children and can raise blood pressure 
in adults the proposal eventually was dropped after protests from 
the medical community and the environmental protection agency 
public citizen says that 40000 deaths and 1 million injuries 
can be tied directly to a decision by bushs task force in 1981 
to revoke a rule requiring installation of air bags and automatic 
safety belts in cars 
insurance and consumer groups challenged the revocation in 
court as a result the standard was reissued in july 1984 to be 
fully effective in 1990 
on another front reagan named bush to lead the battle against 
illegal drugs as head of the south florida task force and later the 
national narcotics border interdiction system his mission was to 
coordinate the strategies and resources of government agencies 
against drug smugglers 
the administration says the budget for combating drug 
trafficking has tripled to 35 billion and reagan says 4000 new 
drug enforcement agents and prosecutors have been hired 
in his most optimistic assessment the president said this year 
that the tide of the battle has turned and were beginning to win 
the crusade for a drugfree america yet the same day reagan made 
that statement his wife nancy declared that drugs are tearing 
our community apart 
bushs running mate indiana sen dan quayle recently 
acknowledged he wasnt even aware of bushs role in the drug fight 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotic abuse and control said im not surprised 
that dan quayle didnt know that george bush was in charge of 
protecting the borders the american people didnt know either it 
is no record to be proud of since drugs have tripled coming across 
our borders in the time george bush has been in charge of them 
rangel said bush had requested no additional resources 
offered no creative new ideas and generally personally was 
ineffective on the issue as drugs poured in over the borders and 
deaths and overdoses mounted 
the vice president also was chief of a task force on terrorism 
that in february 1986 recommended the united states refuse to grant 
concessions to terrorists 
at that point the administration already was involved in 
shipping antitank and antiaircraft missiles to iran in the hope 
of winning the release of american hostages the shipments 
continued long after bushs report was published 
in the vice presidents office the irreverent motto of his 
staff the past eight years has been you die we fly indeed 
among bushs official visits to 76 countries have been three trips 
to moscow for the funerals of soviet leaders leonid brezhnev yuri 
andropov and konstantin chernenko 
bushs staff says that even the funeral trips have deepened the 
vice presidents experience he was the first highlevel us 
official to meet with mikhail s gorbachev before he became the top 
soviet leader 
you can set the tone for your relationship in your first 
meeting said bush press secretary steve hart you can bring 
back some intelligence you can go to a funeral but theres a lot 
more that happens youre generally meeting with the new head of 
government 
richard viguerie the conservative directmail leader has been 
one of bushs toughest and most persistent critics but hes 
softening as election day approaches 
in 20 years i havent said three nice things about george but 
im trying hard viguerie said 
i think hes been good for ronald reagan he said ronald 
reagan never wanted to implement the conservative agenda so from 
that standpoint he bush was an effective vice president for the 
republican establishment he advanced the causes of the eastern 
republican establishment

in the festive season between thanksgiving 
and christmas of 1978 two little girls were born within three days 
of each other in hardee memorial hospital 
one girl was an only child she grew up strong doing the things 
she loved like roller skating and swimming but another side of her 
life was tragic her mother died of cancer when she was only 3 
and five years later her stepmother left after divorcing her 
father 
the other girl grew up with a faint heart in and out of 
hospitals unable to run like the rest of the kids instead turning 
to the piano dressing up and daydreaming of becoming a model she 
had seven sisters and brothers 
the sick girl arlena twigg died too young at age 9 a smile 
on her face fighting valiantly to survive the heart that was 
defective 
now a decade after the girls were born comes a startling 
revelation along with allegations and intrigue that have turned 
the lives of their families upside down 
arlena twiggs parents say they learned shortly before her death 
two months ago that she was not their daughter by birth blood and 
genetic testing required for surgery confirmed it 
they allege the hospital deliberately swapped babies on them 
that their real child is healthy 
they think they know who she is 
at issue are the credibility and the motives of the two 
families strangers to each other the mystery of who the real 
arlena twigg is and on a broader scale the ethics and morality 
of pursuing the search 
arlena died without knowing the dark secret the other girl 
lives in a apartment complex in sarasota fla sheltered from the 
turmoil swirling around her and like arlena not knowing she is 
suspect 
her father lives in fear that someone will walk up to her and 
say something he came outside and talked to an associated press 
reporter who knocked on his door he asked that his daughters name 
be withheld 
regina and ernest twigg have filed a 100 million lawsuit 
against the 50bed hospital three doctors and a nurse charging 
they negligently and willfully switched their baby with the sick 
child and altered arlena twiggs medical birth records to cover 
their deception 
if the babies were deliberately switched what was the motive 
thats a good question i dont know said the couples 
lawyer william post 
the defendants deny the charges and one of their attorneys 
called the allegations groundless and irresponsible 
theyre all too real for the twiggs who moved from florida to 
langhorne pa near philadelphia about a year ago to be closer to 
a hospital that specializes in the treatment of cases like arlenas 
when you lose one that you love as dearly as arlena said 
mrs twigg her voice breaking into sobs you look at a little 
girl and you see one with long dark hair and you grieve you wonder 
about the birth baby and what she would look like does she have 
reddish blonde hair like one of my other children does she have 
brownish hair whats her little personality like 
her obsession led investigators using public records to the 
9yearold blondehaired blueeyed girl in sarasota who the 
twiggs attorneys suspect is the real daughter 
mrs twigg is driven by memories of her own adoption when she 
was 9 that separated her from a younger sister she hasnt seen 
since 
the twiggs lost another daughter vivia grace who died in 1975 
when she was 7 weeks old also of heart disease and on the same 
date arlena died three years later aug 23 
this little sister im talking about its like losing the 
original baby we grieve over having lost a child that belonged to 
us as i grieved as i grew up mrs twigg said 
the twiggs attorneys are seeking to have the sarasota girl and 
her father genetically tested at the johns hopkins medical 
institutions in baltimore where arlena underwent a battery of 25 
tests that showed her not to be their biological daughter 
the odds that the tests were wrong are 300millionto1 said 
phil kibak a spokesman for johns hopkins 
why should i asked the father in sarasota a 43yearold 
salesman i am positive this is our daughter im not going to 
put my daughter through something like this based on suspicion 
shes happy and very welladjusted i do not intend to let 
anyone interfere in her life all im doing is protecting her from 
finding out about this 
he said of the twiggs they need to quit worrying about how 
they feel and start thinking about how the child feels 
daniel callahan an expert on medical ethics who is director of 
the hastings center in briarcliff manor ny agrees 
i dont think there are any clearcut rights involved here 
he said adding he did not see a clear moral obligation for the 
sarasota father to have his daughter tested 
at this point the burden of proof is very much on the others 
to show that he isnt the father no one should be asked to 
take such a test unless theres awfully good reason to doubt the 
situation 
callahan says the case creates a genuine moral dilemma 
if the child is happy with the father comfortable in this 
identity callahan said for mrs twigg to come in and create 
what would be an enormous amount of unhappiness in a lot of lives 
including probably the daughter she should think very carefully 
about the implications 
if she might be the mother her main obligation is to ask 
whats going to be best for my daughter and what might be best 
for her daughter might not be best for the mother 
mrs twigg says people have asked them point blank whether they 
would take the little girl in sarasota away 
we have no intentions of wanting to frighten this child we do 
not intend to just run down there and grab her right out of there 
kicking and screaming is it really fair for her to go through the 
rest of her life thinking that her mother is dead is it fair to 
me there has to come into the picture some kind of an emotional 
balance between ourselves and the ones who shes been living with

dale swope one of the attorneys for the sarasota father says 
arlena twigg was taken to two other hospitals within days of her 
discharge from hardee memorial for studies of the congenital heart 
disease that left her blood starving for oxygen 
swope said these were larger hospitals that did not necessarily 
have the same precautions for identifying babies and the risk of a 
mistake would be higher in them than at hardee 
further mrs twiggs credibility has been challenged by 
accounts from three people in florida who were quoted in the 
orlando sentinel as saying that she told them as far back as 1985 
that arlenas blood type differed from that of her parents and 
mentioned the possibility of a baby switch 
both mrs twigg and her attorney post said the first 
confirmation came when the twiggs received the genetic test results 
from johns hopkins 
but mrs twigg recalled that on the second day in the hospital 
when a nurse brought arlena in she had a darker complexion and the 
mother remarked this doesnt look like the same baby she 
quoted the nurse as saying oh yes this is your child why 
wouldnt it be she has your band 
i thought well maybe its a mothers imagination maybe its 
me said mrs twigg then we just totally accepted it and after 
that we were not questioning never at all until may until we got 
the results of the blood test 
post acknowledged that mrs twigg may have discussed the 
differences in blood types in 1985 wondering how arlenas could be 
bpositive when the twiggs had otype bood 
she was searching for an answer the lawyer said it was 
suggested to her whoever she talked to that possibly the 
medication gave a false reading she came to believe it was a false 
reading she never went to any testing facility to substantiate the 
fact because arlena didnt need surgery then 
mrs twigg told the st petersburg times that she withheld the 
information from her husband three years ago because she feared he 
might think she had been unfaithful even though she hadnt 
her husband said that as far back as last february and march he 
still believed erroneously that arlenas blood type was opositive 
as her birth certificate showed even then he was lining up donors 
among workers at amtrak in fort washington pa where he is a 
reservation clerk 
exactly when mrs twigg knew of the alleged switch has become a 
factor in the twiggs malpractice suit 
florida law generally imposes a statute of limitations of two 
years from the date the wrong is found out arguing that that 
deadline has passed some of the defendants have asked that the 
suit be dismissed 
as the case drags on in the courts fixed in mrs twiggs mind 
are her last moments with arlena just after surgery had restored 
the pink to her lips 
her color was perfect recalled mrs twigg i said 
honey you look so pretty all those boys up on that floor are 
going to be just crazy about you she gave me a smile that will be 
with me until the day i die

the controversy over who was first to reach 
the north pole erupted even before adm robert e peary returned 
from his famous 1909 trek and the only person who really knows the 
answer has been dead for nearly 70 years 
but that hasnt discouraged periodic waves of speculation the 
most recent touched off last week by baltimore historian and 
astronomer dennis rawlins 
he was the finest of the us polar explorers and hell also 
have the credit of the most successful scientific hoax of this 
century i think thats terrific for one man to pull off rawlins 
said of pearys expedition 
according to rawlins notes kept by peary show the explorer 
claimed to be the first person to reach the north pole even though 
he knew he hadnt come closer than 121 miles 
my reaction is primarily one of deja vu this has been going 
on now since 1909 and his observations at the pole have been 
studied and restudied and analyzed and reanalyzed over and over 
responded edward peary stafford grandson of the explorer 
what is implied here is that a man who was an officer in the 
armed services of the united states a commander in the navy of 
unwavering integrity suddenly at age 53 changed his spots and 
became a crook said stafford 
i dont think youll ever convince anybody in the peary family 
that that man was not where he said he was when he said he was 
there and that that point was not the north pole of the earth 
he concluded 
my estimate is that we will never know conclusively whether 
peary actually stood at the pole or not said philip lundeberg 
curator emeritus at the smithsonian institutions museum of 
american history 
in terms of the history of exploration these were major feats 
of exploration at the time and they were accepted at the time 
my opinion is that these are culturally with us as achievements of 
exploration we cant disprove them in terms of artifacts 
lundeberg said 
peary wasnt even back from the trip when the first dispute 
erupted explorer frederick cook had reported reaching the pole 
ahead of peary 
i would say there had been considerable doubt raised all the 
way back to the original cook controversy various societies the 
national geographic society and so forth bought the peary 
report said lundeberg 
cooks claims were eventually rejected being termed a type of 
circumstantial fiction by the late arctic explorer vilhjalmur 
stefansson but they forced peary into a battle to defend his own 
effort 
and the resulting confusion found its way to the halls of 
congress and produced lingering doubts that refuse to be put to 
rest 
even the staid national geographic society an early and fervent 
supporter of peary published an extensive study in september that 
perpetuates the questions 
whether he actually got to the pole or not i dont think 
should detract from his bravery and spirit and his desire to make a 
lasting contribution to the people of this earth said william r 
anderson who commanded the nautilus the first submarine to sail 
beneath the ice at the pole in 1958 
having dealt with the ice pack to a certain extent he had 
a very tough undertaking if he didnt get to the pole it wouldnt 
surprise me an awful lot it really is a tough thing to do with 
what he had to do it with said anderson 
ralph plaisteds 1968 snowmobile trip to the pole would make him 
the first person to reach the spot overland if peary failed to get 
there 
and plaisted of wyoming minn said he has suspected pearys 
claims for years 
youve got to picture this man hes got frozen feet a few 
of his toes are missing and hes 54 years old the man got up 
there and he knew it was his last trip and he probably thought 
why not plaisted said 
i dont blame peary i blame people like the national 
geographic and the new york times who were supposed to investigate 
this plaisted added 
will steger who reached the north pole two years ago is 
skeptical however of the evidence being used to discredit peary 
steger said he is suspicious of the new reports but added 
its his last crack at the pole everythings on the line hes 
freezing in an igloo doesnt have any toes hes totally 
exhausted did he really think he was there or did he make it up 
that well never know 
key to the lingering debate is the fact that pearys arrival at 
the pole or his northernmost point if it wasnt the pole was 
witnessed by four eskimos and his aide matthew henson but no one 
trained to independently calculate the exact location 
in the crossexamination he was subjected to later peary was 
criticized for having no man with him who could vouch for his solar 
observations confirming the latitude pearys answer was that he 
wasnt about to share the glory with someone who had not earned the 
right to be there as he had and there was no one in his view 
wrote barry lopez in his book arctic dreams 
the notes taken by peary himself to support his location can be 
interpreted in more than one way by professional astronomers and 
navigators peary the only person who could fully explain the 
notes he kept died in 1920 
as to whether or not peary reached the north pole the answer 
by nature of the subjective elements within it can never be 
anything more than probability concluded wally herbert an 
arctic explorer asked by the national geographic society to study 
pearys notes 
the admirals diary lacks essential data that a modern 
researcher could use to determine the exact location hebert 
reported and any one of several possible errors could have led the 
explorer in the wrong direction indeed a 10 minute error in his 
watch which he was unaware of at the time might have placed him 
18 miles away from the pole herbert concluded 
herbert concluded that although peary crisscrossed the area to 
make sure he passed over the pole he could well have missed the 
spot by 30 to 60 miles

the drought was the last thing north dakotas 
public schools needed long renowned for aboveaverage test scores 
and graduation rates the schools are sinking into a worsening 
financial crisis that began when oil and farm prices slumped six 
years ago educators now fear the states economic woes will speed 
the departure of two of its most precious resources its teachers 
and its children 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the drought that laid waste millions of 
acres of wheat and grazing land across the midwest now threatens to 
create a new victim north dakotas already hardpressed schools 
few states are suffering more acutely from the drought than 
north dakota whose highly regarded schools were already reeling 
from a prolonged slump in crop and energy prices droughtaffected 
states like illinois oklahoma and nebraska have cut or frozen 
education spending this year but north dakotas current state 
appropriation of 3464 million is fully 42 million less than it 
spent on public schools seven years ago 
how serious is the drought for our schools on a scale of one 
to 10 it is about an eight its very serious it wouldnt have 
been so serious if we hadnt been struggling for the last six years 
with the oil problem said gov george sinner 
the drought has so far cost this economically depressed state 2 
billion a 10 percent drop in the states gross product sinner 
said in an interview at a time when the push for school reform was 
prompting many states to boost spending sinner this fall had to 
cut school aid 2 percent or 9 million the fourth education cut 
in north dakota in as many years 
the latest cut means state aid dropped by 52 per pupil 
spending per pupil is 3481 31st in the nation six years ago 
the state ranked 23rd 
teacher salaries average 21660 47th in the nation six years 
ago they ranked 30th 
yet in many ways the crisis is paradoxical north dakotans from 
the governor on down tend to regard public schools for all their 
apparent troubles as a comparative bright spot in the states 
picture 
the states 118000 students generally score well in tests of 
basic skills ninety percent graduate from high school the third 
best rate in the nation although educators concede thats at least 
partly because school is the only game in town for rural 
youngsters especially in hard times 
a statewide poll last september by the university of north 
dakota found that 41 percent of respondents think schools have 
improved from five years ago a comparable gallup poll conducted 
nationwide found just 25 percent of respondents felt that way about 
their schools 
demographically the schools have much going for them the state 
has fewer singleparent families than the national average north 
dakotans are ethnically homogeneous the state has a long ardent 
tradition of support for public education 
many here refer glowingly to the prairie ethic the 
toughness of the early german and scandinavian settlers who a 
century ago turned this harsh land into the nations leading wheat 
producer 
yet that very ethic may be making north dakotans slow to react 
to the schools crisis educators fear there is practically no 
chance for new state taxes this year to bail out schools said 
state senator bonnie heinrich a member of the legislatures 
education finance committee 
the prairie ethic is a doubleedged sword because weve got to 
change we cant just ask how did our ancestors tough it out 
before said david smette superintendent of the dickinson school 
district located in the western section of the state hardest hit 
by the agricultural and energy slumps 
the biggest fear is that the drought will hasten the already 
pronounced exodus of teachers and young people north dakota has 
become a favorite recruiting ground for teachers especially for 
districts in texas california and arizona that promise higher 
salaries and appealing lifestyles said peg portscheller president 
of the north dakota education association 
right now the talk among teachers of leaving is more than at 
any time ive ever heard said james peters a guidance counselor 
at dickinson high school 
seventy percent of young north dakotans are leaving the state 
after finishing school said portscheller in the most depressed 
places like dickinson its worse a visitor asked 50 high school 
seniors at dickinson high if they would stay in the state one said 
he would 
i dont think there are a lot of job opportunities here 
said nicole fruh 17 who plans to attend the university of 
minnesota at morris next year 
nancy johnson president of dickinsons board of education 
said ive got a brother in denver a brother in minneapolis my 
sister left for oregon to look for work another sisters in new 
jersey and my folks are in arizona i wouldnt be surprised if my 
three kids leave someday thats the story of north dakota 
leaving the state is not necessarily what kids want but were 
not giving them the opportunity to dream to explore to build 
said portscheller 
north dakota ranks 50th in the number of students enrolled in 
advanced placement high school classes many schools lack art 
programs and offer little or no advanced math or science only 19 
percent of high school students take a foreign language compared 
with a third of high schoolers nationwide 
in north dakota reform isnt on the backburner it isnt even 
on the stove said portscheller 
most people in this state think schools are ok but educators 
generally agree that were in a state of crisis weve put children 
on hold she said we do a good job with basic skills but 
if you look beyond the basics like problem solving and the ability 
to make good decisions im not sure were cutting the mustard 
in dickinson where teachers and administrators have already 
been laid off there is talk of eliminating entire programs if the 
economy doesnt improve 
science labs at dickinson high are short of specimens 
microscopes and other equipment the elementary school has no 
central library and just one instructional computer 
the dickinson district cut 12 million from its budget in the 
last two years the current 98 million budget includes a 500000 
deficit that will almost certainly lead to more cuts and possibly 
layoffs 
as area oil jobs have disappeared and farm prices have dropped 
land values have declined and school budgets heavily dependent on 
property taxes have suffered accordingly dickinsons property tax 
valuations have dropped from a high of 24 million in 1984 to a 
current 17 million local real estate agent robert karn said homes 
that sold for 68000 four years ago now go for 32000 
for many small districts the drought may prove the last straw 
before consolidation a dreaded step in isolated towns where 
having a school is what keeps them on the map but many such 
districts barely meet minimum standards according to a report on 
north dakota school problems issued last january 
state sen heinrich sighed when asked about the future of north 
dakota schools 
theres always hope she said if the feds come up with a 
great drought program if we can get some light industry if opec 
lets oil prices go up a bit and if it would rain

china will freeze or impose ceilings on the 
prices of a wide range of goods in an effort to curb rising 
inflation the official xinhua news agency reported late thursday 
it was the first government indication that it will actually 
roll back price reforms rather than merely halting them as 
previously announced 
the situation in the last month shows that the prices of some 
commodities havent yet been reined in xinhua quoted cheng 
zhiping director of the state administration of commodity prices 
as saying 
he said the government will establish national price ceilings 
for important means of production and freeze the prices of 
daily necessities that previously were decontrolled xinhua 
didnt list the affected items 
price ceilings will be set for grain now sold on the free 
market and the prices of chemical fertilizer pesticides and other 
agricultural inputs will be regulated xinhua quoted cheng as 
saying 
cheng spoke two weeks after the ruling communist party ordered a 
twoyear effort to control inflation officially estimated at about 
20 percent but believed to be much higher 
the party called for steps to end hoarding profiteering and 
loose credit that have fueled inflation and for a cutback in 
industrial growth that has strained the countrys weak 
infrastructure 
premier li peng on tuesday ordered the state council chinas 
cabinet to put the new austerity policy into effect

the nations merchandise trade deficit surged 
to 1218 billion in august as a record flood of imported products 
swamped a continued boom in exports the government reports

more companies systematically track their 
competitors to avoid surprises and identify threats to their own 
business operations according to a study by the conference board 
the businessfunded research organization said the study 
released thursday which covered 315 companies in a range of 
industries showed that monitoring competitors is considered very 
important by 59 percent of top management and 68 percent of 
middle management 
an unspecified majority of these managers believe competitive 
intelligence in their companies will expand further in the future 
the conference board said in a news release about the study 
the practice of tracking competitors and predicting their 
movements is gaining attention and support in many companies 
howard sutton a conference board marketing specialist and study 
author said in the release a major reason is that competitive 
intelligence can help shape corporate strategy 
the most valuable intelligence concerns pricing strategy and 
sales and the most useful providers of the information are a 
companys own sales people followed by customers and industry 
publications the study showed 
it listed these objectives behind most corporate competitive 
intelligence efforts avoiding surproses identifying threats and 
opportunities gaining competitive advantages by decreasing 
reaction time improving planning and understanding their own 
companies better 
the study listed several companies by name that conduct 
corporate intelligence programs including american telephone amp 
telegraph co motorola inc pfizer inc and combustion 
engineering inc 
it said motorola hired a former cia agent to run its 
intelligence gathering operation others have utilized strategies 
that range from telephone hotlines to electronic mail that 
accelerates the delivery of competitive information from a sales 
force 
the study also noted that such efforts often confront obvious 
legal and ethical issues it provided this advice to wouldbe

upjohn co is targeting physicians with the 
initial promotional campaign for its antibaldness medication 
rogaine which the company says is now stocked in pharmacies and 
ready for sale 
after upjohn salesmen tell dermatologists and other doctors 
about the minoxidil preparation a television ad campaign will tell 
the public that rogaine is available lawrence c hoff president 
and chief operating officer told a news conference thursday 
how many people will consider the benefits worth the nearly 
50amonth cost of rogaine treatment is unpredictable hoff said 
dr robert l rietschel associate chairman of the ochsner 
clinic in new orleans one of 27 minoxidil test sites reviewed 
research in which rogaine produced healthy hair regrowth on the 
crown of the head with little effect on frontal baldness in 40 
percent of the men tested 
the rest experienced no hair growth or only modest results 
although a 40 percent success rate was considered a big gain in an 
area where all other remedies have failed 
rogain must be applied twice a day and once use stops new hair 
growth is lost 
upjohn said men over 49 and those with large areas of baldness 
were excluded from its tests because rogaine was not expected to 
work for those groups 
the companys television advertising will not mention rogaine by 
name but will announce the availability of minoxidil as a baldness 
treatment and urge people to ask their doctors hoff said 
he said pharmacies are stocked with the medication and upjohn 
salesmen have been promoting the product in visits to doctors since 
last week 
rogaine already is marketed in 46 other countries it was 
cleared by the food and drug administration for us marketing in 
august 
upjohn has filed two recent lawsuits as part of an effort to 
defend its research and development investment in minoxidil hoff 
said 
the suits were filed wednesday in us district courts in reno 
nev against california pacific research maker of new generation 
and in las vegas against pantron maker of helsinki formula 
claiming they violate federal prohibitions against false 
representation of products 
hoff said there was no evidence that polysorbate the active 
ingredient in both products causes hair growth or slows hair loss 
as the companies advertise in hourlong television promotions 
california pacific research issued a statement thursday 
defending its claim that new generation decreases hair loss and in 
many cases promotes hair growth it attributed the lawsuit to 
efforts by upjohn to promote rogaine 
a pantron spokeswoman had no immediate comment 
upjohn previously has sued other companies for importing 
minoxidil for use as a baldness treatment in violation of upjohns 
patent hoff said it had reached settlements in 14 cases so far 
hoff cited wall street analysts estimates for rogaine sales 
varying from 100 million or less to more than 500 million in the 
first year but he declined to offer his own forecast 
david bartash an analyst with the investment firm dean witter 
reynolds said he expected at least 300 million in sales in the 
first year 
stephen buermann of merrill lynch research predicted sales of 
700 million to 1 billion after several years 
upjohn has priced a 60milliliter bottle of rogaine a months 
supply at 4250 pharmacy chains are advertising prices from 43 
to 49 for that amount hoff said 
there are certainly a lot of people for whom the prospect of 
thicker hair is very enticing and for whom the 50 a month price 
they are going to have to pay for it is perfectly reasonable 
bartash said 
but he said the market is unusual and unpredictable because 
sales will result mainly from people asking physicians to prescribe 
the drug rather than doctors ordering its use 
there has never been a prescription cosmetic before bartash 
said

the bitter lengthy and unsuccessful 
strikes by 2300 workers at international paper co mills in three 
states were doomed from the start because of the companys 
financial strength and its access to an alternative labor supply 
according to some labor experts and analysts 
it seemed quite clear that ip had decided not to crumble and 
give in to union demands during the 16month strike said charles 
craypo chairman of the economics department at the university of 
notre dame 
now he says the paper union is in trouble 
the united paperworkers international union and the 
international brotherhood of firemen and oilers abruptly called off 
strikes against the worlds biggest paper company on monday at 
mills in jay and in wisconsin and pennsylvania 
union leaders cited a desire to give strikers an opportunity to 
return to the mills where the average annual salary had been 
37000 before the strike 
the end came as the unions faced the prospect of losing its 
strike benefits the paperworkers union faced decertification 
elections and support lacked for expansion of the strike to other 
ip mills where union members are working without contracts 
the strike over premium pay and work rule concessions could 
have been successful if all ip locals working without contracts 
threatened to walk off the job said ben burdetsky a professor in 
the school of government and business administration at the george 
washington university 
as long as the employer is able to keep running there is 
little impact that a union can have burdetsky said 
the strikes affected only the androscoggin mill in jay and mills 
in de pere wis and lock haven pa more than 1000 workers 
remain locked out at an ip mill in mobile ala 
when other locals failed to join the effort the strikers should 
have realized the company could get along without them craypo 
said from that point on it the strike was foolhardy 
but even with union support across the country the strike still 
likely would have failed because ip kept its mills running with 
hundreds of replacement workers contends michael avakian general 
counsel for the center on national labor policy in north 
springfield va 
they should have known in advance that there is a readily 
available supply of labor in the market he said when the 
unions engage in economic activities they cant have a blind eye 
to the competition for those jobs 
the strikes failure was the latest in a string of union defeats 
that include the failed 198586 meatpackers strike against geo a 
hormel cos flagship plant in austin minn and the reagan 
administrations firing of thousands of striking air traffic 
controllers in 1981 
strikes still can be effective burdetsky said but if you 
cant inflict pain dont strike 
craypo said that given international papers financial strength 
there was little likelihood the strike could have been effective 
international paper with 45500 employees in 33 states and 15 
countries demonstrated it could easily weather the showdown the 
paper company showed a profit for the first nine months of 1988 of 
548 million up 94 percent from 282 million in 1987 revenue rose 
21 percent to 7 billion from 58 billion 
union leaders admit they lost a battle but say it is just one 
small fight in a larger corporate war 
on paper weve lost it but as the ashes sift down therell 
be some hot coals there and we will try to fan them said john 
chouinard a upiu shop steward in jay 
chouinard blamed the unions national leaders for the 
beating the workers took saying they encouraged the strike but 
failed to fully support the effort at the local level 
they pulled the rug out from under us he said 
labor consultant ray rogers who was hired by the unions to 
conduct a corporate campaign against international paper said 
strikers can claim victory for showing solidarity within locals and 
for making unprecendented contacts with 20 other paperworkers 
unions working without contracts at other ip mills

high technology translates into high pay for the 
industrys top executives according to a magazines new survey of 
the top 100 salaries in the business 
the 100 highest paid executives in us hightechnology 
companies earned an average of 785000 last year and 17 were paid 
more than 1 million according to a report this week by electronic 
business magazine 
topping the list is john sculley chief executive officer of 
apple computer whose 1987 cash compensation was 214 million 
the figures in the survey were compiled largely from proxy 
statements they include salaries and cash bonuses but do not 
include perquisities or stock options which in many cases equal or 
exceed the executives cash compensation 
the 785000 average pay was up 235 percent from 1986 when the 
top 100 earned an average of 633000 
the increase partly reflects a good year for the industry which 
saw sales at the top 200 electronics companies rise 74 percent and 
profits soar 536 percent said linda b stallmann senior editor 
of the magazine 
but she said the october 1987 stock market crash and changes 
in income tax laws also helped drive up cash compensation 
executives are preferring cash because sometimes the stock 
options arent as valuable as they used to be and the new tax laws 
have reduced the value of perquisites like houses or cars 
stallmann said 
the magazine also found a sharp increase in the popularity of 
contractual guarantees to compensate top executives in the event 
their companies are taken over by hostile raiders socalled 
golden parachutes 
because of all the mergers and acquisitions the chief 
executives are looking for more security stallmann said

increased steel imports in august boosted 
total shipments for the first eight months of 1988 to 144 million 
tons up 85 percent from the year before according to the 
american iron and steel institute 
exports reached 139000 tons for the highest monthly total since 
september 1982 
the american institute for imported steel which represents 
importers stated thursday that when semifinished imports bound 
for us mills are excluded the eightmonth figure shrinks to 124 
million tons that represents 179 percent of the domestic market 
below the 185 percent target of import quotas the importers 
group said 
steel imports are being restrained at the very moment domestic 
demand and us exports are dramatically expanding said erwin l 
klein president of the importers group and vice chairman of the 
import firm steelinter usa inc 
it isessential us leaders in government and industry 
carefully assess advantages of steel imports in costcutting and 
shortage relief even though american steelmakers now urge 
continuation of quotas klein said in a prepared statement 
the quotas are due to expire in september 1989 and it is 
uncertain whether the next president will renew them 
the figures released by both groups were based on commerce 
department data released thursday 
both organizations reported august imports of 178 million tons 
the importers said the august figure included nearly 185000 
tons of semifinished steel ordered by american mills as a raw 
material for further processing 
the domestic industry association said the august figure was up 
from 16 million tons in july and 158 million tons in august 1987

us automakers posted a 315 percent increase in 
early october car and truck sales this year compared with the same 
period last year when car makers briefly gave up buyer incentives 
you were heading into the nothingness stage last year where 
all the programs were expiring and inventories were getting down to 
a very low level said analyst charles brady of the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co of new york 
now with inventories at an acceptable 60day level their 
comparison looks phenomenal brady said 
during the oct 110 period this year us car makers sold 
278932 cars and light trucks compared with 238707 vehicles 
during the same time last year 
there were eight selling days in the period this year compared 
with nine last year so percentage changes between the two periods 
are based on a daily sales rate 
the early october period was the first sales period of the 1988 
and 1989 model years 
during august and september last year automakers offered buyer 
incentives including cash and lowfinancing rates because many of 
the incentives expired sept 30 some car buyers speeded up their 
purchase plans to meet the deadline 
incentives which have become part of car buying in the united 
states are back on some 1989 models and are continuing to pull 
consumers to dealers 
were going in to the new model year with some incentives 
that arent all that costly just attractive enough to keep the 
consumers coming into the showroom brady said you cant 
expect too much from this 10day period 
this is a time to look at cars rather than buy them 
sales of usmade cars rose 368 percent in early october of 
this year compared to the same period last year going to 183652 
cars from 151043 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc said 
because of accelerated buying plans last september it is tough to 
spot a yeartoyear sales trend 
but heaney said some of the big increase can be attributed to 
incentives automakers put on some cars shortly after the 1989 model 
year began two weeks ago 
ford motor co showed the largest increase among us 
automakers with its car sales jumping 70 percent to 58407 this 
year from 38662 in the same period last year light truck sales 
for ford increased 231 percent on a daily basis to 33574 in 1988 
from 30681 the year before 
general motors corp showed a 317 percent rise in daily sales 
to 90183 cars in early october this year from 77032 cars during 
the yearearlier period gms light truck sales rose 293 percent 
in the oct 110 period this year to 41010 vehicles from 35693 
last year 
chrysler corps usmade car sales rose 118 percent on a 
daily basis to 24566 vehicles in early october compared with 
24714 cars during the same period last year its light trucks

unfriendly advances from an investor group 
jerry k pearlman zeniths chairman and president urged 
shareholders in an open letter released thursday not to support a 
drive by brookhurst partners which wants to take over half the 
seats on zeniths board and sell the company 
new yorkbased brookhurst partners an investor group controlled 
by herbert b abelow and nicholas l ihasz has launched its attack 
on management through a consent solicitation which requires the 
votes of 50 percent of all outstanding shares 
brookhurst partners originally said it wanted zenith to get out 
of its consumer electronics business later it said it had found a 
possible buyer for zeniths computer operation now it says it 
wants to arrange a sale of the entire company 
zenith said that with the help of the investment banker lazard 
freres and co it has contacted other consumer electronics 
companies and was considering such steps as joint ventures sharing 
of certain electronics designs licensing zenith technology and 
knowhow and selling other companies products under the zenith 
label 
brookhurst partners took out fullpage newspaper advertisements 
on thursday asking whats wrong with zenith electronics 
corporation and pointing out the companys persistent losses in 
consumer electronics 
it wants to lower the number of zenith directors from 10 to six 
and have three of its own people named to the board that would 
involve dumping seven current directors including pearlman and 
robert b hansen president of the consumer products group 
zenith said brookhurst partners has been trading zenith stock in 
a way that suggests its only goal is shortterm profits it said 
ihasz worked as a trader in the nowdefunct arbitrage firm of 
imprisoned speculator ivan boesky from 1976 to 1980 
they may be experienced in the world of arbitrage and stock 
speculation but we believe they have no experience in any of our 
own businesses zenith spokesman john taylor said

with the bank of tokyo 
takamasa yamasaki of daiwa bank said some investors also began 
buying the dollar for profittaking and the dollar gradually 
recovered

on the tokyo stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average 
which lost 13607 points thursday gained 3327 points or 012 
percent to finish trading at 2730657

remain fairly stable between now and the us presidential 
election on nov 8 provided there werent any major news

senior congressional tax negotiators are 
demanding that the federal government seize 540 acres of the 
northern virginia countryside to block construction of a shopping 
mall on the spot where gen robert e lee led one of the bloodiest 
battles of the civil war 
the negotiators who are seeking compromise on competing house 
and senate versions of a catchall tax bill agreed thursday night 
to include a requirement that the land be annexed into manassas 
national battlefield park 30 miles west of washington 
leaders of the senatehouse conference committee hoping to wrap 
up work on the bill today also agreed thursday to provisions 
imposing limited economic sanctions against iraq in protest of 
that nations use of poison gas against thousands of members of its 
kurdish minority 
the sanctions would prohibit export of munitions and 
hightechnology equipment to iraq and require us representatives 
to oppose lending to iraq by the world bank and other international 
organizations if the president has evidence at yearend that the 
use of chemical weapons is continuing he would have to impose 
tougher sanctions that could include a cutoff of importexport 
credit and barring iraqi imports into the united states 
giving freelance writers photographers and artists relief from 
a part of the 1986 taxoverhaul law under the new provision they 
could deduct certain expenses of producing a book painting or 
photographs before the works started generating income 
increasing to 3375 cents per mile the mileage allowance 
given rural mail carriers who drive their own cars on their routes 
most people who use their car in business get only 225 cents a 
mile 
removing restrictions on the amount of longterm bonds the 
treasury department may issue at interest rates above 425 percent 
agreements on the provisions were reached by rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee sen max baucus dmont chairman of the senate finance 
revenue subcommittee and the senior republicans on the two 
committees rep bill archer rtexas and sen bob packwood rore 
the agreements are subject to approval by a majority of the 
other negotiators but aides said they expect no problem 
the chief purpose of the differing bills is to fix hundreds of 
errors and ambiguities in the new tax law enacted in 1986 the 
measures have been expanded to carry scores of relatively minor tax 
benefits and the tax increases necessary to pay for them the 
senate version also includes a bill of rights to help taxpayers 
who face enforcement or collections actions by the internal revenue 
service 
we made a lot of progress we are doing very well baucus 
said at the end of thursdays negotiations 
added rostenkowski weve got 7 billion worth of tax 
benefits in the house bill and the senates got 3 billion it 
the final version will be some place in the middle 
the provision requiring the taking of a portion of the site 
where the second battle of manassas was fought in august 1862 was 
added to the tax bill only because sponsors saw no other way of 
getting it enacted into law this year the courts would decide how 
much owners of the land are paid the reagan administration which 
opposes the plan estimates the cost at 50 million 
historians say that is a small price to pay but the 
administration insists the same point could be made by taking only 
80 acres at considerably less cost sen john warner rva 
offered the 80acre provision to the senate but lost when sen dale 
bumpers dark on a 5025 vote won approval to take the full 540 
acres 
warners amendment would have allowed construction of houses and 
some commercial development on the remainder of the plot only a 
mall would have been prohibited 
sixteen thousand troops were killed or wounded during a 48hour 
fight on the site

britains annual inflation rate rose to 59 
percent in september from 57 percent the previous month pushed up 
partly by higher mortgage rates the government announced friday 
the government has increased interest rates significantly in 
recent months to curb inflation which has risen from an annual 
rate of 33 percent in january 
but that action has had the initial effect of boosting the price 
index because of the inclusion of the mortgage rates which stand 
at around 13 percent 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson on thursday reiterated 
interest rates will have to stay high for quite some time in 
order to combat inflation but he said the inflation rate will come 
down next year 
the september rate which was within the financial markets 
expectations also was boosted by a wide range of price increases 
among other goods and services particularly clothing footwear 
household goods and alcoholic drinks the department of employment 
said the price of seasonal foods fell it said 
the departments retail price index rose 05 percent in 
september from august when the index rose 11 percent from the 
previous month 
the index which uses a january 1987 base of 100 stood at 1084 
in september up from 1079 in august and up from 1024 september 
1987

the leader of the american soybean 
association says he has assured european agricultural officials 
this years us soybean crop suffered little damage from the 
drought 
ken bader the trade groups chief executive officer said 
thursday he told european officials including soybean processors 
the drought left only a few beans shriveled and green 
i told them from our estimates this was not a problem any 
longer said bader and at best only 5 percent of our crop was 
impacted 
he also said he assured europeans that the united states will 
have soybeans to exportal though the drought reduced the harvest 
and he urged them to end internal subsidies that hurt us sales 
bader said the high prices guaranteed to farmers in the european 
economic community for their oil seeds make it more attractive to 
grow those crops than to import us soybeans 
bader met with agricultural industry officials at the asas 
annual european outlook conference in london and discussed the 
meeting with reporters in a telephone news conference thursday 
i reassured them that the short supply in us soybeans 
because of the drought did not mean an embargo said bader 
the us department of agriculture has estimated that farmers 
will harvest 15 billion bushels of soybeans this fall down 22 
percent from a year ago 
bader said the united states continues to press the eec on its 
high internal subsidies to farmers who produce oil seed crops like 
sunflowers rapeseed and soybeans 
production of those crops in the eec has increased 400 percent 
since 1981 asa said while the volume of us soybean and meal 
shipments to its member nations has declined 35 percent the value 
of exports to the eec dropped from 35 billion to 2 billion 
between 1982 and 1986 asa said 
bader said the europeans tried to blame increased production in 
south america for the declining us sales 
when their internal oil subsidy scheme is guaranteeing two or 
three times the world price can we look at south america as the 
cause of our problem asked bader 
the association official said he stressed that governments still 
could help farmers but they should do it with payments that do not 
affect the acreage or price of specific crops 
he also said argentina and brazil have stepped up soybean 
production and might try to take advantage of the 1988 drought and 
us bean shortfall as they plant their next crops 
keep your eye on south america as the fall and winter 
progresses said bader it will become a south 
americancontrolled market price 
but analyst bruce henrikson of adams amp associates in champaign 
said there now is some concern about dry conditions in argentina 
and brazil and planting has been delayed 
bader said agricultural products have helped ease the united 
states foreign trade deficit but he was not optimistic about 
soybean exports in the short term 
because of our supply our export figures are going to be 
down he said

japans finance minister changed his earlier 
testimony and said today that 10000 shares of stock in a firm 
involved in an insider trading scandal were purchased in his name 
kiichi miyazawa is the first cabinet member linked directly to 
the scandal over unlisted shares of the real estate firm 
recruitcosmos co that were sold later for large profits after the 
company went public 
i never intended to hide it from the public but i just found 
out about it myself a few days ago miyazawa said in response to 
questions from opposition parties in parliament 
several other senior officials including prime minister noboru 
takeshita have said their aides purchased shares in the company 
without their knowledge 
miyazawa told the diet japans parliament in august that a 
former aide tsuneo hattori bought the stock on his own and did 
not acknowledge any direct involvement 
i conferred with mr hattori recently after the case was 
revealed and learned that he used my name to make things work more 
smoothly miyazawa said he told me that he was asked by his 
friend to lend my name and he responded to the request carelessly 
but miyazawa continued to deny any previous knowledge about the 
dealings and said people including myself and my aides were 
never involved in the dealings themselves 
a number of senior politicians and business leaders reportedly 
obtained unlisted shares of recruitcosmos in 1984 and earned up to 
780000 each in profits by selling them after public trading began 
a short time later the price of the stock nearly quadrupled soon 
after the shares were placed on the overthecounter market 
no criminal charges have been filed against those who bought the 
shares but opposition parties have raised ethical questions about 
the politicians who were involved 
the controversy has highlighted the frequently lucrative ties 
between businessmen and politicians in japan trading on privileged 
information is a widely accepted practice new laws passed since 
the scandal unfolded this summer deal more stringently with insider 
trading but are not retroactive 
the japan communist party on tuesday released a list of nine 
people including miyazawa who allegedly purchased shares in the 
company through dobest inc a financial firm linked to 
recruitcosmos 
the list included aides to prime minister takeshita former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and shintaro abe secretary 
general of the governing liberal democratic party 
takeshita has said a former aide obtained 2000 shares of 
recruitcosmos stock through another firm and sold them shortly 
after public trading began earning a profit of about 31000 
opposition parties fiercely attacked miyazawa today for his 
personal involvement in the stock dealings and his previous 
testimony

despite recent fluctuations the us trade deficit 
is on a downward trend us federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan said friday 
greenspan also said international monetary coordination had not 
changed in recent months and that the major world financial powers 
still hold a policy of currency stability 
greenspan in tokyo for meetings with japanese central bank 
directors and government officials made his comments at a news 
conference against a background of a sharp drop in the exchange 
value of the us dollar this week aggravated by a 
largerthanprojected us trade deficit for august 
the dollar closed in tokyo friday at 12825 yen about 5 yen 
below the level it held most of last week 
greenspan agreed that the 1218 billion august trade deficit 
was higher than most predictions but said it was better to use an 
average of trade figures than one months figure because they are 
by nature highly erratic 
the trade adjustment process seems to be moving appropriately 
that is the trend is clearly downward in the american trade 
deficit he said 
he said he suspected most forecasts of the august deficit were 
too low because oilimport data published earlier by the us 
department of energy were lower than the final statistics causing 
forecasters to underestimate an important sector of the trade 
figures 
asked about international coordination to stabilize exchange 
rates greenspan said the agreements in recent months are 
essentially unchanged 
at meetings in berlin in late september monetary officials made 
no fundamental change in the policy of the seven major industrial 
nations he said we seek stability in exchange rates 
asked whether movements in exchange rates this year have been 
within the limits of stability envisioned by the seven industrial 
powers greenspan replied broadly yes 
the fed chairman declined to answer several questions about 
specifics of exchange rates and about whether more coordinated 
support was needed in view of the dollars slide this week 
asked whether his meetings here had included discussion of 
adding special drawing rights a baskettype international 
currency or the japanese yen as international reserve currencies 
greenspan replied no 
recently there have been some suggestions that the increasingly 
strong yen could become a reserve currency lifting some of the 
pressure from the us dollar 
greenspan said international holdings of yen are not large and 
there was a tendency for there to be only one major world currency 
although he had meetings thursday and friday with bank of japan 
governor satoshi sumida the japanese central bank declined to 
comment on them 
greenspan also was meeting with finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
friday then returning to the united states on saturday he said

a judge has lifted a restraining order that 
blocked britains grand metropolitan plc from acquiring an interest 
in pillsbury co and blocked pillsbury from taking steps to thwart 
grand mets 52 billion takeover bid 
the lifting of the dayold order on thursday at pillsburys 
request frees the company to make an acquisition or take other 
defensive action 
separately officials of both companies said the securities and 
exchange commission has launched an inquiry into trading of 
pillsbury stock prior to the oct 4 announcement of grand 
metropolitans 60ashare tender offer for the food and restaurant 
giant 
pillsburys trading volume was extremely high and there were 
heavy purchases of options to buy pillsbury shares in the future at 
40 each in the week before the tender offer was announced 
in washington chiles larson the secs deputy director of 
public affairs said he could not confirm or deny the existence of 
any investigation of trading in pillsbury stock 
grand met attorney allen finkelson said the british company 
considers the investigation routine 
pillsbury stock closed at 5725 a share up 37 cents in new 
york stock exchange trading thursday 
on wednesday hennepin county district court judge thomas carey 
issued the order blocking grand met from acquiring any pillsbury 
stock and preventing pillsbury from altering the status quo until 
oct 27 
on that date the judge is to hear further arguments in 
pillsburys lawsuit seeking to block the grand met tender offer on 
the grounds that it violated state statutes that prevent liquor 
distillers from selling liquor in retail outlets 
pillsburys retail liquor outlets include the fullservice 
restaurant chains of steak amp ale and bennigans grand met is 
seeking waivers from the law in minnesota and other states saying 
it will immediately sell pillsburys liquor retail outlets if the 
takeover is successful 
federal securities law already prevents grand met from acquiring 
pillsbury stock until its tender offer expires nov 1 
analysts note that pillsbury is now free to defend itself 
against the bid possible defenses could include selling off its 
restaurants to raise money to go private or taking on additional 
debt 
pillsbury has been fighting the bid but has not yet officially 
rejected the offer under federal securities laws pillsbury has 
until wednesday to respond to the offer 
pillsbury has sued in 14 states to block the tender offer on 
grounds it violates state statutes

a smaller version of hong kongs 
capitalist wonderland has attracted hordes of young people to this 
special economic zone of communist china in search of 
opportunity and a fast buck 
with the influx have come reports of labor strife exploitation 
of child workers prostitution and a plague of beggars in the town 
adjacent to the british crown colony which is to be returned to 
china in 1997 
migrant workers account for about half the 600000 people in the 
border community which in 1979 became chinas first and largest 
testing ground for marketoriented economic reform 
the other special economic zones also in southern china are in 
zhuhai shantou and xiamen 
many shenzhen factories are joint ventures with foreign 
investors and wages generally are much higher than elsewhere in 
china 
zhang ruoyong a 19yearold from shantou about 300 miles 
northeast quit her fourth shenzhen job in weeks because the pay 
was too low even though the monthly wage of 200 yuan 54 a day 
was more than double the average 76 yuan paid elsewhere in china 
i had a job that paid four yuan 108 a day but that was 
too little she said i found another one that paid eight yuan 
but working in an electronics factory was too hard 
beggars have followed the money 
the shenzhen special zone daily newspaper reported in august 
that a professional beggar family from henan province 520 
miles north made enough money to buy a cassette player meals of 
fish and chicken and a regular supply of expensive american 
cigarettes 
it said they arrived two years ago and the four children earned 
up to 200 yuan 54 a day from begging while their father watched 
despite the relatively high pay living conditions usually are 
spartan particularly for unmarried workers in factory dormitories 
a 19yearold who gave only her surname li works at a large 
electronics factory that assigned her to a room of 80 square feet 
with nine other women 
how would i not miss home said miss li a native of hainan 
island 580 miles southwest of shenzhen she added however that 
life in the factory was better than toiling on a rubber plantation 
miss zhang from shantou expressed a sentiment common to most 
migrants the higher pays makes the sacrifices worthwhile 
articles published by the china youth news last summer reported 
21 strikes in shenzhen in 198687 
the paper said workers at a doll factory who normally put in 
six eighthour days a week were forced to work 14hour shifts 
without a day off and one was fired when they went on strike 
workers rarely strike elsewhere in china and seldom are fired 
shenzhen government officials denied the reports of strikes 
they were just minor disputes said zhu wendui deputy 
director of the shenzhen labor bureau sometimes the wages were 
delayed because of a foreign exchange transaction or the workers 
were not accustomed to strict management it is different from 
strikes in the west 
general manager kong qingping of the governmentrun shenzhen 
labor service co which helps factories recruit workers said 
overtime generally is limited to 48 hours a month but added 
the economy is developing so quickly that manufacturers are 
absorbed in increasing production and might overlook the welfare of 
the workers 
china youth news also said more than 1000 rural teenagers 
half of them gradeschool students were recruited from neighboring 
guangxi province to work in sweatshoplike factories run by foreign 
investors 
it said conditions were incredibly bad at a factory making 
silk flowers and 12yearold girls worked 15hour shifts sleeping 
two or three to a bed in a tent serving as a dormitory 
a 16yearold girl showed a reporter a petalshaped mark on her 
hand she said was caused by a burn from a machine the paper 
reported 
kong said authorities began investigating the use of illegal 
child labor in april and 300 children were returned to their 
hometowns it is against the law for shenzhan factories to hire 
workers under 16 but some ignore the rule because children can be 
paid less 
if we find out the employer is hiding the fact we will cancel 
his license kong said in fact most of them laid off child 
workers after we warned them 
chinese news reports claim promiscuity homosexuality and 
prostitution have increased among the estimated 250000 female 
migrant workers who outnumber men 501 in many factories 
one report in the china youth news quoted a police psychologist 
as saying the womens hearts are like kindling wood when they 
meet the fire of love the flames will rage 
in the shekou industrial district of shenzhen the number of 
unwanted pregnancies quadrupled from about 200 in 1985 to 800 in 
1987 the paper said 
wen wei po a probeijing paper in hong kong said 122 
prostitutes were arrested in shenzhen hotels last june it said 
their clients included hong kong businessmen truck drivers 
shenzhen policemen and communist party functionaries 
shenzhen officials declined comment on the report

you dont have to work the land to be 
considered a farmer under iowa law the state attorney generals 
office said friday 
at issue was the legal definition of farming used in state laws 
aimed at preserving family farms 
the general assembly did not impose any requirement in the 
definition of farming which requires actual physical labor in 
performing the various activities which constitute farming wrote 
timothy benton an assistant attorney general the legislature 
has the prerogative of defining its own terms 
lawmakers over the years have carved out a series of protections 
for family farm corporations farmers who incorporate their 
operation and crawford county attorney thomas gustafson wanted to 
know if those who owned such a business actually had to work the 
land to qualify 
state law prohibits corporate ownership of farmland but family 
farm operations are exempt from that ban 
gustafson said the question was sparked by a farm corporation 
which leased farmland on a cropshare basis and the actual 
physical labor on the agricultural land which the corporation owns 
is performed by the tenant 
the opinion said theres nothing in state law banning a family 
farm corporation from leasing its land 
we cannot add such a requirement through the guise of 
statutory construction benton wrote 
benton noted that state law covering farming operations is 
extensive and lawmakers could have easily added a requirement that 
farmers actually work the land but have chosen not to do so 
in the definition of actively engaged in farming there is no 
requirement of actual physical labor on the farm benton wrote 
the definition can be satisfied if the shareholder or officer of 
the corporation either inspects the production activities 
periodically and contributes toward the cost of production or 
takes an important part in farm management decisions or performs 
the actual physical work 
consequently under the lexicon of the general assembly a 
shareholder or officer need not perform actual physical labor to be 
actively engaged in farming the opinion said 
benton noted that lawmakers have debated the issue during the 
past two legislative sessions 
however the general assembly has not chosen to amend the 
provisions involved in your question so we can conclude it has no 
interest in imposing a requirement of actual physical labor in 
these definitions he wrote 
this is consistent with the definition of farming itself 
which as we noted also does not impose such a requirement benton 
wrote in the opinion

the miami news a struggling afternoon newspaper 
will be shut down if no buyer is found by the end of the year cox 
enterprises said today 
the staff of the news was informed of the decision this morning 
in the newsroom 
quite simply the miami news despite an outstanding editorial 
presentation is not supported by advertisers or readers david 
easterly president of the cox newspaper division said in a 
statement released in atlanta 
daily circulation has declined from 112000 in 1966 to below 
48000 today while dade county households have grown by 80 percent 
in the same period this means that the miami news now serves fewer 
than 8 percent of dade county households 
the miami news has had a joint operating agreement with the 
miami herald owned by knightridder inc since 1966 
the herald a morning newspaper with daily circulation of more 
than 400000 is responsible for providing advertising 
circulation production and promotion services to the news 
atlantabased cox owns the newspaper and manages only the editorial 
department of the news 
cox shares in the profits of the miami herald publishing 
company and until last year knightridder had shared in the losses 
at the news 
james c kennedy chairman and chief executive officer of cox 
made the announcement that the news will cease publication if no 
buyer is found by years end 
it is with a deep sense of sorrow and regret that we make this 
announcement kennedy said noting that the news has published 
since 1896 and won five pulitzer prizes 
among its staff is editorial cartoonist don wright a pulitzer 
prize winner whose work is syndicated in newspapers across the 
country 
easterly said that since 1966 knightridder and cox have spent 
more than 90 million in operating the news he said the net cost 
of publishing the news is now running about 9 million annually and 
would be expected to worsen over time 
several years ago cox proposed to knightridder an extension of 
the joint operating agreement kennedy said after numerous 
meetings knightridder and cox entered into an agreement in 
january 1987 which permitted cox to continue sharing in the 
profits of the miami herald at a reduced rate until 2021 
however the new agreement required cox to fund all losses from 
the operation of the news and kennedy said months of study 
determined there was not way to reverse the circulation and 
advertising declines and keep the newspaper alive 
under the new agreement knightridder will pay cox enterprises 
a percentage of the heralds profits based on a sliding scale 
through the year 2021 even if the news ceases publication 
the profit percentage which was 15 percent under the old 
agreement will decline to 10 percent over the next five years and 
will remain at that level until 2021 said easterly 
that means cox could earn 165 million from the herald by 
conservative estimates based on current figures over the next 33 
years easterly said 
the business facts and market conditions in miami have left us 
with only one conclusion that the miami news is not a viable 
general interest newspaper for the future kennedy said

billionaire philip anschutz has completed a 18 
billion acquisition of the southern pacific railroad one of the 
nations oldest rail lines with track stretching from oregon to 
louisiana 
the historic railroad combined with his denver amp rio grande 
railroad puts anschutz at the head of the nations fifthlargest 
rail company in terms of track mileage 
the purchase ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to 
robust competition in the western rail corridors said rio grande 
chariman w j holtman at the deals closing in new york on 
thursday 
this historic combination brings together two railroads which 
hold an important place in the pioneering of the west he noted 
anschutzs new railroad has 15046 miles of track and is ranked 
sixth nationally based on revenues estimated at 25 billion the 
rocky mountain news reported that he paid 102 billion in cash and 
assumed 760 million in debt 
the interstate commerce commission approved the combination in 
august last year the icc rejected a proposal that chicagobased 
santa fe southern pacific corp merge the southern pacific and 
santa fe railroads and ordered the company to divest one of the 
lines 
the company chose to sell the southern pacific but had to 
overcome the objections of another rail company before it could 
proceed southern pacifics stock has been held in a trust for 
nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should 
own the railroad 
anschutz who made his fortune in oil gas and real estate will 
become chairman of southern pacific 
mike mohan now executive vice president of southern pacific 
will become the chief executive of both lines which will operate 
from southern pacifics san francisco headquarters damprg had been 
headquartered in denver 
anschutz has said 400 to 800 jobs will be lost through the 
consolidation of the two companies the cuts likely will be split 
evenly between san francisco and denver 
the two lines will remain separate entities although both will 
be held by rio grande industries inc said anschutzs attorney 
bob starzel 
damprg mainly carries coal on about 2500 miles of track between 
kansas city mo and colorado and utah and rents track to other 
railroads three times a week runs the rio grande zephyr from salt 
lake city to denver 
this creates the only western railroad with two rail 
corridors now southern pacific and rio grande will be in both 
the southern and central corridors starzel said

industries and kendavis holding co for the sale of cummins sales

in 1986

against a projected backdrop of billowy clouds 
and angelic figures an obscure hawaiian minister kicked off an 
annual bankers gathering here with a prayer for stable interest 
rates and economic prosperity 
not a typical invocation from a man of the cloth but serious 
business for those who control much of americas pursestrings and 
face the uncertainty of a new president in the aftermath of black 
monday 
its been a wild and wooly year recalled charles pistor 
outgoing president of the giant american bankers association whose 
term began on black monday despite the stock market drop we 
did make progress in 1988 but there are some things we have not 
seen this year 
a perennial concern is banking reform legislation however that 
seems likely to be overshadowed in the coming year by the mounting 
problems of the federal savings and loan insurance co which 
insures the nations 3200 thifts 
the issue of fslic will be more overriding than banking 
reform pistor chairman of northpark national bank of dallas 
told reporters at the 114th annual aba convention in honolulu this 
past week congress must deal early on with the problem 
at stake is about a quarter of the federally insured sampls which 
are considered at or near insolvency estimates for liquidating or 
bailing them out have ranged from 45 billion to 100 billion far 
too costly for the financially strapped fslic 
bankers worry that the problem may spill over to them since 
congress could consider merging the financially strapped fslic with 
the healthier federal deposit insurance corp which insures the 
nations 14000 commercial banks and some thrifts 
a merger of the two insurance funds which both insure 
individuals deposits of up to 100000 has long been opposed by 
bankers and the fdic itself for one thing they fear a merger 
would drive up the cost of bank insurance premiums which run about 
2 percentage points below what thrifts pay 
bankers also worry that tapping into the fdic may aggravate 
banks own failure problem the fdic says a record number of banks 
will fail this year as many as 250 compared with a record 184 
last year and 19 others that needed federal assistance 
still comptroller of the currency robert l clarke warned 
bankers at their fourday convention that an fslicfdic is a 
distinct possibility and that the industry should take a more 
active role in dealing with the thrift problem or risk being a 
prisoner of events 
merging the fdic insurance fund with the thrift insurance fund 
has a political attractivess that cannot be ignored clarke 
insisted certainly there isnt enough money in the fdic to 
solve the problem but the fund is enough to serve as a significant 
down payment and it is available 
like all the other independent agencies in our government the 
fdic is a creature of congress and what congress gives congress 
can take away 
in an emotional rejoinder though fdic chairman l william 
seidman promised to defend the fund and prevent the problems of 
the sampls from being billed to banks 
he said the fdic plans to complete a study after election day 
that began about eight months ago on possible solutions for the 
thrift crisis 
the aba also has promised to conduct its own studies 
this is a complicated issue we dont know with certainty how 
big this problem is said newly elected aba president thomas r 
rideout vice chairman of first union national bank of north 
carolina debate is just beginning i think aba has been early on 
in shaping public policy 
the aba also promises to keep its hand in shaping banking reform 
legislation before the next congress 
a turf battle between house banking committee chairman fernand 
j st germain dri and house energy and commerce committee 
chairman john dingell dmich quashed a measure that would have

a group of wickes companies inc 
managers on friday withdrew their 598 million buyout offer for the 
home and industrial products company citing deteriorating earnings 
the group led by wickes chairman sanford sigoloff announced 
the decision along with a report that warned the company might lose 
money on continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters and 
the fiscal year 
operating income for the year could be 40 million less than 
what was forecast at the time the buyout offer was made on aug 21 
the company said operating income for august and september was 15 
million below projections the company said 
future earnings are critical to a leveraged buyout transaction 
because the acquiror must rely on cash flow to help repay loans 
used to finance the purchase 
the management group offered to pay 12 for each wickes share in 
a leveraged buyout but the offer included a 60day wait before the 
group could begin buying shares in order to give other bidders a 
chance to surface 
last week as the oct 20 deadline approached the company 
announced that it hadnt received any offers although it had 
discussed selling all or part of the company with a number of 
potential buyers 
wickes is involved in a number of diverse businesses that some 
analysts have said are more attractive individually than as a 
group the companys main businesses include wickes furniture and 
builders emporium doityourself stores in southern california the 
company also manufactures auto fabrics wallpaper carpet and

biotechnology will boost agricultural 
output in the 1990s but the new science will drive a lot of 
farmers out of business says an expert in the field 
michael phillips senior associate for the congressional office 
of technology assessment said the steady decline in the number of 
farmers since the 1930s will increase in the 1990s because of the 
higher investments and keen management skills needed to thrive in 
the biotechnology age 
the early adapters will benefit the most and the laggards will 
be left behind phillips said thursday at a meeting of top farm 
policy and agribusiness leaders at a twoday farm conference ending 
friday 
middlesized farmers fulltime farmers who annually sell less 
than a quarter million dollars worth of crops and livestock will 
feel the biggest squeeze from the gains made in biotechnology 
during the 1990s phillips predicted 
biotechnology is the use of data and techniques of engineering 
and technology to study and solve problems involving living 
organisms 
small farmers with offfarm income can almost ignore the 
revolution phillips said but mediumsized farmers will have to 
scramble to keep up with farmers who will have an easier time 
adopting the new biotechnology processes 
the squeeze on the middlesized farms means that by the year 
2000 86 percent of the nations food will be produced by only 14 
percent of the farmers phillips predicted 
he predicted that the first wave of agricultural biotechnology 
breakthroughs will come in livestock production while most of the 
advances in plant agriculture will not be available to farmers 
until the late 1990s 
walter hobgood jr director of animal nutrition and health for 
monsanto agricultural co said a new hormone which will be 
injected into cows every two weeks to boost milk production could 
be on the market as early as next year and will be adopted by most 
dairy farmers in the next five years 
phillips predicted a genetically engineered hormone that will 
make hogs grow faster and leaner will be approved and ready for 
sale to farmers by about 1995

computers without a big drop in sales of older models analysts 
said 
ibms stock was up 137 a share at 120 in late trading on the 
new york stock exchange 
they earnings were pretty decent said steven cohen an 
analyst for soundview financial group formerly gartner securities 
in stamford conn

more canadians support a free trade agreement 
with the united states but people remain sharply split over the 
dominant issue in the election campaign according to a poll 
published friday 
the poll by the environics research group and the independent 
globe and mail newspaper show 44 percent of canadians support and 
42 percent oppose the agreement signed by president reagan and 
prime minister brian mulroney in january 
support increased by 7 percentage points from the last poll 
conducted in june but opposition also increased by 2 percentage 
points the number of undecided canadians dropped to 14 percent 
the poll was based on 1515 interviews conducted throughout 
canada between oct 2 and 10 the margin of error was 25 percent 
a victory for mulroneys progressive conservative party in the 
nov 21 election would remove any stumbling blocks from 
parliamentary approval of the agreement scheduled to take effect 
jan 1 
both opposing parties the liberals and the socialist new 
democrats say they would tear up the agreement 
the most recent gallup poll taken last week shows the 
conservatives ahead with 43 percent the liberals with 33 percent 
and the new democrats with 22 percent 
an environics poll published tuesday found the conservatives 
ahead with 42 percent of decided voters the new democrats in what 
would be a stunning secondplace finish with 29 percent and the 
liberals trailing with 25 percent 
such an outcome would preserve the conservatives majority in 
the house of commons 
the freetrade deal would eliminate all tariffs between canada 
and the united states and eventually put canadas 26 million people 
in open competition with the 245 million people of its more 
powerful and wealthier southern neighbor 
it would mean the dismantling of a system of high tariffs that 
date back to the 19th century 
opponents charge canadas very existence as a sovereign nation 
could be endangered by the agreement but supporters scoff at that 
idea and say the agreement would ensure future prosperity 
the free trade agreement has raised few hackles in the united 
states where the senate approved it 839 last month at least 70 
percent of the 150 billion in trade each year between the 
countries already is tarifffree

the navy on friday tapped the lockheed corp 
to build a new submarinehunting patrol plane providing the 
california contractor the opportunity to extend a quartercentury 
monopoly on such work 
the initial contract is worth only 200000 the navy said 
friday but a fullscale engineering development contract will be 
awarded after formal review of the program by the department of 
defense the navy said 
ultimately the selection decision could be worth up to 5 
billion since the navy hopes to buy 125 of the new planes 
the navy in a brief statement said lockheed had bested two 
large competitors and been awarded a contract to develop a new 
modernized version of its p3c orion subhunter 
the p3 a military version of lockheeds fourpropeller electra 
passenger airplane of the 1950s has been used by the navy as its 
longrange submarine patrol craft since 1962 
the fourturboprop orion carries a crew of 10 an array of 
sonobuoys and other detection equipment and mk46 torpedoes it 
operates from shore bases and has a range of more than 2700 miles 
despite the planes longevity and various upgrades through the 
decades the navy has been trying to replace the orion for more 
than five years the service argues it needs a more reliable and 
more capable airplane based on the latest technology in order to 
counter soviet gains in submarine warfare 
until last year the navys efforts to start a new program had 
been blocked either by defense department officials or 
congressional leaders mainly on cost grounds 
but the service finally won authorization in 1987 to launch a 
program and solicit bids on an entirely new antisubmarine airplane 
that it designated the lraaca or longrange air antisubmarine 
warfare capability aircraft 
eventually the boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp decided 
to challenge lockheed and submit proposals boeing proposed a 
military derivative of its twinjet 757 transport while mcdonnell 
douglas proposed a derivative of an md87 airliner with a new 
technology engine known as the ultra high bypass unducted fan 
industry officials had said before fridays announcement that 
mcdonnell douglas would have difficulty winning because the new 
propfan engine wasnt expected to be ready early enough to suit the 
navys schedule narrowing the real competition to boeing and 
lockheed 
lockheed which has built more than 500 orions for the navy over 
the years and dozens more for foreign allies responded with what 
it described as a modernized version of the p3 that would be 
equipped with a new more fuel efficient turbo prop engine and 
fivebladed nonmetal propellers 
the new engines built by the general electric co will cut 
fuel consumption by 25 percent lockheed said the company also 
argued that by sticking with the basic p3 the navy could take 
advantage of commonality with the existing p3 support structure 
to reduce program cost 
the navy did not offer any explanation on friday why it selected 
lockheed over boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
the navy did say that lockheed had submitted the lowest bid but 
added it also had considered such factors as lifecycle costs 
compliance with technical requirements and logistic support in 
judging the bids 
the navy said it expected the defense acquisition board to 
review the program in december hopefully clearing the way for 
fullscale development the navy expects the first prototype to fly 
in september 1991 with production deliveries beginning in 1994 
the flyaway cost estimate for each plane is 391 million 
the navy said 
were delighted with the navys selection said jim 
ragsdale a lockheed spokesman in burbank calif 
it represents a program that lockheed has worked very hard to 
win over the past year and it represents an opportunity to 
continue a long history of more than 50 years of pioneering 
maritime patrol aircraft 
despite the navys announcement the future of the new patrol 
aircraft is anything but certain congress still could withhold an 
appropriation to start fullscale production or the navy may have 
to shift its weapon priorities because of expected budget cuts

a group of oil ministers will try 
again this weekend to fashion what has become an everelusive 
strategy to boost sagging oil prices 
sundays meeting here of the gulf cooperation council which 
includes ministers from six persian gulf nations comes amid a 
backdrop of pricewar threats and rollercoaster prices that 
sometimes have dropped as much as 8 below the 18abarrel 
benchmark for crude 
in new york speculation that opec members would agree on 
production cuts sent prices soaring friday in the oil futures 
market 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil shot up 71 cents a barrel to settle at 
1492 on the new york mercantile exchange the contract had 
briefly traded below 1230 a barrel as recently as last week 
within the gcc we must have one strategy one oil policy 
said gcc secretarygeneral abdullah bishara of kuwait 
gcc members include saudi arabia kuwait qatar the united arab 
emirates bahrain and oman with the exception of bahrain and oman 
each nation is a member of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
opec has been trying to reign in production by its 13 member 
states in an effort to boost oil prices 
oil industry executives estimate that during august gcc nations 
along with iran and iraq accounted for 13 million barrels a day of 
opecs 20millionbarrel daily output had the nations adhered to 
their designated opec production quotas the outflow would have 
been 105 million barrels a day 
iraq and iran ignored their opec quotas to finance their 
8yearold war although a ceasefire went into effect aug 20 
both sides have insisted they be allowed to produce as much as 
needed to finance reconstruction 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
gulf states will have to find some way of helping iran and iraq 
otherwise they will just keep producing 
iraq has hinted it will accept an opec production ceiling to 
bolster prices it is producing about 27 million barrels a day 
against a quota of 15 million barrels a day irans output is 
pegged at about 25 million barrels a day slightly above its 
236millionbarrel quota damage to its facilities prevents higher 
output 
within the the gcc the emirates has publicly set its ceiling at 
15 million barrels daily compared to its 948000barrel quota 
oil industry analysts have said kuwait is also above its opec mark 
and saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter and opecs most 
influential member has served notice that it will no longer play 
swing producer by decreasing its own output to balance 
overproduction of others 
the kingdom said this month it had lost 109 billion over the 
years in attempting to shore up prices 
saudi sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer will submit a plan to restore 
balance and stability to the oil market 
the kingdom has stressed it backs opec and is ready to abide by 
quotas if other members do but observers say its threats to 
increase production is a pressure tactic to get others in line 
a western diplomat noted that as long as others are cheating 
on their quotas saudi arabia will too theyre not looking to 
start a price war but they are looking to defend their market 
share 
the day after the saudis oct 3 announcement crude prices 
dropped to a 26month low it takes what the saudis have done to 
get everybody back in line said an industry source here 
in 1983 the saudis cut back their oil production to help 
stabilize prices but lost so much market share that two years 
later they resorted to netback pricing pegging crude prices to 
the value of refined products other producers followed suit and 
oil prices collapsed in early 1987 opec countries halted netback 
pricing and briefly drove up prices 
the progovernment media has been lashing out at opec the 
englishlanguage riyadh daily referred to the cartel as another 
motley organization whose members are perenially at 
crosspurposes 
prices have edged back up since the saudi announcement and 
analysts have said a cold winter might also help raise prices if 
the demand for heating oil increases 
some sources say quotas may be increased to bring the current 
ceiling of 1506 million barrels daily more closely in line with 
actual production of about 20 million barrels daily a full opec 
meeting has been scheduled for nov 21 in vienna

biogen inc finally turned the corner in 
the unsteady genetic research industry friday reporting its first 
quarterly profit after racking up more than 100 million in losses 
since its founding 10 years ago 
it was the first time that biogen one of the nations earliest 
biotechnology startups has been in the black since going public 
in 1983 
analysts said a major restructuring that emphasized the 
marketing of new drug and diseasetesting procedures has helped 
biogen transform a 699 million loss in the 1987 third quarter 
into a modest profit of 361000 or 2 cents a share in this 
years quarter 
this is the first turnaround story in the biotechnology 
sector said viren mehta a vice president at sg warburg co in 
new york 
the good news comes at a time when biotech stocks have been 
slumping shares of industry leader genentech inc of san francisco 
were trading at 44 at the end of last year but since have fallen 
to about 17 
for 1987 biogen lost 226 million on revenues of 125 
million but revenue spiked upward this year in the third quarter 
revenue totaled 98 million up from 269 million a year ago and 
for the first nine months of the year revenue jumped to 238 
million from 95 million a year ago 
this gives us a lot more flexibility in how we run the 
business day to day said biogen vice president and treasurer 
jack catterall its no longer crisis management 
in overthecounter trading friday biogen rose 25 cents to 
812 a share 
founded by nobel prizewinning harvard university scientist 
walter gilbert and others in 1978 biogen spent millions on diverse 
and costly genetic research projects and lost 101 million in the 
process 
biogen started as a very high flier said andrew mcveigh an 
analyst with rodman amp renshaw inc in chicago over time it lost 
its cache its fair to say they had management problems 
three years ago the company brought in businessman jim vincent 
of abbott laboratories as its chairman who is credited with 
trimming fat and engineering a major restructuring last year 
in the shakeup biogen sold off research facilities in 
switzerland and belgium cut expenses refocused research and 
development on marketable products and retained rights to new 
products rather than licensing them out 
the major difference is biogen is now being managed from 
a more commercial and less technical perspective said biogen 
cofounder phillip sharp director of the center for cancer 
research at the massachusetts institute of technology 
clinical trials began this week at two hospitals of a new aids 
drug called cd4 developed by biogen scientists that doctors hope 
will act as a decoy to attract the lethal virus but competitor 
genentech began clinical testing of a version of the drug several 
weeks ago 
biogen also expects approval in west germany for genetically 
engineered gamma interferon for treatment of severe rheumatoid 
arthritis it has an edge in hepatitis research thanks to a broad 
patent based on research by one of its founders 
biogen recently developed and licensed a diagnostic test and 
vaccine for hepatitis b a swine growth promoter that could help 
farmers raise leaner pigs and the anticancer drug alpha 
interferon that is sold in 43 foreign countries 
despite a rosier financial picture analysts said biogen still 
must prove that its new drugs and procedures can succeed in the 
marketplace

food costs showing further effects from the 
drought accelerated sharply in september but a big drop in energy 
costs kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at a moderate 04 
percent the government reported friday 
the price report brought smiles at the white house where the 
reagan administration claimed it showed inflation was not heating 
up but some private economists expressed worries about what could 
happen if world oil prices suddenly rebound 
the september increase represented a drop from an august 
increase of 06 percent for the first nine months wholesale 
prices have been rising at a rate of 43 percent 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the inflation 
report showed a clear downward trend indicating inflation was 
under control 
the government also reported friday that retail sales fell for 
the second straight month in september declining 04 percent 
because of weakness in auto sales 
in another sign that the economy was slowing the federal 
reserve said the operating rate for americas factories mines and 
utilities was unchanged in september the first month industrial 
production has failed to increase since last february 
the financial markets took the data in stride stock prices rode 
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little 
changed with the dow jones average of 30 industrials losing 018 
to close at 213318 an initial rally in the bond market ran out 
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose bonds finished 
slightly higher 
in the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail 
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the 
economy was not in danger of overheating 
those worries earlier in the year had prompted the federal 
reserve in an inflationfighting move to tighten credit 
conditions and push interest rates higher 
the good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked 
and should decline in coming months said richard rahn chief 
economist of the us chamber of commerce the bad news is not 
all that bad the economy is slowing but only slightly 
other economists agreed although some said they were worried 
that the underlying inflation rate after removing the volatile 
food and energy categories jumped by 06 percent in september 
double the rate of increase in august 
some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to 
wait until after the nov 8 presidential election and then resume 
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen 
consumer demand 
the big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 33 
percent drop in energy costs the biggest decline since january 
all fuel categories showed decreases gasoline costs fell 33 
percent natural gas dropped 25 percent and home heating oil 
declined by 46 percent 
the price declines reflected the current battle among 
oilproducing nations over production quotas 
offsetting the drop in energy costs food prices jumped by 12 
percent last month three times the rate of increase in august 
serving notice to consumers that the effects of the summer drought 
have not played themselves out 
many economists said they expect this pattern of higher food 
costs offset by declining energy prices to repeat itself for the 
rest of the year 
once again we lucked out said david wyss an economist with 
data resources inc of lexington mass energy prices are 
dropping at precisely the time we need it to balance the drought 
wyss noted that declining world oil prices in 1986 had helped 
cushion the inflationary impact from a drop in the value of the 
dollar 
but john hagens senior economist at the wefa group another 
economic consulting firm said the scenario for moderate inflation 
could be disrupted if opec countries start obeying their production 
quotas and world oil prices rebound 
the downward movement in oil prices could suddenly come back 
to hit us if they start rising again pushing the inflation rate 
higher he said 
much of the momentum for the september gain in food costs came 
from a 42 percent jump in beef prices as producers ended the herd 
liquidations that had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle 
fruit costs jumped 10 percent and vegetable prices shot up by 
165 percent both gains were blamed on demand shortages caused by 
the drought prices also rose for coffee and dairy products which 
both climbed 15 percent 
prices fell however for eggs down 85 percent pork down 42 
percent and rice down 36 percent 
another factor pushing prices higher in september was a 18 
percent increase in new automobile prices the report said this 
reflected lower endofthemodelyear incentives to buyers as 
automakers were faced with less of an overhang of unsold cars than 
they have had in past years 
the september changes put the labor departments producer price 
index for finished goods at 1086 meaning that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 at wholesale in 1982 would have 
cost 10860 last month 
the government on oct 21 will release its report on price 
changes at the consumer level through august consumer prices were 
rising at an annual rate of 46 percent only slightly higher than 
the 44 percent gain for all of 1987

the market has not seen the sort of panic buying that marked last 
years dramatic rally sloane said copper prices more than doubled

bond prices finished unchanged to slightly 
higher friday in volatile trading as an early rally inspired by 
new economic reports ran out of steam 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond rose about 316 
point or 187 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves in the opposite direction and is often an indicator of 
interest rate trends slipped to 890 percent from 892 percent 
late thursday 
the yield on the key 30year issue reached as low as 880 
percent and as high as 894 percent during the session 
prices surged early in the trading day on the strength of 
government reports suggesting moderate growth and tame inflation 
analysts said 
they said the market was influenced largely by a labor 
department report that showed wholesale prices a key inflation 
component rose only 04 percent in september restrained by 
sharply falling energy prices 
the report suggested that inflation which erodes the value of 
fixedincome investments is not as significant a threat as earlier 
feared 
in other reports the commerce department said retail sales fell 
an unexpected 04 percent in september suggesting a decline in 
consumer demand another important inflation component 
at the same time the federal reserve board said industrial 
production was unchanged in september an indication that economic 
growth is moderating and further easing inflationary pressures 
analysts said bond prices later retreated however in response 
to a steep decline in the dollar against other major currencies and 
a rise in oil prices 
we took a beating said kevin flanagan a moneymarket 
economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
a weakening of the dollar tends to erode the value of bonds and 
notes denominated in the us currency while rising oil prices 
rekindle fears of inflation 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues were unchanged to 132 point higher intermediate 
maturities were flat to 116 point higher and longterm issues 
rose 532 point according to figures provided by telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was up 043 at 115028 
in corporate trading industrials and utilities also rose 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures price 
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer edged up 035 to 29496 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile slipped to 755 
percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 732 percent yields 
on sixmonth bills rose to 778 percent as the discount edged up 1 
basis point to 740 percent yields on oneyear bills declined to 
803 percent as the discount slipped 1 basis point to 750 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted late in the day at 8 percent up from 8116

the union representing machinists at eastern 
airlines filed a request friday to examine all documents related to 
the planned 365 million sale of the carriers northeast air 
shuttle to developer donald trump 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers asked us district judge barrington d parker to reopen 
discovery in a suit in which the union charges that easterns sale 
of various assets is part of an effort to undermine the strength of 
organized labor

constitutes its latest effort to undermine the status of its 
unions the machinists said in papers filed in us district

the union said it needed to examine the sale documents in order 
to prepare a request for a preliminary injunction to stop the deal 
from being completed 
the motion noted that the shuttle operation which serves new 
york boston and washington is the only profitable section of 
ailing eastern 
frank lorenzo the chairman of texas air corp easterns 
parent said earlier this week he expects the sale to be completed

honeywell inc has filed a 350 million 
lawsuit against unisys corp accusing the giant computer 
manufacturer of artificially inflating the financial strength of 
four aerospace operations that honeywell purchased from unisys for 
more than 1 billion in 1986 
unisys filed a similar suit in new york city in september 
seeking 565000 it said was due under the sales agreement 
in a lawsuit filed in us district court on wednesday the 
minneapolis manufacturing firm accuses unisys of refusing to 
provide more detailed financial information when honeywell sought 
it in 1986 
honeywell said it had to rely on financial statements issued in 
september and october 1986 which the suit says overstated the 
assets and income of the aerospace operations 
the aerospace stations purchased by honeywell were owned by 
sperry corp before it merged in 1986 with burroughs corp to form 
unisys now based in blue bell pa and detroit 
honeywell already has taken a 27 million writeoff for what it 
said were unrecoverable contract costs last month honeywell 
announced there would be further writeoffs in the quarter that 
ended sept 30 it has not yet announced its financial results for 
that quarter 
unisys issued a statement friday from its blue bell 
headquarters saying it believed the honeywell suit should be 
settled in new york supreme court where unisys earlier filed its 
suit the company said the sales agreement was negotiated and 
performed in new york and it specified new york law would apply to 
all claims 
unisys also claimed honeywells lawyers accountants and 
investment bankers had the chance to review fully all financial and 
operating records of sperry in 1986 unisys added it believes it 
has strong factual and legal defenses to honeywells suit although 
it did not respond to the specific claims 
unisys said it filed its suit after receiving notice from 
honeywell regarding claims honeywell was asserting against unisys 
relating to the sale the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment as 
to the rights and obligations of unisys and honeywell relating to 
the sales transaction 
honeywells suit which seeks more than 350 million alleges 
violations of federal and state securities laws fraudulent 
misrepresentation and breach of warranty it asks for a jury trial 
some of the claims against unisys were that it concealed losses 
of at least 36 million on 10 fixedprice contracts failed to 
report an additional loss of 12 million on one of those contracts 
and of 1 million on five others that it did not report a drop in 
value of 24 million for one poorly performing operation and that 
it overvalued assets by more than 54 million

federal marshals threw a legal net over more than 
13 million pounds of rotting and rodentinfested seafood at a 
northwest suburban warehouse the us attorneys office said 
friday 
marshals sealed freezers containing about 25 million worth of 
seafood at impex shrimp and fish co after us food and drug 
administration inspectors found rodent feces and infestation as 
well as decomposition according to assistant us attorney 
frederick branding 
impex distributes seafood nationally he said 
the seafood seized under a warrant included scallops lobster 
tails shrimp frog legs cod sole and red snapper branding said 
there had been no reports of the tainted seafoods reaching 
consumers he said 
fda district director raymond mlecko said there was no health 
hazard involved 
you cannot get sick from eating it mlecko said 
the owner of impex bernard kane was not available immediately 
for comment friday afternoon his office manager said 
according to a complaint filed before us district judge john 
nordberg the seized items consist in part of a filthy substance 
because they contain rodent fecal pellets and consist in whole or 
in part of a putrid or decomposed substance 
fda investigators discovered unsanitary conditions in a 
30000squarefoot freezer warehouse during a recent inspection 
branding said 
if the company protests the seizure a court hearing will be 
held so the company can present evidence that the fish is not 
contaminated and is salvageable he said 
impex cannot sell or move any of the alleged contaminated 
products without court permission branding said 
some of the seafood was imported from mexico but the products 
came from all over he said 
investigators believe the seafood might have been decomposing 
when it arrived in elk grove village branding said 
the federal court complaint seeks to have th fish destroyed at 
impexs expense

a federal judge in delaware on friday 
denied an attempt by polaroid corp to block a hostile takeover bid 
by the disney familyowned shamrock holdings inc 
us district judge caleb wright ruled that polaroid had proven 
no reasonable probability of success if the case had gone to 
trial or irreparable damage from shamrocks 42ashare offer he 
refused to issue a temporary injunction against the bid 
the decision keeps alive the takeover effort by shamrock the 
burbank califbased television and radio concern wholly owned by 
the family of roy e disney nephew of the late animator 
rumors circulated on wall street friday that forstmann little amp 
co a new york leveraged buyout concern was about to make its own 
offer for polaroid for 46 a share forstmann little was rebuffed 
in august when it approached polaroid about a friendly takeover 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips declined to comment on the 
new rumor 
we are delighted that the federal court has ruled in our 
favor shamrock president stanley p gold said in a statement 
now that one of the roadblocks polaroid sought to erect to 
prevent polaroid stockholders from accepting our premium cash 
tender offer has been eliminated we are hopeful that polaroid will 
reconsider its decision not to meet with us he said 
the instant camera pioneer filed the suit last month seeking to 
block shamrock from acquiring any additional shares of the company 
that introduced instant snapshots in 1948 and compel it to divest 
of its current 5 million shares 
polaroid attorneys are studying the decision of judge wright 
to deny the companys motion for a preliminary injunction against 
shamrocks tender offer and will determine the next steps 
polaroid said in a statement 
the decision does not affect a trial scheduled to begin 
wednesday in delaware court of chancery on shamrocks lawsuit 
against polaroids recently issued employee stock ownership plan 
polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
shamrock on friday also extended its 42 a share tender offer 
for polaroid until october 27 the offer was to expire on monday 
shamrock was rebuffed in an unsolicited takeover bid before 
making a sweetened hostile offer last month that values polaroid at 
26 billion polaroid said the offer was too low and advised 
shareholders to reject it 
polaroid stock rose 212 to 40 in consolidated new york stock 
exchange trading friday 
a major point of controversy between the companies is polaroids 
employee stock ownership plan or esop which places 14 percent of 
company stock in employee hands shamrock has refused to recognize 
the esop 
employees are paying for the shares with a 5 percent pay cut 
polaroid had to borrow 285 million to fund the 300 million esop 
polaroid asked the federal court in wilmington del to issue a 
temporary injunction against what it called a manipulative 
deceptive and materially false tender offer 
attorneys for polaroid maintained shamrock violated securities 
laws because its offer was not extended to all valid shares and 
did not include its investment bankers wertheim schroder amp co 
and drexel burnham lambert inc as cobidders 
polaroid attorneys said the investment houses would obtain 100 
million in stock or 21 percent control of polaroid for 46 
million but shamrock said the investment bankers only brought the 
deal to shamrocks attention and the 21 percent stake was part of a 
fee arrangement 
analysts were not surprised by the judges decision 
i think that was basically expected that was a normal move 
for polaroid or any company under attack to do to accuse a 
pursuer of securities violations said polaroid analyst eugene 
glazer of dean witter reynolds inc

the latest bid of 36 billion to the 
hospital corporation of america by an investor group may be the 
highest offer the company gets a broker said friday 
the offer this week of 51 a share in cash and securities for 
hcas 706 million outstanding shares comes after a special 
committee last week rejected the groups initial 47 a share cash 
offer 
hca may not be able to risk a subsequent rejection said a 
stock broker with dean witter reynolds inc in nashville who spoke 
only on condition that he not be identified this is probably the 
highest bid that hca is going to get i think they will consider it 
seriously they have an obligation to their shareholders to 
consider such offers he said 
the latest offer would pay 43 in cash plus securities the group 
valued at 8 for each hca share the group also has commitments for 
all the debt and equity financing needed to complete the buyout

regarding the proposal 
our attorneys have instructed us not to comment past the news 
release said david mcfadden director of corporate relations for 
hca our next comment will be in the form of a news release 
the offer is valid until 5 pm edt tuesday and is subject to 
the approval of shareholders and the hca board of directors 
a special committee of independent directors of the board is 
expected to meet some time next week to consider the proposal 
the special committee on oct 6 rejected a 33 billion 
leveraged buyout proposal from the group led by hca chairman 
thomas f frist jr 
hca which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide set 
up the special committee to consider buyout offers when the first 
one was proposed in midseptember 
the company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over 
a year ago to a new employeeowned company healthtrust inc

a large drop in energy costs in september outweighed sharply 
higher food prices and kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at 
a moderate 04 percent the government reported 
while the reagan administration lauded fridays report as signs 
that inflation was not heating up some private economists 
expressed worries about what could happen if world oil prices 
suddenly rebound 
the september increase represented a drop from an august 
increase of 06 percent for the first nine months wholesale 
prices have been rising at a rate of 43 percent 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the inflation 
report showed a clear downward trend indicating inflation was 
under control 
the government also reported friday that retail sales fell for 
the second straight month in september declining 04 percent 
because of weakness in auto sales 
in another sign that the economy was slowing the federal 
reserve said the operating rate for americas factories mines and 
utilities was unchanged in september the first month industrial 
production has failed to increase since last february 
the financial markets took the data in stride stock prices rode 
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little 
changed with the dow jones average of 30 industrials losing 018 
to close at 213318 an initial rally in the bond market ran out 
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose 
in the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail 
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the 
economy was not in danger of overheating 
those worries earlier in the year had prompted the federal 
reserve in an inflationfighting move to tighten credit 
conditions and push interest rates higher 
the good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked 
and should decline in coming months said richard rahn chief 
economist of the us chamber of commerce the bad news is not 
all that bad the economy is slowing but only slightly 
other economists agreed although some said they were worried 
that the underlying inflation rate after removing the volatile 
food and energy categories jumped by 06 percent in september 
double the rate of increase in august 
some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to 
wait until after the nov 8 presidential election and then resume 
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen 
consumer demand 
the big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 33 
percent drop in energy costs the biggest decline since january and 
a reflection of the rrent battle among oilproducing nations over 
production quotas 
offsetting the drop in energy costs food prices jumped by 12 
percent last month three times the rate of increase in august 
another factor pushing prices higher was a 18 percent increase in

to speculation that opec oil producers would reach an agreement on 
production cuts at meetings this coming week 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude rose 71 cents friday to settle at 1492 a 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange

organization of petroleum exporting countries to between 185 
million and 195 million barrels a day said peter beutel 
assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
opecs production recently has been about 21 million barrels a 
day even though the official ceiling is about 19 million barrels 
its not a fait accompli said beutel who said he got his 
information from sources these numbers may not come into 
existence 
oil traders pushed prices so high in anticipation of an opec 
accord that if one fails to materialize prices could fall back 
quite rapidly analysts said 
the heaviest buying friday was by traders who had speculated on 
a decline in prices and were forced to bail out when the market 
turned against them said jayne ball a trader and analyst at dean 
witter reynolds inc

opec members is scheduled to meet sunday in saudi arabia on 
thursday opecs price monitoring committee and longterm strategy 
committee are scheduled to meet jointly in madrid 
the price of oil skidded in recent weeks trading below 1230 
a barrel at one point last week because of continued 
overproduction by cartel members and opec is trying to construct 
an agreement that will lower output and push prices higher
