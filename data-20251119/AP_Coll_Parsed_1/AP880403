police chief daryl gates vowed saturday to 
deploy 1000 officers on gangridden southcentral streets to keep 
easter churchgoers safe after a driveby shooting in which one man 
died and 12 others were wounded 
gang violence erupted later in the day when two gang members 
were wounded by gunfire after a confrontation between rival groups 
in a downtown parking lot said police lt orley barton 
the victims both 21 were taken to los angeles countyusc 
medical center a spokeswoman said one was in fair condition with a 
gunshot wound in the foot and the second who was hit in the 
buttocks was listed as serious 
county supervisor kenneth hahn sent a telegram to gov george 
deukmejian urging him to declare a state of emergency in los 
angeles and send in two companies of military police from the 
california national guard 
the people of los angeles county are increasingly living in a 
state of fear no one is safe he wrote 
the governor is very concerned about the escalation of gang 
violence in los angeles county said deukmejians press 
secretary kevin brett 
however he would declare a state of emergency only after the 
city and county governments proclaim that such an emergency exists 
and that it exceeds the capabilities of local law enforcement 
officials brett said 
no one had been arrested in fridays shooting but gates said 
police were investigating leads on two men seen shooting from a 
passing car one of those wounded was a 4yearold boy 
the shootings came in the midst of a police crackdown on 
escalating gang violence which only a day earlier prompted one los 
angeles county supervisor to call for help from the california 
national guard 
if we were angry before we are exceedingly angry now gates 
said at a news conference where he called gang members rotten 
little cowards who shoot down 4yearold kids 
plans were under way to put 1000 officers on southcentral 
streets where 200 officers usually patrol gates said adding that 
300 officers would be out saturday night 
we have all this shooting going on on the holy weekend people 
in southcentral la want to go to church tomorrow and were going 
to make sure theyre safe gates said 
he also called for night sessions at all courts in order to 
speed up trials and put criminals behind bars special courts to 
handle gang and narcotic cases and a southcentral justice center 
lt charles massey said fridays shots were fired on turf 
claimed by five or six gangs and that the shootings probably were 
intended as some type of retaliation police believe a 
semiautomatic weapon was used 
rodney bragg 16 said he saw men in a cadillac stop and talk to 
a group of people 
all of a sudden they just opened up he said there were 
about 20 shots i guess maybe more than that you could hear them 
hitting the trees and the houses everything 
the car sped off and then returned for another look before 
fleeing bragg said 
at least 25 rounds were fired gates said 
cmdr william booth said 13 people were hit only 11 were 
accounted for at local hospitals authorities said two people may 
have sought medical attention on their own 
seven antigang police sweeps through the city in the past 
month including one through the southside thursday night have 
resulted in 874 arrests and seizures of weapons drugs cash and 
cars 
on thursday county supervisor kenneth hahn asked gov george 
deukmejian to call in the national guard to help quell gang 
violence 
hahn cited 387 gangrelated deaths within the county last year 
and said the gangrelated death rate in the first three months of 
1988 exceeds the rate for the same period last year 
however since the sweeps the tally of gangrelated homicides 
apparently has decreased from 25 in march 1987 to 14 in march 
1988 police said

a former british fighter pilot was reported sunday 
as saying austrian president kurt waldheim saved his life and those 
of other allied prisoners during world war ii by preventing them 
falling into the hands of nazi executioners 
the sunday times said the pilot bruce ogilvie is the first 
and possibly the only british exserviceman to speak in defense of 
waldheim who denies accusations of involvement in war crimes 
when he was serving with the german army 
ogilvie now 66 said he was in danger of being shot when he was 
found armed and in civilian clothes on the britishoccupied greek 
island of leros in november 1943 the day after german paratroops 
invaded 
he said he was taken to an airfield outside athens where he met 
waldheim who introduced himself by name and ensured that ogilvie 
and others were sent to a prisonerofwar camp instead of the nazi 
ss who shot prisoners 
ogilvie said waldheim took the prisoners identity discs and 
gave them substitutes which had been taken from the bodies of 
allied servicemen killed in action the discs enabled the prisoners 
to prove they were not commandos or spies 
ogilvie said he mentioned waldheims help to royal air officers 
who debriefed him after his release from a prison camp in may 1945

sunday when he tried to attach a palestinian flag to a utility 
pole hospital officials said a second arab died of gunshot wounds 
suffered last week in a clash with israeli soldiers 
the fatalities came hours before the scheduled arrival of 
secretary of state george p shultz for a third round of talks with 
israeli leaders on his middle east peace initiative and while 
hundreds of christians celebrated easter in jerusalem 
the deaths also occurred a day after israeli soldiers shot and 
killed six arab protesters in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip the highest oneday death toll in four months of unrest 
the jerusalem post newspaper quoted military sources as saying 
the army has adopted a new policy of entering even remote arab 
villages to break up protests instead of ignoring demonstrators as 
long as they did not endanger lives or interfere with traffic on 
the main roads 
the confrontations over the weekend were a result of our 
initiative defense minister yitzhak rabin told israel radio 
in jerusalem about 1000 pilgrims from around the world 
attended easter sunday services in the church of the holy sepulcher 
where most christians believe jesus was buried and rose from the 
dead 
church officials said the number of worshipers dropped by half 
from last year apparently because many pilgrims were scared away 
by the violence in the occupied territories 
in the west bank town of tulkarem 40 miles northwest of 
jerusalem an army official said a 20yearold arab youth died 
early sunday after being electrocuted when he tried to attach a 
red white black and green palestinian flag outlawed by israel 
to a utility pole 
after receiving the shock the youth fell from the pole and hit 
his head said the official who in keeping with army regulations 
spoke on condition of anonymity the youth was pronounced dead at

arab died sunday of wounds he suffered wednesday in a clash with 
israeli soldiers during the clash ali diab abu ali of the west 
bank village yatta was shot in the neck and paralyzed said a 
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
his death brought to 134 the number of arabs killed in four 
months of antiisraeli protests according to un figures the 
youth from tulkarem was not included in the count because of 
conflicting reports on the circumstances of his death one israeli 
soldier has died in the violence 
shultz is scheduled to meet monday with rabin prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and foreign minister shimon peres israel radio 
quoted sources in egypt as saying shultz planned to present to 
israeli leaders an invitation to an international peace conference 
which is to launch direct bilateral negotiations between the 
parties to the conflict 
shamir opposes key elements of the shultz plan especially a 
proposed international conference the jerusalem post quoted a 
shamir aide as saying if shultz doesnt present any new ideas in 
his talks with shamir the prime minister will not budge 
peres supports the shultz plan

jesse jackson accustomed to bringing an 
uplifting message to the downtrodden found a warm reception among 
the already uplifted at this chic ski playground 
looking to win delegates in mondays colorado democratic 
caucuses jackson dropped in on the sunny snowy resort high in the 
rocky mountains on saturday afternoon 
it was a visit that took the black civil rights leader and 
presidential candidate a long way from his usual audiences like 
the hispanics who surged to touch him in pueblo and the striking 
meatpackers in greeley who cheered wildly to his denunciation of 
the rich and powerful earlier in the day 
i was surprised he came here said mary scheerer a tanned 
and blond frequent visitor from minneapolis who strained to get 
jackson in the sights of her video camera as he arrived i guess 
its because the mayor invited him 
jackson was greeted by the towns white bearded mayor bill 
stirling a local real estate man who sported a jackson bumper 
sticker across his white cowboy hat later wearing a blue 
pinstripe suit and bow tie he danced and sang along with a 
recorded campaign song after introducing the candidate 
people have said why aspen its too glitzy too lily 
white too middle class the mayor said his last remark drawing 
laughter well we vote here too 
arriving after a day of skiing was tom hayden the california 
legislator and husband of actress jane fonda he wasnt endorsing 
jackson he said but he had nice things to say about him 
the gathering spilled out the door from the ornate room in the 
old jerome hotel a recently restored threestory brick building 
that looks like it came straight out of the old west but updated 
for the ski crowd to get to jacksons speech people walked past 
guests frolicking in the hotels outdoor hot tub and through a bar 
with a giant chandelier made of antlers 
some who turned out were supporters and some just seemed 
curious many wore bright ski suits 
one man dressed in cowboy shirt and hat face red from skiing 
said on his way in were here for both jesse and the fashion 
show he said there really was a fashion show in town but he 
might have been talking about the affluent allwhite crowds 
wardrobe 
others claimed to be real supporters at the pitkin county 
airport where the idle private jets of aspens visitors wait in 
rows andrea hanson was among the handful of greeters 
i just think hes the best thing going said hanson clad in 
a black leather miniskirt she described herself as an author of 
childrens books 
posters printed by local supporters invited people to see 
jackson included was a notice that the reception beforehand was 
for substantial contributors only 100 to 1000 
jackson spoke passionately as usual of the poor but at the 
same time responded to his monied audience the poor work he said 
and are all around even in aspen 
they changed the sheets in the hotel you slept in last 
night he said 
the upper class cannot remain upper if there is not a middle 
class he told the substantial contributors 
one man put a tough question to jackson did he back raising 
taxes as high as 60 percent on upper incomes like his own it would 
discourage the creation of jobs he said 
to tax you 60 percent would be as absurd as a tax cut 
responded jackson who hours earlier had denounced president reagan 
for reverse robin hood taking from the poor for the rich 
jackson suggested the tax rates before president reagans 1981 tax 
cut were reasonable 
with the larger crowd jackson didnt miss an opportunity to ask 
for contributions to his campaign 
give like you live high jackson said 
jackson led in responsive chants as he does with other audiences 
evoking such shouts as vote and jesse when they didnt 
get it right he interrupted lets stop and do it right do it 
with rhythm and soul 
a few feet to the side hayden was talking politics and 
speculating on a mario cuomojesse jackson ticket 
something very powerful is happening hayden said i dont 
know if he can win in november but nobody else is having an effect 
like this 
jackson seemed to enjoy his visit too the chanting done 
jackson grinned and waved 
okay aspen he said

three moderate earthquakes shook athenians 
awake saturday and sunday while another strong temblor rocked the 
western resort island of corfu 
none of the quakes caused injuries or damage authorities said 
a spokesman for the athens seismological institute said a strong 
quake measuring 50 on the richter scale occurred at 1156 am 
sunday its epicenter was 212 miles northwest of athens in the 
seabed off the island of corfu 
the popular resort island has about 2000 mostly british 
tourists visiting over the easter holiday local police said 
three other quakes registering 42 46 and 44 on the richter 
scale rumbled through the greek capital between 11 pm saturday 
and 7 am sunday 
the four quakes are not geologically connected we rule out 
the chance of a disastrous quake coming from any of the areas 
so people shouldnt panic professor yiannis dracopoulos 
greeces senior seismologist told staterun television 
the athens region has 35 million residents a third of greeces 
population 
the first two quakes had their epicenters 125 miles east of 
athens in the seabed off the coastal town of loutsa while the 
third had its epicenter 47 miles northwest of the capital 
an athens police spokesman said the three quakes were felt 
throughout the capital but didnt cause any injuries or damage 
we had a lot of people calling in to find out what was 
happening but nobody panicked said a police spokesman who 
requested anonymity 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a magnitude 4 quake can cause moderate damage while a 
force 5 temblor can cause considerable damage

under police and army guard pilgrims from 
around the world gathered at dawn for easter sunday services in the 
church marking the site where most christians believe jesus rose 
from the dead 
about 1000 worshipers half as many as last year attended 
services in the 12th century church of the holy sepulcher church 
officials said 
many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost daily 
violence in the israelioccupied territories that have left more 
than 130 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead the greek 
orthodox church canceled three preeaster processions scheduled for 
the weekend 
security was lowkey sunday at the crusaderbuilt church where 
about half a dozen uniformed police stood guard in the courtyard 
and at the entrance 
but dozens of soldiers were stationed throughout the walled old 
city some on rooftops and others patrolling the narrow cobblestone 
streets an arab attacker stabbed an israeli policeman in the old 
city on friday 
before we came our friends were worried and said they would 
pray for us said 71yearold arnold rosenbrock a lutheran from 
kankakee ill 
weve been fine but someone was killed in bethlehem yesterday 
saturday a few hours before we visited he added there were 
boulders in the street and it was tense 
we were frightened before we came but now that we are here 
we feel it is safe said philip jiamachello 31 of houston 
texas who attended the services with his wife and young son for 
me this was a very moving experience 
tourism ministry officials said they had no figures for the 
month of march but acknowledged a 13 percent drop in tourism for 
the first week of the month as compared with a year ago officials 
also expressed concern about possible cancellations in april and 
may 
clouds of incense and organ music filled the church during the 
latin service held in front of the marbleenclosed tomb marking the 
site where jesus is believed to have been resurrected 
the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem monsignor michel 
sabbah the first palestinian to hold the post presided over the 
service last week he called on worshipers to make special easter 
prayers for those caught up in the arabisraeli conflict 
at the church entrance visiting pilgrims kissed and pressed 
their foreheads to the rosecolored marble stone where followers 
are believed to have washed jesus body before his burial 
several worshipers dropped handkerchiefs to soak up some of the 
holy water that dampens the stone 
others walked upstairs to the candlelit table marking the site 
where jesus cross is believed to have been buried 
one feels very humble walking on the same soil where christ 
walked said gale crisher 48 of long island ny my children 
couldnt believe i was coming to israel now but i felt have very 
comfortable here 
while the roman catholics were celebrating easter orthodox 
denominations were marking their palm sunday walking along the via 
dolorosa or way of sorrow where jesus wearing a crown of thorns 
was forced to carry the cross on which he died orthodox christians 
celebrate easter this coming sunday 
in the midst of the easter service about two dozen chanting 
coptic priests and choir boys in long dark robes entered the church 
carrying palm leaves some formed in the shape of a cross 
easter also fell on the third day of the jewish holiday of 
passover commemorating the deliverance of the ancient hebrews from 
slavery in egypt 
palestinian shopkeepers opened stores around the church from 
morning until noon the times permitted by the palestine liberation 
organization the plo has ordered afternoon strikes in arab east 
jerusalem to protest the israeli occupation 
but even merchants who remained open complained there was little 
business 
i sold about 1000 worth of items a day last year during holy 
week this year im lucky if it is 100 said mike mannix a 
jerusalemborn palestinian and owner of a shop selling olivewood 
crosses and icons 
last easter my store was filled to the doorway and people were 
crowded on the streets outside the 32yearold mannix added

two years after a us bombing raid 
shocked the nation libyans are breathing a bit easier 
moammar gadhafi their leader and the target of the attack is 
permitting some longawaited though small steps to fix the 
economy he is also calling for greater personal liberty 
and its true right that reagan cant become president 
again asked a libyan military man confident that life is 
looking up for his countrymen 
for the us president col gadhafi was the mad dog of the 
middle east and a sponsor of terrorism including 1985 attacks on 
airports in rome and vienna to gadhafi reagan was the israeli 
dog in the black house the villain behind the april 15 
1986 bombing which libyans say killed the colonels baby daughter 
and 36 other people 
the goodguy badguy rhetoric drew attention from an economy 
badly needing direction especially after falling oil prices 
flattened libyas plump cushion of petroleum income the global 
theater also overshadowed the growing demands of libyan consumers 
now gadhafi seems bent on ensuring his popularity by improving 
life for his more than 35 million countrymen in the north african 
nation 
of course motives are often difficult to judge in the case of 
the mercurial colonel who came to power in a 1969 coup and who is 
now simply called the leader by libyans 
some observers think the 45yearold gadhafi may have decided to 
reform his virulent antiamericanism which sometimes made him an 
easy target of us outrage others think gadhafi may also have 
been affected by an amnesty international appeal in july to end an 
alleged policy of assassinating opposition figures 
while slogans denouncing purported american aggression are still 
plastered on buildings one diplomat says that there has been a 
quiet exchange of messages between the us and libyan governments 
indicating a desire if not to improve relations at least to keep 
channels open 
there are several signs gadhafi may also have decided to push 
for a more liberal economy 
a tripoli newspaper last month reported that small businesses 
are now permitted to import items such as automobile parts 
previously allowed only for governmentfranchise holders and sell 
them at a profit diplomats were apparently told to improve 
distribution of consumer goods and more private businesses were 
allowed to operate 
insisting repeatedly that libyans must produce for themselves 
gadhafi has tried to reduce dependence on imports especially after 
libyas oil revenues dropped dramatically from a 1980 peak of 22 
billion 
by 1986 lower oil prices saw annual revenue plummet to less 
than 6 billion prospects for slightly higher oil prices this year 
could put income at about 65 billion 
on tripolis shopping streets business seems to have grown over 
the past year freshly slaughtered fat chickens hang from doorways 
enticing customers women some shrouded headtotoe in white 
cotton others in formfitting olive green military pants and 
jackets examine satinstriped fabric while men try out imported 
calculators 
it seems every other store window has cheap leather shoes vinyl 
pocketbooks and suitcases 
a diplomat reports that in the past year the government which 
likes to boast of an extensive health care system is allowing 
libyans to buy western currency and go abroad ostensibly for 
medical treatment 
one thing that hasnt changed in libya though is the ground 
rule of anonymity which covers conversations with diplomats 
businessmen and the few libyans willing to give their reading on 
whats happening 
gadhafi has been focusing as well on personal liberties 
one afternoon last month the masterful user of the media rode a 
bulldozer to knock down the gate of a tripoli prison to the cheers 
of one of the largest rallies in the capital in years according to 
a diplomat gadhafi declared that the released inmates included 
some who had plotted to kill him 
a week later gadhafi called for abolishing the death penalty in 
a nation where hangings have been broadcast on state television 
on march 28 gafhafi announced that all arrests should be backed 
by a court order 
this is a very good thing said a smiling libyan relaxing 
in a lounge a few hours after the speech now members of the 
revolutionary committees just come up and take people away without 
warning 
the committees are gadhafis watchdogs of revolutionary ideology 
gadhafi also announced he is withdrawing troops from eastern 
libya as a goodwill gesture toward its eastern neighbor egypt 
with which it has been feuding for 15 years

communist rebels suffered a major 
setback with the recent arrest of their top leaders but military 
officials and analysts say the insurgents are far from beaten 
through their 19year rebellion the guerrillas have 
demonstrated remarkable resilience despite harsh crackdowns their 
influence has spread from the countryside to urban centers attacks 
have stepped up and captured leaders have been replaced immediately 
president corazon aquino who has vowed to crush the insurgency 
before her term expires in 1992 hailed last tuesdays arrests of 
the new peoples army commander and the communist partys no 2 man 
as the beginning of the end 
it clearly demonstrates that we have turned the tide and are 
winning the war against the communist insurgency she said in a 
statement 
but military officials and others say the president may have 
spoken too soon although they acknowledge that the arrests were a 
big blow to the 25000strong guerrilla army 
it will disturb some of their programs brig gen rodolfo 
biazon manila area commander said of the arrests but to say 
that this means the defeat of the communist movement may not 
entirely be correct because we are fighting an idea and the idea 
is still there 
francisco tatad a columnist and former information minister 
under ousted president ferdinand marcos noted the insurgents not 
only survived but expanded after the capture of party founder jose 
maria sison and former rebel commander bernabe buscayno in the 
mid1970s 
tatad said the rebels now enjoy broad support among workers 
students the clergy and other groups in society and that the 
government must improve its services to make the very idea of 
insurgency obsolete 
still the arrests of rebel commander romulo kintanar 
secretarygeneral rafael baylosis and four other rebels marked a 
dramatic success for the government 
they came as the military was on alert for rebel attacks marking 
last tuesdays 19th anniversary of the rebel force instead it was 
the military which struck raiding communist hideouts in the 
capital 
the arrest of kintanar 37 is especially significant kintanar 
a master guerrilla strategist was widely believed to have 
organized assassination squads known as sparrow units which 
brought the guerrilla conflict from the countryside to the cities 
police say up to 4000 sparrows are deployed in metropolitan 
manila where they have killed more than 150 police soldiers and 
government officials since january 1987 
veteran journalist max soliven wrote in the philippine star that 
for the first time in years the rebels are now sweating it 
out but he warned against complacency 
the rebels are so desperate at this juncture that they may 
unleash a series of furious attacks and ambushes just to create 
the impression that the movement remains strong soliven wrote 
sen rene saguisag mrs aquinos former spokesman agreed it 
was too early to say whether the arrests have dealt a fatal blow to 
the insurgency 
saguisag said one factor favoring the government is mrs 
aquinos continued popularity another he said was the ongoing 
attempt to hammer out a land reform act 
he said since mrs aquino took over from marcos on feb 25 
1986 she has introduced broad social and economic reforms 
saguisag acknowledged that substantial disaffection remains but 
it is nowhere like the disenchantment with marcos which was 
across the board 
even more than a debacle for the rebels the arrests are seen as 
a morale booster for the underpaid illequipped armed forces of 
the philippines since mrs aquino took office when a 
militarycivilian uprising deposed marcos the 160000member armed 
forces has been wracked by divisions that resulted in at least half 
a dozen coup attempts 
defense secretary fidel v ramos says those days are over he 
said the arrests show the military is now a united effective force 
ramos spoke before the escape saturday of former lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan leader of a failed coup attempt in 
august many filipinos saw the escape as a blow to the prestige and 
unity of the armed forces 
the significance of tuesdays arrests may well depend on the 
accuracy of intelligence reports of a bitter power struggle within 
rebel ranks 
according to military officials the infighting is between those 
favoring violent struggle and others who want the movement to 
expand politically among the rural population 
brig gen alexander aguirre the capitals chief law enforcer 
predicted that tuesdays arrests will deepen divisions among the 
rebels because each faction will blame the other for the setback 
much also depends on how much foreign assistance flows to the 
rebels military officials say the funds come from leftist groups 
in western europe australia new zealand and the united states 
richard armitage us assistant defense secretary told a 
congressional committee in washington this week that the soviets 
were sending money soviet diplomats here deny the charge

gen manuel antonio noriega the 
indicted strongman of panama may be running out of time and 
options in his stubborn quest to remain in power 
the man president reagan once called a tinhorn dictator so 
far has relied on brute force threats and intimidation to maintain 
his grip on the nation 
but despite another harsh crackdown on his opposition last week 
many diplomatic and other observers feel noriega can count his 
remaining days on his fingers and toes 
he really doesnt have anywhere to turn said one western 
diplomat late last week he is almost totally without meaningful 
support either within the country or abroad 
still noriega has withstood four weeks of mounting economic 
pressure with such mulish defiance that another foreign diplomat 
also speaking on condition of anonymity was led to comment 
this guys proving to be harder to get rid of than fleas on a 
dog the problem is becoming one of whether you have to kill the 
dog before the fleas will leave 
even elliott abrams the state department official masterminding 
the us effort to oust noriega acknowledged last week that he and 
others in the reagan administration had misjudged the generals 
staying power 
abrams the assistant secretary of state for latin american 
affairs said the miscalculation was based in part on the 
successful use of economic pressure to remove presidents ferdinand 
e marcos from the philippines and jeanclaude duvalier from haiti 
the united states has cut off all economic and military aid to 
panama withheld about 65 million a month in user fees from the 
panama canal helped tie up more than 50 million in government 
funds on deposit in us banks and eliminated some trade 
preferences 
abrams suggested the time had come to consider even harsher 
economic sanctions up to a total trade embargo thats a bridge 
the administration so far has been unwilling to cross for fear of 
so badly damaging the country that a postnoriega government would 
be unable to pick up the pieces 
we now realize that it is easier to remove civilian dictators 
than military ones abrams said in analogous circumstances 
marcos and duvalier were gone already 
some foreign diplomats in panama dont see the situation here as 
analogous to the philippines and haiti regardless of any possible 
differences between civilian and military dictators 
in the philippines you had a cory aquino who provided a 
rallying point said one referring to philippines president 
corazon aquino theres nobody like that here there also arent 
many people here who appear willing to risk their lives in the 
struggle in the philippines and haiti we saw desperate people 
acting desperately 
the diplomats and two private economists all of whom spoke on 
condition of anonymity agreed there is little chance of us 
military intervention despite reagans decision late last week to 
send an additional 1300 soldiers to panama to help the 10500 
already here guard the panama canal and protect american civilians 
indeed only a day before reagan announced his decision to send 
the new troops the panamanian government issued a communique 
saying it had no intention of provking an excuse for us military 
action 
the diplomats and economists also agreed unanimously that 
noriegas days are numbered by a rapidly souring economy that 
already has the general trapped in a fiscal maze with no outlet 
panama went bankrupt last year unable to make interest payments 
to any of the lenders to whom it owes 48 billion one of the 
highest per capita debts in the world 
then early this year noriega was indicted by two federal grand 
juries in florida that accused him of selling out his country to 
colombian drug traffickers in exchange for millions of dollars in 
bribes 
after some weeks of apparent soul searching panamas president 
eric arturo delvalle called for noriegas dismissal only to have 
the effort backfire with his own ouster in a thinly disguised coup 
orchestrated by the general 
three weeks ago abrams chief deputy william walker and a 
state department legal officer came to panama and offered noriega a 
deal accept offered asylum in spain and the united states will not 
pursue you 
the general refused 
delvalles ouster triggered a run on banks that forced their 
closure the government short of cash could not pay its 
employees some disgruntled officers tried but failed to overthrow 
noriega and his civilian opposition heaped coals on the fire with 
a twoweek general strike that began to crumble only late last week 
even with the anticipated reopening of most industries and 
businesses this week the government and its people are so short of

police patiently watched a stolen 
motorcycle for 17 days 24 hours a day in hopes of catching a 
burglar linked to nearly 200 breakins until one officer took a 
twominute restroom break and the bike disappeared 
two alachua county sheriffs investigators involved in the 
failed surveillance were placed on six months of probation 
the socalled interstate 75 cat burglar a cocky thief who 
police believe has occasionally helped himself to a snack while his 
victims slept soundly has been linked to more than 180 breakins 
in seven florida counties along i75 he remains at large 
alachua county investigators had their best shot at catching him 
in january when a motorcycle stolen in citrus county during one of 
the cat burglars sprees was found at a gainesville apartment 
complex the gainesville sun reported saturday 
teams of officers kept watch over the motorcycle from a motor 
home 125 yards away to see if the burglar would return to use it 
but sgt william bear bryan and investigator tony canchola 
said friday that a combination of incredible luck on the burglars 
part and a poor line of sight from their vantage point combined to 
doom the surveillance 
the 2000 motorcycle was discovered parked at the apartment 
complex on jan 9 one resident remembered seeing a man drive away 
on it on the same day the cat burglar struck a gainesville 
neighborhood and it was later returned to the complex 
bryan and canchola said the discovery of the motorcycle was the 
only real break in the i75 cat burglar cases which have 
frustrated authorities since november 
so two deputies at a time kept vigil with the aid of a 
television camera and nightvision scope 
bryan and canchola even took the precaution of disabling the 
motorcycles engine so it couldnt be started 
on jan 16 canchola was watching the tv monitor while bryan sat 
in the back of the motor home repairing other surveillance 
equipment they said friday canchola saw no one near the 
motorcycle so he went to the bathroom for about two minutes by 
the time both men got back to the monitor the motorcycle was gone 
we were so shocked that we were laughing canchola said 
we thought somebody had moved the motorcycle and was playing a 
joke on us 
interviews with witnesses later revealed the cat burglar had 
snatched the motorcycle in a matter of seconds 
the suspect drove up in a small pickup truck and parked just out 
of the investigators line of sight then without trying to start 
the disabled motorcycle he wheeled it to his truck and lifted it 
in the back 
the cat burglar did not hit gainesville that night when 
lawenforcement agencies were at full alert 
the motorcycle was later found abandoned in port orange south 
of daytona beach alachua county sheriffs spokesman spencer mann 
said that city had several night burglaries at that time but they 
have not been positively linked to the i75 cat burglar 
canchola and bryan wound up on probation and said friday they 
still feel bad about losing their best chance at collaring the 
burglar 
if wed have caught him wed have been heroes bryan said 
instead we just got burned this time canchola said

lebanon long known as a supplier of hashish 
has become one of the worlds big heroin centers in the past few 
years as its economy and central government have collapsed us 
officials said 
almost all the militias are involved in some way in the 
trafficking of drugs one intelligence official said 
several officials from the cia the drug enforcement agency 
and the state department agreed to provide an overview of the 
drug situation in lebanon on the condition their names not be used 
lebanons role in the worlds drug trade is discussed in the 
state departments march report on narcotics 
lebanon is reportedly the worlds major producer of hashish 
as well as a key processing and transit point for heroin the 
department said in its report called international narcotics 
control strategy report 
although lebanon has yet to approach places like colombia 
pakistan and mexico in the volume of its drug trade officials said 
the situation is worrisome because the united states has virtually 
no influence in the country much of which is controlled by 
christian druze and moslem factions 
the united states has few statistics about lebanons drug trade 
but it reportedly is a more than 200 millionayear business the 
christians have long dominated the countrys drug business but 
other sects have moved into the business 
syria one of four countries under us sanctions for failing to 
cooperate in the war on drugs has peacekeeping troops in parts of 
lebanon the other countries on the sanctions list are iran panama 
and afghanistan 
so chaotic is the situation in lebanon that yonah alexander an 
expert on drugs and terrorism described the country as turning 
back to the middle ages alexander is at the center for strategic 
and international studies a think tank 
the central government has little control over the 
countryside where armed militia factions and syria hold sway the 
state department said in its report 
the department said that much of lebanons drug activity occurs 
in the fertile bekaa valley a region that is controlled by the 
syrian military and was once the countrys breadbasket 
syrian military officers profit from the trade and protect 
it the report said 
the hezbollah a proiranian faction of shiite moslems thought 
to hold some of the american hostages in lebanon also has bases 
and support in the bekaa in 1986 dea agents were involved in a 
failed attempt to contact and pay the kidnappers in exchange for 
hostages 
poppy cultivation has replaced the growing of fruits and 
vegetables in some of the bekaas fields and farmers find it 
easier to make money cultivating drugs and producing foodstuffs 
officials say 
we have seen over the last few years a shift from traditional 
agricultural products to more poppy one department officer 
said with decline of the lebanese pound cultivating drugs has 
become a very lucrative safe way of work he said 
growing drugs is less hassle for farmers too marketing is not 
a problem because the buyers often come to the source and pay cash 
the official said 
as a result of drug money the bekaa has become a 
selfsufficient region within the tiny country which is about the 
size of connecticut the farmers are very independent often 
setting up schools and buying bigticket items like electric 
generating equipment an american said 
the bekaa has many of the countrys heroin processing plants of 
which there are as many as 10 lebanon is not only a grower but 
also an importer of drugs an american said imported drugs come 
primarily from afghanistan and southeast asia 
drugs are often shipped out of lebanon through ports controlled 
by various militias the deas interdiction program based in 
cyprus about 60 miles off lebanons coast has successfully halted 
some trafficking 
as a result lebanese middlemen increasingly have relied on 
female couriers who leave the country overland through turkey or by 
plane with small amounts of drugs in body cavities or concealed in 
some fashion 
drugs from lebanon usually end up in the united states europe 
of egypt officials say but often couriers travel through africa 
before reaching their final destination enforcement officials say 
countries in west africa have large lebanese colonies addis 
ababa the ethiopias capital and nairobi the kenyas capital 
are favorite transit points for drug dealers from lebanon and 
elsewhere because of their good airport facilities officials say 
lebanons burgeoning drug trade has led to more addicts inside 
the country particularly among the militias and the young college 
crowd the bekaa farmers however seem to have little use for drug 
consumption 
us officials are not optimistic about making a dent in 
lebanons drug trade anytime soon 
a comprehensive eradication and interdiction program must 
await restoration of central government control the state 
departments report said 
official us policy calls for national reconciliation in 
lebanon and removal of all foreign forces 
but drugs contribute to the breakdown in central order by giving 
the militias and factions an outside source of income making them 
more flexible and independent the traditional way for the private 
militias to finance their operations is through local taxation 
in the long run this drugs contributes to the emerging 
partitioning of the country one official said

the effort to push stock market crash 
legislation through congress before lawmakers become preoccupied 
with the summer political conventions has produced some strange 
bedfellows 
nicholas brady chairman of president reagans task force on the 
crash has teamed with two of the administrations sharpest 
critics senate banking committee chairman william proxmire 
dwis and rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
energy and commerce finance subcommittee 
bradys republican credentials are impeccable he is a former 
republican senator from new jersey a member of vice president 
george bushs inner circle and a likely prospect for secretary of 
the treasury in a bush presidency 
yet on the issue of reforming the nations financial markets he 
finds himself working closely with proxmire whose golden 
fleece awards regularly skewer administration moneywasting and 
markey who made his name as a severe critic of the governments 
nuclear power bureaucracy and is now turning his attention to the 
regulation of the financial markets 
arrayed against bradys proposals are three reagan appointees 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan securities and 
exchange commission chairman david ruder and commodity futures 
trading commission chairwoman wendy gramm 
all three have praise for bradys research but all three are 
vigorously opposing his proposals for changes in their agencies 
jurisdiction 
two months ago under the glare of television lights in a senate 
hearing room brady uttered his now wellknown warning regarding 
the fragility of the stock market we are looking down the barrel 
of a gun and the gun is still loaded 
since then at every hearing the lanky wall street investment 
banker attends he hears his words repeated by a democrat eager to 
prod a laissez faire reagan administration into action 
brady would clearly like to see legislation providing more 
uniform regulation of the markets but he is just as clearly 
uncomfortable at hearing his words used as a political club against 
the administration 
after one hearing where markey mixed lavish praise of brady 
with complaints of administration footdragging brady joked to 
reporters i didnt say anybody was going to pull the trigger 
the administration has created a working group to resolve 
differences among the regulatory agencies it is due to report to 
the president by midmay 
but both markey and proxmire have painted the creation of the 
group as a delaying tactic by an administration that doesnt want 
to offend entrenched interests and is prone to be skeptical of 
government regulation in the first place 
brady says the working group isnt a bad idea but nevertheless 
he has helped markey and proxmire write bills that will be finished 
before the administration is ready to make its recommendations 
markeys bill is still being written but proxmire introduced 
his on thursday it would create an intermarket coordination 
committee and instruct the regulatory agencies to cooperate with it 
opposition from the agencies as well as infighting among 
legislators representing competing interests make the bills 
prospects appear dim 
but because of bradys efforts the sides are drawn less along 
party lines than some had expected 
the day before proxmire introduced his bill brady was on the 
floor of the senate drumming up support as a result five of the 
bills seven cosponsors are republicans

the federal communications commission has 
begun investigating two more california dialaporn services but 
the agency says it is running out of complaints it can act on 
i keep beating the bushes for new specific complaints but we 
just dont have a lot of them though the agency gets plenty of 
general complaints about dialaporn said greg vogt chief of the 
fccs telephone enforcement division 
for the fcc to investigate possible violations of a federal law 
prohibiting transmission of sexually explicit messages to children 
the agency needs information such as a phone bill and a statement 
that someone under 18 has reached the service without using a 
credit card an access code or a descrambler he said 
i know there are violations out there and i would love for 
concerned citizens to help us by bringing them to our attention 
because there is no way we can locate them in any other way he 
said 
the fcc has jurisdiction over dialaporn when the calls cross 
state lines or are to from or within the district of columbia 
local calls are under the jurisdiction of the state 
complaints about dialaporn services have prompted many states 
to require telephone companies to block access to 976 and 900 
numbers for residential customers who request it phone companies 
also have been responding to public pressure to disconnect or 
otherwise limit the availability of these services 
the fcc sent letters last week to two california adultmessage 
services advising them of apparent violations they were given 
30 days to respond 
if violations are found the fcc could levy fines of up to 
50000 per day for each day a violation occurred 
the companies cited are ramrod enterprises inc of redding 
calif and 2001 enterprises of reseda calif neither company was 
listed with telephone directory assistance and the fcc said it was 
unable to obtain phone numbers for the companies or their owners 
the actions against both companies stemmed from the same 
complaint that generated an investigation begun last dec 7 of 
another california provider of sexual messages intercambio inc of 
san jose calif 
the complaint was from parents of a 16yearold connecticut boy 
who had made more than 280 calls to dialaporn services the 
family was not identified 
the complaint says the boy lost all respect for women in 
general as a result of the dialaporn messages he heard and is 
now seeing a psychiatrist 
the fcc requires dialaporn providers to use an access code 
available only to adults or prepay with a credit card before they 
listen to the sexually explicit messages the fcc also allows 
providers to scramble the messages so they can be heard only by 
someone with a descrambling device 
the complaint against intercambio and a separate one citing 
audio enterprises of mill valley calif are pending while the 
commission reevaluates the companies messages in light of a 
federal appeals court ruling in january that the agency can 
restrict access only to obscene messages but not indecent ones 
the commission defines indecency as language or material that 
depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities or organs 
obscene material must appeal to the prurient interest depict or 
describe sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and lack 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value

its a bigcity motorists nightmare driving aimlessly for an 
hour or more seeking a legal parking space many succumb to the 
temptation of stopping in front of a hydrant or in a no parking 
zone 
then begins the gamble will they get caught and if so do they 
pay up 
an associated press check of 13 major us cities showed that 
they collect at least 380 million annually in parking fines but 
many violators ignore the tickets and the backlog of unpaid fines 
totals more than 155 billion in new york and los angeles alone 
the amounts the two cities do collect in a year would be enough 
to finance the budgets of many smaller cities new york collected 
an alltime high of 177 million in 1987 and los angeles brought in 
nearly 59 million 
some other large cities are good collectors too washington got 
38 million last year chicago 24 million san francisco 28 
million philadelphia 216 million 
cities have two purposes in imposing parking fines said 
john tepper marlin vice president of the national civic league in 
new york first to keep the traffic flowing second to collect 
revenues 
officials at new yorks parking violations bureau dont forgive 
or forget they refuse to write off about 14 billion in parking 
penalties dating back eight years los angeles officials say their 
city is owed nearly 157 million in parking fines 
last month los angeles mayor tom bradley demonstrated how 
cities use fines to persuade drivers to improve their parking 
habits he announced that fines for illegal parking during rush 
hours would be nearly doubled from 28 to 53 
bradley said the city expects to collect an additional 6 
million in the next year from the higher fines which are aimed at 
motorists who clog the right lanes of major streets he proposed 
using much of the revenue for improvements such as building 
lefthand turn pockets that would ease congestion 
in detroit under a plan that took effect last week 52000 
scofflaws with six or more unpaid parking tickets will have to pay 
their fines or lose their right to update renew or replace their 
drivers licenses 
payments of parking fines rose from 386000 in december to 
956000 in january after mayor coleman young announced the plan 
city officials estimate that some 60000 drivers owe 24 million in 
unpaid parking fines 
boston officials said a similar nonrenewal system has helped 
improve its collection percentage of parking fines from 20 percent 
to between 65 and 75 percent 
many cities also nab illegally parked cars with such measures as 
towing indianapolis tows some 19000 cars a year any car with 
more than six tickets automatically goes on the towing list 
we have a rather aggressive system said william eubanks 
who instituted a computerized tracking system 12 years ago when he 
took charge of citys traffic violations bureau 
however towing cars can backfire about 15 percent of the cars 
impounded in grand rapids mich are never claimed by their owners 
then theres the device known as the denver boot it was first 
used there in 1955 which can be locked on the wheel of a 
scofflaws parked car immobilizing it until unpaid fines are 
cleared up 
san antonio texas last week joined such cities as los angeles 
philadelphia chicago washington and pittsburgh that use a boot 
kirby thomas a san antonio attorney refused to believe his car 
should have been booted the week before he said he had paid 
63 for six delinquent tickets 
however a check of city records showed that he owned a second 
car with eight overdue tickets thomas paid 89 in fines for his 
second car and 35 to remove the boot from the car he was driving 
a month earlier after a drop in the number of parking tickets 
issued by police was partly blamed for a city budget crisis 
houston began to use the boot to corral cars whose owners had three 
or more unpaid tickets 
on the first day the device was used 70 drivers were booted 
and had to pay 100 just to have the device removed 
cities also use the carrotandstick technique to encourage 
scofflaws to pay their fines 
chicago collected 5 million last year in an amnesty period that 
allowed delinquents to pay tickets at half price in st paul 
minn where an estimated 25 million in parking tickets is owed 
an amnesty program last year brought in about 140000 and miami 
owed a similar figure in tickets offers an annual amnesty period 
in which it waives late fees for those who pay up 
many cities do not know how much they collect or how much they 
are owed because of divided jurisdictions or because parking 
statistics are lumped in with other vehicular violations

the democratic presidential candidates want to 
increase pressure on south africa to force change in that nation 
while george bush generally favors pursuing the reagan 
administrations policies a survey says 
the investor responsibility research centers survey said the 
democrats jesse jackson michael dukakis and albert gore differ 
dramatically from bush the likely gop nominee on what us policy 
should be toward south africa and the region 
the center is a public policy group that tracks issues and 
investment in south africa a country where blacks are denied 
social and political rights through a system known as apartheid 
the countrys racial segregation has attracted interest in 
united states particularly among the black voters who have turned 
out in force for jackson 
jacksons successes in the primaries ensure that the candidates 
positions on south africa mozambique and angola will be 
scrutinized in 1988 
jackson who is black has long stressed support for the 
oppressed in south africa 
the survey which was based on the candidates statements and a 
questionnaire show that vice president bush for the most part 
endorses the policies the administration has pursued over the last 
seven years 
former television evangelist pat robertson bushs only rival 
for the gop nomination is the sole candidate seeking to repeal the 
1986 sanctions that congress slapped on whiteruled south africa 
robertson however has done poorly in the primaries and is not 
expected to win the nomination 
in contrast to the republicans the democrats want the united 
states to pursue a tougher line against south africa 
gore a tennessee senator who portrays himself a moderate is 
less extreme than jackson and dukakis the massachusetts governor 
the latter two agree on many points 
here is a breakdown of the candidates positions according to 
the survey 
</TEXT>

jackson and dukakis want additional sanctions against pretoria 
if south africa does not end its state of emergency release 
political prisoners remove the ban on the african national 
congress the outlawed political organization based in lusaka 
zambia and enter into negotiations to repeal the apartheid laws 
the two also have spoken in favor of us companies pulling out 
of south africa 
gore is more equivocal about more sanctions saying he would 
consider them if south africa shows no real and dramatic 
progress he said companies should make their own decisions on 
disinvestment 
bush would not recommend additional sanctions but he wouldnt 
repeal those put in place in 1986 the house is considering a 
sanctions bill that amounts to a total embargo on south africa 
bush suggests the use of diplomacy and negotiations for 
constructive change rather than impose additional sanctions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the democrats pledge to have routine dialogue with the anc they 
also say pretoria should negotiate with the anc and other groups 
bush says he would continue the reagan administrations periodic 
diplomatic contacts with the anc 
</TEXT>

dukakis and jackson want to stop us aid to the anticommunist 
unita rebels headed by jonas savimbi and if elected they would 
extend diplomatic recognition to the sovietbacked angolan 
government 
gore says he is troubled with the aid to the rebels but that 
they must be incorporated into a political settlement he does not 
promise to recognize the angolan government 
bush supports aid to the rebels as a way of blocking soviet 
encroachment in africa he would not recognize luanda in an effort 
to compel the angolans to begin talks with unita and expel 40000 
cuban troops from the country 
bush views the cuban troops as the most important obstacle to 
peace in the region dukakis and jackson say that a south african 
pullout from namibia could lead to a cuban withdrawal south africa 
maintains their troops in namibia to protect the country from the 
cubans in angola

pope john paul ii made an emotional plea for 
peace justice and human rights sunday in an easter message from a 
rainsoaked balcony overlooking 100000 people in st peters 
square 
after a solemn mass inside st peters basilica attended by 
us secretary of state george p shultz the pope wished the world 
a happy easter in 52 languages 
the mass usually held outdoors on the flowerdecked steps of 
st peters was moved inside christendoms largest church because 
of rain 
john paul then appeared on the churchs central balcony 
unprotected from the steady drizzle and addressed an estimated 
100000 people in the square and millions more following by 
television and radio around the world 
at the end of his traditional easter message urbi and orbi 
to the city of rome and the world the pope departed from his 
written text and made a special plea to the virgin mary 
pray for peace in the world for justice pray for the rights 
of man especially for religious freedom for every man for every 
christian and nonchristian pray for us john paul said 
speaking in italian in a strong emotional voice 
pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world the first 
world second third and fourth all the world he continued 
in yours and our easter joy we carry again this weight of 
humanity this weight of so many human hearts our brothers our 
sisters and we repeat pray for us 
later in another impromptu remark the pope thanked those 
following on television and radio and urged them to pray to mary 
and with mary for all the people all the families all the people 
who suffer especially for those countries where peace justice and 
the means are lacking 
earlier in his prepared message the pope also addressed his 
words to mary for whom he has a special devotion and dedicated the 
current marian year 
christ whom you bore is risen hallelujah said the pope 
wearing a white robe trimmed with gold and a tall gold bishops 
hat queen of heaven rejoice this is the day of the churchs 
easter joy we all share in your glory oh mother 
after a warm sundrenched early spring winter returned to rome 
this weekend with a cold rain drenching the capital sunday morning 
and dampening the spirits of the hundreds of thousands of tourists 
visiting the capital for easter 
it was decided at the last moment to move the easter sunday mass 
inside the basilica where the pope celebrated the service from an 
altar under the baldacchino the immense baroque canopy 
designed by bernini 
shultz an episcopalian and his wife helena a roman catholic 
were in the front row of the packed church mrs shultz was among 
those taking communion from the pope 
shultz left later in the day for israel on the first part of his 
new middle east peace shuttle in a private audience at the vatican 
on saturday the pope had given shultz his blessing for the mission 
a choir sang byzantine verses in the ancient slavic language 
paleoslavonic the first time they had been sung in rome at a papal 
ceremony since the ninth century 
vatican officials said it was meant to show solidarity with 
christians celebrating the 1000th anniversary of their faith in 
what is now the soviet union 
the crowd in the square broke into loud cheers and chants of 
viva il papa long live the pope when john paul keeping with 
tradition appeared on the balcony at noon to deliver his easter 
message and blessing 
afterwards the polyglot pope offered brief easter greetings in 
52 languages ranging from english to ukrainian to swahili 
the longest and final greeting was in his native polish 
addressed to all my fellow countrymen in my country and all 
around the world and to all those who in the midst of adversity and 
anxiety are trying to find a path

edwards retired a 4 million debt as backers almost tripped over 
each other to pay 10000 for the ride but tauzin said he will net 
only 250000 from his trip aboard the canada star which costs a 
mere 3000 to 6000 a head

also do something nice for those who worked with us the 
congressman said in a telephone interview from the tiny coastal 
town of chackbay last week 
with some wealthy backers paying for tickets they wont use 
tauzin said he is doling out their tickets to key people who worked 
in his 1987 campaign in all 250 people will set sail 
tauzin also sent letters to lobbyists telling them they would 
have a captive audience of several congressmen who were invited 
along free of charge he said he approached the house and senate 
ethics committee about the trip and the cruise organizers will 
follow the ethics rules strictly 
but tauzin said he wasnt sure how many would show up 
wayne smith a political consultant said about 30 cabins had 
been sold to washington politicians and businessmen as of last week 
the cruise tauzin said is no different from staging a cocktail 
party or dinner at a hotel to raise money to pay off campaign debts 
its a long extended cocktail party he said 
tauzin along with edwards lost the governorship last fall to 
buddy roemer who remains behind to deal with a debt no junket is 
likely to retire the almost bankrupt state owes 2 billion

new marker posts being installed along the 
oregon trail no longer bear bronze medallions because they have 
become the targets of thieves who fancy them as attractive 
ornaments for their belts 
the medallions were authorized by the wyoming historical society 
in the 1950s thieves also have taken medallions from markers on 
the mormon trail and the pony express route 
this has been happening all over the state because these 
trails run from border to border said bill mortimer of the 
bureau of land management the longer we leave them out there the 
more susceptible they are to vandalism 
there are still a few marker posts with medallions but mortimer 
said he doesnt know where they are 
and if i did know i probably wouldnt tell you he said

after investigators found four people shot 
to death at an athens farm and a 70yearold woman missing last 
july the sheriff said you find me helen and ill probably tell 
you what happened 
last week investigators found bones in a marsh that they 
believe are those of the missing helen kunz 
and now marathon county sheriff leroy schillinger says it will 
probably be some time before he can tell the public what happened 
no arrests have been made based on the discovery but taylor 
county chief deputy sheriff william breneman predicted there would 
be charges 
im not sure exactly how soon but theyre coming he said 
miss kunzs son kenneth says he arrived home after a night of 
drinking on july 5 and found his uncle two aunts and his brother 
dead each shot with a 22caliber weapon his mother was missing 
there was no reason for them to do this to my family 
kenneth kunz said last week after the discovery of the remains 
believed to be his mother i hope they find who done it 
investigators ruled out robbery as a motive after they found 
about 1000 in the home 
neighbors knew little about the family that lived on a 108acre 
farm in a wooden house off a dirt road in central wisconsin the 
family rarely invited people into the cluttered house but did most 
of their business at the door neighbors said kenneth kunz 55 
lived in a trailer next to the house 
the house had a wood stove and no indoor plumbing but merchants 
said helen kunz had bought a videocassette recorder and microwave 
oven for the family 
hardware store owner gale weiler said the woman also bought 
22caliber ammunition a few weeks before the killings and 
complained that her family watched dirty movies on the vcr she 
said the ammunition was for her younger son 30yearold randy 
kunz to shoot birds 
you find me helen and ill probably tell you what happened 
schillinger said just after the killings 
miss kunz who never married was described by people in town as 
the family matriarch who paid the bills and did laundry while randy 
waited in the car randy also accompanied her to high school sports 
games 
miss kunzs sisters irene 81 and marie 72 were seen less 
frequently by neighbors who remembered the women working in their 
garden and wearing oldfashioned clothes their brother clarence 
76 had been ill and had retired from farming 
as investigators probed the familys past questions of incest 
which first arose during a 1930s rape trial resurfaced and have 
yet to be solved 
lawyers raised the possibility of incest during the trial of a 
40year old neighbor whom helen kunz then 15 and pregnant had 
accused of attacking her her mother denied the incest accusations 
and the neighbor was convicted in 1933 of statutory rape 
kenneth kunz told the milwaukee sentinel in an interview after 
the killings that he thought clarence kunz was his father 
authorities based their identification of the remains found last 
week on clothing some tattered some scattered some with 
skeletal remains found in the marsh about 16 miles north of the 
kunz farm lt elwood mason said 
the bones and clothing were taken to the state crime laboratory 
in madison for forensic tests expected to take several days 
around six months after the killings police questioned several 
people and held a 21yearold man in jail over a weekend for 
interrogation but they released him without charges and no one 
else was arrested 
in midmarch investigators gathered reporters from as far away 
as minneapolis and milwaukee and escorted them to a manure pit 
where authorities dug for three days without finding any evidence 
police said a detective found the remains last week on the basis 
of information from an informant whom they would not identify 
mason and schillinger said there are more than one but fewer 
than a dozen suspects in the case but would not say if the 
discovery of the remains eliminated any suspects or drew their 
focus to anyone in particular 
i dont think it adds any new questions said mason who has 
been heading the investigation we may have eliminated some you 
dont know

thousands of roman catholics 
marched peacefully in northern ireland on sunday to commemorate the 
1916 easter rising against british rule in what is now the republic 
of ireland 
police abandoned a shortlived policy of staying away from 
funerals and other occasions organized by sympathizers of the 
outlawed irish republican army and mounted heavy patrols around the 
main march through the catholic ghettos of west belfast 
armored land rovers with officers riding shotgun drove at the 
head and tail of the milelong procession about 5000 people 
waving irish tricolor flags marched to the sound of pipe bands to 
the catholic milltown cemetery 
police reported no incidents at the parades in belfast 
londonderry the second largest city and 10 smaller centers across 
protestantdominated northern ireland 
british troops with rifles cocked also patrolled the west 
belfast route lined by catholics wearing orange green and white 
badges the tricolor colors embossed with a lily 
the flower is the symbol of the 1916 uprising in dublin the 
uprising led to independence six years later for the overwhelmingly 
catholic republic 
britain at the insistence of protestants in the north retained 
control of the six northern counties which now make up northern 
ireland 
the easter sunday parades marked the start of the annual 
marching season in northern ireland where protestants and catholics 
separately commemorate key dates of their troubled history 
protestant marches were due to begin monday 
in milltown cemetery where a protestant gunman killed three 
people in a march 16 attack on an unpoliced ira funeral police 
ringed marchers as they thronged round a memorial to guerrillas 
killed in the iras bombandbullet campaign to end british rule 
we have a message for the british government said martin 
mcguinness vice president of sinn fein the iras legal political 
wing 
we will demoralize you we will make your six counties into a 
millstone which will strangle you 
police stared silently as the crowd burst into applause when 
mcguinness declared 
our strategy is to sap the political will of the british 
government and the british people to remain in ireland the means 
are limited guerrilla warfare against the crown forces 
the royal ulster constabulary ended its nopolicing policy after 
an upsurge of sectarian violence last month culminated in the 
murder of two british soldiers who drove into an ira funeral march 
19 
sundays march passed close to the spot where the two signals 
corpsmen in plainclothes were dragged from their car by the 
funeral mob beaten and then shot by ira gunmen 
the spate of killings in which 12 people died began march 6 
when british commandos fatally shot three unarmed ira guerrillas 
who were on a bombing mission in the british colony of gibraltar 
a total of 2638 people have been killed since sectarian 
violence erupted in 1969 
mcguinness denied published reports that the ira is considering 
abandoning violence 
the ira position has been on the record for years he told 
reporters they have stated there will be no more ceasefires

liberals and conservatives often at 
loggerheads on social programs are in rare agreement on expanding 
eight childrens programs citing independent research that shows 
the programs work well and save the government money 
a report released this weekend by the house select committee on 
children youth and families cites specific costs and benefits of 
each program as determined by independent research and analysis 
the findings have convinced liberals and conservatives that they 
can be both compassionate and costconscious said rep dan coates 
rind the senior republican on the committee 
were working toward a consensus here coates said ive 
seen a decided change in attitude on the republican side about 
how we should approach the process of spending 
whereas there was wholesale sparenoprogram cutting in the 
early years of the reagan presidency coates said members are more 
discriminating now and willing to spend money on programs that work 
absent these standards you dont get new money said rep 
george miller dcalif chairman of the childrens committee and a 
member of the house budget committee 
miller said the house budget resolution provides several hundred 
million dollars in increases above inflation for the eight 
education health nutrition and employment programs 
the report released this weekend is an update of a 1985 report 
and contains 25 additional studies that reinforce the original 
findings 
this update gives more credence to the initial effort it can 
serve as a very important guideline to the new administration 
coates said 
the report discusses research findings by universities 
government agencies and other sources in the areas of medicaid 
supplemental nutrition for pregnant women infants and children 
wic youth employment preschool education compensatory 
education handicapped education prenatal care and immunizations 
miller said the report and the update were prompted by the 
skeptical proveit reaction encountered by advocates when they 
argued that shortterm investments would produce longterm savings 
he said the initial compilation was instrumental in persuading 
lawmakers to stop cutting those programs and led to increased 
spending on them in subsequent years 
the key is to back it up with research coates said 
the largest childprogram increases in the house budget 
resolution a nonbinding spending blueprint include 210 
million for the compensatory education program for children at 
academic risk and 170 million for handicapped education other 
substantial hikes would go to the wic program 150 million and 
head start 77 million 
among the newer findings cited in the report 
national math and reading rankings of students in the 
compensatory education program increased in every grade except 12th 
it costs only 500 to provide a year of compensatory education 
to a student at risk of academic failure while it costs more than 
3000 for a student to repeat a grade 
a pregnant woman not participating in wic increased her chances 
of having a lowbirthweight highrisk baby by 60 percent in one 
north carolina county 
for every 1 spent on wic in missouri about 49 cents was saved 
the incidence of nutritional anemia virtually disappeared at an 
inner city health center from 1971 to 1984 the researcher said 95 
percent enrollment in wic probably was the reason 
for every dollar spent on childhood immunization the 
government saves 10 in medical costs

for 10 months paroled 
rapistmutilator lawrence singleton has lived a hermitlike 
existence in a trailer at the state prison the only place 
authorities could find for him after he was driven out of town 
after town 
on april 25 his parole and his stay at san quentin will 
come to an end singleton will be able to walk away a free man 
under no obligation to tell officials where he will settle 
the 60yearold exconvict bears little resemblance to the 
burly harddrinking exsailor convicted of raping and sodomizing 
15yearold hitchhiker mary vincent in 1978 and chopping off her 
forearms with an ax 
today he lives on a small social security grant and spends his 
days tending the yard around his trailer in a remote corner of the 
1000acre prison grounds 
although not formally under guard he observes a 10 pm to 6 
am curfew and is watched by at least one parole officer when he 
leaves the grounds for weekly visits to a psychologist officials 
said 
when he wants to go shopping he asks us because he has no 
transportation said ronald chun regional parole administrator 
for the department of corrections technically we have him under 
surveillance he can walk around on his own but for all practical 
purposes we are escorting him 
if it werent for the press calls we wouldnt know he was out 
there said prison spokesman dave langerman out of sight is 
out of mind anyone out on the streets has more to fear from the 
unknown the guy with the tattoo next to them in the supermarket 
than from this poor little burnedout guy under escort 
singleton does not grant interviews but has had occasional 
visitors including exwife mary collins a retired nurse who 
offered him a home but was refused by parole authorities said 
michael van winkle a corrections spokesman 
singleton served nine years 11 months of a 14year fourmonth 
sentence in the california mens colony at san luis obispo 
receiving an early release for good behavior and through a 
workcredit program chun said 
the early release infuriated residents of a halfdozen small 
communities where authorities tried to place singleton last spring 
in rodeo about 25 miles northeast of san francisco a mob of 500 
people forced officers to move singleton under armed guard from a 
hotel room 
finally in june gov george deukmejian ordered singleton 
placed at san quentin for the duration of his oneyear parole 
once his parole ends singleton is under no obligation to tell 
officials whether he will settle in florida near relatives or 
elsewhere chun said 
i hope he goes to florida the victim and her parents will 
feel much better knowing he is gone said nancy fahden a contra 
costa county supervisor who fought singletons release to her 
county 
vincent who now has a child declined to be interviewed but 
said last year before singleton was paroled that she still fears 
her attacker 
as a condition of his parole singleton takes a drug that would 
make him extremely ill from any amount of alcohol even if splashed 
on in an aftershave lotion langerman said 
he is completely absolutely defused as a threat to society 
the spokesman said if he takes a drink he will fall down 
retching so you dont have to worry about him going on a bender 
and going out looking for a hitchhiker 
but once singletons parole ends he is not required to continue 
the drug called disulfiram chun said 
yes there is a concern he claims he doesnt really need it 
he doesnt lose that much control according to him chun said 
singleton maintains as he did at his trial that he is innocent 
and was mistaken for another man 
i think if anything hes worse now said donald stahl the 
stanislaus county prosecutor at singletons trial 
he has not taken responsibility stahl said he lives in a 
bizarre fantasy land and acquits himself each day he doesnt 
accept his guilt and resolve never to do it again

leg in january and her eyesight was failing but she seemed to be 
doing well under the circumstances the family said 
she died feb 1 just hours after having dinner with tonys

about diabetes his mother said hes a nice sensitive kid who

a senior iranian official said sunday that 
iran would retaliate for iraqs renewed attacks on iranian cities 
by launching new ground offensives 
iran also revealed that a month of iraqi air and missile attacks 
on iranian cities has left 1145 people dead and another 4000 
wounded 
deputy foreign minister mohammad javad larijani said any 
suggestion that the war of the cities could change the military 
balance is a joke 
they sent more than 100 missiles into tehran and that could 
not change anything he added by iraqi count 105 missiles have 
been fired into the iranian capital 
larijani said an iraqi raid on the northeastern city of tabriz 
330 miles northwest of tehran killed at least 10 civilians and 
wounded 15 others on sunday 
irans official news media earlier had reported the warplane 
raid as well as another air attack on the central city of isfahan 
the raids followed a 2day lull in iraqi attacks on iranian 
cities during a visit to baghdad by turkish prime minister turgut 
ozal iran also had largely ceased its attacks on iraqi cities 
asked whether iran would retaliate for the new raids larijani 
said we will have plenty of surprises for them but made it 
plain that these would come chiefly in the battlefield through 
punitive offensives 
these offensives will stop them definitely and they will pay 
a high price he told a news conference attended by the 
associated press 
iran periodically allows western reporters to travel to tehran 
he also said iran has anything that is needed to prevent the 
iraqis from using chemical weapons against iranian cities he did 
not elaborate 
for just over a month iraq has been pounding the iranian capital 
with al hussein missiles which it says were made in iraq 
western analysts say they are sovietmade scudbs with boosters 
to give them extra range to travel the 290 miles to tehran 
larijani who is a deputy foreign minister for economic and 
international relations is to meet on wednesday with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar as part of international 
efforts to end the 7yearold war 
he said iran would continue these discussions in a cooperative 
mood but reiterated irans demand for a condemnation of iraq as 
the aggressor in the war 
we are insisting that baghdad be held accountable for a 
long list of criminal actions he said we are going to ask for 
every bit of our rights 
in an earlier meeting with western reporters kamal kharrazi 
directorgeneral of irans war information headquarters said said 
irans valfajr10 offensive in mountainous northeastern iraq had 
achieved its objectives and ended after winning control of about 
390 square miles of iraqi territory 
a western diplomatic source said he understood that the iraqis 
had began a counteroffensive with the aim of recapturing the town 
of halabja 
iraqi reportedly attacked halabja with chemical weapons after 
iran took it in march 
a visit to the halabja area for western newsmen which had been 
scheduled for monday was put off without explanation no new date 
was given 
iran claims 5000 kurds were killed and another 5000 injured in 
the chemical attacks march 1617 iraq has repeatedly denied using 
chemical weapons but also has stressed it is ready to use any 
weapons at its disposal to defend iraqi soil

anticommunist afghan rebel leaders 
say the united states has stopped supplying stinger antiaircraft 
missiles to the guerrillas in apparent anticipation of a settlement 
of the afghan civil war 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze arriving sunday 
in kabul to confer with afghan government leaders said the united 
states and pakistan were blocking talks in geneva aimed at ending 
the eightyear war 
mohamad nabi mohamadi leader of the harekat islami one of the 
seven guerrilla groups fighting communist forces in afghanistan 
said the rebels have not been receiving the shoulderlaunched 
missiles for the last four or five months 
we are extremely worried nabi mohamadi told the associated 
press in a weekend interview at his headquarters in the pakistani 
border city of peshawar 
we dont trust the russians we are afraid because they are 
deceitful and sly he said referring to soviet claims that they 
want to withdraw their estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan 
however two other guerrilla leaders said the supply of stingers 
had not stopped 
the official soviet tass news agency said in a commentary that 
peace could be brought to afghanistan without us agreement on a 
plan to settle the war 
the commentary indicates that the kremlin may be willing to sign 
a settlement in geneva without american assurances that it will 
stop shipping weapons to afghan rebels 
the united states has said it will halt military aid to the 
rebels only when the soviets stop aiding the communist government 
in kabul 
soviet officials contend that economic and military assistance 
to the afghanistan government is a bilateral matter outside the 
scope of the geneva peace talks 
shevardnadze told tass that his discussions with afghan 
president najib would center on the problems delaying an end to the 
war 
unfortunately serious difficulties have developed at these 
talks because of the nonconstructive position taken by pakistan 
and the united states the 60yearold foreign minister said 
according to tass 
in geneva the un talks recessed thursday for the easter 
holiday and were to resume monday pakistan represents the rebels 
in the talks 
soviet officials had placed high hopes on getting a peace 
agreement out of the current round of negotiations that began march 
2 but the talks have stalled over the question of foreign military 
assistance to the two sides 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
communist government battle the insurgents western analysts say at 
least 10000 soviet soldiers have been killed in afghanistan and 
more than 20000 wounded 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev offered in february to begin 
the pullout on may 15 if the settlement plan was signed by march 
15 that informal deadline was surpassed when new issues arose at 
the geneva talks 
the washington post reported last week that the us government 
intended to stop supplying the rebels with stingers which are said 
to have dramatically improved the guerrillas air defenses since 
they first acquired the deadly missiles in late 1986 
the newspaper quoting unidentified diplomatic sources said 
reagan administration was nervous about leaving a large number of 
the missiles in the hands of afghan factions that cannot be 
controlled after us ties are cut some of the missiles have made 
their way to iran 
in peshawar nabi mohamadi said he assumed the united states 
stopped the missile shipment because of the possible soviet 
withdrawal he said he believed the supplies would resume if the 
soviets failed to leave afghanistan 
but sebghatollah mojadeddi head of the afghan national 
liberation front which is considered moderate said no halt had 
been confirmed 
the united states has promised that it will not leave us alone 
and as long as the russians help the kabul government they will 
continue helping us mojaddedi said in an interview 
ahmad gilani leader of the national islamic front of 
afghanistan said i know that they have not halted the 
stingers 
ahmad shah whom the guerrillas have chosen to head a rebel 
interim government in afghanistan if the soviets leave said the 
halt in the stingers would not deter the guerrillas from battling 
the communists 
we never asked for stingers he said this was their 
decision when we didnt have the stingers we still were 
fighting and shooting down enemy planes 
yunis khalis leader of the hezbi islami rebel group declined 
to confirm that the supply of stingers had been halted but he 
charged the americans were helping the rebels only to serve their 
own interests 
we never stretched our hands out to america for military 
help khalis said 
khalis said that even without us aid the rebels will 
continue their battle

a soviet customs inspector became suspicious of an 
african couple because of their roundabout travel route and found 
10 million worth of heroin packed inside their suitcases a 
newspaper said sunday 
police arrested the couple from cotonou benin after the 
incident at moscows sheremetyevo airport komsomolskaya pravda 
reported 
the newspaper did not say when the alleged smuggling attempt 
occurred or whether the pair had been formally charged 
it said more than 32 pounds of heroin was found in five 
suitcases carried by the couple komsomolskaya pravda said the 
drugs would have a black market value of about 10 million 
customs inspector vyacheslav chugunov was credited by the 
newspaper with discovering the narcotics 
chugunov told the newspaper he became suspicious of the couple 
when he noticed they were passing through moscow on a trip home 
from new delhi which he said was far from the shortest or simplest 
route 
in recent years there have been several cases of foreigners 
arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs through sheremetyevo 
airport they generally believe that arrival from moscow attracts 
less attention from customs agents at their final destination

after highstepping past allegations of 
cruelty and abuse for over three decades the tennessee walking 
horse industry may be stopped in its tracks by a federal court 
ruling officials say 
based on the decision of a washington district judge the us 
department of agriculture banned the stacked shoes and limited the 
weight of leg chains used to give the show horses their flamboyant 
stride 
the move has crippled the walking horse industry said mack 
motes president of the walking horse trainers association which 
plans to help fight the court decision 
were trying to save our breed motes said 
several shows in alabama and tennessee have been canceled since 
the regulations were announced two weeks ago and things look grim 
for the tennessee walking horse national celebration the annual 
10day show scheduled for late this summer in shelbyville 
typically attracts more than 2000 horses from across the country 
and is considered the world series of the breed 
i dont think the celebration could go this year said 
frederick harper an animal scientist with the university of 
tennessee agricultural extension service 
us district judge oliver gasch ordered the new regulations in 
a suit filed by the american horse protection association against 
the agriculture department 
the rules forbid the use of braceletlike chains weighing more 
than 6 ounces and padded shoes for racking and walking horses 
chains of up to 10 ounces and stacked shoes 4 inches high had been 
allowed 
the special shoes and chains are needed to keep the walking 
horse industry on its feet proponents say 
a horse on stacked shoes gives a better show that old 
horse really gets into it said reese smith jr spokesman of 
friends of the show horse 
but animal protection activists say chains can cause soreness 
and swelling of the leg and that padded shoes which cover the 
horses hooves help hide sores they also can hide objects that 
are placed between the horses hooves and the shoes to cause the 
animals pain said russ gaspar general counsel for the american 
horse protection association 
many in the industry say they are being penalized for abuses 
long since corrected including the use of chemical irritants in 
the 1960s 
irritants placed above the hoof combined with chains to make 
horses lift their feet up and out in a flamboyant gait called the 
big lick but they also gave the animals raw sores 
their widespread use helped push congress to pass the horse 
protection act of 1970 which banned irritants and other soring 
practices and prompted the industry to form an elaborate inspection 
system for each show 
motes said the industry isnt causing sores now and added that 
98 percent of horses inspected over the past five years have passed 
nevertheless the judge ruled that horse protection group had 
raised doubts about the accuracy of show inspections in the suit 
usda spokeswoman nancy robinson said the department on friday 
asked gasch whether the industry could keep using the devices while 
the department sets final rules which could take two months or 
more 
smith whose organization has raised over 400000 and hired 
lawyers to fight the court decision said industry groups do not 
know yet exactly how they will fight the decision but they expect 
to challenge it in court 
harper estimates the states economy would lose about 140 
million in one year if walking horse shows were wiped out there 
are about 500 shows in the state each year mostly to benefit 
charities he said 
the walking horse is the only show horse that really attracts 
people theyre exciting smith said we have a special horse 
and were treated special especially bad

michael dukakis says he will criticize fellow 
democratic hopeful jesse jackson on occasion but refrained from 
doing so on sunday he also said no one knows whether jackson is 
could win against vice president george bush 
dukakis argued that the voters are not interested in fellow 
democrat albert gore jrs criticisms of himself and jackson and 
rejected suggestions that criticism of jackson would help indicate 
what his own values are 
why is that a test of ones presidential qualities he asked 
reporters outside of st constantine church here 
i disagree with jesse jacksonand i have expressed those 
disagreements and will in the future but i dont think the 
american people have the slightest interest in what al gore thinks 
of him or of me dukakis added 
gore a tennessee senator criticized jackson sharply last week 
on foreign policy and experience dukakis hesitated to do the same 
but said there are several areas in which he and jackson have 
policy disagreements 
the massachusetts governor visited three churches on easter 
sunday before picking up his campaigning for votes in tuesdays 
wisconsin primary 
he dropped in on services at an allblack church and served fish 
and fries at a sunday supper he also attended services at 
annuciation greek orthodox church which was celebrating palm 
sunday under his churchs calendar then dukakis flew to a farm in 
northern wisconsin before wrapping up his day in madison 
the democratic hopeful was pressed on his judgment of jacksons 
electability a matter of concern to many democratic leaders the 
two men are locked in a tight race in wisconsin 
asked if either he or jackson could beat bush he answered 
yes but i think i have best chance of doing soi think george 
bush is beatable id like to be able to run against him 
then dukakis was asked if he disagrees with democrats who say 
jackson is unelectable in november 
i dont think there is any way of telling based on what we 
have seen over the past yearthere are no sure things dukakis 
said 
asked about the subject again later he said i make no 
predictions 
i do think im the strongest candidate against bush i think i 
can take the fight to him i think i can build a very broad 
coalition with people who want somebody who has the skill and 
the ability and the experience to do this job who has balanced 
budgetswho has a record thats my strength in this race 
in the last analysis what we want is a victory he added 
dukakis is leading in the latest polls in wisconsin but he said 
that is meaningless 
i dont pay attention to polls there were all kinds of polls 
in michigan that said i was ahead its on tuesday that the people 
of this state will decide who will be the strongest nominee and 
best president he said 
jackson beat dukakis 21 in the michigan caucuses on march 26 
after dukakis was leading in the polls there 
dukakis said he was going to continue to emphasize his positive 
message and avoid attacks on other candidates unless he is first 
attacked he said that approach is working for both him and jackson 
i think it is significant that the two of us who are positive 
and hopeful and optimistic about this country are also leading in 
this race dukakis said 
dukakis mentioned three disagreements with jackson middle east 
policy oil import fees and how to provide health insurance for all 
americans

secretary of state george p shultz launching 
a fresh us peace venture told israel sunday night to act on his 
plan for negotiations for palestinian selfrule 
negotiations work he said in a strong arrival statement 
the time to act on it is now 
shultz said the palestinians must be included in the talks and 
negotiations must be based on a 1967 united nations resolution that 
calls on israel to give up territory in exchange for arab 
recognition 
shultz acknowledged that the plan he presented last month to 
arab and israeli leaders on a swing through the region was 
difficult for everyone 
but he said that the balance in our approach is evident and 
that picking on objectionable parts is to take a road labeled 
delay and frustration 
his message was intended for israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir who on a trip to washington in midmarch condemned shultzs 
call for an international peace conference 
shultz quoting from ecclesiastes said there is a time of war 
and time of peace 
he said this is the time and the season to move decisively 
towards peace 
the conference would be held this month as a way of launching 
negotiations on may 1 to provide some selfrule for the 15 million 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
but shamir objected that it could provide an active and 
meddlesome role for the soviet union who usually back arab 
positions and broke diplomatic relations with israel 21 years ago 
on a tour of the troubled west bank shamir again took a stiff 
stand sunday he said he expected no breakthrough in his talks with 
shultz that begin monday 
he again dismissed the conference proposal saying shultz should 
explain to him why direct talks are not possible without such a 
multiparty meeting 
israel would deal in the negotiations with a joint 
jordanianpalestinian delegation to work out a threeyear interim 
arrangement for the occupied areas meanwhile negotiations on the 
overall settlement of the arabisraeli conflict would begin in 
december 
foreign minister shimon peres who favors the approach greeted 
shultz and his wife enthusiastically at the ben gurion 
international airport near tel aviv 
adressing them as george and helena peres invited them to 
join in this passover season in prayers for peace 
we shall pray knowing there is no easy way to peace the 
obstacles are so many and the light so dim peres said but he 
said it is our duty to provide a green light 
peres said israel was still looking for palestinians to agree to 
enter the process 
stones are not messages and messages do not need the threat of 
stones he said referring to the four months of antiisraeli 
protests which have claimed the lives of 136 palestinians and one 
israeli soldier

mark spreyer doesnt mind when people say his job 
is for the birds even his business cards read mark spreyer the 
naturalist nobody likes defending the species nobody wants 
starlings my speciality 
spreyer never meant to become an advocate for one of the 
nations leastliked birds but the 31yearold ornithologist for 
the chicago academy of sciences thinks theyre getting a bad rap as 
messy invaders who take over other birds turf 
he recently delivered a lecture titled in defense of 
starlings before the national wildlife rehabilitators association 
in denver and he has also spoken on the birds behalf in new york 
and orlando fla 
he even has one for a pet rod starling shares spreyers 
suburban barrington apartment has learned to talk and has been 
known to fly to the telephone when it rings and get the receiver 
off the hook 
some of spreyers enthusiasm has caught on according to a local 
veterinarian peregrine wolff interviewed by the chicago suntimes 
recently after encountering spreyers pet 
my opinion of starlings was not very high before i met this 
bird said ms wolff who said rod imitated spreyers telephone 
bell and answeringmachine beep and then in a hitchcockian twist 
said clearly this is mark spreyer 
starlings are related to talking myna birds and spreyer said 
sunday their talent as mimics helped them wing their way into his 
heart im embarrassed to admit it now but eight years ago i 
used to consider them as owl food said spreyer 
spreyer became better acquainted with starlings two years ago 
while preparing for a lecture on urban wildlife which includes 
other european imports such as house sparrows and pigeons 
people are trained to think all introduced things are bad and 
all native things are good spreyer said sunday ive come to 
realize that we have to deal with the environment as it is today 
starlings which often gather in large noisy flocks have 
gotten an undeservedly bad reputation as messmakers and nuisances 
while their good points are overlooked he said 
the black songbirds use a completely different food source than 
other birds he said 
while most birds have strong squeezing muscles in their beaks to 
enable them to crack nuts for example starlings have mighty 
muscles for prying things open adapting them perfectly for digging 
up cutworms and other pests 
groundskeepers at some golf courses welcome starlings which 
reduce the need for pesticides spreyer said 
there are plenty of other birds that make a mess and the 
starlings reputation for displacing native birds with aggressive 
nesting habits is overblown he said 
some critics remain unconvinced including ron ogden illinois 
director of animaldamage control for the us department of 
agriculture 
theyve gotten a bad rap because theyre bad birds he told 
the suntimes i cant believe anybody would be talking up 
starlings after all the damage theyve caused i know mark i 
like him but he doesnt have to deal with them every day like i 
do they give me fits 
ogden said crews have been pruning trees around the old state 
capitol in springfield to evict nonnative starlings whose 
droppings made a teetotal mess

democrat jesse jackson preached easter 
sermons to huge white black and hispanic crowds sunday invoking 
the memory of martin luther king jr and declaring hope has been 
unleashed 
there is a sense of hope and renewal in the air jackson 
told a largely hispanic catholic congregation where hundreds stood 
outside not an easter of eggs and rabbits and ruffled dresses 
but an easter of authentic hope and renewal shaking of shackles 
jackson repeatedly referred to the crucifixion of jesus christ 
and compared his death to that of king the civil rights leader 
slain 20 years ago monday in memphis 
dr king and jesus government set the climates for their 
killings he said dr king got in trouble with our 
government for ending apartheid 
he compared the crucifixion as well to the suffering of the 
poor and used the symbolism of easter and the resurrection in 
describing the end of president reagans administration 
the real easter is going on jackson said we survived 
seven years of midnight 
jackson was campaigning a second day in colorado where 
democrats express a choice for president in statewide caucuses 
monday night that will apportion 45 delegates 
as jackson was met with large enthusiastic crowds his campaign 
manager california assembly speaker willie brown said in a tv 
interview that the jackson forces are ready for the closer scrutiny 
that comes with a candidates emergence as a frontrunner 
what jesse jackson has done during the course of the last four 
or five months people have not paid close attention to him 
have not asked him whole lots of questions hes been in a 
position where he is really prepared his answers hes prepared 
himself to respond to any questions put to him brown said on the 
abctv this week with david brinkley program 
jackson is smart he has observed and he is ready to be 
looked at really closely far more closely than he has been looked 
at in the past 
brown also said that there is a new jackson who has shown 
phenomenal growth since his 1984 campaign 
jackson on sunday spoke at denvers predominantly white first 
baptist church where a joint service was held with the 
predominantly black shorter african methodist episcopal church 
some 1500 people crowded the church and watched on television from 
the basement and at least as many stood outside in the warm sun 
listening on loudspeakers 
he then went to our lady of guadalupe catholic church in a 
predominantly hispanic working class neighborhood the church was 
jammed and hundreds lined up for a block a halfdozen deep to 
catch a glimpse of the candidate 
denver mayor federico pena sat with jackson at the catholic 
church 
why are so many people here today jackson asked the 
congregation because hope has been let loose 
jackson was met with similarly large and enthusiastic crowds 
saturday in three other colorado cities including the affluent ski 
resort aspen 
i sense as i travel around the nation something is going 
on he said at first baptist church there are several thousand 
people outdoors something is going on from aspen to alabama 
something is going on 
sitting in the front row was gary hart the former colorado 
senator who dropped out of the presidential race accompanied by 
his wife lee and daughter andrea 
neither hart nor pena has endorsed jackson reading one of the 
old testament lessons at the first church was the state democratic 
party chairman buie seawell who is backing michael dukakis against 
jackson for the democratic presidential nomination 
jackson delivered sermons heavy with biblical references but 
blended with it political references to himself and criticism of 
president reagan the congregations responded with shouts and 
applause 
one of his standard political lines got applause at the catholic 
church 
i would rather have roosevelt in a wheelchair than reagan on a 
horse he said

rep samuel stratton says hes endorsing 
gov mario cuomo for president despite cuomos insistence that 
hes not a candidate 
the only really outstanding candidate thats going to help the 
democratic party is mario cuomo and the sooner he recognizes that 
and the democratic party recognizes that were headed for 
victory the veteran albanyarea congressman said 
stratton said in a weekend radio interview he would back the bid 
of former westchester county congressman richard ottinger whos 
urging voters in new yorks april 19 democratic primary to vote for 
an uncommitted slate with the hope cuomo will change his mind 
he said he knows a fantastic number of people in the albany 
area who want to see him as a presidential candidate 
with his entry into the race we would have a very exciting 
finish said stratton 
he said he had little hope for the democratic party if no one 
else emerges besides frontrunners michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
if thats all its going to be we might as well throw the 
race he said

wisconsins republican members of congress say 
vice president george bush will fare exceptionally well in 
novembers general election simply because the democrats feel he is 
the weakest candidate 
he will do better than people expect he will be stronger and 
more tenacious said rep steve gunderson who shifted his 
support from sen bob dole of kansas to bush after dole dropped 
out of the gop race 
rep toby roth who has not endorsed anyone in wisconsins 
presidential primary tuesday agreed with gunderson that the 
democrats perception of bush will be advantageous 
remember 1980 all the democrats were saying they hoped the 
republicans would nominate ronald reagan hed be the easiest to 
beat roth said so we nominated reagan and the democrats 
didnt even come within striking distance 
roth said the continuation of a sound economy low interest 
rates and lack of american involvement in shooting war would 
help bush win the general election 
rep thomas petri said bushs ability to differentiate himself 
from reagan policy and speak out more clearly on domestic issues 
so he can use the election as a mandate for policy change will be 
the key to a bush victory 
times have changed and so the emphasis and the issues must 
change he must differentiate himself from reagan said petri 
who endorsed bushs candidacy nearly a year ago

cardinal miguel obando y bravo prayed 
sunday during the easter mass for a definitive truce in the 
6yearold civil war and a passage from war to life 
the roman catholic prelate also announced after speaking with 
representatives of the government and rebels that peace talks 
scheduled to open wednesday in managua had been postponed until 
april 12 
a 60day ceasefire signed march 23 went into effect friday and 
the defense ministry said sunday there were no reports of 
violations 
the rebels nicaraguan resistance alliance on saturday insisted 
the meeting set for wednesday be postponed for a week saying 
technical talks to work out the mechanics for the ceasefire had 
net been resolved 
obando y bravo who is an observer at the peace negotiations 
told the nearly 300 people who attended mass at the small las 
sierritas church that the oneweek delay of the talks is sad for 
our people 
he told the worshipers the new round of peace talks had been 
delayed because the rebels known as contras said the sandinista 
government had not complied with the plan signed by both sides at 
meetings last month in the border outpost of sapoa 
but the cardinal said he is satisfied with the progress in the 
negotiations and i have a lot of hope on this easter sunday 
enough of death a step toward life he said as members of 
the congregation applauded and cheered 
military officers from the government and nicaraguan resistance 
met march 2829 in sapoa and agreed to set up five zones in which 
the contra combatants would gather as part of the truce 
they did not however establish in detail the zones or security 
measure for the rebels 
contra leader adolfo calero said saturday night in a telephone 
interview from miami we are living up to the accord however the 
reason we asked for a delay in the talks is that the zones have yet 
to be established and there are many details 
the rebels also said the sandinistas had not freed all the 
prisoners requested by the contras when the government released 100 
political prisoners march 29 the ceasefire plan calls for the 
gradual release of 3300 political prisoners 
in another complaint the contras said the government had 
violated the provision of the plan that provides for unrestricted 
freedom of expression by withholding newsprint to the opposition 
newspaper la prensa newsprint like other imported items is in 
short supply 
la prensa in its march 26 edition said it would not publish 
during holy week 
progovernment newspapers also havent published papers since 
wednesday because of the holidays 
horacio ruiz a la prensa editor said sunday the paper would 
publish monday with stockpiled paper 
government offices and most businesses and restaurants have been 
closed since wednesday afternoon 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco in a fridaydated 
letter to contra leader aristides sanchez said it was extremely 
important to follow the outline of the ceasefire plan referring 
to the talks that had been scheduled for wednesday 
tinoco blamed the contras for the lack of progress during the 
technical meetings saying the rebel delegation arrived late on the 
first day and insisted on ending the talks promptly at 5 pm on 
the second day 
the two sides planned to hold another round of technical 
negotiations starting tuesday at sapoa 90 miles south of the 
capital on the border with costa rica 
under the truce plan contra combatants are to move into 
designated zones during the first two weeks of april there would 
be a second release of political prisoners after it was verified 
the rebels were in the zones

voters on tuesday will choose a fresh face to 
occupy the mayors office in a closely contested race that marks 
the end of incumbent mayor henry maiers reign of nearly three 
decades 
maier has held his office since 1960 longer than any other 
bigcity mayor in the country the 70yearold maier cited his age 
as reason for not running for another term 
the two contenders vying for his job are state sen john 
norquist 38 and former acting gov martin schreiber 48 the race 
is nonpartisan both contenders have run for other offices in the 
past as democrats 
when the campaign began polls put norquist well behind but his 
support grew and he finished 4 percentage points behind schreiber 
in the february primary recent polls put the race a dead heat 
during maiers tenure the city enjoyed a downtown renaissance 
but suffered from lingering racial divisions and his performance 
received mixed reviews from the two candidates 
the good thing about him is that hes strong and he makes 
decisions and deep down inside he cares deeply about the city 
norquist said but he had trouble dealing with his enemies 
dealing with his critics i think henry would take criticism too 
much as a personal criticism 
schreiber meanwhile said maier has established an excellent 
foundation on which we can build 
both candidates praised the downtown revitalization but they 
noted more attention should go toward the innercity neighborhoods 
which hold the potentially key black vote about onefourth of the 
citys 600000 residents are black 
schreiber won the endorsement of a black convention organized by 
the thirdplace finisher in the mayoral primary lee holloway 
norquist boycotted the event objecting to a 20 admission fee 
charged by holloway to help retire his campaign debt 
but norquist may be able to draw on support from key members of 
the black community including alderman michael mcgee and state 
sen gary george 
the biggest single economic problem that we have is the high 
black unemployment rate norquist said the federal bureau of 
labor statistics reported in 1985 that black unemployment in the 
milwaukee metropolitan area was about 28 percent 
the race between schreiber and norquist has centered as much on 
their personalities as it has on the issues where the two 
candidates often sound similar 
schreiber cultivated an image of being a likable candidate who 
as mayor would bring together different factions to address the 
citys problems and promote harmony 
but he is criticized for trying to please too many people and 
making promises on issues without having all the facts 
for example schreiber won the endorsement of the primarys 
fourthplace finisher donna horowitz richards when he announced 
support of her proposed development programs for neighborhoods 
but he then was unable to answer certain questions about the 
plan and afterward he backed off his position saying he would 
promise to study the ideas 
i am not a hotshot and i dont have all the answers 
schreiber said all of my strengths and all of my successes have 
been brought about by getting people around the table and talking 
about an issue and then developing a plan 
norquist portrayed himself as a takecharge candidate who offers 
detailed programs but he has been criticized for being too 
strident which schreiber insists proves his opponents 
instability 
while norquist says he has tried to tone down emotions he adds 
a mayor ought to be able to get angry especially when its 
something that affects the city 
schreiber was elected lieutenant governor 1970 after eight years 
in the state senate he became acting governor in 1977 when gov 
patrick lucey resigned to become ambassador to mexico but the 
following year schreiber lost the general election for a full term 
as governor to his republican challenger 
norquist at 6foot7 nearly a foot taller than schreiber 
served in the state assembly from 1974 to 1982 when he was elected 
to the senate

iraqi troops killed 400 kurdish civilians 
who had been injured in a chemicalbomb attack and were trying to 
reach a hospital a kurdish guerrilla leader said sunday 
the report could not be independently confirmed neither iraq 
nor iran which backs the iraqi kurdish separatists had immediate 
comment 
iraq meanwhile said its warplanes raided two iranian 
refineries sunday but iran said the bombs hit residential areas 
killing 10 civilians and wounding 50 
in tehran a senior official told reporters iran would respond 
to the renewed attacks on his nations cities with ground 
offensives 
kurdish guerrilla leader jalal talabani said the 400 civilians 
from the mountainous qara dagh district were wounded in an iraqi 
chemical raid 
talabani leader of the patriotic union of kurdistan said the 
wounded were traveling to a hospital in the northeastern city of 
sulaymaniyah when they were taken prisoner by iraqi soldiers and 
killed on saturday 
talabani is in london and made the accusation in a telephoned 
statement 
kurdish separatists have been fighting the iraqi government for 
decades for an independent homeland 
qara dagh is 20 miles west of lake darbandikhan where iran 
claims iraqi chemical bombings march 1617 killed 5000 civilians 
and injured many more a senior iraqi official on sunday repeated 
the claim that un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is 
biased toward iran 
akram alwitri chief of the legal department at the foreign 
ministry told a news conference we have been patient but now we 
are fed up with perez de cuellar and other top un officials who 
are appeasing iran for their self interest

soldiers forced him to climb a utility poll to remove a palestinian 
flag in the west bank in one of three deaths in the occupied 
territories the army said 
it reported another arab was electrocuted while trying to attach 
a palestinian flag to a power line in tulkarem also in the west 
bank arab reporters said the man was shot by israeli soldiers 
us secretary of state george p shultz arriving on a new 
mideast peace shuttle told israel to act on his plan for 
negotiations for palestinian selfrule 
defense minister yitzhak rabin announced a new army policy to go 
on the offensive and teach rioting arabs a lesson 
sundays deaths brought to 136 the number of arabs who have died 
in four months of protests against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip according to un figures one israeli soldier 
has been killed 
the months of rioting cast a pall on christian celebrations of 
easter 
about 1000 worshipers half of last years number attended 
services in the 12th century church of the holy sepulcher marking 
the site where christians believe jesus rose from the dead after 
being crucified 
shultz said the palestinians must be included in peace talks and 
negotiations must be based on a 1967 united nations resolution that 
calls on israel to give up territory in exchange for arab 
recognition 
for everything there is a season a time to love and a time 
to hate a time for war and a time for peace he said this is 
the time and the season to move decisively towards peace 
his remarks appeared aimed primarily at prime minister yitzhak 
shamir who told reporters during a visit to a west bank settlement 
sunday that shultz had yet to convince him of the need for an 
international peace conference 
the american peace proposal calls for an international 
conference on the middle east under the proposal israel would give 
land to the palestinians in exchange for peace 
shultzs third middle east shuttle since october began after a 
sharp escalation of bloodshed in the past week in which 20 arabs 
were killed and scores more shot by israeli soldiers 
visiting the site in gaza city where soldiers shot three arabs 
to death on saturday rabin explained a new tactic the army was 
using to take the initiative away from the arab demonstrators 
in the majority of the incidents rabin said about the 
recent bloodshed the confrontations were the result of our 
initiative part of an effort to ensure a calming of the situation 
and to suppress the violence 
army spokesmen said soldiers would no longer ignore as they had 
in the past demonstrations in remote villages or other locations 
that did not interfere with traffic or endanger lives 
officials at ramallah hospital said a 40yearold ali diab abu 
ali died sunday of a neck wound suffered during land day protests 
march 30 in the west bank village yatta 
the army said khalil jaber hamzawy 18 was electrocuted when 
soldiers ordered him to climb a utility pole and remove a flag in 
the askar refugee camp near nablus 
the army also said a 20yearold arab man was electrocuted while 
trying to attach an outlawed palestinian flag to a power line in 
the west bank town of tulkarem arab journalists said soldiers shot 
the youth 
the united nations did not include the tulkarem death in its 
toll 
sheik saad eddin alami the 77yearold mufti or moslem leader 
of jerusalem said he suffered heart problems after an israeli 
policeman struck him friday as he sought permission to allow tv 
cameramen into the al aqsa mosque area 
police spokesman alex lapidot described alamis claims as a 
big lie from start to end 
in a leaflet last week underground leaders called for a general 
strike in the occupied west bank and gaza strip on monday to 
protest the shultz visit they demanded that palestinians avoid 
meeting shultz during his visit 
speaking to reporters in the israeli military settlement of 
ginat shamir predicted arranging peace talks would be a lengthy 
process 
im skeptical about all the prophecies that the talks will 
have some kind of result a breakthrough said shamir who called 
for shultz to concentrate on the substance of a settlement and not 
the logistics of starting negotiations

police watched over easter sunday services in 
the citys impoverished southcentral neighborhoods attempting to 
reassure churchgoers shocked by a good friday street gang shooting 
that ranked among the citys worst 
the decent people in the community have a right to see us 
around every once in a while said sgt jack davenport adding 
that his officers were ordered to make their presence known near 
churches 
im pleased said osmond lindo pastor of vermont square 
united methodist church when he heard two officers had parked out 
front and looked in briefly on his service we need to let the 
thugs in our city know they cannot dominate our city 
most people leaving the service said they hadnt noticed the 
officers but many in the largely minority neighborhood said the 
offical concern about continuing gang violence was long overdue 
this stuff is going on every day said ron mcknight 58 
whose son rodney 19 was recovering from seven bullet wounds 
suffered in the shooting 
any day is a good friday when people can walk the streets sit 
on their porch said mcknight adding his son like most of those 
wounded wasnt associated with gangs 
at st brigids roman catholic church near the scene of the 
shootings the rev eli bauwens welcomed the police interest but 
urged worshipers to seek solace in god he held up the example of 
jesus disciples who spread the message of christianity despite 
fear of death at the hands of unbelievers 
the police deployment followed an overnight sweep by a task 
force of more than 300 officers seeking to intimidate gang members 
and forestall retaliation for the friday night shooting which 
killed one man and injured 12 other people one of them a 
4yearold boy 
the killers who gunned down rival gang members and innocent 
bystanders alike from a passing car remained at large sunday 
police who participated in the overnight sweep arrested 175 
people for investigation of a variety of alleged offenses and 
interrogated 619 people about 500 of them believed to be gang 
members said detective tony celli 
the steppedup police presence around churches sunday was 
accomplished without extra manpower though police chief daryl 
gates on saturday reiterated an oftrepeated promise to declare war 
on the gangs blamed for nearly 400 killings in los angeles county 
last year 
officers were ordered to show the flag around services as much 
as possible in the course of their regular duties 
gates said saturday he would redeploy his force to boost the 
number of officers on southcentral streets from 200 to 1000 he 
didnt say when the redeployment to be accomplished by putting 
officers on overtime would begin 
police said the good friday shootings may have been the citys 
worst in terms of the number of total casualties in 1984 five 
people were killed and five others injured in a gang shooting at a 
party outside a home 
for residents of the gangplagued area driveby shootings 
such as fridays are chillingly commonplace 
this is nothing new for any of us said bauwens at st 
brigid who heard the gunshots from his room in the rectory 
everybody here lives in a certain amount of fear bauwens 
said i must have done half a dozen funerals in the past year or 
two for teenagers all boys who are victims of gangs 
most of the wounded were not associated with gangs but were 
standing and talking on a sidewalk in an area claimed as drugsales 
territory by five or six gangs police said 
the 4yearold who was wounded dashawn holly was reported in 
fair condition sunday at countyusc medical center

mormon church leaders praised jesus christ 
as the resurrected son of god to close the faiths 158th annual 
general conference sunday with an easter theme reaffirming 
fundamental church doctrine 
the gathering closed with a sermon written by president ezra 
taft benson telling listeners to demonstrate their love for god by 
obeying his laws 
i pray that we will be obedient to god learn his will and do 
it and above all that we will keep the first and great 
commandment to love the lord with all our heart soul mind and 
strength said the sermon which was read by gordon b hinckley 
a counselor in the churchs ruling first presidency 
bensons sermon said mormons should consider whether they are 
adhering to the churchs principles such as participating in 
missionary work daily scripture reading and building family unity 
with weekly activities 
it also stressed the longstanding admonition that church members 
prepare for possible emergencies by keeping on hand enough food 
clothing and other essential supplies to last one year 
a church official said the 88yearold benson asked hinckley to 
read the sermon for him because he was tired 
earlier hinckley delivered his own homily saying christ 
submitted to crucifixion to make the resurrection of all men and 
women possible through his own death mormon doctrine holds that 
mankind will be resurrected in perfect immortal physical bodies 
before the final judgment 
of all the victories of human history none is so great none 
so universal in its effect none so everlasting in its 
consequences as the victory of the crucified lord who came forth 
in the resurrection that first easter morning hinckley said 
joseph b wirthlin a member of the twelve a group of clergy 
that assist the first presidency urged mormons to follow christ by 
emulating his honesty which he said includes paying employees a 
fair wage filing accurate tax returns and not padding expense 
accounts 
the leaders spoke as part of a series of 12 sermons capping the 
twoday conference in which speakers stressed the churchs basic 
beliefs about christs resurrection 
critics have accused mormons of exalting joseph smith who 
believers say found the church in 1820 after god and jesus appeared 
to him to a level equal to or surpassing jesus but the speakers 
gave no indication that their remarks were in response to such 
criticism 
the conference attended by more than 6000 church members also 
was told saturday that the church attracted a record 227284 
converts during 1987 bringing total membership to 65 million

vietnam is scheduled to make its 
largest release of what are believed to be remains of us military 
personnel missing in action in the vietnam war that ended with a 
communist victory in 1975 
a us military team is to receive the 27 sets of remains on 
wednesday at hanois noi bai airport and fly them to the armys 
central identification laboratory in honolulu for analysis 
it would be the fourth turnover since retired gen john w 
vessey acting as president reagans special emissary reached an 
agreement in hanoi the vietnamese capital last august that ended 
months of deadlocked negotiatons on the issue 
positive identifications of the 27 sets of remains would mean 
substantial progress because hanoi has returned only 152 confirmed 
sets since the war 
the two nations often have quarreled over accounting for the 
1767 americans who remain listed as missing in action in vietnam 
the largest previous transfer of remains was on aug 14 1985 
it involved 26 sets and at least 24 have been identified as 
american remains 
a us official closely involved in the issue said recently that 
while progress since the vessey agreement had not been as rapid as 
washington had hoped hanoi has been much more responsive to us 
requests to investigate reports involving mias 
the vietnamese have been discussing the issue with an increasing 
number of congressmen and other american visitors many of whom 
return to urge increased official contacts with hanoi 
in march the vietnamese met with john leboutillier a former 
congressman who now heads a private lobbying group that insists 
there are still americans being held prisoners in vietnam 
the mia issue also is on the agendas of us sens larry 
pressler rsd and gv sonny montgomery dmo who are 
separately visiting hanoi this week 
the us official said the vietnamese have indicated they did 
not believe washington was implementing humanitarian provisions of 
the vessey agreement he said the vietnamese complained that the 
united states has only sent exploratory medical teams and 
encouraged private us agencies to aid vietnams disabled war 
veterans and other humanitarian cases 
theyre not making a secret that they prefer direct 
governmenttogovernment aid said the official who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity 
the united states and vietnam do not have diplomatic relations

a company that advertised that it could help 
businesses secure loans is facing an fbi investigation and lawsuits 
from unhappy exclients who paid high fees but never received 
financing according to a report published sunday 
the boston sunday globe reported that since its founding in 
1986 first boston charter corp has collected between 2 million 
and 50 million from clients seeking loans but dozens of clients 
interviewed by the newspaper reported that they didnt get any 
loans and were unable to recover their fees 
three exclients have sued fbc in us district court in boston 
and a federal grand jury in las vegas has indicted the executives 
of several companies with which fbc works an fbi spokesman said 
the agency has launched an investigation of first boston charter 
and several of the companies it deals with 
the company is unrelated to the new yorkbased securities firm 
first boston corp 
fbc president marc w anderson refused to be interviewed the 
globe said his associate paul j gilbert also refused comment 
and referred questions to william m codinha the boston lawyer 
representing the company 
codinha told the globe that after consulting his clients he 
decided it was not in their interest to talk 
according to the globe fbc works with numerous other companies 
in arranging loans and loan guarantees the various companies 
involved claim to be independent of each other the globe said but 
in fact are linked in some way 
george h jones jr 56 of allentown pa told the globe he 
went to fbc when he and a partner were looking for a 500000 loan 
to set up a charter bus company and saw a newspaper advertisement 
for fbc 
he told the globe that fbc officials told him that fbc did not 
make loans but would get him a loan guarantee a promise that 
money he borrowed would be repaid even if the bus company failed 
fbc also told him that a second company would issue the guarantee 
jones said that while the second company did not make the actual 
loan it would direct him to a third company that would come up 
with the money 
jones told the newspaper that fbc executives warned him that 
there would be risks in the deal 
however jones said by the beginning of 1987 he had paid fbc a 
20000 fee a 3500 fee to a company called first fidelity 
finance for a character and credit investigation and was making 
1000 monthly fee payments to another company in on the deal 
euroshares based in spain 
last august jones said he lost his bus company and he 
eventually had to sell his car and put his house on the market 
because of indebtedness 
edward showalter an ohio manufacturer who sought a 1 million 
loan through a series of companies that involved fbcs anderson to 
produce a line of clothing featuring cartoon characters told the 
newspaper a story similar to jones showalter paid several 
companies fees totaling 42500 but never received the 1 million 
loan he was seeking according to the globe 
in a suit filed here businessman richard p johnson of stuart 
fla contends he and a client of his paid fees totaling 70000 to 
fbc for help in securing 35 million in loans but never received 
any financing 
one of several european companies to which fbc clients are 
referred eurokredit na is owned by alan copeland who is 
under indictment in las vegas for fraud copelands real name is 
bruce cooper and he is a convicted bank robber and con man the 
newspaper reported 
five other people were also indicted last fall two copeland 
colleagues and three executives of other companies affiliated with 
first boston the newspaper said the various companies are accused 
of working together to defraud clients splitting the large fees 
but failing to provide loans 
the newspaper said first boston charter claimed to have growing 
numbers of satisified customers but declined to name any of them 
according to the globe records in ohio and california show that 
anderson changed his name shortly before arriving in boston to set 
up first boston charter in mid1986 before the change his name 
was william marc knasel the globe said

the shipbuilders union at the bath iron 
works has rejected a proposed threeyear contract that both the 
company and union had hoped would usher in a new era of labor peace 
however saturdays vote did not signal authorization for a 
strike the 5500member union and the company are expected to 
stick with the existing contract that expires aug 14 and reenter 
negotiations sometime this summer 
biw had invited its unions to open contract talks early in 
hopes of improving its competitiveness it lost four of five navy 
cruiser contracts in february to rival ingalls shipbuilding of 
mississippi 
the proposed contract which offered three annual 25 percent 
wage increases and the phaseout of a twotier pay system that 
gives less to new employees was rejected by a margin of roughly 3 
to 2 said ray ladd president of local 6 of the industrial union 
of marine and shipbuilding workers of america 
about 2500 of the unions approximately 5500 members 
participated in the voting 
i feel it should have gone through because i dont feel 
theyre going to offer any more in august ladd said 
duane d fitzgerald biws executive vice president issued a 
statement saying management officials were disappointed with the 
result but believe the process was constructive and informative 
we do not regret having made the effort fitzgerald said 
ladd blamed the rejection in part on members desire for bigger 
pay hikes and a swifter end to the twotier wage system he said he 
understood rankandfile sentiments but added the company hasnt 
got any money they opened the books and proved it 
under the current contract newer employees have been paid about 
3 less an hour than veteran workers the rejected company proposal 
would have phased out the twotier system in april 1990 
the proposed 25 percent wage increase would have amounted to 29 
cents an hour more for firstclass mechanics in the first two years 
of the contract and 30 cents an hour more the final year 
members of local 7 a much smaller union representing 393 
clerical and technical workers overwhelmingly approved a new 
threeyear contract a week ago 
the shipyard maines largest private employer reached its 
highest peacetime employment level last month reporting 8900

more than five months after jessica 
mcclures dramatic rescue from a narrow well gripped the nation 
the child and her family continue to grapple with the ups and downs 
of their celebrity status 
the texas rangers expect their openingday game monday to be 
packed as jessica tosses out the first ball of the season at 
arlington stadium 
that was hardly the mcclures only offer 
later i got a call from the houston astros said former 
state sen pete snelson of midland the familys publicist he said 
he turned down the astros request for jessica because the family 
didnt have time for their tuesday opener 
last week jessica and her mother reba cissy mcclure 
traveled to lancaster in north central texas to help fundraising 
efforts for a 5yearold boy who faces heart and lung transplants 
but not all the attention leveled at the family has been 
flattering 
the mcclures bought a new threebedroom tract house in the 
modest suburb of greenwood mrs mcclure who turned 19 last week 
stays home with jessica while her 18yearold husband works at a 
new job selling sporting goods at a local store 
but when oprah winfrey brought her television talk show to 
midland and sent a limousine to pick up the mcclures rumors spread 
that the couple was living in a large home in an exclusive 
neighborhood 
thats when the rumors started flying said ml blevins 
accountant for the mcclures he dismissed the talk estimating the 
value of the mcclures new home at between 30000 and 40000 
snelson said the mcclures lifestyle has remained relatively 
spartan despite large sums of money placed into a trust fund and 
forwarded in other donations 
but the familys fame remains strong and the notoriety hasnt 
been all bad for a town that had been hit hard by the slump in oil 
and gas prices 
i got a letter the other day a registered letter addressed 
to jessicas mayor said carroll thomas midland mayor 
thomas recently formed a committee to choose the best movie deal 
about the well rescue and break an impasse between two associations 
of rescuers pursuing separate agreements 
initially he said the rescue did a lot to take our minds off 
the oil business problems it gave us a chance to think about the 
fact that there are things just as important as if not more 
important than money

the presidential candidates took their politicking to easter 
church services on sunday as they battled for victory in this 
weeks campaign double feature the colorado caucuses and 
wisconsin primary 
republican pat robertson whose candidacy is all but derailed by 
vice president george bushs march to the nomination said he has a 
mandate from god and wont stop until he is president of the united 
states 
saying he would run again in 1992 robertson told about 3000 
people at denvers happy church that i am not going to quit 
that is his plan for me and for this nation 
but with bushs nomination virtually assured the 1988 focus is 
now on the democrats 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee who has staked hopes of 
reviving his trailing campaign with a good showing in wisconsin on 
tuesday picked up the endorsement this weekend of the milwaukee 
journal 
the newspaper cited gores impressive record in arms 
control military reform and environmental protection cand called 
him one of congress best informed members on the future of 
science and technology 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who shares frontrunner 
status with jesse jackson was asked by reporters outside a 
milwaukee church if he shared the view of some democrats that 
jackson is not electable because he his black and too liberal 
i dont think there is any way of knowing dukakis said 
democratic party chairman paul kirk also sidestepped that 
question sunday when interviewed on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program 
we havent nominated anyone yet he said the democratic 
party will do its best to nominate i hope the most electable 
candidate in order to win in november 
jackson on sunday showed no concern about reports of 
consternation among democrats over his recent momentum 
speaking to overflow crowds at two denver churches he continued 
to hammer home the themes that have brought a burgeoning response 
to his campaign 
at the first baptist church where 1500 people jammed inside 
and at least as many listened to him on loudspeakers outside 
jackson said 
i sense as i travel around the nation something is going on 
there are several thousand people outdoors something is going on 
from aspen to alabama something is going on hope has 
been unleased 
later in a predominantly hispanic neighborhood people lined 
the street for a block to see jackson arrive at our lady of 
guadalupe catholic church 
jacksons success in the primaries and caucuses including a 
victory over dukakis in the virgin islands on saturday has 
created a sticky issue for democrats bent on picking a nominee who 
can secure the white house 
his campaign chairman california assembly speaker willie brown 
said sunday that the margin of jacksons successes has surprised 
even him but he said that even if jackson gets the most delegates 
by the end of the primary season that doesnt mean he should get 
the nomination 
you can have a plurality of the delegates and still not be 
able to reach the 2082 required to secure the nomination brown 
said on this week with david brinkley 
i only believe hes entitled to the nomination if we succeed 
in producing the appropriate number of delgates that george 
mcgovern got that fritz mondale got or that jimmy carter got 
brown said 
but brown also raised the possibility of the jackson forces 
instigating a rules fight at the convention this summer if the 
delegate race does not play out as they think it fairly should 
jackson himself downplayed the possibility it would come to that 
were certainly going to stand for fairness but i hope it 
wont come to a fight i think that most demcrats are going to 
stand for that which is fair and that which is right he said as 
he campaigned in colorado 
it appears unlikely any democrat will have enough delegates in 
hand to secure the nomination at the end of the primary season in 
june the nomination thus will lie in the hands of the socalled 
super delegates who are automatically delegates by virtue of their 
position as party leaders or elected officials 
dukakis so far has won 6535 delegates to jacksons 6465 and 
gores 3818 according to the associated press tally 
democratic leader kirk on sunday appeared to moderate his 
suggestion that his party should rally behind whoever is the 
frontrunner at the end of the primary season 
kirk said that a candidate who emerges with the most delegates 
but shy of the needed 2082 should not automatically get the 
partys nod 
thats not what the rules say the rules say that the person 
who attains a majority of delegates will be the partys nominee 
he said 
he said that when he earlier had talked about getting party 
leaders together to solidify support for a frontrunner he meant 
that if anyone gained a very very substantial plurality of 
delegates and someone has the nomination within virtually within 
his grasp that the party ought to sit down and talk about 
getting behind that person 
under questioning he refused to say what would consistute a 
substantial plurality 
spokeswoman julie anbender later said kirks views on the matter 
have not changed 
kirk has not altered his position about rallying behind the 
clearcut frontrunner he continues to believe that at the end of 
the process one of our candidates will clearly emerge from the 
pack and kirk will at that point encourage the party to rally 
behind its inevitable nominee she said 
brown noted that the jackson campaign is actively seeking out 
support among the superdelegates and the uncommitted delegates 
particularly members of congress who represent districts where 
jackson has run strongly 
as if the jackson forces would as they did at the 1984 
convention challenge any rules on how delegates are selected 
should jackson fail to bring many uncommitted delegates on board 
brown said 
i think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so 
jackson previously has said he has no plans to raise rules 
challenges at the summer convention in atlanta but he has also 
said he expects the party to treat him fairly

a panamanian military vehicle on 
sunday tried to stop the car of us ambassador arthur davis the 
us embassy reported and it called the serious 
terence kneebone an embassy spokesman said davis was leaving 
the residence of the vaticans ambassador in a chauffeurdriven car 
when a military vehicle began following immediately picking them 
up right outside the gate 
it followed them down balboa avenue then tried to stop them 
with lights and sirens the ambassadors driver in accordance with 
instructions did not stop the ambassador was driven to his 
residence and the other vehicle followed all the way 
we consider this serious kneebone added he said that would 
be the embassys only characterization of the incident and referred 
further questions to the state department in washington 
kneebone said davis had gone to call on the papal nuncio 
monsignor jose sebastian laboa to pay his respects on easter 
sunday the spokesman noted that the papal ambassador is the dean 
of the diplomatic corps in panama 
the distance between laboas residence and the american 
ambassadors house is about two miles and the route followed by 
davis car took him along oceanfront balboa avenue 
sundays edition of the daily newspaper la republica which is 
run by the military carried a frontpage picture of davis with a 
caption that said he did not venture from his residence unless he 
was armed to the teeth 
the brief article accused the ambassador of exaggerating any 
possible threat to his personal security and said davis suffered 
from either a persecution complex or guilty conscience 
the incident came only three days after the panamanian 
government said the defense forces commanded by gen manuel 
antonio noriega would not do anything to provoke an excuse for a 
us invasion the united states has demanded that noriega under 
federal indictment in florida on drugtrafficking charges resign 
in its statement the government said aware of the 
overwhelming power threatening it the republic of panama will 
not provide the foundation for fabrication of a charge of 
aggression that could pretent to justify the launching of acts of 
war

the last act of gov evan mechams 
impeachment trial begins monday with attorneys final arguments 
wrapping up a historical drama involving charges of obstruction of 
justice and misuse of state funds 
if the arizona senate votes against him mecham would become the 
seventh us governor removed from office by impeachment the vote 
could come as early as monday 
it would take a twothirds vote or 20 of the senators to convict 
mecham who has only been in office a little more than a year the 
body then could take a second vote and bar him from holding state 
office again 
if he is acquitted mecham would still face a recall election 
may 17 he also faces a criminal trial on felony charges associated 
with alleged concealment of a 350000 campaign loan that charge 
was included in the articles of impeachment but was thrown out by 
senators last week in a surprise vote 
the first impeachment charge alleges that mecham 63 obstructed 
justice by impeding an attorney generals investigation of an 
alleged death threat on a grand jury witness by one of mechams 
staff members the witness a former mecham aide had agreed to 
testify about mechams campaign finances 
in the second charge he is accused of illegally lending public 
funds 80000 from a protocol fund to his auto dealership 
an underlying question is whether either of the charges if 
sustained constitutes high crimes malfeasance and 
misdeameanors the requirement for removing an elected official 
the prosecution in a trial memorandum urged senators to 
convict mecham 
the criminal acts and the acts of abuse of power breach of 
public trust neglect of duty and obstruction of justice demand 
that gov mecham be removed from office they said 
defense lawyers said they would respond with written arguments 
monday but after five weeks of testimony the respective positions 
are clear 
prosecutors say the firstterm republican governor instructed 
the states top lawman ralph milstead not to cooperate with an 
attorney generals investigation of the alleged death threat 
mecham who says he was politically at war with the attorney 
general concedes he may have said something like that but insists 
he acted out of ignorance of the facts mecham claims no one told 
him details of the alleged threat 
a key issue is the credibility of several witnesses the key 
ones being mecham and milstead 
the second charge involves money mecham says money raised by 
his inaugural committee to pay off his campaign debts always 
remained private money even after a law prevented its use for its 
original purpose the prosecution says it became public money when 
it was placed in a protocol fund to pay for gifts to visiting 
dignitaries and events enhancing the image of arizona 
undisputed is the fact that mecham loaned 80000 from the fund 
to his car dealership did not record the deed of trust and paid it 
back three months later with interest when another campaign finance 
scandal erupted over the 350000 loan 
prosecutors will say that mechams loan was unethical and 
illegal defense lawyers will say it was legal and for the good of 
the state mecham has contended his only motive was to increase the 
fund by paying higher interest than it was getting at a bank 
disputing the prosecutions contention that the dealership was in 
financial difficulty and needed the money 
arguments were expected to take about two hours with each side 
speaking a half hour on each charge 
the procedure of the senators voting on each charge separately 
could be lengthy whether it starts monday or tuesday unlike 
jurors in a court trial the 30 senators each get 15 minutes to 
explain their votes

to stop the chauffeurdriven limousine of us ambassador arthur 
davis on sunday but the diplomat continued on to his residence the 
us embassy reported 
it called the incident serious 
the effort to stop the ambassador came after panamanians rich 
and poor attended church services observing a somber easter in the 
crisis over the refusal of gen manuel antonio noriega to resign 
noriega commands the 15000member defense forces and as the 
military strongman is the power behind the civilian government he 
is under indictment by a federal grand jury in florida and has 
rejected us demands that he resign 
terence kneebone a us embassy spokesman said davis had 
visited the vatican ambassador and was leaving in his car when a 
military vehicle began following immediately picking them up

an excuse for a us invasion 
aware of the overwhelming power threatening it the republic 
of panama will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a 
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of 
acts of war the government said 
the united states has more than 10000 military personnel in 
panama under the panamanianbased us southern command the reagan 
administration said friday it would sent 1300 additional soldiers 
and marines to panama this week to reinforce security for americans 
and usfacilities in the country 
in a televised mass monsignor marcos a mcgrath the roman 
catholic archbishop of panama city said this sunday of the 
resurrection of 1988 is particularly dramatic for us 
during this lenten season we have suffered strong divisions 
tensions among the panamanian people he said we have suffered 
many privations 
in these final days of holy week half of panama has been 
fasting because it has no food and the other half has been fasting 
in sympathy with them 
the countrys economy has foundered since march 4 when noriega 
closed banks to prevent a run on cash made scarce by us 
sanctions the economic chaos was aggravated by a twoweekold 
general strike that closed down an estimated 90 percent of the 
countrys business and industry 
protesters have taken to the streets and noriegas troops have 
responded with force 
the strike eased late last week with some groceries and 
pharmacies opening reportedly under government pressure 
opposition leaders have not formally called off the strike and were 
to meet sunday and monday to discuss whether to continue it 
at a mass at cristo rey church the rev xavier villanueva an 
outspoken noriega foe urged catholics to support a recent call by 
panamas nine bishops for the generals resignation 
the congregation broke into applause and many waved white 
handkerchiefs which have become a symbol of dissent in panamas 
crisis 
in his easter homily mcgrath spoke of the nations social 
decomposition he referred to the reality of disintegrating 
homes the reality of a people increasingly losing confidence in 
their leaders the reality of a community misinformed by the 
partisanizing and falsifying of the news 
the crisis which had been building for months erupted in late 
february when thenpresident eric arturo delvalle tried to fire 
noriega who had been indicted in the united states on 
drugtrafficking charges delvalles move backfired when noriega 
dismissed him

a town marshal who said hed been 
kidnapped by burglars faked his highly publicized disappearance 
last week a mississippi highway patrol investigator said 
there was an attempted burglary at a local convenience store 
but marshal gary stokes the towns only fulltime policeman 
fabricated the tale of his abduction state patrol investigator 
larry rickels said saturday 
rickels said he had not uncovered a motive for the phony 
abduction 
stokes could not be reached for comment sunday because his 
telephone was busy his stepmother mary stokes said she was 
surprised by the investigators finding but didnt feel residents 
would be angry at her stepson because most were just glad he had 
returned unharmed 
stokes 35 disappeared about 1255 am thursday after calling 
for backup units while investigating an attempted burglary in this 
northeastern mississippi town of 860 residents 
police arriving at the store found his car with the engine still 
running the lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the 
door his revolver and billfold were found nearby 
stokes reappeared friday morning after claiming to have escaped 
from his captors 
i knew i was done for anyway and i had nothing to lose 
stokes said at the time when they let me out of the trunk i hit 
the ground running and i didnt look back 
he told reporters that he was still nervous and kind of shook 
up they had said several times they were going to kill me and i 
believed them 
rickels however said stokes apparently spent the night in the 
woods or an abandoned house in union county before turning up 
friday 
in addition the attempted burglary actually occurred thursday 
afternoon much earlier than the alleged abduction rickels said 
stokes pistol had been fired but somewhere other than near his 
squad car rickels said stokes claimed the gun went off in a 
struggle with his captors 
lawmen used tracking dogs in the rain as they searched for 
stokes in rural areas surrounding blue mountain on thursday and 
well into the night 
rickels said he will discuss his findings with the district 
attorney

there was a time when the only boots associated 
with this city were cowboy and ski boots but that changed more 
than 30 years ago when police asked an inventor to make a device 
that would immobilize a parked car 
in his small patternmaking shop in west denver frank p marugg 
designed a 12pound jawlike clamp that was first used by the 
denver police department in 1955 
marugg died 15 years ago but his denver boot continues to 
torment parking violators and scofflaws many us cities use the 
original denver boot or a variation and it also has been used in 
japan israel and england 
denver city and county officials were enthusiastic about the 
boot from the start some 200 denver boots are used in the metro 
area and were ordering more said sgt chuck espinoza chief 
of the boot detail for the denver county sheriffs department 
the county employs four fulltime booters who seek out cars 
registered to motorists who havent paid fines once a car is 
located it takes about 19 seconds to fasten one of the 12pound 
boots over the front wheel said espinoza 
the jawlike clamp covers the hubcap making it impossible to 
remove the tire trying to drive with the boot can severely damage 
a tire the denver boot is made of an aluminum alloy with a 
breaking strength of 32000 pounds per square inch 
espinoza said the boots which are clamped on cars about 40 or 
50 times a day in denver add 15 million each year to the city 
and countys general fund motorist can get debooted only by 
paying all fines 
maruggs daughter grace berg who has taken over the 
manufacturing and marketing of her fathers most famous invention 
said last week theyve been unable to improve on it 
berg 62 runs the company out of her suburban home a foundry 
pours the metal parts and a mechanic assembles them 
she recalled how the denver police asked her father in the early 
1950s for a device to eliminate the need to tow 
they were running out of space in the city garages and it 
also relieved the problem of inventorying each car that was towed 
in she said 
berg said she sells between 50 and 100 boots a year and charges 
275 apiece denver gets a special rate she said because it buys 
so many 
its not a fastmoving object they usually last a long 
time said berg 
berg said she also sells many boots to parking garage owners in 
new york city and a few to owners of expensive cars who want to 
protect them from thieves

attempt by his followers why dont they say it openly and 
publicly

in the wake of honasans escape and warned that leftist and

having hooked area markets and restaurants 
with her pitch for locallygrown fish marilyn doane has netted the 
first profits from the troutfarming business she began three years 
ago 
a venture that started with 1000 fingerlings now operates on a 
bigger scale 42000 fish 17 ponds and some 35 commercial 
customers in the grand rapids area 
doanes country lane fisheries also has begun showing a little 
profit for the former carpenter 
it turned around in january i made 6 doane said 
before starting her fishery the 38yearold doane knew little 
about the fishfarming business 
she was a trained secretary who along with her husband roger 
built and operated a mobile home park while also operating their 
own heavy construction equipment they sold the park in 1981 and 
moved to alaska flying in a restored 1947 fabriccovered airplane 
and on returning bought a 30acre topsoil farm in belmont just 
north of grand rapids 
the couple rented out a house to a biologist and an 
ichthyologist who said their farmland was just right for raising 
trout a fish that likes cool water yearround 
the observations spawned the idea for a trout farm 
marilyn doane took an intensive twoweek course in coldwater 
fish hatching at the national fisheries academy in traverse city 
and gave up her carpentry job to go into the business 
she started with 1000 fingerlings and in a couple of years 
built a business that now sells about 3000 fish a month 
overcoming obstacles such as a 1986 dam break that flooded her 
ponds and cost her 6000 fish 
the business supplies 35 commercial customers including 20 dampw 
supermarkets in the grand rapids area restaurants country clubs 
and fish stores doane is putting in more ponds and building an 
addition to her house for more efficient fish processing 
its potential is almost beyond what i can imagine doane 
said 
her biggest sales point is that the fish are locally grown 
the hot button in the food business is locally raised 
products said john astma dampws meat manager who promotes the 
fish with signs like marilyns trout grown in belmont at the 
chains fish counters 
astma convinced dampw executives to carry doanes trout in their 
stores by bringing the chains president and vice president of 
marketing to the farm for a picnic it cinched the deal 
you just have to be there to understand whats going on

campeau corp gained a major new presence in 
us shopping malls by winning an agreement to acquire federated 
department stores inc but will lose some of federateds diversity 
in the process 
to help finance its 7350 a share 658 billion buyout of 
federated torontobased campeau said it would sell several other 
federated chains and one of its own holdings 
but campeau initially will keep federateds crown jewel 
retailers bloomingdales richs lazarus goldsmiths burdines 
and abraham amp straus that are seen as giving it a key foothold in 
us malls 
the combined federatedcampeau will be the nations 
fourthlargest retailer with annual sales of about 15 billion 
trailing only sears roebuck amp co k mart corp and walmart 
stores inc 
analysts say a key campeau goal in the bitter twomonth battle 
against rh macy amp co for control of cincinnatibased federated 
which ended with fridays merger agreement was to acquire real 
estate especially in major malls 
stores such as the federated crown jewels are regarded as 
anchors the one or two major stores generally placed in a mall 
to attract shoppers 
such heavyweights as bloomingdales and lazarus in addition to 
its present jordan marsh operations give campeau instant entree to 
some malls while increasing its negotiating strength with 
developers of new malls 
if you are an anchor tenant you may get 10 to 20 per cent of 
a shopping center for free said one industry analyst with a 
canadian firm who asked not to be identified if you were in a 
position to commit two or three choice anchors as campeau would 
be able to do you might get 30 to 40 per cent 
the analyst noted robert campeau chairman of campeau corp 
built the company as a real estate and mall developer and 
speculated campeau now could make a shopping center just by 
agreeing to locate the anchors 
to acquire such benefits campeau agreed to sell to macy the i 
magnin i magnin bullocks and bullockswilshire operations of 
federated for 11 billion 
campeau had agreed earlier in the takeover fight to sell its 
brooks brothers clothing chain which it acquired in its 1986 
takeover of allied stores corp to britains marks amp spencer plc 
for 720 million 
campeau also had agreed to sell federateds texasbased foleys 
and bostonbased filenes department stores to may department 
stores co 
furthermore campeau has said already it would sell federateds 
filenes basement stores in response to antitrust concerns among 
several northeastern states has plans to sell federateds 
supermarket and specialty store chains and widely is expected to 
sell other department store chains 
the pattern mirrors the path campeau took after acquiring allied 
for 36 billion when he sold most of the companys store 
operations to help pay off the debt incurred to make the deal 
although the divestments stemming from the federated deal will 
enable campeau to make the transaction some analysts say the sales 
will eliminate some of the variety that made federated such an 
attractive company at the outset 
campeaus victory is a great one but hes giving up a lot for 
it said walter f loeb a retail industry analyst with the 
investment firm morgan stanley amp co 
hes going to end up with just the core department stores and 
end federateds long tradition of diversity loeb said 
loeb and other analysts have said that by eliminating that 
diversity the campeaufederated coupling continued the recent trend 
toward sameness among the nations big retailers 
some industry watchers believe that under campeau federated 
will consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that 
are now carried out separately by the federated units 
that could dampen innovation created by having more retailers 
buying and experimenting with new merchandise which fosters new 
styles and trends
