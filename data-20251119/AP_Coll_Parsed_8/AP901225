deaf thais aided by an american have 
produced what they say is the first real dictionary for the deaf in 
the developing world they hope it will help end discrimination 
against the handicapped in thailand 
the 1500page dictionary took eight years to complete and 
involved setting down 3500 signs in pictoral form according to 
editorinchief owen wrigley 37 of manhattan kan the dictionary 
is to be officially released shortly 
we hope it will provide not only a useful tool for the deaf 
but that the dictionary is offered as proof that the thais have a 
distinctive national sign language wrigley said in an interview 
wrigley said it is hoped such recognition would help the cause 
of the deaf who now are barred from government service and from 
the buddhist monkhood they cannot legally acquire driving licenses 
and some thais want them to lose the right to vote on grounds the 
deaf are not literate 
it is conservatively estimated that 100000 thais are deaf that 
figure does not incloude those who lose their hearing in old age 
most are poor manual laborers seamstresses and street vendors 
wrigley estimates that at most 5 percent of deaf children are 
able to attend schools the only deaf college graduate known in 
thailand is a woman who lost her hearing as a teenager and was 
able to complete a teachers training college course 
a disabled persons act aimed at giving the handicapped a better 
deal has languished in parliament for years 
wrigley said he became involved in helping the deaf shortly 
after arriving in thailand in 1981 with the usbased 
international human assistance program the united nations had 
declared that year the year of the disabled person 
working with the national association of the deaf in thailand 
wrigley obtained funds for the project from the us government 
united nations canada australia and local donors 
the research team included deaf people one a dynamic young 
woman named manfa suwanarat died before the dictionary was 
completed after receiving questionable treatment for a medical 
ailment 
the team interviewed the deaf throughout thailand taking notes 
and photographing the signs they used to communicate the 
dictionary graphically depicts the signs and explains them in 
written form in thai and english 
a few of the signs were drawn from abroad particularly american 
sign language but by far the largest majority have their roots in 
thailand and its culture 
to communicate thailand in sign language the forefinger is 
extended and crooked to resemble an elephants trunk the elephant 
features prominently in thai history and culture 
wrigley said dictionaries for the deaf are a recent development 
the first appeared in the united states in 1965 only a few other 
nations in the west have produced or are working on them there are 
no fullfledged dictionaries for the deaf known to exist in the 
developing world 
wrigley notes that many people believe the deaf can communicate 
easily through an international sign language one such does exist 
developed in italy in the 1960s and called gestuno but wrigley 
says it has about as much popularity and relevance as the 
international spoken language esperanto

for india alone if the crisis continues until march 
brazils oil bill has risen 12 billion philippine government 
efforts to cope with the problem prompted demonstrations against 
president corazon aquino 
here is a review of some developing countries and how they are 
affected 
bangladesh a continuing crisis in the gulf would cost more

workers 222 million in higher oil prices and 150 million in lost 
exports and tax revenue mostly from tea and jute sales 
brazil the oil bill has doubled to 600 million a month 
inflation is rising and many brazilian companies with projects in

chile about 200 million has been added to the 1990 oil bill 
and an oil stabilization fund has been established primarily with 
money from an increase in the price of copper chiles main export 
egypt lost revenues totaled 67 billion because of a decline 
in the tourist industry reduced income from the suez canal and an 
end to remittances from 400000 egyptians working in iraq and

philippines has lost remittances from 30000 citizens who returned 
from jobs in iraq and kuwait 
sri lanka officials put the cost for 1990 at 130 million and 
say the annual inflation rate might surpass 20 percent many of the 
90000 sri lankans working in the gulf region have returned home 
and losses of remittances are expected to reach 53 million higher 
oil prices will raise the energy bill by 87 million 
zambia fuel costs have more than doubled causing the prices 
of transportation food and other necessities to soar 
zimbabwe energy cost about 400 million in 1990 nearly double 
the previous figure president robert mugabe recommended that

bonnie anderton was going to spend christmas day in the nations 
capital campaigning for the release of iraqs hostages including 
her husband she and 11yearold daughter jennifer had a petition 
to deliver to the iraqi embassy 
it was the nicest wasted effort ive ever made said mrs 
anderton whose husband richard was among holdouts at the us 
embassy in kuwait allowed to leave in time for the holidays 
just two weeks ago she and families around the nation wondered 
whether theyd ever see their captive loved ones again since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 theyd had mostly bad news or none at 
all 
he didnt think hed be home and we didnt think hed be 
home mrs anderton 40 said monday from larkspur colo 
thats why its so special just to be together 
theyre thankful at how things worked out for them especially 
compared with the nearly 300000 us servicemen and women in the 
persian gulf and their families despite the andertons good 
fortune its still a somber holiday season with the united states 
on the brink of war 
im extremely glad my husband isnt sitting on the 50yard 
line but theres still a tremendous problem to be solved mrs 
anderton said its far from over 
pete dooley never thought hed be out in time to sip champagne 
and sit around the christmas tree opening gifts at home in 
kentucky in a twinkling he went from hiding in iraqioccupied 
kuwait to freedom and the loving arms of relatives who had prepared 
for the worst 
we were looking for the long haul his mother kitty dooley 
said monday from hopkinsville ky we didnt dream wed have him 
with us that wed be calling out with joy 
dooley 40 was among hundreds of americans freed earlier this 
month by saddam hussein 
i was artfully eluding capture that was the goal of my days 
it was lonely tense nervous said dooley who managed 
restaurants for a kuwaiti company two weeks ago i certainly had 
no plans to be here to be home for christmas 
freedom is whats important even to take out the trash is a 
treat 
the rev edwin davis will say a special grace for his soninlaw 
before the traditional holiday supper his daughters husband like 
many kuwaitis married to americans stayed behind to defend his 
country and relatives 
were happy that martha and the two grandchildren are back 
home safely with us but were still praying for mike davis said 
from koran la we just hope he can get out of there before 
theres a war were wondering about a war 
global worries aside freed hostages want to spend the time 
trying to relax and enjoy a respite from tensions that have 
dominated recent months 
you cant help but think about the politics and the troops 
over there said guy seago an oil worker who was used as a 
socalled human shield 
but for me the focus this christmas is on faith the father 
of six said from johnson city tenn its on faith and thanks and 
quiet time with the family 
james e carrolls wife and seven children had a christmas tree 
waiting when he arrived home in augusta ga 
its just a special christmas of being thankful to the 
lord said carroll a pediatrician who also holed up at the us 
embassy in kuwait 
another family had not planned to have christmas this year 
we werent going to celebrate said margaret williams of 
germantown tenn whose son and daughterinlaw were held by iraqi 
troops 
and now the holiday has become a little anticlimactic 
our christmas already came mrs williams said it came 
when we saw them home and safe it came when they were free and

single mother valerie bodon wanted to shower 
her four sons with gifts and cook a scrumptious christmas feast 
today but there was no money luckily she wasnt too proud to 
ask for help 
for mrs bodon who tries to make ends meet with food stamps and 
a 405 monthly government check the help came from a small 
indianapolis group that prefers to remain anonymous 
delivered to her door last week were about 30 wrapped gifts 
four stockings stuffed with candy fruit and other treats a 
miniature decorated christmas tree and two gift certificates from 
a supermarket and discount shoe store 
mrs bodon has been studying accounting at butler university so 
she can get a better job she was divorced three years ago while 
working as an accounting clerk a job that did not pay enough to 
support the family 
knowing she had virtually nothing to give her boys for 
christmas she went to one of the 14 community centers of 
indianapolis in november to ask for help 
the nonprofit agency which provided christmas assistance to 
more than 3500 families last year brings together people who want 
to help with those who need it spokesman ward beckham said 
shes trying to go to school trying to raise a family trying 
to keep her budget balanced said mike waddell her counselor at 
one of the centers she impressed me as somebody whos going to 
be a real success when she starts working 
many other families are in similar circumstances most are 
headed by single mothers trying to get by on welfare others are 
elderly people on social security 
the community centers of indianapolis help families when they 
are behind on their rent or utility bills or when the cupboards are 
empty 
at christmas the centers work with stores and groups such as 
kmart the fire department marine reservists supermarkets 
service clubs and the gas company which donate money food or 
toys beckham said 
affluent churches funnel help through the community centers or 
churches that serve the poor 
yet the churches and agencies can help only those who ask for 
it some children will have empty stockings because their parents 
are either too proud embarrassed or drugaddicted to seek help 
officials say 
a lot of children dont get the christmas they want a few 
dont get the christmas they need said cindy clements executive 
director of christamore house another of the centers 
with the extra help from her anonymous benefactors mrs bodon 
will be able to give her children more than they could have 
expected 
im just happy that somebody is doing this for me she said 
as long as the tree isnt bare on christmas then theyll be 
satisfied

cambodia a nation ravaged by war and 
revolution for the past 20 years is again facing severe food 
shortages because of increased fighting drought and floods united 
nations officials say 
some refugees who say they cannot grow rice are among the 
roughly 20000 cambodians who fled west to guerrillacontrolled 
camps in thailand this year thousands of others went east to areas 
under government control 
government officials in phnom penh expect that cambodias 8 
million people will be shot about 100000 tons of rice in 1991 or 
three times the official deficit for this year scott leiper of the 
un world food program told donor countries at a dec 18 meeting 
the situation is causing concern said sams kibria the 
un secretarygenerals special representative for cambodian aid 
programs 
from all indications the food situation had improved over the 
last couple of years he said in an interview monday this 
year because of the fighting a lot of the land was left 
uncultivated secondly the rainfall both in terms of quantity and 
timing was not right 
another major factor he said was that the soviets have stopped 
providing fertilizer as a result of their general disengagement 
from cambodia 
cambodia had been getting about 50000 tons of fertilizer 
annually but only a fifth of that amount was available for the 
1990 wet season crop leiper said 
the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh is battling 
three guerrilla groups and fighting has spread since the 
vietnamese troop pullout that began in september 1989 
each year combat intensifies during the dry season that has 
just begun 
the un security council has drawn up a peace plan to end the 
civil war in cambodia but representatives of the warring factions 
failed during talks in paris last weekend to agree on all parts of 
the plan 
millions died in cambodia in the 197075 civil war the 197578 
bloody rule of the communist khmer rouge and in the fighting since 
late 1978 when invading vietnamese troops drove the khmer rouge 
into the jungles 
western isolation of the communist phnom penh government has 
kept the country impoverished 
leiper head of the world food programs phnom penh office told 
the donor countries that the shortages are expected to hit hardest 
in southwestern kampot and kompongspeu provinces which have 
suffered alarming food shortages due to drought the past two 
years 
they are expected to face a combined food deficit of 44000 tons 
of rice in 1991 about 40 percent of the total nationwide deficit 
leiper said prolonged drought in many areas of the central and 
southeastern provinces has reduced the area planted and flooding 
in the west and the fighting has also reduced cultivation 
cambodias official spk news agency recently said drought and 
floods had destroyed more than half the cultivated area in the 
central province of kompong thom 
it said the average yield was expected to drop by a third 
compared to last year in the northwestern province of battambang a 
main agricultural region due to bad weather and guerilla 
harassment 
leiper also requested aid for the 130000 people many living in 
dire conditions who have been displaced in governmentheld 
territory this past year getting them food he said has been 
hampered by shortages of trucks and fuel and the countrys 
battered infrastructure 
international aid officials say about 90 percent of these people 
had fled the fighting in the western provinces of battambang and 
banteay meanchey 
the world food program moved cautiously in appealing for aid 
because some of the other refugees in kompongspeu and kompong 
chhnang provinces said the government had moved them out of their 
villages because of guerrilla infiltration 
at the donor meeting sweden pledged 66 million for aid inside 
cambodia the united states pledged 10 million and the european 
community 6 million to help about 300000 refugees in thai border 
camps controlled by the guerrillas

on christmas eve alighting aboard this hospital ship with a full 
complement of reindeer 
it was not completely a surprise visit 
fifteen minutes beforehand the public address system crackled 
to life to announce that awacs surveillance planes high overhead 
were reporting a single unidentified aircraft closing in on the 
ship 
the craft was moving too slowly to be intercepted by navy f15 
fighter jets later announcements said 
finally came the report it was a sleigh pulled by deer and 
driven by an old man the jingle of bells on the address system 
heralded its arrival 
santas real identity was the ships air boss cmdr stanley 
schmidt he handed out packages addressed to any service 
member nurses and corpsmen perched on his lap as he sat on a 
cargo dolly decorated like a sleigh 
pulling the dolly were seven men and women wearing cardboard 
reindeer antlers stuck high over their ears lead reindeer rudolph 
actually cmdr dan barrett 44 of flint mich the ships 
lawyer had a bulbous red nose 
the singalong right after the visit included such highlights as 
rashid the red nosed camel and two dinars an ode to the 
high fares of bahrain taxi drivers 
in other christmas events the movie miracle on 34th street 
was playing in o lounge 
the catholic chaplain the rev richard mattie 58 scheduled a 
midnight mass and both he and protestant chaplain lt cmdr doug 
weadick 40 planned an ecumenical service both are from hornell 
ny 
weadick said his christmas message would concentrate on being 
able to relinquish your life to the powers that be on having to 
sacrifice our individualism for the common good 
mattie said he planned to talk about the price we have to pay 
to preserve peace 
the only christmas religious service being held in public for

when all the receipts are tallied christmas 
sales are likely to be unchanged or barely above last year a poor 
season for retailers who couldnt overcome consumer worries over 
the economy and middle east 
shopping traffic was slow at many stores and malls this season 
and consumers who did shop bought selectively highprofile 
retailing companies around the country complained monday their 
sales were a disappointment 
sales that are unchanged or barely higher are considered poor 
because after the rate of inflation is subtracted a stores 
business may be down from yearearlier levels consumer prices rose 
64 percent through the first 11 months of this year meaning many 
stores modest gains were wiped out 
it has not been a disaster but it has been a pretty flat 
season said suzanne mcmillan senior vice president for 
marketing at saks fifth avenue 
its not going to be anything thats going to excite 
anybody said kenneth macke chairman of dayton hudson corp the 
companys sales will be unchanged or perhaps 1 percent higher than 
last year macke said 
many retailers increased or moved up price reductions in the 
last few weeks in an effort to draw more shoppers nationwide 
chains reported their worst results came in the northeast where 
the recesssion has hit particularly hard 
the first inkling of real trouble among retailers came back in 
august as sales of clothing furniture toys and appliances stalled 
in the wake of the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
sales for most retailers failed to ick up in the early fall a 
time when business normally accelerates when the christmas season 
kicked off sales remained slow although they picked up some steam 
during the last week 
in many areas weather extremes also hampered holiday sales 
younkers inc a des moinesbased chain of 34 midwestern 
department stores said its december sales which rose between 2 
percent and 3 percent would have been higher if not for heavy 
snows and frigid temperatures 
we did very well considering the weather said younkers 
president w thomas gould younkers sales were 2 percent to 3 
percent higher than last year a better year than most retailers 
especially those with higherpriced items 
in parts of the country where temperatures have been in the 50s 
and 60s for much of december the warm weather dealt a blow to 
winter clothing sales sears roebuck and co the nations largest 
retailer was among the stores that moved up apparel clearance 
sales because the merchandise was not moving 
results at dayton hudson whose stores range from upscale 
department stores to the target discount chain reflected the fact 
that consumers were trading down or buying cheaper gifts 
what shoppers bought also reflected the difficult season dayton 
hudson had more success with levis jeans than with designer jeans 
and sweatshirts and sweatpants were among the most popular items 
macke said 
it was a very functional christmas he said 
macke said the poor christmas does not bode well for the first 
half of 1991 if santa claus and christmas cant bring people 
into the stores why are they going to be in in january and 
february he asked

for the seventh time a court refused 
to order a hospital to resume feeding nancy cruzan the severely 
braininjured woman whose family won her right to die 
meanwhile on christmas eve eight antieuthanasia demonstrators 
huddled without their tent outside the building where she lay 
dying protesters have maintained a roundtheclock vigil since ms 
cruzans feeding tube was removed dec 14 
the court decision monday came in response to a request by the 
rev patrick j mahoney of boca raton fla who argued the state 
was violating ms cruzans rights by not ordering her to be fed 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals issued a onepage order 
that said mahoney had no standing in the case mahoney said he 
would take his case to the us supreme court 
the us district court for western missouri had earlier 
dismissed mahoneys suit 
ms cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since an 
auto crash in early 1983 doctors give her n chance of recovery 
she remained in deteriorating condition today 
also monday authorities ordered demonstrators outside the 
missouri rehabilitation center to remove a tent they had erected 
when protesters refused hospital employees took it down 
the demonstrators had been using a torch in the tent to combat 
the bonechilling weather the arrangement was considered a fire 
hazard and once temperatures warmed into the 20s monday hospital 
officials order it removed hospital director don lamkins said 
in a landmark ruling the us supreme court said earlier this 
year missouri could require clear and convincing evidence that 
a person in ms cruzans condition would want to die 
jasper county judge charles teel then heard testimony from 
friends who said ms cruzan would want to die and ruled her parents 
could have the feeding tube removed 
the latest appeals court ruling was the seventh time a court had 
refused to order feeding of ms cruzan resumed 
mahoneys motion said the state was violating ms cruzans 
rights and argued the hearing teel held was improper because 
witnesses who testified were not crossexamined and there were no 
witnesses who said ms cruzan should be kept alive 
mahoney also argued that the state had erred by not appealing 
teels order 
the clergyman filed his action under a legal concept called 
next of friend describing it as a strategy to be used when no 
one else was protecting the rights of a person 
in taking the case to the us supreme court mahoney said he 
would cite testimony from the former chaplain at the hospital who 
said ms cruzan had a noticeable reaction when he told her she was 
going to die 
unlike comatose patients ms cruzan opens her eyes and changes 
her facial expressions but doctors testified her lack of 
consciousness was irreversible and she had no awareness and could 
not feel pain 
mahoney is director of the center for christian activities a 
righttolife group associated with the antiabortion group

american airlines accused its pilots of staging a 
sickout during one of the busiest travel times of the year to 
protest stalled contract talks 
american based in forth worth said the number of pilots 
calling in sick over the weekend before christmas soared to record 
numbers the absentee rate was almost 70 percent higher than 
normal airline officials said 
union officials denied any organized protest was occurring but 
conceded that disgruntled employees could be acting on their own 
american management and the allied pilots association have been 
negotiating a contract for 14 months but have made little headway 
its all an attempt to compel the company to agree to terms 
that the pilots would like us to on the contract said robert w 
baker american executive vice president for operations 
baker said 529 of americans 9000 pilots were on sick leave 
monday about 500 pilots had called in sick over the weekend the 
pilot absentee rate is about 250 normally and 300 during christmas 
holidays american spokesman marty heires said 
we have to assume theres some union activity here heires 
said now i dont know whether this was an organized effort or 
whether some pilots are taking it upon themselves to do this 
all were seeing is the end result weve had an approximate 
67 percent increase in the number of pilots calling in sick he 
said 
union officials denied a concerted effort is behind the higher 
absentee rate 
i know theres nothing going on in terms of any grassroots 
operation or any other type of operation to call in sick or not 
being available aa executive director scott peterson said 
baker said the absentee rate for flight attendants was average 
the apparent pilot sickout coupled with bad weather a high 
volume of holiday traffic and the airlines loss of 230 pilots to 
operation desert shield led to an unusually high number of flight 
cancellations over the weekend heires said 
american canceled 74 flights or one in every 11 flights into 
and out of its hub at dallasfort worth international airport 
during sundays holiday crunch 
a sickout would be illegal under the railway labor act which 
also covers airlines 
both management and labor traded contract proposals in the past 
month but remain far apart negotiations resume jan 7 in 
washington under the auspices of federal mediators 
under the railway labor act the existing contract will remain 
in force until a federal mediator declares an impasse after a 
30day cooling off period the carrier may impose new terms on the 
pilots and the union can strike 
the union has been urging members to be diligent about seeking 
sick leave when ill and not to answer their phones if they dont 
want to work on their days off 
although the company may be disappointed in that theres 
nothing illegal about it said apa spokesman tom hunt whats 
the reason for that i think its low morale theres no question 
the pilots at american airlines are extremely disgruntled with the 
company with management

the worst freeze since 1937 devastated 
californias navel orange crop sending growers into christmas with 
little hope of salvaging the seasons harvest 
this is way worse than ive ever seen bakersfieldarea 
grower john slikker jr said monday yesterday we cut these 
oranges in half it was just like cutting through a popsicle 
the weekend arctic blast also damaged nursery plants lemons and 
avocados and destroyed most early southern california strawberries 
agriculture officials said crop damage was put in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
cliff holland of california citrus mutual a growers 
organization admitted the string of freezing nights probably 
destroyed the states 199091 navel orange harvest 
it will take some time to assess damage but it looks bleak at 
this point he said about 80 percent of the 199091 crop 
estimated at between 60 million cartons and 80 million cartons 
remained on the trees holland said 
most of californias navel oranges are sold on the fresh market 
florida oranges in contrast are used mostly for juice and juice 
concentrate those that sustain frost damage can sometimes be 
salvaged for juice processing 
the sunkist growers inc cooperative said early estimates 
indicated that at least half the citrus crop sustained frost 
damage spokeswoman claire peters said she added that growers hope 
to salvage some for juice 
there will be fewer fruit and what there is will cost more 
peters said 
inmporters of chilean fruit like los angelesbased david 
oppenheimer amp co expected demand for foreign fruit to increase as 
markets scramble to make up for local losses 
it was freezeofthecentury stuff said dave carman of the 
national weather service this is probably the secondcoldest 
freeze of the century we are dealing with extreme record cold 
since friday temperatures throughout the san joaquin valley 
citrus region had dipped to 20 degrees and below and were forecast 
to drop into the teens early today it was the worst freeze since 
1937 officials said 
navel oranges begin to show damage if temperatures fall to 25 or 
26 degrees and stay at that level or below for at least four hours 
holland said 
basically i have written off the crop that is on the tree 
said chris caviglia a tulare county grower what im concerned 
about now is the crop for next year i could very well lose it as 
well if the trees arent protected 
the navels were more vulnerable than normal this season because 
they were about two weeks late in maturing leaving the rinds too 
thin to ward off much cold california navels are harvested between 
november and june 
the 1989 navel orange crop was valued at 248 million compared 
to 129 billion in florida orange production that year 
losses in tulare county which produces most of the states 
navel oranges were expected to be about 200 million said county 
agriculture commissioner lenord craft state officials said most 
strawberries were lost but provided no dollar figure for the 
damage 
in ventura county losses to lemons avocados and nursery 
stocks or nonfoodbearing plants totaled at least 100 million 
said jim fulmer deputy agricultural commissioner 
about onefifth of the states avocados which account for 90 
percent of national consumption were lost said mark affleck 
president of the california avocado commission 
the extent of damage to vegetable fields in the sacramento and 
san joaquin valleys wasnt known but some farmers reported losses 
joe p prandini general manager of betteravia farms co said 
he lost about 35 percent of the cauliflower grown on his 4000acre 
farm 
holland said california growers have been fortunate in avoiding 
devastating freezes in the past some have saved for a bad year 
but others will be hurt 
i talk to growers who try to keep a minimum of one years 
farming costs in the bank but we also have people in the industry 
with tremendous debt on groves he said there are going to be 
some hard times

the prospect of war in the middle east 
has military and civilian security forces making extra sure theyre 
ready to protect the 800milelong transalaska oil pipeline from 
terrorists 
americas most important oil lifeline also may be its most 
vulnerable far removed from the continental united states and 
surrounded by wilderness 
its safety rests largely on a private firm under contract to 
alyeska pipeline service co the consortium of oil companies 
running the pipeline with plans for support from alaska state 
troopers the alaska national guard and the air force officials 
said 
security along the pipeline at pump stations and the 1000acre 
tanker loading terminal in valdez was tightened after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait in august alyeska officials said 
beyond that security plans to combat terrorist threats are 
being upgraded at the request of sen ted stevens ralaska 
in august i raised the question several times about the 
status of the contingency plans for the protection of the 
pipeline stevens said lt gen thomas mcinerney commander of 
the 11th air force in alaska was involved in the talks he said 
im assured there have been some meetings that have explored 
the degree of cooperation and coordination necessary to defend 
the pipeline he said they have a good plan i asked them to 
dust it off and make sure everybody understood it 
the transalaska oil pipeline completed in 1977 is the jugular 
of domestic oil production about 2 million barrels a day of north 
slope crude one quarter of all us output is pumped from 
prudhoe bay fields to the icefree port of valdez 
alyeska national guard and other federal officials would not 
discuss specific aspects of pipeline security saying it reveal too 
much to terrorists 
we are working on a draft plan national guard spokeswoman 
kristine schuster said alyeska is the lead agency here the 
national guard has been asked to give their input 
i dont talk about it said jp pat wellington manager 
of corporate security for alyeska he oversees alyeskas contract 
with american guard alert inc which is in charge of physical 
security on the 9 billion pipeline 
we are aware of what the security plans are and we are happy 
with them said dave vickery spokesman for the us bureau of 
land management which with the federal department of 
transportation and the state division of natural resources monitors 
the pipeline 
the 48inch pipe half of it buried and half of it elevated was 
laid across 575 miles of blmmanaged land it crosses 34 major 
rivers and 800 smaller streams seventythousand people helped 
build it 
at least two telephone threats warning of possible attacks on 
the pipeline were reported in recent weeks but neither claim could 
be substantiated and officials declined to discuss them 
its our policy not to confirm or deny the receipt of 
threats said tom matthews chief fbi agent in alaska 
meanwhile a source familiar with alyeska security who asked not 
to be identified said the pipeline company has been considering 
subscribing to a terrorism forecasting service 
despite the official worries terrorism specialist mike ackerman 
of ackerman associates in miami said the pipeline is an unlikely 
target of arab extremists 
terrorists if they strike inside the us would probably hit 
public targets such as airports in detroit or new york city 
ackerman said 
and a possible attack on the pipeline would be unlikely to shut 
down oil flow for a significant period of time he said

a hardline tehran newspaper today 
rejected salman rushdies efforts to end moslem anger over his 
novel the satanic verses it said the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis death edict still stands 
the british author announced monday that he has embraced islam 
and will not allow the book to be published in paperback he also 
pledged that he would no longer seek to have the novel published in 
other languages 
the novel has sold 1 million copies and already been translated 
into 15 languages the book is banned by 20 countries 
the abrar daily said in an editorial that khomeinis historic 
edict on rushdie is irrevocable even if he rushdie repents 
in february 1989 the iranian fundamentalist patriarch called on 
moslems to seek out and kill rushdie for allegedly blaspheming 
islam in the satanic verses iran subsequently offered a 1 
million bounty for rushdies death 
rushdie has been in hiding ever since 
rushdie announced his concessions to moslems in a statement 
released in london by one of several islamic leaders with whom he 
met in secret on monday 
hesham elessawy president of the islamic society for the 
promotion of religious tolerance said rushdie had typed the 
statement himself 
essawy said rushdie who was born to a moslem family in india 
and had previously said he did not consider himself a religious 
moslem now had a clean slate with the worlds estimated 1 
billion moslems 
but abrar dismissed rushdies efforts as part of propaganda 
maneuvers by the british government aimed at bringing rushdie out 
of isolation and making moslems neglect khomeinis edict 
although essawy said that he and two other prominent moslem 
scholars met with rushdie the newspaper claimed no british 
moslem leader could confirm any such meeting 
iran severed relations with britain over the rushdie affair 
accusing the london government of defaming islam by allowing the 
satanic verses to be published 
relations were resumed sept 27 after british officials conceded 
that rushdies book offended moslems and that london had no wish to 
offend islam 
the resumption of relations came amid efforts by iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani leader of his countrys socalled 
pragmatists to build bridges with the west following the june 1989 
death of khomeini 
the iranians have not rescinded khomeinis death sentence on 
rushdie claiming it is a religious edict that cannot be revoked 
but rafsanjani and his supporters have indicated they are prepared 
to allow the decree to lapse 
abrars editorial reflected the thinking of hardline radicals 
opposed to rafsanjanis drive to boost relations with the west and 
irans arab neighbors as well as liberalize iranian society 
rafsanjani has largely marginalized the radicals in a power 
struggle but they continue to snipe at him 
rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference monday 
that it is up to iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death 
sentence but he added i feel a lot safer tonight than i felt 
yesterday 
many moslems worldwide object to rushdies use of the names of 
the prophet mohammeds wives for the prostitutes in his novel and 
the implication that mohammed wrote the koran islams holy book 
instead of receiving it from god 
some moslem leaders in britain were not satisfied with rushdies 
concessions demanding that hardcover editions of the satanic 
verses be removed from bookstore shelves 
sher azam of the council for mosques in bradford in northern 
england where the book had been publicly burned sad 
until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on

message today that political leaders will choose patience and 
dialogue over a war in the persian gulf and noted that the holy 
land is also without peace 
the light of christ is with the tormented nations of the 
middle east for the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for 
the threat of conflict to disappear may leaders be convinced that 
war is an adventure with no return by reasoning patience and 
dialogue with respect for the inalienable rights of peoples and 
nations it is possible to identify and travel the paths of 
understanding and peace 
the holy land too has been awaiting this peace for years a 
peaceful solution to the whole question which concerns it a 
solution which takes into account the legitimate expectations of 
the palestinian people and of the people which lives in the state 
of israel the pope said

efforts for peace in the tormented nations of the middle east 
for the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for the 
threat of conflict to disappear the pope said in a christmas 
message delivered from the central balcony of st peters basilica 
in vatican city 
he also said a peaceful solution in israelioccupied lands must 
take into account the legitimate expectations of the palestinian 
people

middle east the pontiff said

recent memory 
for us christmas is an event of peace and here you cannot 
feel peacesaid german tourist gabriele beitz in manger square 
near the grotto where tradition holds that christ was born 
the christmas mood elsewhere in the middle east was also anxious 
as us troops in the gulf were placed on a heightened state of 
alert to guard against terrorist attacks 
but soldiers still managed to mark the holiday with carols 
decorations and desert religious services 
bethlehems christmas celebrations were canceled by the towns 
palestinian officials in solidarity with the threeyear uprising 
against israeli occupation most shops and restaurants were closed 
in past years the town was crowded with pilgrims during 
christmas and the streets were awash in colorful lights 
but only several hundred people were in manger square as 
midnight mass began at nearby st catherines church 
the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem michel sabah prayed 
for a peaceful resolution of the gulf conflict 
jesus shows us the way of love we need today on the eve of a 
world war especially under these circumstances we need peace 
he said in arabic and french

arab attacks on israelis after the oct 8 riot on jerusalems 
temple mount in which israeli police killed 17 palestinians 
as a christmas gesture the military announced it was releasing 
217 palestinian prisoners most had less than a month to go in 
their sentences 
for the estimated 300000 us troops in the gulf christmas 
festivities were muted by saudi law that forbids practice of all 
religions except islam 
carols such as silent night were sung behind closed tent 
flaps and military chaplains were renamed morale officers before 
holding lowkey services 
some soldiers however had some lively holiday diversions 
the cruise liner cunard princess was turned into a christmas eve 
party spot off bahrain where a woman dressed as santa claus 
greeted troops on the gangplank the pentagon paid 31 million to 
lease the ship for six months for the troops 
comedian bob hope was also in the gulf keeping to his longtime 
tradition of entertaining us troops at christmas 
britains archbishop of canterbury robert runcie today said war 
in the gulf could only be justified if and when all other means 
of persuasion have failed 
in such a combat thousands could suffer and die said 
runcie who was a decorated tank officer in world war ii 
in london queen elizabeth ii thanked the multinational forces 
in the gulf for resisting the bully and the tyrant she also 
condemned attacks by the irish republican army in northern ireland 
where 75 people have died in violence so far this year 
germans marked their first christmas since unification with a 
gesture of friendship to the soviet union 
money was collected to help ease the soviet food shortage and 
some people in former east germany invited red army soldiers over 
for the holiday 
its hearttoheart contact people to people said klaus 
wuest of berlin whose family spend christmas eve with a 
19yearold soviet soldier the old regime was based on suspicion 
and hatred now we can be friendly 
dramatic changes were also celebrated in albania where a 
23yearold ban on religion was lifted in november 
roman catholic priest simon jubani who was jailed eight times 
by the former stalinist regime led christmas mass in a rundown 
chapel the northern city of shkodra 
for the first time in 23 years there will be midnight mass 
jubani said merry christmas 
in statecontrolled churches in china worshipers and the 
curious joined in prayer and song 
for many in china an officially atheist country christmas is 
viewed as an exotic foreign holiday but department stores and 
hotels catering to foreigners often feature christmas themes 
i am not a believer said one student who attended a service 
in beijing but i know this day is very important to some people 
here and people everywhere i just want to learn a little about 
it

here is the vaticans official english 
translation of the annual christmas urbi et orbi to the city 
and to the world message given by pope john paul ii on tuesday 
 
at midnight the prophet isaiah spoke to us with inspired voice 
he proclaimed the people who walked in darkness have seen a 
great light those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them 
has light shined isaiah 92 
a light has shined only the light seen by the shepherds at 
bethlehem was it only that light which shone on the horizon 
in truth that light became a guiding sign like the star which 
guided the wise men from the east the light shone in a different 
way it shone more clearly to mans interior eyes god has revealed 
himself 
in broad daylight the evangelist speaks to us the apostle john 
the true light that enlightens every man was coming into the 
world john 19 this light is born in god it comes from god 
it is god 
it is the eternal word the word is the son one of being with 
the father god from god light from light the word has come 
into the world the word was made flesh 
in him was life and the life was the light of men the light 
shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it 
john 145 
the night persists the night of advent the peoples walk in 
darkness yet the light is with them the word who was made flesh 
in the midst of the nations the word in whom the unknowable god 
has made himself known to mankind the word who is the son 
in him the word is eternally known and eternally loved and he 
is the measure of this love the divine measure for god so loved 
the world that he gave his only son john 316 
the divine measure of love is the gift it is the son as a gift 
as the absolute gift not comparable with other gifts god man 
in him is life 
above the heritage of death present in the world man inherits 
the life which is from god he inherits it in the son who became 
man on bethlehem night and was born of the virgin mary he was born 
by the power of the holy spirit through whom is realized the 
absolute gift 
the night persists the night of advent the peoples walk in 
darkness yet with them is this absolute gift 
he is present the spirit of truth revealed in the son and by 
the son 
the light of the son ceases not to be with man through the power 
of the spirit who bears witness to him 
he bears witness to the word who was made flesh and on 
bethlehem night has come to dwell among us our earthly eyes see 
the child placed in a manger cf luke 27 while the eyes of 
faith see the glory glory as of the only son from the father full 
of grace and truth john 114 
on this day we ask for light we ask that the eyes of our hearts 
be enlightened cf ephesians 118 we ask for harmony and unity 
for families wounded by misunderstanding and torn by division 
the night persists but the light of christ is with mankind it 
is with the people in europe above the tumbled walls of 
ideological and political opposition there appear for believers 
demanding challenges and prospects 
yes europes future will be filled with wonderful spiritual 
vitality if hedonism and practical materialism are overcome and 
also if the barriers which divide the followers of the redeemer are 
broken down 
unity in the church and among all believers in christ this is 
the commitment of christians for building the new europe in the 
third millennium 
the light of christ is with the tormented nations of the middle 
east for the area of the persian gulf we await with trepidation 
for the threat of conflict to disappear may leaders be convinced 
that war is an adventure with no return 
by reasoning patience and dialogue with respect for the 
inalienable rights of peoples and nations it is possible to 
identify and travel the paths of understanding and peace 
the holy land too has been awaiting this peace for years a 
peaceful solution to the whole question which concerns it a 
solution which takes into account the legitimate expectations of 
the palestinian people and of the people which lives in the state 
of israel 
may the light of christ shine upon the continent of africa 
especially where freedom is compromised because of under 
development where peace and harmony between different peoples and 
traditions is disrupted by fratricidal struggles where hope for 
peace is still fragile and must be strengthened 
i call once again for a more just sharing of the earths 
resources a new and more just world ethical and economic order 
only effective and respectful cooperation between the rich 
countries and the emerging peoples can prevent the contrast between 
north and south from becoming a widening abyss which will increase 
the already vast and disturbing archipelago of poverty and death 
but the shadows through they seem to be growing deeper on the 
horizon cannot dim the light of christ 
to humanity seeking joy he offers the treasure of his own life 
he gives himself lavishing the signs of his love upon our weary 
present 
how for example could we fail to bless him for the religious 
awakening today influencing so many people young and old how 
could we fail to thank him for the new openness of peoples to his 
gospel to which the recent ad limina visit of numerous bishops 
from vietnam also bears promising witness 
christ travels and lives with us he is among us living and 
glorious in his triumph of mercy 
let humanity go to meet his unapproachable light which today 
reveals itself to us with power 
with the tongues of the peoples and nations let us ask for 
light

iraqi ambassadors headed home today for urgent consultations 
and us troops in the saudi desert experienced a christmas of 
contrast peace and goodwill mixed with loneliness and a 
heightened state of alert 
at camp david president bush was reportedly told that some 
military leaders believe us combat units in the persian gulf will 
not be ready for allout war with iraq by the jan 15 deadline 
imposed by the un security council 
lt gen calvin waller deputy us commander in saudi arabia 
made a similar assessment last week during defense secretary dick 
cheneys visit 
saddam hussein recalled his ambassadors from the united states 
the united nations and several western european countries 
iraqi officials were not saying what would be discussed but the 
call indicated saddam could be planning a major diplomatic 
offensive the council has said iraq must withdraw from kuwait by 
jan 15 or face possible attack by the almost 400000strong 
usled multinational forces stationed in the gulf 
fear of terrorist attacks during the holiday season led us 
military commanders in the gulf to order extra security 
precautions 
nevertheless troops tried their best to bring a yuletide mood 
to the saudi sands a special christmas feast was prepared using 
tons of supplies shipped in last month and christmas carols were 
sung inside tents 
santa even made several appearances one courtesy of coast 
guard petty officer 2nd class ron sauers 44 of rochester ny 
who used toilet paper for a beard and wore a red stocking cap 
services were held by protestant and roman catholic chaplains 
renamed morale officers because of a saudi law fobidding practice 
of all religions expect islam in the kingdom 
thousands of christians celebrated christmas in baghdad today 
and prayed for peace leaders of iraqs 15 million christians 
officiated at midnight masses and morning services across the iraqi 
capital 
bush was reportedly told by cheney and gen colin l powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff monday that military 
commanders believe us forces will not be ready for a fullscale 
attack on iraq by the jan 15 deadline 
cheney and powell returned monday from a fiveday trip to the 
gulf 
the comments to bush were reported by abctv and the new york 
times both cited unnamed sources the times said bush was told 
many military officials recommend delaying any attack until 
february 
neither the white house nor the defense department provided 
details of the meeting 
wallers remarks appeared to have upset some officials in the 
bush administration which has sought to show itself unwavering in 
its determination to use force if saddam refuses to quit kuwait 
which he seized on aug 2 
cheney said on sunday that us troops would be prepared today 
to take military action adding that us troop strength in 
the gulf is nearly 300000 
the israeli media said today the jewish states military is on 
higher alert than ever and has moved extra forces to its eastern 
front although army sources played down the reports 
banner headlines in most israeli newspapers and a report by 
israel radios military correspondent spoke of a heightened 
military alert and reinforcements along the border with jordan 
which lies between israel and iraq 
the reports came the day after israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said the danger of a gulf war was very close and 
foreign minister david levy warned jordan to not allow any 
adventurer to use its land or air space for the purpose of 
attacking israel 
saddam said over the weekend he would attack tel aviv first if 
war broke out over kuwait 
but military sources said on condition of anoymity that a 
military alert had been in force since the start of the gulf 
crisis they said they were not aware of any buildup on the jordan 
border 
in other developments 
comedian bob hope was in the gulf today entertaining troops 
hope first visited us troops for christmas shows in 1941 
on monday about 500 mourners gathered at mayport naval station 
near jacksonville fla for ceremonies to honor the 21 sailors 
from the uss saratoga killed in a ferry boat accident off israel

the armed forces appeared in control 
of this former dutch colony today after toppling the nearly 
3yearold elected government in what two former surinamese 
officials called a bloodless coup 
the dutch government today condemned the military takeover 
monday night and dutch tv said no one was arrested in the coup 
the takeover followed a dispute between president ramsewak 
shankar and longtime military chief lt col desi bouterse who 
had resigned earlier in the day 
there were no reports of shooting and shankars whereabouts were 
not known dutch foreign ministry spokesman dig istha said that 
practically all communication lines out of suriname were still cut 
this afternoon 
dutch television quoted an surinamese embassy spokesman as 
saying that no one has been put under arrest in the coup 
reportedly led by the acting commander of the dutch forces ivan 
graanoogst 
observers in the netherlands believed the coup was masterminded 
by bouterse 
in 1980 bouterse led a military coup that toppled a 
legitimately elected government in the small mineralrich country 
on south americas northeastern tip he ruled until elections in 
november 1987 which shankars front for democracy and development 
party won by a landslide 
relations between the government and bouterse have been strained 
ever since shankar began serving a fiveyear term on jan 25 1988 
with bouterse wielding considerable power by virtue of his control 
of the military 
in amsterdam netherlands a former highranking surinamese 
official who spoke with bouterse after mondays coup said the 
military had acted after the government reneged on a pledge to step 
down 
graanoogst announced the takeover on surinamese television late 
monday according to dutch tv and former surinamese diplomat living 
in a nearby country 
the former diplomat said the coup appeared to have been 
bloodless and quoted graanoogst as saying a curfew was in effect 
graanoogst urged his countrymen to remain calm and said the 
military had everything under control 
the former surinamese official in amsterdam said the army had 
promised to form an interim government that would organize free 
elections within 100 days and that bouterse had assured him that no 
shots were fired during the coup 
the official andre j haakmat was minister of justice and 
minister of the army from 198082 by went into exile after a 
dispute with bouterse 
earlier monday night a surinamese newspaper reporter told the 
associated press bureau in san juan puerto rico that the military 
had overthrown the government 
the telephone line went dead after a few minutes and the 
reporter who did not want to be identified by name was unable to 
give further details 
later all telephone and telex lines to suriname went out of 
service in washington the state department had no immediate 
comment 
in a dispute with shankar bouterse announced saturday that he 
intended to resign as head of the military in this nation of 
380000 people 
he was angered by treatment he had received at amsterdams 
schiphol airport and accused shankar of collaborating with dutch 
officials who refused to grant him a visa or allow him access to 
journalists 
if i had been in shankars place i would have turned schiphol 
upside down to protect the dignity of the commander of my countrys 
national army bouterse said saturday returning from a trip via 
amsterdam to ghana and switzerland 
haakmat said the government had promised to step down in a 
meeting monday with bouterse and other military leaders but reneged 
immediately afterward 
the government is being accused of failing to uphold 
surinamese national dignity said haakmat in the two years 
they were in power they could not solve any of the problems in the 
country 
the dutch government said bouterse was kept from the public at 
the amsterdam airport for security reasons because bouterse might 
be at risk from the thousands of his political opponents who are 
living in the netherlands 
the dutch foreign ministry warned over the weekend that a coup 
will have a detrimental effect on development aid 
a 15billion annual dutch aid package to suriname which 
gained independence in 1975 was suspended after 15 prominent 
opposition leaders were killed on dec 8 1982 by bouterses 
military government 
bouterse had accused the leaders at the time of plotting to 
overthrow him 
but the suspension of the aid package only deepened the economic 
crisis that beset the country after bouterse took power and the 
weak economy has contributed to the political instability 
suriname has suffered from a drop in the price of bauxite its 
primary foreign exchange earner 
suriname is a multiracial nation whose population consists of 
indians javanese bush negroes and indigenous tribes 
much of the country is covered by heavy jungle making both 
communications and internal security difficult

kevin costner considered 
filming dances with wolves in grand teton national park but 
switched to a south dakota location when park officials wouldnt 
let them use a choice site 
the request was to provide a campsite of 40 tepees on a river 
with the tetons in the background said marshall gingery the 
parks assistant superintendent 
park officials recommended a site along the snake river north of 
moose which was turned down by the filmmakers 
they wanted to make deadmans bar which sits along the snake 
river with the tetons in the background into a campsite but park 
officials didnt think it could withstand the heavy use it would 
have received during the filmmaking 
we felt the resource was not able to tolerate that 
disturbance gingery said 
gingery also said officials were concerned about what offroad 
traffic might do to the area they were talking about boom 
trucks we didnt want any vehicles off the road in the 
cottonwoods especially he said 
gingery said the decision to move the film to south dakota 
probably was for the best because the terrain there is probably 
more typical for the sioux

parliament today voted to give sweeping new powers 
to president mikhail s gorbachev approving his ideas for a new 
vice presidency and cabinet under his direct control 
the approval of new powers by the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies was a clear victory for gorbachev and a triumph 
for the hardline lawmakers whom foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze cited last week in his stunning resignation he said 
hardliners were pushing the country to dictatorship 
the parliament voted today to eliminate gorbachevs moribund 
presidential council form a new federation council with gorbachev 
as its chief and create a powerful new vice presidency subordinate 
to gorbachev 
they approved a bill placing the proposed new cabinet of 
ministers under gorbachevs direct control as opposed to the 
current council of ministerss subordination to the national 
supreme soviet legislature 
the parliament also fell short of the twothirds majority needed 
to approve a bill that would require legislative approval for 
gorbachevs presidential decrees the president currently can issue 
his sweeping orders without any oversight although many republics 
have been ignoring the decrees and adding to the breakdown of 
order 
the votes came after boris n yeltsin leader of the soviet 
unions most populous republic condemned the plans to broaden 
gorbachevs power and said he would vote against them 
the soviet president claims the reforms are needed to hold 
together a country being threatened with collapse by separatists 
movements and economic chaos each of the republics have declared 
some form of political independence or economic autonomy seeking 
to supercede national laws with their own 
the gorbachevproposed amendments would replace the council of 
ministers and its prime minister nikolai ryzhkov with a smaller 
15member cabinet and a more powerful vice president all under 
direct presidential control 
they also would give more power to gorbachevs federation 
council of representatives from the 15 republics 
debate began today with one deputy suggesting gorbachev should 
give up some of his posts in the reorganization 
dont you feel sorry for mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev he has 
only one life to live erkin yusupov a deputy from uzbekistan 
told the congress 
he has a family children grandchildren he is communist 
party general secretary he is president he is responsible for 
the council of ministers in the end we have to consider how 
much is one person capable of doing 
gorbachev who has attended every session since the congress 
opened dec 17 said he would keep the jobs in the government and 
party 
the president also indicated shevardnadze had agreed to remain 
foreign minister during the congress scheduled to end thursday 
shevardnadze i believe is a man who has done a lot and will 
still do a lot gorbachev told reporters today the question of 
where and how will continue to be discussed 
the amendments on presidential power include provisions that 
would prohibit the vice president from being a member of congress 
said alexander kudryavtsev chairman of the amendment drafting 
commission 
nearly every senior leader including the few people thought to 
be candidates for the vice presidency is a deputy in the congress 
kudryavtsev also said the draft calls for the federation council 
to include representatives of the 15 republics and the 20 smaller 
autonomous republics which are under republic jurisdiction 
that would give the council about 150 members which kudryavtsev 
likened to a small general assembly 
on monday congress ordered each republic to hold a referendum 
asking residents whether they want to remain in a restructured 
soviet union and another on whether people should be allowed to 
own land privately 
private property ownership already has been approved by the 
russian legislature which has authority over threequarters of the 
countrys land and control of 90 percent of its energy supplies 
yeltsin has said there is no need for a referendum 
congress also endorsed the concept of a new union treaty to keep 
the union together and voted to keep socialist as part of the 
countrys name

a majority of people surveyed in major european 
countries have a favorable view of japan but believe it is not 
fulfilling its international responsibilities the foreign ministry 
reported tuesday 
among the chief criticisms was that japan needs to correct its 
trade imbalance however many respondents said the creation of the 
european single market planned for 1992 will improve relations 
between japan and the european community the ministry said in a 
news release 
it was the sixth such poll conducted by japan since 1977 it was 
carried out from september through october by private research 
organizations in each of the countries surveyed britain france 
germany belgium italy the netherlands and spain 
in all seven countries the degree of trust in japan is rather 
high ranging from 71 percent to 91 percent the ministry said 
in every country except italy however a majority of 
respondents thought japan was not fulfilling its international 
role 
japan the worlds no 2 economic power has come under 
criticism for not doing more to assist usled forces in the 
persian gulf and to ease its chronic trade surpluses 
many respondents called for a prompt correction of japans trade 
surplus with the ec which totaled 149 billion in november the

among other findings according to a summary released by the 
ministry

officials in the central province of shaanxi have 
formed a special antidrug force to combat narcotics trafficking 
and abuse the legal daily newspaper reported tuesday 
the state newspaper said 184 people were convicted of 
drugrelated crimes in shaanxi in the first 10 months of this year 
it gave no details 
shaanxi officials said the illegal trade and drug abuse have 
increased dramatically over the past three years authorities in 
other regions of china also have expressed alarm over the countrys 
increasing drug problems 
chinese courts in shaanxi and other provinces have begun to 
impose stiff sentences for drug crimes in some cases even the 
death penalty 
the legal daily said authorities broke up three smuggling 
networks bringing drugs into shaanxi from other provinces such as 
yunnan this year 
yunnan in southwestern china borders the golden triangle 
an area including parts of thailand laos and burma that has been 
one of the largest sources of opium for the worlds heroin supply 
yunnan also has been a gateway for smugglers carrying drugs 
through southwestern china to hong kong for shipment abroad 
the legal daily said authorities from shaanxi and the 
neighboring province of henan worked together to crush two regional 
drugtrafficking networks involving more than 20 people 
it said that in addition to the legal crackdown the special 
team set up in shaanxi will increase efforts to curb drug use 
addicts will receive treatment to help break their drug habits and 
education programs have been started to prevent others from using 
illegal narcotics the newspaper said 
chinas drug problem was virtually eliminated after the 
communists came to power in 1949 but it has reemerged in recent 
years

advocate of kashmiri independence on a monthlong parole he was 
arrested in septermber united news of india described gurds

englishlanguage daily the liberation front is the largest of many 
separatist factions in the northern jammukashmir state

largest sikh faction but resigned his seat last year he is known 
to be close to some guerrilla factions but is opposed by others as 
too moderate 
extremists have killed more than 3200 people this year in

claiming the state was being stripped of its revenues from its rich 
tea plantations and oil fields

and women in the gulf to make the free calls during thanksgiving

pope john paul ii prayed for peace on 
christmas day as world leaders spoke worriedly of the prospect of 
war in the persian gulf us soldiers thoughts turned to loved 
ones as they spent a somber holiday far from home 
germans marked their first christmas since their national 
unification and albanians were free to celebrate a religious 
holiday for the first time in more than two decades 
in bethlehem the site of jesus birth soldiers patrolled the 
city crowds were small and the atmosphere subdued because of the 
gulf crisis and the 3yearold palestinian uprising which has 
sharply cut tourism to the holy land 
the light of christ is with the tormented nations of the 
middle east the pontiff said in a christmas message delivered 
from the central balcony of st peters basilica in rainsoaked 
vatican city 
for the area of the gulf we await with trepidation for the 
threat of conflict to disappear the pope said may leaders be 
convinced that war is an adventure with no return 
john paul said a peaceful solution in israelioccupied lands 
must take into account the legitimate expectations of the 
palestinian people 
the fear of palestinian unrest and the gulf crisis left 
bethlehem with one of its smallest christmas crowds in recent 
memory 
for us christmas is an event of peace and here you cannot 
feel peacesaid german tourist gabriele beitz in manger square 
near the grotto where tradition holds that christ was born 
in albania where a 23yearold ban on religion was lifted in 
november roman catholic priest simon jubani led christmas mass in 
a rundown chapel in the northern city of shkodra 
the croatian news agency hina reported that more than 30000 
catholics attended the mass which would make it the biggest such 
celebration in postwar albania security forces were on hand but 
no incidents were reported the news agency said 
it said another 500 worshipers attended a mass in tirana 
albanias capital 
for the first time in 23 years there will be midnight mass 
said jubani who was jailed eight times by the former stalinist 
regime merry christmas 
in his message john paul said the fall of communist rule in 
eastern europe last year poses demanding challenges for 
catholics in the region 
europes future will be filled with wonderful spiritual 
vitality if hedonism and practical materialism are overcome he 
said 
in and around the persian gulf tens of thousands of american 
troops were on a heightened state of alert to guard against any 
attacks but soldiers still celebrated the holiday with carols 
decorations and religious services 
christmas festivities in saudi arabia where the bulk of the 
us troops are deployed were muted to avoid offending the islamic 
saudis carols such as silent night were sung behind closed 
tent flaps and military chaplains held lowkey services 
servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier uss saratoga were still 
mourning the loss of 21 crewmen in the sinking of an israeli ferry 
on saturday the ferry capsized as it was bringing the men back to 
the saratoga after shore leave in israel 
crewmen ferried to haifa israel to telephone home on 
christmas but said they had little inclination to celebrate 
any plans i had of having me a good time died with the guys on 
saturday said a sailor from louisiana who spoke on condition of 
anonymity im going to go straight back to the ship and have a 
quiet christmas after i phone home 
in london queen elizabeth ii thanked the multinational forces 
in the gulf for resisting the bully and the tyrant she also 
condemned attacks by the irish republican army in northern ireland 
where 75 people have died in violence so far this year 
the archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said war in the 
persian gulf could only be justified if and when all other means 
of persuasion have failed 
in such a combat thousands could suffer and die said 
runcie who was a decorated tank officer in world war ii 
germans marked christmas as one nation with a gesture of 
friendship to the soviet union money was collected to help ease 
soviet food shortages and some people in former east germany 
invited red army soldiers over for the holiday 
in china an officially atheist country worshipers and the 
curious joined in prayer and song in statecontrolled churches 
i am not a believer said one student who attended a service 
in beijing but i know this day is very important to some people 
here and people everywhere i just want to learn a little about 
it 
in his message the pope also spoke of africa disrupted by 
fratricidal struggles where hope for peace is still fragile and 
must be strengthened 
however the pontiff said the light of christmas broke through 
the shadows of some world conflicts he pointed to communist 
vietnams granting permission to bishops to travel to rome to meet 
with him 
the vatican said the popes message was broadcast in about 60 
countries including poland bulagria czechoslovakia hungary 
romania and the soviet union which have all established formal 
ties with the vatican since 1989

president bush spent a secluded christmas with 
his family tuesday a holiday overshadowed by the possibility that 
soon he may have to order american troops to war 
bush and his wife barbara were at camp david in marylands 
catoctin mountains about 60 miles north of washington with their 
children and grandchildren spokesman steve hart said 
the holiday menu included turkey cranberry sauce green beans 
sweet potatoes and pie hart said bush was not expecting visitors 
and planned no special activities for the day he said 
but although his stay at camp david through jan 2 is billed as 
a vacation the president will work several hours every day and 
receive reports on developments around the world hart said 
bush decided to forgo his traditional texas turkey hunt this 
year so he could stay close to washington and monitor the persian 
gulf crisis aides said 
in his christmas message to us troops bush promised he would 
try to bring them home without a single shot fired but if they 
must fight he added the sacrifices you make will never be 
forgotten 
on christmas eve bush conferred at camp david with defense 
secretary dick cheney and gen colin l powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff both had just returned from five days in 
saudi arabia 
the two reportedly told bush that senior military officers think 
the us troops deployed in the saudi desert will not be ready to 
attack iraqi forces by jan 15 the deadline set by the united 
nations for iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
that opinion was first expressed several days ago by lt gen 
calvin waller deputy us commander in saudi arabia cheney and 
powell told bush that commanders in the field predict us troops 
wont be ready until the beginning or middle of february the new 
york times reported tuesday 
hart had no comment on the report 
the un security council decided last month that the united 
states and its allies would be allowed to use force against iraq 
unless its troops left kuwait by jan 15 
bush said he wanted to give diplomacy one final chance by 
sending secretary of state james baker to baghdad to convey 
american determination to implement the un resolution 
but attempts to arrange a meeting between baker and saddam have 
failed and baker who said he would be willing to fly to baghdad 
on christmas day was instead spending the holiday in houston his 
hometown 
cheney was spending christmas in wyoming and vice president dan 
quayle was skiing in vail colo quayle plans to visit american 
troops in saudi arabia on dec 29

a weeklong ban on ammunition sales that began 
tuesday should make it harder to start 1991 with a bang say 
authorities concerned about revelers shooting into the air new 
years eve 
the ban in effect in san fernando as well as los angeles 
angers gun shop owners who predict it will be ineffective 
barry kahn general manager of bampb sales in north hollywood 
said customers will only have to visit a neighboring community to 
buy ammunition 
frankly its a crock he said they cant come up with 
the statistics to back the law 
no one was injured last year by falling bullets but in previous 
years bystanders have been wounded or even killed 
we dont expect to solve it overnight even with the ban 
said police deputy chief william rathburn but were optimistic 
that over the years we can stop the practice of celebrating new 
years eve by firing guns

serbias renamed communists 
overwhelmingly won the republics first free vote in five decades 
taking 194 seats in the republics 250seat parliament according 
to final official results tuesday 
serbia the largest republic and montenegro the smallest were 
the only two of yugoslavias six republics to elect commnunist 
governments in the other four regions centerright or nationalist 
parties triumphed 
the results in serbia and montenegro threaten to push yugoslavia 
one step closer to disintegration 
the procapitalist opposition in serbia did better in sundays 
secondround voting than in the first round dec 9 but it failed 
to dislodge the former communists recently renamed the socialists 
from control of the state assembly 
in the first round the socialists won 87 seats and their 
leader slobodan milosevic was reelected by a wide margin as the 
republics president 
the opposition which formed a coalition on the eve of the 
second round ballot won 48 seats in the onechamber parliament 
eight seats went to independent candidates not involved in the 
coalition 
some prominent communists and close allies of milosevic 
including serbian premier stanko radmilovic were ousted in the 
second round 
dragoljub micunovic of the democratic party who defeated a 
socialist candidate in belgrade told reporters the opposition 
should look into alleged irregularities before declaring the 
elections fair and honest 
he also complained the opposition did not get enough coverage by 
socialistcontrolled media to present an effective campaign 
in slovenia where a centerright coalition ousted communists in 
spring elections 95 percent of voters in a referendum sunday chose 
independence from yugoslavia 
slovenias parliament will decide within the next six months 
whether to secede from the fractious federation both slovenia and 
its westernminded ally croatia say they will secede if yugoslavia 
is not transformed into a loose confederation 
serbia home to 40 percent of yugoslavias 235 million 
inhabitants advocates a strong federal government milosevic has 
not been willing to negotiate with the western republics and warned 
he will not respect borders within yugoslavia if the federation 
breaks up 
yugoslavias defense minister gen veljko kadijevic this month 
threatened army intervention to preserve federal integrity 
a recent cia report predicted the country could fall apart 
within 18 months because of ethnic tensions and political 
infighting among republics it said civil war was possible

did you hear the one about the guy who 
thought he accepted a job in iowa only to find out boise is in 
idaho 
or the one about a wall street journal real estate ad listing a 
450000 log cabin in sun valley iowa the renowned ski resort is 
in idaho 
for a decade tim woodward a columnist for the idaho statesman 
has written periodically about the confusion over two states 1500 
miles apart 
woodward says he keeps writing what he intends to be the last 
column on the subject only to be deluged with newspaper clippings 
magazine articles and testimonials from readers with more tales of 
what he calls the idahoiowa connection 
i have a file it probably weighs about five pounds of 
stuff that i still have to use woodward said there isnt a 
week that goes by that i dont get things from people 
woodward a 42yearold boise native who is writing a book on 
such mixups believes much of the confusion comes what he calls 
the i factor 
people think all four of the i states should be in a neat 
line in the midwest he said of course three of them are iowa 
illinois and indiana 
the confusion between iowa and idaho certainly cant be 
attributed to a similarity of landscape 
idaho has a dozen national forests and its highest point is 
12662 feet iowa has no national forests and its highest point is 
1670 feet 
we both have corn fields but iowa has a lot more woodward 
said 
woodward said one of his favorite mixups is the pilot who 
thought he was moving to iowa 
someone told him the boise assignment was a good one that itwas 
good working hours easy flying conditions not much air 
traffic woodward said 
not until he actually got ready to move and had been given the 
boise assignment did he realize he was 1500 miles off woodward 
said he had boise and des moines mixed up 
but he came anyway he liked it and hes still here

when electric rates go up or the wind 
knocks power lines down norman pearson and julieanne belanger 
never notice 
pearson and belanger choose to live without any help from the 
electric company they heat their home with wood and cook with 
propane or on a wood stove depending on the season 
until last spring when pearson installed solar panels on his 
roof that provide some electricity the only indoor lighting was 
from gas lamps kerosene lanterns and flashlights 
the couple do without indoor plumbing and use an outhouse 20 
yards from their home 
pearson who grew up in a middleclass home in a chicago suburb 
says he enjoys the feeling of selfsufficiency 
his decision to go without electricity also reflects his 
opposition to nuclear power and concern that extending power lines 
to his house might encourage people to build on undeveloped 
property nearby 
ive seen power bills said pearson im amazed at how 
much they are 
its a secure thing said belanger who built a tiny house 
of her own in nearby concord with no water or electricity in the 
1970s our neighbors sometimes would call after a storm and say 
did you lose your electricity theyd forget 
pearson and belanger are not the only people in maine who live 
without electricity there are houses scattered around the state 
without power although there are no statistics on how many 
the couples house looks as if it were built in sections as 
needed there are no visible wires leading to the house the phone 
line is underground 
inside the house is heated by a wood stove and the sun that 
shines through fiberglass covers on the southern side pearson cuts 
the wood on his land primarily from damaged trees to feed the 
stove 
more than seven cords of wood enough to last more than a year 
are stacked in a shed 
its a great feeling to have excess wood pearson said 
the couple cook on a big castiron woodburning stove during 
the summer they use a small stove hooked up to a propane gas tank 
their tiny refrigerator is powered by propane in the summer and is 
not used in the winter 
the only water inside comes through a hand pump in the kitchen 
sink hooked up to a well theres no toilet no shower no hot 
water except for the pot on top of the stove 
pearson said he could build a bathroom but prefers the 
outhouse toilets waste too much clean water he says 
pearson grew up with the typical amenities and graduated from 
northwestern university he was a maine social worker for seven 
years and now works six to eight weeks a year as a substitute rural 
mail carrier he is also a new vineyard selectman 
belanger teaches first grade in new portland 10 miles away her 
daughter ahmen is an eighthgrader at mount blue junior high 
school in farmington 
ahmen would prefer to live in a normal house with electricity 
and water she said she would love to have a shower in the 
mornings and isnt fond of having to walk to the outhouse 
especially on cold winter nights 
many of her friends think the house is novel but others refuse 
to visit overnight because theres no bathroom 
pearson said his lifestyle has surprised foreign friends who 
have visited the house over the years 
they were amazed pearson said they always thought 
america is the land of consumption the land of plenty

los angeles ap the canceled tv series baywatch the 
lifeguard drama starring david hasselhoff that drowned in low 
ratings is riding a new wave of popularity overseas and will 
resume production next year its syndicator said 
baywatch was canceled by nbc last spring after ending its 
first season ranked 74th among 111 series the three major networks 
but the show proved a hit overseas becoming the no 1 imported 
show in the united kingdom said henry siegel president of lbs 
communications which syndicates the show the show has been sold 
in more than 40 nations 
in the uk their rationale is that baywatch may be what 
people perceive that the us is all about it has goodlooking 
people with good action said siegel 
the strong foreign sales make new episodes possible 
additionally hasselhoff has agreed to take a lowerthanusual 
salary in exchange for a share of the profits siegel said 
critics said the show lacked substance and had too many scantily 
clad beach romps sort of a babes watch but siegel cited poor 
promotion as the reason baywatch failed 
far from being a sexploitation show he said its emergency 
on the beach its also an issueoriented show but the issues 
happen on the beach 
siegel expects the former cast to return with the exception of 
parker stevenson and shawn weatherly

by this point on the political calendar 
new hampshires campaign veterans are accustomed to seeing wouldbe 
presidential nominees at work in the first primary state in person 
or by proxy 
but a year before first primary of the next presidential 
election campaign nothing is stirring 
a few potential candidates visited in 1989 and early 1990 but 
not one candidate or campaign worker has set up shop in what should 
be prime time to prepare for 1992 
its been amazingly quiet says dennis murphy chairman of 
illinois sen paul simons 1988 primary campaign i havent heard 
from anyone havent talked to anyone even remotely representing a 
presidential candidate 
by contrast democrats bruce babbitt the former arizona 
governor and rep richard a gephardt the house majority leader 
from missouri campaigned in new hampshire two years before the 
1988 primary other candidates including thenvice president 
george bush had campaign workers in the state at this time in 
1986 
bush and massachusetts gov michael s dukakis the eventual 
nominees won their party primaries here in 1988 since the current 
primary system was instituted no president has been elected 
without winning in new hampshire first 
in iowa site of the first presidential caucus the political 
scene is equally quiet 
whats the story 
some say candidates have abandoned long primary campaigns 
because they are too grueling can lead to burnout and have turned 
off many voters they also point to gephardt who withdrew before 
the national convention in 1988 as evidence that candidates who 
get the jump on their competition often end up losing anyway 
others say candidates dont want to tip their hands too early 
after even one trip here no one can say anything on their 
minds anymore because it will be viewed as being motivated by 
presidential politics says ned helms the state democratic 
chairman 
sen sam nunn of georgia recently turned down an invitation to 
speak in new hampshire in february 
i am not ready to have everyone in the country say that sam 
nunn has decided to run for president he explained 
the 1988 primary was for an open presidential race with ronald 
reagan retiring bush will be up for reelection in 1992 
state republican chairwoman rhona charbonneau said gov mario 
cuomos narrowed margin in a threeway new york election and sen 
bill bradleys close call victory in new jersey hurt two of the 
democrats most appealing potential candidates 
other democrats mentioned as possible entries include nunn 
sens joseph r biden of delaware lloyd m bentsen of texas 
albert gore jr of tennessee tom harkin of iowa and bob kerrey of 
nebraska govs douglas wilder of virginia and richard celeste of 
ohio and the rev jesse jackson 
the speculation about a possible conservative challenge to bush 
in a republican primary comes up short of likely candidates 
former delaware gov pete du pont has set up a political action 
committee but he quickly told a new hampshire newspaper that it 
wasnt to finance a second presidential bid du pont ran in 1988 
he said his committee for republican leadership is to fight tax 
increases not to launch a presidential bid 
thomas rath who led sen bob doles 1988 new hampshire primary 
effort says bushs enormous popularity for most of his first term 
and the persian gulf crisis are reasons for the political 
inactivity 
for an extended period of time bushs numbers were so high 
they maybe scared off challengers rath says and the middle 
east has had a big impact i dont think anyone wants to look like 
theyre using it for their own political gain 
some welcome the change from twoyear primary campaigns 
im not disappointed at all murphy says ive never been a 
fan of the firstinthenation primary what happens in the 
statehouse is much more important 
mary chambers democratic leader of the new hampshire house 
also believes less is better in primary elections 
nobody is even thinking about it theyre too busy with other 
things she says they are going to stay in washington and 
take care of business as long as its so questionable about what 
will happen in the middle east

five employees of a state tax agency are 
going to get to keep their jobs thanks to the cooperation of their 
fellow workers 
the five employees of the board of equalization and assessment 
were expected to be among the nearly 2000 state workers being laid 
off to help combat a 1 billion budget deficit in new york state 
but their colleagues saved their jobs by volunteering to take 
some time off without pay making the agencys budget stretch a 
little further ramon rodriguez assistant director of the board 
said monday 
the board oversees the local administration of property taxes 
the holiday season probably had something to do with the good 
spirit but my sense is were an agency that would do this any time 
of the year he added 
employees at the agency approached managers and asked that they 
survey the staff to see who would be willing to give up a few days 
pay to save jobs he said a notice went out to all employees last 
week 
in all 279 of the boards 560 employees agreed to take one to 
three days off without pay 
what you have is an agency coming together as a community 
said rodriguez 
that wasnt the only example of jobsaving at the board eleven 
managementlevel workers saved two other employees jobs by 
volunteering to give up a week of vacation pay 
despite such actions the board didnt completely avoid layoffs 
rodriguez said two employees are taking early retirement and 
three others will have to be laid off

federal wildlife agents are using a new 
weapon in their battle against big game poachers the poachers 
themselves 
a us fish and wildlife service program is turning convicted 
poachers into video preachers violators tell fellow hunters and 
hunting guides about the impact of the illegal killing of 
grizzlies wolves caribou dall sheep elk and other big game and 
waterfowl in alaska and the west 
one of the biggest guns among the new antipoaching crusaders is 
longtime alaska guide and outfitter ron hayes hayes who was 
convicted in 1987 of illegally hunting grizzly bears by airplane 
served two years in prison forfeited several aircraft paid 
thousands of dollars in fines and lost his hunting privilege 
he was probably the most notorious bandit guide that ever 
lived said dave hall a new orleansbased agent of the fish and 
wildlife service who is organizing the video project 
hall visited hayes several times in prison and helped show him 
of the error of his ways on halls urging hayes agreed to help 
make a 30minute video last summer for the services use and to 
cooperate with a national geographic society television documentary 
on poaching to be broadcast this spring 
several other convicted poachers have agreed to appear in the 
agencys videos 
this is the only way we can make conservation enforcement 
effective hall said 
alaska has 545 million acres of national park lands and just 11 
patrol rangers that comes to nearly 5 million acres per ranger 
the national parks and conservation association and some 
wildlife officials contend poaching harms big game species by 
depleting the strongest animals in the species reducing the 
quality of the gene pool other officials say there is not enough 
biological evidence to support that conclusion 
hall has put his emphasis on guides because alaska prohibits 
nonresidents from hunting big game without the services of one of 
the approximately 450 guideoutfitters in the state 
for the national geographic society project filmed during the 
summer hayes recreated his poaching technique on the katmai 
national park and preserve by herding a grizzly to a hunting party 
with his airplane 
in a startling admission hayes said in the film that of the 37 
grizzlies he helped hunters place in the boone and crockett clubs 
record book every one was shot after being herded illegally to the 
hunter with an airplane 
the national geographic film will be broadcast this spring as 
one of four segments on poaching in its explorer series other 
segments will deal with poaching of waterfowl and elk and a 
national overview of the problem 
because of alaskas size and the number of trophy animals 
hunted poaching in the state has become a major problem officials 
said 
there are no figures for the number of animals killed illegally 
but state wildlife officials say hunters come to alaska from around 
the world seeking trophysized sheep grizzlies and wolves and to 
hunt moose and caribou black bear waterfowl and other game 
animals 
not all poaching is for sport 
some hunters illegally kill big game animals for selected body 
parts bear gall bladders are used in some asian cultures for 
medical purposes bear claws are used to make jewelry and caribou 
antlers are ground up to make powdered potions said to enhance sex 
federal and state officials however said they are most 
concerned about trophy poachers 
the guides are under great pressure to produce trophy animals 
and have a huge financial stake in hunters success guides get 
paid on a peranimal basis and can receive 7000 or more for a 
dall sheep and between 8000 and 10000 for a grizzly according 
to jim hannah a national park service district ranger in the 13 
millionacre wrangellst elias national park and preserve

some american jewish leaders tuesday criticized 
israels performance so far in handling the influx of soviet jewish 
immigrants 
we are concerned that there is no sense of urgency seymour 
reich outgoing chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations told a news conference 
we believe it is incumbent on israel to address this as a top 
priority using all of its resources all of its people all of its 
government facilities he said 
about 172000 soviet jews have settled in israel this year and 
officials expect 1 million by the end of 1992 but efforts to 
absorb them have run into bureaucratic and financial difficulties 
shoshana cardin the newly elected chairman of the new 
yorkbased conference the leading us jewish organization said 
there appeared to be a lack of coordination among ministries 
dealing with immigrant absorption 
housing minister ariel sharon is at odds with absorption 
minister yitzhak peretz and has accused peretzs staff of failing 
to cope with the influx peretz is boycotting the cabinet 
immigration committee headed by sharon 
there seems to be not that urgency of everyone working 
together to ensure the maximum efficiency in the minimum amount of 
time crdin said 
she said that sense of urgency will translate itself in the 
diaspora of jewish communities outside israel and encourage fund 
raising and investment in this country 
peretz a rabbi has made hotly disputed claims that up to 35 
percent of the soviet immigrants are not jewish other rabbis in 
the government say the figure is no more than 5 percent 
peretz says israel should tighten its law of return which 
affords automatic citizenship to all jewish immigrants 
asked to comment cardin said anything that would deny or 
impede the aliya immigration would be tragic at this point

tamil rebels said tuesday they would 
suspend fighting to mark the new years holiday but demanded that 
army troops in northern and eastern districts be confined to 
barracks during the truce 
the offer comes after three previous ceasefires between the two 
combatants ended in more bitter rounds of fighting with each side 
accusing the other of violating the truce 
we will offer a unilateral ceasefire to mark the new year it 
will begin midnight dec 31 and may go on for two or three days 
rebel spokesman sathasivam krishnakumar said in a telephone 
interview from london 
however defense secretary cyril ranatunge said the tamil tiger 
rebel movement cannot be trusted 
every time this kind of thing is put out the terrorists go 
back on their word he said the government routinely refers to 
the rebels as terrorists 
gen ranatunge said he cannot comment on a government response 
because it will be a political decision 
more than 14000 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
secessionist war by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the longest ceasefire lasted 13 months until june 11 when the 
tigers stormed 30 police stations and army barracks along the 
eastern coast killing scores of security force personnel 
fierce fighting since then has left the government forces in 
control of several towns in the east and the guerillas holding the 
jungles and the entire northern district including their 
stronghold of jaffna peninsula 
the tigers have been fighting since 1983 claiming the ethnic 
tamil minority is discriminated against by the sinhalese in jobs 
and education 
tamils who are mainly hindu make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people the mostly buddhist sinhalese account for 75 
percent of the population and dominate the government and the 
military

some of the western humanitarian aid pouring into 
the soviet union has been stolen but more than 99 percent is 
reaching the people who need it most the kgb chairman said 
tuesday 
some western donors have expressed concern that in the 
chronically corrupt soviet economy the aid could be stolen 
siphoned off to the black market or otherwise abused 
at a news conference at the congress of peoples deputies the 
soviet parliament kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov did not say what 
was stolen or how much 
he said only that minor cases of theft had been discovered 
by the kgb the soviet legislature has asked the police agency to 
ensure proper distribution of donated food medical and other 
supplies 
kryuchkov shrugged off the state departments condemnation of 
his speech to the soviet congress on saturday in which he accused 
the cia and other outside forces of trying to pressure the 
soviet union and impose doubtful ideas and plans 
the condemnation the kgb chief said does not produce much 
enthusiasm in me 
referring to his speech he said i think they will go back 
read it again and understand it better 
kryuchkov said between 440000 and 460000 soviet citizens had 
emigrated to israel the united states and other countries in 1990 
and its entirely possible the number will not decline in 1991 
i think thats an awful lot for us and i would say that when 
people are leaving their native country that is not a good sign 
for the condition of the society he said 
kryuchkov said he was sorry that eduard a shevardnadze resigned 
last week as foreign minister adding personally i had a good 
relationship with him 
but kryuchkov rejected shevardnadzes contention that the 
country was heading toward dictatorship 
i am deeply convinced that in the event our president invokes 
emergency measures it would mean just introducing order which we 
all feel the lack of he said 
its being demanded by the way from the left the right and 
the center

moscows first consul in israel since 1967 
presented his credentials tuesday underscoring growing warmth 
between the jewish state and the soviet union at a time when soviet 
jews are emigrating in record numbers 
in a similar ceremony in moscow arieh levine presented his 
credentials to soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze to 
become israels consul to the soviet union 
at the office of foreign minister david levy in jerusalem 
alexei f chistyakov said he felt honored to be moscows consul to 
israel and would do everything to nurture relations between the 
countries 
the diplomat who spoke in russian through a translator 
promised to foster a political dialogue between jerusalem and 
moscow he said the new relations would help to reach a stable 
peace in the middle east which guarantees the rights of all the 
peoples and countries in the region as well as the interests of 
the international community 
eventually he said ties would be normalized 
moscow severed diplomatic relations with israel 23 years ago 
after israel captured land from the soviet unions arab allies 
during the 1967 middle east war 
the soviets have hinged a full resumption of ties on israel 
making concessions to the palestinians through an international 
peace conference 
israel maintains that the break in relations was unjustified 
because it was the arabs who caused the 1967 war it rejects the 
peace conference formula fearing it will be forced into making 
dangerous territorial concessions 
nonetheless the effects of soviet political reforms have been 
felt here since june 1987 when the soviets sent a temporary 
diplomatic delegation to tel aviv it became permanent so israel 
insisted on reciprocity and was allowed to dispatch a consular 
group to moscow a year later 
cultural economic and sports exchanges followed israel aided 
armenian earthquake victims and last month sent food supplies to 
moscow leningrad museum authorities signed an agreement to give 
israel a priceless collection of jewish historical documents 
most dramatic is the influx of soviet jewish immigrants about

the auto industry puts its best face forward 
during the next two months with elaborate displays at the annual 
series of winter auto shows overshadowed by a cloud of recession 
the first two shows will begin jan 12 in detroit and los 
angeles the detroit show runs through jan 20 by the time spring 
rolls around major shows also will have been held in chicago and 
new york 
but underneath the glitz and glamour automakers are facing 
their darkest days since the early 1980s when chrysler corp 
brushed with bankruptcy ford motor co wondered if it would 
survive and general motors corps dominance began fading 
new car and truck sales are in a tailspin partly because of 
sagging consumer confidence worry about conflict in the middle 
east and a slowing economy through november car and light truck 
sales in the united states totaled about 132 million down nearly 
5 percent from last year 
if automaker executives are correct the industry will take 
another 5 percent hit in its sales rate next year 
each of the big three has predicted dire financial results for 
the fourth quarter and it appears that chrysler could wind up 
losing money in 1990 it would be the first annual loss posted by 
an automaker since 1982 when ford took a 658 million loss 
none of that will be visible at the shows in fact it will be 
well hidden behind fake waterfalls a simulated test track and 
dozens of concept cars or notforproduction vehicles made to 
show off an automakers technical and design expertise 
ford has redesigned its detroit exhibit doing away with 
turntables and leggy models opting instead for more 
consumeroriented actors talking about the companys cars and 
trucks 
thats not to say the ford exhibit will be without glitter 
there will be a 40footwide curtain of cascading water as a 
backdrop in the center of the display 
gm will have a simulation of a test track at its corporate 
exhibit which also will feature displays emphasizing environmental 
efforts 
among the concept cars will be fords zig and zag a 
pair of tiny runabouts from the ghia design studio in italy the 
zig looks like a bar of dove soap a twoseat convertible the zag 
looks like a bar of dove with a hardtop

flight crew member stephanie harr 
ran out on the deck of the usns mercy hospital ship tuesday to 
bellow merry christmas to her family in san antonio 
specialist john davidson of the 37th airborne engineer battalion 
pulled guard duty in a sandstorm on christmas day everybody here 
is down and depressed he said 
bob hope meanwhile tailored his 50th year of entertaining 
troops at christmas to a devout moslem land 
the 300000 us troops sent to saudi arabia under operation 
desert shield marked christmas day 140 of the deployment with a 
bittersweet mix of holiday cheer and homesickness 
santa made several appearances he reached the 1000bed 
hospital ship mercy after the awacs surveillance planes spotted a 
lowflying object and reported that it was a sleigh pulled by 
deer and driven by an old man 
he also appeared in a bunker 
spec chad dombrosky 20 of miltonfreewater ore was on 
guard duty when at the stroke of midnight he alerted the sergeant 
of the guard of unusual activity theres a fat guy in a red suit 
with a bag full of gifts who wants to come into the camp but he 
doesnt know the password dombrosky said 
the best present the troops could have received was to be with 
loved ones 
id like to be home for christmas but the military is our 
second family said joseph leo 20 of des moines iowa leo was 
brought to the hospital ship three days ago with internal bleeding 
in a nearby bed sgt danny barrick 30 of carlyle pa stared 
ruefully at his broken leg injured in a desert football game 
that will earn him a spot on a plane home 
his christmas wish 
hopefully ill get this drip taken out of my arm he said 
pointing to the intravenous tubes next to him but christmas in a 
hospital bed was much better than sitting out there with the sand 
blowing over you he said 
first sgt charles rio 39 of fayetteville nc received a 
most unlikely gift from his son a fishing lure to catch land 
bass 
his unit the 37th battalion received a 90minute videotape

it brightened up an otherwise gloomy day waldorf said 
the armed forces radio network avoided most songs with a 
religious theme to avoid hurting saudi sensibilities the kingdom 
which uses the moslem holy book the koran as the basis for all 
laws bans other religions 
bob hope was back with the troops for christmas but he had to 
leave marie osmond the pointer sisters and other girls in his 
tour behind in bahrain because saudi arabia bans female 
entertainers 
instead hope took former cincinnatti reds catcher johnny bench 
and country and western singer aaron tippon to visit the troops 
the us military barred the media from covering hopes shows 
saying his repertoire could be exploited by the iraqis for 
propaganda purposes but hope delivered some of his patois at a 
news conference on tuesday morning 
he said he was briefed on saudi sensitivities three times and 
tailored his show to avoid offending moslems eliminating jokes 
about american men and saudi women 
chief warrant officer wesley wolf the militarys food czar 
made sure that one part of christmas tradition was intact in the 
desert the menu

the arab news newspaper has been running a kday countdown 
showing the number of days iraq has until the jan 15 un deadline 
for it to pull out of kuwait or face the possibility of a military 
strike by the usled forces 
the paper wrote 
twas the night before kday 
and all through kuwait 
no iraqi was leaving 
they had sealed their fate 
iraqi president saddam hussein told jordanian politicians 
visiting baghdad tuesday that he wouldnt leave kuwait until israel 
withdrew from the occupied territories 
let all the fleets and israel hear palestine comes first and 
it must be liberated saddam said 
in other gulfrelated developments tuesday 
the new york times reported that 20 north korean military 
advisers arrived in baghdad to help iraq repair its sovietmade mig 
warplanes the report quoting asian diplomats said north korea 
also was to provide spare parts the soviets have stopped shipping 
iraq in compliance with the unimposed embargo 
iraqi newspapers said in christmas editorials that baghdad 
would never surrender and warned president bush that many american 
lives would be lost in any war with iraq 
israels defense minister moshe arens said he had seen no 
significant change in the gulf crisis that indicated heightened 
danger for israel newspapers had said a day earlier the military 
was on higher alert and had reinforced its defenses along the 
border with jordan

romanias former monarch king 
michael arrived tuesday on a surprise visit more than 40 years 
after being forced into abdication and exile by the nowousted 
communist leadership 
michael 69 arrived in a private jet from switzerland where he 
lives 
the former king of the hohenzollernsigmaringen house was 
accompanied by his wife ana de bourbonparme and daughter 
sophie they arrived in the country without visas or other 
authorization and were met by another daughter margarita already 
in romania on a visit 
the royal family returned exactly one year after former 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife elena were 
summarily tried and executed formally ending the communist rule 
that had forced michael into exile in 1948 
margarita told reporters his return was probably like being 
born very painful and very happy at the same time 
he has been a person ripped in two all his life and the two 
bits have suddenly come together she said 
it was the former kings first to romania since going into 
exile he had planned to visit romania last april but the 
government refused to let him return 
the interior ministry issued a statement saying michael his 
wife and daughter crossed the border fraudulently and will have 
to bear the legal consequences the statement did not 
elaborate 
but michael emerged from immigration about an hour after 
landing beaming as he displayed his danish diplomatic passport 
he and his family then sped off in a waiting car to a monastery 
at curtea de arges 87 miles west of bucharest where the kings 
ancestors are buried 
danielle maillefer a spokeswoman said the royal family decided 
to visit romania on short notice princess margarita informed 
premier petre roman of their plans on christmas eve maillefer 
said 
roman strongly advised him not to come but did not give a 
firm yes or no maillefer said michael felt he has a role to 
play in romania and so he decided to ignore romans advice she 
said 
government officials were throught to be displeased by the 
monarchist nostalgia the visit could stir 
the former king ruled romania twice for short periods he first 
succeeded his grandfather ferdinand in 1927 as michael i after his 
father carol was excluded from the succession 
carol acceded to the throne in 1930 and ruled for 10 years 
michael was then crowned again and reigned until he was forced to 
abdicate when the communists took power in 1947

something will be missing when americans open 
their mailboxes wednesday the annual greeting from the internal 
revenue service will not be included in the postholiday deluge of 
late christmas cards 
the irs did not forget its simply that the agency no longer 
wants to be the grinch who stole christmas 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr decreed the mailing of 108 
million tax packages should take place on dec 28 not on the day 
after christmas as it has for more than a decade 
we wanted to move it away from the christmas holiday to allow 
folks to enjoy that period of the year as long as they possibly can 
before we throw a wet blanket on them said arthur altman 
director of the irs tax forms division 
the reprieve is brief the irs still seeks to get the forms 
delivered by the first week in january to insure plenty of 
preparation time before the april 15 filing deadline 
the mailing is the biggest and most expensive the government 
does each year costing 29 million for printing and postage 
for the second year in a row americans will find few changes 
the amounts for the standard deduction and personal exemption 
have been adjusted to reflect the effects of inflation the 
selfemployed will find a new deduction replacing the 
selfemployment tax credit 
otherwise the forms look much like last years 
a major difference is not in the forms themselves but in the 
type of form each taxpayer receives 
some 45 million elderly taxpayers used to getting form 1040 
will get the shorter form 1040a the change was made possible when 
the irs added lines allowing the elderly to report retirement 
income that previously could be reported only on the longer 1040 
among other changes from last year 
the personal exemption the amount you may exempt from 
taxation for yourself your spouse and each dependent increases 
from 2000 to 2050 
the standard deduction claimed by people who do not itemize 
rises to 3250 for a single person up from 3100 the exemption 
for a couple increases to 5450 up from 5200 
families with income as high as 20264 may qualify for an 
earnedincome credit up from a limit of 19340 the maximum 
credit available is 953 
the basic tax rates remain at 15 percent 28 percent and 33 
percent but the tax brackets have been widened so that more income 
will be taxed at a lower rate thus compensating for the effects of 
inflation 
once again this year the irs is encouraging people to file 
their returns electronically 4 million taxpayers did it last 
year tax preparers normally charge between 25 and 50 for this 
service but the taxpayer gets his refund check sooner normally 
within two to three weeks versus five to six weeks for paper tax 
returns 
the irs expects 113 million returns will be filed with refunds 
going to 70 percent of all taxpayers last year more than 76 
million refunds were issued averaging about 900 each 
the irs is making an effort to debunk a myth concerning the 
preprinted mailing labels which cut down on irs processing 
errors some people have refused to use the labels believing they 
contained secret codes that targeted some returns for audits 
by explaining what each letter and number in the labels means 
the irs hopes to boost their use 
we are trying to assure taxpayers that none of the numbers in 
the label are a secret code that says audit this return 
altman said 
troops stationed in saudi arabia will be among those receiving 
tax packages but they like all americans living overseas have 
until june 15 to file 
the irs expects twothirds of all taxpayers to file form 1040 
the remaining onethird will use either the shorter form 1040a for 
people who do not itemize and whose income is below 50000 or the 
nineline form 1040ez which can be used only by single people who 
do not itemize and who earn less than 50000 with interest income 
of less than 400 
those who need tax forms other than those included in their 
package can call a new irs toll free number 1800taxform 
18008293676 forms will also be available at many banks post 
offices and libraries

president mikhail s gorbachev won sweeping new 
powers over a reorganized executive branch tuesday despite foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadzes warning that the country was 
heading toward dictatorship 
gorbachev turned back attempts by reformist lawmakers to limit 
his authority to issue presidential decrees which he says he needs 
along with government reorganization to restore order in the 
country he angrily said such restriction would be the funeral of 
executive power 
approval by the 2250member congress of peoples deputies was a 
clear victory for gorbachev and for hardline lawmakers who have 
urged emergency rule over secessionist republics in his stunning 
resignation speech thursday shevardnadze said hardliners were 
pushing this country to dictatorship 
parliament voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments 
that eliminate gorbachevs moribund presidential council create a 
powerful new vice presidency subordinate to gorbachev and form a 
new cabinet of ministers under gorbachevs direct control 
it strengthened gorbachevs existing federation council the 
centerpiece of his reorganization but modified his vision of it as 
a small governing body creating doubt about its effectiveness 
the council is intended to give republics a greater voice in 
national government and help the kremlin deal with the nations 
more than 100 ethnic groups it will also try to settle the 
multiple regional conflicts which have led to bloodshed in the 
caucasus moldavia and central asia 
the changes will go into effect only after a final vote expected 
wednesday or thursday the congress still must consider proposed 
amendments on the restructuring including one that would create a 
national security council led by the president 
the congress is due to finish work by friday 
the flurry of votes came on the sessions eighth day after 
shevardnadzes resignation and saturdays harsh speech by kgb chief 
vladimir kryuchkov accusing foreign agents of plotting against the 
kremlin 
some reformminded lawmakers expressed outrage over giving the 
president more power 
havent we learned anything from the resignation of 
shevardnadze over the coming dictatorship asked vologda deputy 
vladimir lopatin 
congress chairman anatoly lukyanov cut off lopatins microphone 
saying he was not speaking about the amendment at hand 
before the session began tuesday russian republic leader boris 
n yeltsin condemned plans to broaden gorbachevs power and said he 
intended to vote against them in the parliament the state news 
agency tass said 
yeltsin gorbachevs leading political rival said he opposed 
absolute powers for the president of the ussr according to 
the independent news agency interfax 
gorbachev wants to establish a strong presidency combined with 
a new union treaty to hold the country together the congress 
endorsed the concept of the union treaty on monday and ordered the 
15 republics to set dates for referenda on whether to stay in the 
soviet union 
gorbachev strolled into the lobby during a break in the session 
and said his strategy would settle political crises 
i am sure that if we come to understand each other in the next 
few months we shall be able to stabilize within the next year 
he said 
the parliament voted 1514140 with 140 abstentions to revamp 
and strengthen the federation council created last march 
gorbachev and the new vice president would head the council it 
would include highlevel officials from the 15 republics and about 
20 autonomous republics plus special representatives from smaller 
regions officials said 
it would have 3540 standing members but up to 150 people could 
attend meetings making it a small general assembly said 
alexander kudryavtsev chairman of the commission that drafted the 
amendments 
how effective the federation council could be as ruling body 
with that many people was unclear gorbachev initially had not 
intended to include so many 
the parliament voted 162035 with 73 abstentions to create a 
cabinet of ministers which will be an executive and 
administrative organ of the soviet union subordinate to the 
president 
it would oversee the economy with responsibility for financial 
and monetary policy energy transportation communications and 
other fields 
the present council of ministers under prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov answers to the national supreme soviet legislature and has 
exercised a degree of independence from gorbachev particularly 
over economic matters 
the vice president might take over some functions now performed 
by the prime minister 
gorbachev has said nothing of possible candidates for the new 
job except that he had planned to nominate shevardnadze the 
foreign minister has said he would not accept the post 
the deputies voted to eliminate the 9monthold presidential 
council which had been envisioned as a new cabinet but was stifled 
by conflicts with ryzhkovs council of ministers 
to gorbachevs annoyance reformers repeatedly proposed 
amendments to require legislative approval for his decrees each 
time falling short of the twothirds majority needed 
gorbachev now can issue orders without any oversight although 
many republics have been ignoring the decrees 
if every day the president has to issue orders and each of 
them has to be ratified by the supreme soviet then i tell you 
thats the funeral of executive power it would be better to leave 
things as they are gorbachev said

four moslem fundamentalists seeking to avoid deportation in the 
occupied territories troops fired at crowds of stonethrowing 
palestinians wounding 15 arab reports said 
eleven of those shot were young demonstrators in the gaza strip 
town of khan yunis four palestinians were shot in a clash with 
soldiers in the tulkarm refugee camp in the west bank the reports 
said 
the appeals board ruled that the four men from the occupied gaza 
strip facing expulsion were key activists of hamas a moslem 
fundamentalist organization involved in the 3yearold palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation 
the board gave them 48 hours to appeal to the supreme court the 
military command said the supreme court rarely reverses such 
decisions 
the four were served with deportation orders on dec 15 the day 
after hamas which means zeal in arabic claimed responsibility 
for the stabbing deaths of three israelis in jaffa a suburb of tel 
aviv 
the four are college instructor fadel khadel zaabut 34 civil 
engineer emad khaled el alami 34 mustafa youssef abdul el lidawi 
26 and mustafa ahmed el qnuih 45 
israel has expelled 60 arabs to neighboring arab countries since 
the uprising in gaza and the west bank began claiming they 
fomented violence 
western countries say deportations violate the geneva 
convention 
eight of the 11 people shot in khan yunis were hit in the legs 
and the other three in the chest or abdomen including a 
10yearold boy who suffered a serious chest injury arab reports 
said the army confirmed the boy was wounded and was checking 
reports that others were shot 
in the tulkarm camp one of the four palestinians wounded was a 
13yearold boy shot in the chest 
the army command confirmed the injuries 
the command also said tuesday that under new military 
regulations to take effect jan 1 all male officers must carry 
arms even those in noncombat positions serving in pre1967 
israel 
the new orders followed a wave of attacks on civilians inside 
israel as the uprising against israeli occupation spilled into tel 
aviv this month 
officers serving in combat units already carry weapons but only 
noncombat officers living in the occupied territories captured in 
the 1967 middle east war had carried weapons under the old orders 
the army said 
israel army radio said the jewish states broadcasting authority 
voted to remove druse journalist rafik halaby from his editorial 
post at staterun israel tv tuesday as a result of an article he 
wrote on the oct 8 temple mount riot in which at least 17 
palestinians were killed by police gunfire 
halaby will be moved out of the tv newsroom into a different 
department the radio said it said the article indicated support

american airlines charges that its pilots are 
staging a sickout over stalled contract talks and have contributed 
to flight cancellations but the pilots union denies theres any 
organized protest 
american management and the allied pilots association have been 
negotiating a revsed contract for 14 months but have made little 
headway 
the increase in the number of pilots calling in sick coupled 
with bad weather the holiday traffic crush and the airlines loss 
of 230 pilots to operation desert shield led to an unusually high 
number of flight cancellations over the weekend said american 
spokesman marty heires 
at its hub at dallasfort worth international airport on sunday 
the carrier canceled 37 arriving and 37 departing flights 
amounting to about 9 percent of its flights 
the fort worthbased carrier said the number of pilots calling 
in sick over the weekend soared to record numbers almost 70 
percent higher than normal airline officials said 
its all an attempt to compel the company to agree to terms 
that the pilots would like us to on the contract said robert w 
baker american executive vice president for operations 
baker told the dallas morning news in tuesdays editions that 
529 of americans 9000 pilots were on sick leave monday and about 
500 called in sick over the weekend 
the typical pilot absentee rate is 250 during normal periods and 
300 during christmas holidays said heires 
we have to assume theres some union activity here heires 
said now i dont know whether this was an organized effort or 
whether some pilots are taking it upon themselves to do this 
union officials denied any concerted effort was behind the 
higher absentee rate though for some time now they have been 
urging pilots not to work if they are sick 
i know theres nothing going on in terms of any grassroots 
operation or any other type of operation to call in sick or not 
being available said apa executive director scott peterson 
baker said the absentee rate for flight attendants is average 
both management and labor traded contract proposals in the past 
month but remain far apart negotiations resume jan 7 in 
washington dc under the auspices of the national mediation 
board 
under the railway labor act the existing contract will remain 
in force until a federal mediator declares an impasse after a 
30day cooling off period the carrier may impose new conditions of 
employment on the pilots and the union can strike 
employee sickouts are illegal under the railway labor act 
for several months the union has been urging its members not to 
push themselves into going to work if they are ill and not to 
answer their phones if they dont want to work on their days off 
the union says that does not amount to a sickout 
although the company may be disappointed in that theres 
nothing illegal about it said apa spokesman tom hunt whats 
the reason for that i think its low morale theres no question 
the pilots at american airlines are extremely disgruntled with the 
company with management 
the apa is seeking to abolish the twotier wage scale pilots 
accepted in 1983 when the company was struggling financially the 
twotier scale pays newly hired pilots at a lower scale than 
existing crew members 
in addition union members want the company to bring newer 
pilots up to parity in terms of pension and vacation time the 
pilots are also fighting the companys insistence that they 
shoulder a greater share of their health care insurance costs 
apa members also contend that american as the largest airline 
in the western world and one of the most profitable should pay its 
pilots the highest wage of any us airline 
the company contends the apas contract demands will force it to 
scale back its fiveyear 209 billion expansion plan

the suriname army chief who led a 
bloodless christmas eve coup pledged tuesday to relinquish power to 
an elected government within 100 days and denied an ousted dictator 
was behind the coup 
the army is not bent on having and keeping power cmdr ivan 
graanoogst said on staterun radio a day after he and other 
officers overthrew the elected 3yearold government of president 
ramsewak shankar 
the military removed shankar and his cabinet while they met at 
the presidential palace monday evening as many surinamese were 
attending christmas mass 
the coup will give the surinamese society a chance to choose a 
better government that can give content to a credible democratic 
structure graanoogst said in an interview with dutch television 
no one was injured or arrestd in the coup and the army is 
allowing the ousted president and his ministers complete freedom of 
movement shankar said in an interview from his home 
im free to go wherever i want to he said 
the coup was seen as the culmination of a conflict between 
shankar and desi bouterse dictator of suriname from 1980 until 
1988 shankar took office that year after defeating a candidate 
backed by bouterse despite the defeat of his candidate bouterse 
stayed on as army chief 
the dutch and us governments denounced the coup the dutch 
the former colonial rulers of the nation of 400000 people said 
they were cutting aid to the government 
normal holiday activity resumed in the capital paramaribo on 
tuesday people flocked to churches for christmas services and 
there was no unusual military presence on the streets 
international telephone service was restored tuesday afternoon 
after being cut monday night shortly after the coup 
everything is completely normal as if nothing has happened 
said a surinamese journalist who asked not to be further 
identified for security reasons life in the country goes on 
graanoogst said paramaribos international airport and two 
smaller airports remained open and there would be no curfew because 
there is no danger whatsoever 
the coup occurred at 11 pm monday as shankar and his cabinet 
held an emergency meeting to discuss bouterses announcement 
earlier in the day that he was resigning because of differences 
with shankar whom he called a joker 
a highranking government source said the military told shankar 
it was assuming control and asked the president and his cabinet to 
leave the presidential palace they decided to do so to avoid 
bloodshed the source said 
later monday night graanoogst appeared in uniform on state 
television to announce the coup 
the latest conflict between shankar and bouterse had been 
brewing since saturday when bouterse returned from a trip to ghana 
and switzerland on three separate occasions this month dutch 
officials refused to give bouterse a visa or allow him to speak to 
reporters after he landed at amsterdams schiphol airport 
dutch officials cited security reasons bouterse claimed shankar 
collaborated with the dutch to humiliate him 
if i had been in shankars place i would have turned schiphol 
upside down to protect the dignity of the commander of my countrys 
national army bouterse said 
the two men also have been at odds over the governments attempt 
to negotiate a settlement of an armed revolt led by bouterses 
former bodyguard ronny brunswijk on behalf of the nations bush 
negro minority the jungle war began in july 1986 
suriname is a jungleladen georgiasized country with few roads 
and poor communications its population is a multiracial mosaic of 
indian and javanese immigrants bush negroes and indigenous tribes 
bouterse opposes a tentative peace agreement reached with 
brunswijk on the grounds that it failed to disarm the insurgents 
and left them in control of the interior of suriname 
also some surinamese have been urging the government to bring 
charges against bouterse and others for the 1982 massacre of 15 
opposition politicians the government had never said whether it 
plans to do anything about the atrocity 
because of bouterses resignation monday graanoogst head of 
the nations military police and one of four military commanders 
acted as nominal head of the new military regime 
bouterse was believed to be the mastermind of the coup but 
graanoogst claimed the former commanderinchief desi bouterse 
was not at all involved 
bouterse is at home and like a real surinamese he offers his 
input when necessary said graanoogst who went on to describe 
bouterse as a man who has shown in the last ten years that his 
heart is in the right place 
graanoogst promised to set up an interim cabinet that would 
organize free national elections within 100 days but refused to 
speculate on who would be appointed as the countrys leader in the 
meantime 
in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said 
it did not appear us citizens in suriname were in danger the 
department called for the restoration of the civilian government 
we condemn this violation of constitutional order in 
surinamewe call on the surinamese military to restore power 
immediately to the democratically elected authorities of that 
country ms mccarty said 
the dutch foreign ministry said it sharply condemns the 
undemocratic seizure of power by the surinamese army 
bouterse led a military coup in 1980 that toppled an elected 
government he allowed elections in november 1987 in which 
shankars threeparty coalition the front for democracy and 
development easily defeated the militarybacked national democracy 
party 
when shankar began his scheduled fiveyear term on jan 25 
1988 bouterse continued to wield considerable influence as the 
countrys military chief 
suriname was among the most prosperous countries in south 
america before the 1980 coup 
since then its economy has declined due to a cut in dutch aid 
a drop in the price of bauxite the main export and the guerrilla 
warfare that curtailed bauxite and aluminum production 
when suriname gained independence from the netherlands in 1975 
the dutch government pledged a developmental aid package amounting 
to 100 million annually over 15 years 
the aid was suspended after the 1982 massacre of the 
politicians whom bouterse claimed were planning a coup 
a relatively small amount of humanitarian aid was resumed 
recently to shankars government

albanias newly formed opposition 
democratic party drew more than 5000 excited supporters to its 
first rally outside the capital tuesday 
the crowd gathered in the central square of kavaje 20 miles 
west of tirana shouting freedom democracy and raising their 
hands in victory signs as leaders of the new party addressed them 
an associated press photographer at the rally reported by 
telephone that the crowd of mostly young people literally jumped 
around in excitement and nearly toppled the rostrum when party 
leader sali berisha stood to speak 
albania officials legalized the party less than two weeks ago 
after student protests led to widespread demands for democracy 
throughout europes last stronghold of hardline communism 
on monday the government refused to postpone feb 10 
legislative elections the opposition had asked for the voting to 
be held in may to allow it more time to prepare an effective 
campaign 
the communists in power since 1944 control every sphere of 
public life including national news media the democratic party 
has received permission to publish its own newspaper but lacks 
funds and equipment 
official media have said little about the new party meaning it 
must spread its program around albania by wordofmouth or at 
rallies similar to tuesdays at kavaje 
kavaje a town of 25000 was a center of protest against 
communist policies in middecember along with northern city of 
shkodra the port of durres and the central city of elbasan 
sihat tozaj secretary of the parliamentary presidium said the 
government refused to delay the voting because a new parliament was 
needed urgently to adopt constitutional changes and reform laws 
the state news agency ata reported 
the reforms are to include opening up albanias isolated 
economy now on the brink of collapse removal of restrictions on 
religion and bringing human rights standards up to world 
standards ata quoted tozaj as saying 
the governing albanian labor communist party was to discuss 
the planned reforms at a national party conference wednesday in 
tirana 
albanias president and communist party leader ramiz alia 
began implementing some cautious reforms this year in an attempt to 
edge the small balkan nation of 32 million out of decades of 
selfimposed isolation

wouldnt leave kuwait until israel withdrew from the occupied

let all the fleets and israel hear palestine comes first and 
it must be liberated saddam said in a speech broadcast on iraqi

the iraqi president also repeated his claim that kuwait was 
unjustly removed from baghdads rule by british colonial rulers 
he challenged the united states britain and other forces

future to an arab referendum 
if you brought your fleets because of this issue how can you 
help the people in kuwait have their say in a democratic manner 
 
why do they not hold a referendum to see the inclination of 
the majority of the arab people if they are truly democratic 
saddam said 
he denounced the united states and its allies on the

santa claus got a parking ticket while delivering 
toys jackets and food to needy families and he says he may go to 
court over the 150 he had to pay to retrieve his sleigh 
larry longfelder a lawyer and president of the forgotten 
childrens fund said he didnt know he was in an apartment 
managers reserved space when he stopped at an apartment building 
dressed as santa on christmas eve 
within 10 minutes he said the cars wheels had been locked to 
a barrel by an employee of the community police traffic and parking 
enforcement agency 
just because its santa claus doesnt mean he can park 
anywhere said a supervisor for the private agency who 
instructed an employee to insist on the 150 fee before releasing 
the vehicle the supervisor refused to give his name 
longfelder said the agency refused to accept a check or credit 
card so he had to walk to an automatic teller machine and withdraw

security forces arrested 31 radical 
students and charged them with conspiring with north korea to 
overthrow the government the national intelligence agency said 
wednesday 
more than 70 other members of an undeground group called 
chamintong are on a wanted list the national security planning 
agency said chamintong means independence democracy and 
unification 
the agency said in a news release that chamintongs goal was to 
form a unfified korea by 1995 under north korean leader kim il 
sungs leadership if necessary through an armed uprising in the 
south 
the agency said that the 31 students were core members of 
chamintong which it said was formed in 1988 with guidance from a 
clandestine north korean propaganda agency 
chamintong manipulated chondaehyop a dissident student 
alliance to stage antigovernment and antiamerican activities in 
the name of seeking democratization the news release said 
chondaehyop has been involved in sometimes violent 
demonstrations demanding the pullout of american troops and 
overthrow of the seoul regime in favor of unification with the 
north

kapsuk 24 a senior at chonanm unviersity in kwangju who was 
arrested in october the agency did not say when the others were

allegiance to kim il sung and sing songs praising kims exploits 
fighting japanese colonial rule the agency said japan colonized 
korea from 1910 through world war ii 
the peninsula was divided following the war and since the korean 
war has been split into the staunchly communist north ruled by 
kim and the free marketoriented south dominated by the military 
with increasingly democratic rule

in the barracks or the locker room nobody 
thinks twice about threatening to whip kick or otherwise manhandle 
the oppositions rear end its different when presidents get down 
and graphic 
that may make it an effective way to turn up the volume when the 
man in the white house doesnt think somebody is paying attention 
as in president bushs holiday message to saddam hussein 
if we get into an armed situation hes going to get his ass 
kicked 
there are certain amenities about the purposeful presidential 
use of such terminology for public consumption 
its not done on tape or on camera except inadvertently better 
to have it relayed second hand leaving just a little room for 
doubt that a leader so eminent would talk that way 
and it cant be done often or it would become too ordinary to 
attract attention 
besides theres always a risk of a backlash a former governor 
of massachusetts francis w sargent once used the aword at a 
governors conference and said his mother called to tell him she 
was going to wash his mouth out with soap 
then again its hardly an xrated term and it is right there 
in the dictionary ass vulgar slang the buttocks bushs 
latest usage was widely quoted on radio and television and in 
print 
after bush met with a group of congressmen on dec 20 rep 
elton gallegly rcalif said the president had told them that he 
doesnt think saddam hussein understands that there really will be 
war if he doesnt get out of kuwait 
the greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed 
confrontation is to make sure that saddam hussein be made really 
aware that to quote him that if we get into an armed situation 
hes going to get his ass kicked gallegly said 
while others confirmed the remark bush was circumspect asked 
later whether it was an accurate quotation the president arched 
his eyebrows and said nothing 
hed been more forthcoming after accidentally putting a similar 
observation on the record during the 1984 campaign when he was 
vice president we tried to kick a little ass last night he 
said after a campaign debate with rep geraldine a ferraro his 
democratic opponent bush made the comment while shaking hands with 
dockworkers at a campaign rally in new jersey unaware that there 
was a boom microphone close enough to pick up his words 
later on he said he wasnt apologizing i stand behind it i 
use it all the time my kids use it everybody who competes in 
sports uses it 
ronald reagan expressed some doubt about the campaign comment 
saying he wasnt inclined to believe his vice president had said 
it 
reagan himself didnt go beyond keister which is slang for 
rump 
in 1983 irked that information about his budget and other white 
house business was finding its way into print reagan ordered a 
crackdown ive had it up to my keister with these leaks he 
told his staff 
no such gentler euphemism would do for jimmy carter when sen 
edward m kennedy was preparing to challenge him for the 1980 
democratic presidential nomination 
if kennedy runs ill whip his ass carter said at a white 
house dinner with democratic congressmen 
i was startled said thenrep william m brodhead dmich 
i thought my ears were deceiving me i said excuse me mr 
president what did you say and carter replied if kennedy runs 
ill whip his ass 
he did and carter did but strong words arent enough reagan 
won the white house

the dollar rose against the yen and stock prices 
fell in sluggish trading in tokyo tuesday amid concerns about the 
middle east and political problems in the soviet union 
the dollar closed at 13595 yen up 025 yen from fridays close 
of 13570 yen financial markets were closed on monday for a 
national holiday 
after oening at 13595 yen the dollar ranged from 13590 yen 
to 13625 yen trading was quiet at 228 billion in spot 
transactions down from 12351 billion on friday the dollar has 
now gained 292 yen in four trading days 
market players were beginning to pay more attention to 
international politics than to interest rate shifts said tomoko 
hirai a dealer at citibank 
the us federal reserve lowered a key interest rate last week 
a move that is generally associated with the weaker dollar 
but anxieties about the future of the soviet union following 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes resignation announcement 
last week and the continuing tensions in the middle east have been 
putting upward pressures on the dollar dealers noted 
investors tend to buy the dollar as a safe haven in times of 
international uncertainty 
the dollar is stable now but there is a technical resistance 
point to its rise at 13630 yen said hirai 
on the stock exchange the stronger dollar lower bond prices 
and worries about the persian gulf and the soviet union helped push 
the nikkei average lower dealers said 
the 225issue nikkei stock average closed at 2376788 points 
down 35172 points or 146 percent from fridays close volume on 
the first section was estimated at a slim 210 million shares down 
from 350621 million friday 
the nikkei average has now shed 110890 points in three trading 
days 
the absence of foreign investors slowed down trading said a 
dealer at a tokyobased securities firm 
financial markets were closed overseas today for christmas 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds fell to 8736 points from fridays 
8778point close their yield rose to 7210 percent from 7115

if the crisis in the persian gulf heats up 
would us securities and futures markets melt down 
probably not say most market professionals although they 
disagree on just how sharp a backlash there would be on exchange 
floors and trading pits 
if you had the outbreak of a sudden major shooting war in the 
middle east i suspect that shortterm the market would go into a 
freefall but i also wouldnt be surprised at all if it closed 
higher two or three days later said robert kirby chairman of 
capital guardian trust co in los angeles 
yale hirsch a market tracker who produces the stock traders 
almanac predicts if theres no shooting war or drawnout 
impasse we expect the dow jones industrial average to break 
through 3000 in 1991 
but if the crisis ends badly the average a key stock market 
indicator could sink to 2000 next year he said 
federal regulators say they have contingency plans to head off 
panic in the markets but what those plans are theyre not 
saying 
the securities and exchange commission which oversees the 
stock bond and mutual fund markets says it has developed plans 
for emergencies and has been in contact with the exchanges 
but we dont discuss specific situations or specific 
contingency plans said brandon becker associate director of the 
secs market regulation division 
wendy gramm chairwoman of the commodity futures trading 
commission who oversees futures markets for key commodities such 
as oil has said the cftc and other agencies have plans for dealing 
with market disruptions but she also would not elaborate 
a cftc insider said officials have plans to get in touch with 
the exchanges to coordinate information among the various markets 
but do we have a plan so that if x happens well do this no 
because i think whatever x we put down or y or z thered be q r 
and s on top of that we dont have a plan in that sense and we 
just dont think we can said the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the big question is whether the markets reaction to bad news 
from the gulf would be severe enough to force the exchanges or 
regulators to shut them down 
cftc commissioner william albrecht has said a market closing 
would be the last thing you really want to do because of the 
need to determine prices and keep trading flowing 
the chicago mercantile exchange has said it would stop trading 
stock index futures futures contracts based on a range of stocks 
if the new york stock exchange closed in the event of war 
however the nyse also isnt revealing its hand 
im not going to say theres a plan in place or not in place 
until you know whats been presented to you said richard 
torrenzano an nyse spokesman 
even officials at the merc decline to discuss the issue on the 
record saying they didnt want to speculate on what they might do 
nyse officials point to a series of circuitbreakers created 
since the 1987 stock market crash that would slow down forms of 
computerized program trading often blamed for worsening stock 
market volatility or temporarily halt trading if the market plunged 
or skyrocketed 250 or more points 
should there be a surge in buying selling or volume these 
circuit breakers would serve to slow the market down and give 
everyone a chance to assess what has taken place and make an 
investment decision said torrenzano 
kirby the capital guardian trust chief and a member of the 
commission appointed by president reagan to investigate the 1987 
stock market crash said a market halt is the only fair way to 
handle this kind of situation 
but market shutdowns except for the occasional power outage in 
new york or chicago are rare 
the nyse shut down at the beginning of world war i from july 31 
to nov 28 1914 that was largely because of fears that 
goldhungry europe would sell its securities in new york and take 
gold home sparking a possible economic collapse in this country 
said stock market historian robert sobel of hofstra university 
the new york markets also shut for vj day at the end of world 
war ii and after president kennedy was assassinated 
sobel doesnt think there would be a panic if war broke out in 
the gulf because this is an event that we can look ahead and 
think about when it happens people have plans all ready 
by contrast he said the crash of 1987 when the dow jones 
industrial average plunged more than 500 points caught a lot of 
people unaware 
its the ones that catch you unaware that cause panics he 
said

nearly five years after the big bang 
deregulation of britains financial markets experts say londons 
pioneering electronic stock market isnt living up to its 
potential 
deregulation was supposed to sweep away londons clubby cartel 
of stock dealers and create a fast accessible and bigger 
electronic market of the future but critics say there arent 
enough stock dealers trading is too expensive and small 
shareholders are losing out 
londons potential is very very good said michael selby 
who teaches finance at the london school of economics but its 
not happening yet 
the stock exchange concedes that some criticisms against the 
system are valid and it is seeking to address them 
the big bang brought in an electronic automated quotations 
system that moved trading off the exchange floor and onto 
securities firms trading floors it also opened the securities 
business to commercial banks and foreign firms 
deregulation allowed more firms to become market makers who buy 
and sell shares from their own inventory market makers are 
required to quote prices on the electronic system continuously 
buyers and sellers look for the best prices 
londons market is based on the united states nasdaq electronic 
overthecounter system which began operating in 1971 
by comparison the new york stock exchange the tokyo stock 
exchange and most of the worlds other stock markets are 
centralized marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet on a trading 
floor and agree on a price 
londons system provides continuous trading and liquidity or 
plenty of stock to buy and sell while the other markets can break 
down under a flood of sell orders its proponents say that 
contention isnt entirely supported by the facts 
during the 1987 stock market crash londons exchange stayed 
open while many other european exchanges buckled under selling 
pressure but in the united states the new york stock exchange 
never closed which its supporters say saved the world financial 
system from a meltdown meanwhile many us electronic traders 
simply abandoned their posts 
since many firms now are owned by publiclyheld banks much more 
is disclosed about what goes on in the oncesecretive london 
securities industry and regulation has much improved said robin 
hutton directorgeneral of the british merchant banking and 
securities houses association 
but there are still problems and complaints 
volume on the exchange shrank to 130 billion shares in 1989 from 
150 billion in 1987 part of the decline is due to a slump in 
equity trading since the stock market crash that has hindered 
profits at many firms 
one complaint about london is that there arent enough market 
makers in each stock to avoid a cartel and many small stocks dont 
have market makers makeing it difficult to trade those shares 
london has 23 equity market makers down from a postbang peak 
of 33 but still more than the prederegulation 17 more than 200 
of the exchanges over 2000 domestic stocks had just one or no 
market makers in september 
another criticism is that some market makers allegedly avoid 
trading when the market is falling sharply by refusing to answer 
their phones or taking them off the hook precisely what happened 
during the 1987 crash in the united states 
market makers say that if investors cant get through its 
because traders are busy the firms are running leanly and cant 
afford to keep extra traders they say 
critics also said londons spreads between the buying and 
selling prices are too wide the average spread for primary stocks 
in september was 243 percent compared with a precrash average of 
122 percent 
the large spread results from londons relatively high trading 
costs market makers must put up their own capital to build up 
stock inventory and securities houses need expensive computer and 
telephone systems to trade 
small investors have to pay for a commission and the spread 
while institutional investors can find commissionfree service 
some firms refuse to handle individual customers because of the 
expense 
another complaint is that the british paper settlement system 
which completes share transactions is too slow and cumbersome but 
the exchange plans to introduce a new electronic settlement system 
next fall which could make trading faster and cheaper 
meanwhile it also has ordered at least two market makers to 
make competing price quotes on small shares starting in january 
the london exchange stands by its system saying it should be 
the basis for a paneuropean stock market the 12member european 
community wants to create 
we believe the competing marketmaking system is the right 
system said michael moore head of service development at 
londons exchange and those markets that dont have some 
electronic form of trading will find it difficult to survive 
but the exchanges chief executive peter rawlins said recently 
the exchange is reexamining its business and infrastructure and 
would decide by next spring how to move forward

surviving unemployment how to cope with 
emotional pressures assess your coping resources form a support 
group 
the advertisement was enough to catch the eye of rita dalpe an 
unemployed software engineer who is surviving on temporary work 
fewer family vacations and no christmas gifts this year 
im just looking to hear that somebody is having the same 
problems i am i want to hear what other people are doing to keep 
themselves on an even keel how they keep from getting 
discouraged said dalpe who also fears her husband may be forced 
to retire early from cashstrapped digital equipment corp 
dalpe was among scores of people who responded to the ad 
reflecting a growing trend nationwide by people out of work who 
need to talk about the misery of joblessness 
people are feeling depressed anxious angry irritable 
said dr eileen schwartz the psychologist who initiated the group 
the demand for support for the unemployed is increasing 
we just dont have enough support groups here in southern 
california or nationwide said dr paul leeshaley a los angeles 
psychologist who specializes in treating the unemployed 
and right associates which offers financial and career 
counseling and weekly support sessions for laidoff workers has 
seen business at its 72 us and canadian offices increase 32 
percent this year said senior vice president virginia lord 
the reality is unemployment is always difficult said 
philip quinn director of the massachusetts bayview center which 
runs employee assistance programs and has been increasingly called 
on to help firms with layoff procedures 
but when it goes from 49 percent to 7 percent as it is here 
people feel they dont have much of a chance he said 
nationwide unemployment hit a threeyear high of 59 percent in 
november 
people reporting to career counselors for job advice are 
breaking down in tears said mary muir director of the 
massachusetts department of employment and trainings regional 
office in woburn 
we are seeing a doubling over last year 4100 people are 
collecting unemployment from our office she said and there 
are more instances of people who are coming in quite distraught 
even the people most of the world looks to for help mental 
health workers are seeking support the cambridgebased family 
institute hosts open houses two nights a week for unemployed mental 
health workers 
in california workers in fields as diverse as the defense 
industry to real estate are filing more workers compensation 
claims and personal injury claims leeshaley said 
instead of going home and being depressed they go to the 
lawyer and be depressed and file a stress claim he said 
experts say the unemployed complain of short tempers trouble 
sleeping and depression many people drink and use drugs more 
heavily may abuse family or friends or isolate themselves 
dalpes family has been making sacrifices for the six years she 
has been without a permanent job in part so she can receive some 
sort of counseling now she and her husband are considering 
selling their home in the boston suburb of north reading and moving 
into a smaller more affordable condominium 
sometimes the worries can be overwhelming she said 
people of my generation were taught to believe if you got 
training it was a pretty sure thing youd have a job obviously 
that isnt happening she said white collar unemployment is a 
new area society doesnt know what to do with us

for many of the nations retailers the 
christmas shopping season was a disappointing casualty of the 
recession and the middle east crisis despite a lastminute burst 
of business from procrastinating consumers 
some retailers were heartened by a late pickup in their sales 
others smarting from the poor season were looking ahead to gloomy 
times early next year 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer was among 
those whose sales were hurt this season by consumer worries about 
the economy and the middle east 
were slightly below expectations matthew howard sears 
senior vice president for marketing said monday evening as the 
christmas season drew to a close 
however sears took comfort from its results the last three days 
of the season when shoppers responded to a new advertising 
campaign and a new round of price reductions on a variety of 
merchandise 
were pleased we felt we got a good balance in all of the 
businesses howard said in a telephone interview the final 
weekend left sears inventories in good shape he said 
other highprofile retailers reported a lastminute surge in 
sales but as in sears case the extra business was not enough to 
turn the entire season around 
there was a bit of a rush that was encouraging but as you 
know prior to this weekend it had been pretty sluggish said 
suzanne mcmillan senior vice president for marketing at the 
upscale saks fifth avenue 
at dayton hudson corp chairman kenneth macke was clearly 
disappointed with the season 
when all the receipts are tallied dayton hudsons sales will be 
unchanged to 1 percent higher than the firms christmas 1989 
results macke said monday afternoon 
im not feeling very happy he said 
sales that are little changed or up very slightly are considered 
poor because when the effects of inflation are subtracted a 
stores business may be down from yearearlier levels consumer 
prices rose 64 percent through the first 11 months of this year 
meaning many stores modest gains were wiped out 
predictions of a poor christmas season were issued back in 
august as sales of clothing furniture toys and appliances stalled 
in the wake of the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
sales for most retailers did not recover in september october 
and november normally a time when their business accelerates 
after the christmas season kicked off in late november store 
traffic and sales generally remained slow until the final weekend 
the weather also worked against the retailers this christmas in 
some parts of the midwest snow and ice kept shoppers at home but 
in many other areas temperatures in the 50s and 60s curbed sales 
of winter clothing 
like sears many retailers increased or moved up price 
reductions especially on coats and other coldweather wear in 
the last few weeks in an effort to draw more shoppers 
while the overall industry trend was poor some retailers ended 
the season pleased with their results 
im delighted clark johnson chairman of pier 1 imports 
inc said christmas morning we exceeded our expectations 
and clearly it was the best christmas we ever had he said his 
stores had a 3 percent increase from 1989s holiday sales 
johnson said the weakening economy actually helped his home 
furnishings and clothing business as consumers traded down or 
bought less expensive gifts this year people that normally 
bought gifts at higherend shops came to pier 1 he said 
other retailers also saw evidence of consumers trading down 
at dayton hudson business was strongest at the firms target 
discount stores where sales rose about 2 percent macke said 
meanwhile sales fell at the companys daytons hudsons and 
marshall fields department stores which have more expensive 
merchandise 
jane arend a spokeswoman for walmart stores inc said monday 
her company was pleased with its results but the retailer found it 
hard to draw hesitant consumers into its stores ms arend said she 
could not release any sales figures 
the discount retailer has consistently outperformed other 
storeowners throughout the season 
what shoppers bought this season reflected the difficult times 
dayton hudson had more success with levis jeans than designer 
jeans and sweatshirts and sweatpants were among the most popular 
items macke said 
at sears tool sets and portable electric tools sold well 
when you have a difficult economy its a more practical kind 
of gift people seem to want to give howard said 
macke said the poor christmas does not bode well for the first 
half of 1991 if santa claus and christmas cant bring people 
into the stores why are they going to be in in january and 
february he asked 
but johnson thought the lastminute surge was a good sign for 
his stores we had such tremendous traffic that therell be nice 
carryover momentum he said
