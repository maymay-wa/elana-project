sixties drug guru timothy leary said hes 
signed up to have his head removed and frozen after he dies for 
possible resurrection but he admits the technology is a long 
shot 
i dont want to just go bellyup when my blue cross runs 
out said the 67yearold former harvard psychology professor who 
once advised the youth of america to tune in turn on and drop 
out with mindaltering drugs 
leary said thursday hes formalizing a 35000 agreement to have 
his head preserved for posterity in socalled cryonic 
suspension by the alcor life extension foundation in riverside 
its the second dumbest idea in the world leary said of 
cryonics the practice of freezing the recently dead the first 
is that you go to the worms its a long shot but its worth a 
try 
alcor is best known for a longrunning battle with authorities 
about whether an elderly woman client was actually dead when her 
head was surgically severed and immersed in liquid nitrogen a 
judge backed alcor in its refusal to turn in the head for tests 
and the matter remains at a standoff 
leary who recently has been appearing at colleges and 
nightclubs after years of relative obscurity said he has followed 
developments in cryonics since 1976 when he wrote a paper on 22 
alternatives to involuntary irreversible death 
hes been interested the last 30 years in any cutting edge 
technology explained his agent eric gardner and this if 
youll pardon the expression is cutting edge technology 
for his 35000 leary who says he is perfecly healthy would 
become a member of the nonprofit alcor foundation that gives him 
the right to have his head surgically removed after death and 
immersed in liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees fahrenheit 
alcor also freezes entire bodies but leary said he couldnt 
afford the 100000 price 
mainstream scientists scoff at cryonics but adherents believe 
the essence of a persons mental or spiritual being resides 
physically in the brain that essence could someday be transferred 
to a mechanically produced or biologically cloned body said 
alcors president carlos mondragon 
theres about as good a chance that theyll be able to bring 
you back in 50 years than there is that well get a good president 
of the united states or that theyll find a cure for the common 
cold leary said 
leary doesnt think his muchpublicized drug use ruined his 
brain for revival but is prepared id be very happy if they 
dont bring me back to have it turned over to the neurologists 
alcor has six heads and two complete bodies frozen in concrete 
vats of liquid nitrogen mondragon said he said 109 members signed 
up to be suspended after they die the controversy over the head of 
85yearold dora kent boosted interest in membership and learys 
endorsement may do the same said mondragon a lot of people may 
have negative reactions to dr leary but people without open minds 
dont generally come to us anyway said mondragon

near the end of two days of scholarly talk 
about the ramifications of allowing intentionally aborted fetuses 
to be used for medical research a national institutes of health 
advisory committee member sharpened the issue with a simple 
question 
will there ever be a medical benefit great enough for 
antiabortionists to drop their opposition to using tissue from 
induced abortions 
no kay james public affairs director of the national right 
to life committee told joseph b martin chief of neurology at 
massachusetts general hospital in boston 
no said judi brown of stafford va president of the 
american life league 
a few minutes earlier robin chandler duke cochairwoman of the 
population crisis committee based in new york city had 
acknowledged the strong opposition of antiabortionists and said 
she wished there was some way to reach accommodation over the 
transplant issue 
but to hold a nation hostage to a minority group who are 
opposed to abortion is a tragedy she said they must know that 
even if it abortion became illegal it would still be done its 
just not going to go away it has been with us since the written 
word 
another member of the panel of witnesses sam gorovitz dean of 
the college of arts and sciences at syracuse university told 
martin he empathized with his effort to find common ground but 
suggested the intractable polarity of positions just outlined 
by his fellow panelists showed that would be impossible 
in the end gorovitz predicted the special advisory committee 
will simply have to settle on the position for which the 
arguments are best with the realization that one group or the 
other will be unhappy 
there is no way out of that gorovitz said 
retired federal appeals court judge arlin m adams of 
philadelphia the advisory committee chairman broke the 21member 
committee into smaller groups for informal discussions thursday 
night and again today 
he planned to bring them together late today in hopes they could 
reach consensus on whether to recommend federal approval of using 
fetal tissue from induced abortions for research and if so what 
guidelines to recommend to guard against abuses 
adams said he hoped the committee could agree enough by the end 
of the day to allow a rough draft of a document that would be 
circulated for further discussion with an eye toward having a 
formal recommendation ready in time for presentation dec 1 to a 
standing nih committee 
father don mccarthy a roman catholic church leader from 
cincinnati drew a clear distinction between induced abortions and 
natural abortions in expressing his opposition to using tissue from 
the former 
one might say that the american public becomes accomplices 
after the fact for these induced abortions if its institutions 
embrace policies that could tend to give a medical value to having 
an abortion he said 
several committee members used the term custom pregnancy as 
a short way of raising the concern that some woman might become 
pregnant just to produce an aborted fetus for research either for 
financial gain or in an effort to help a sick relative 
i dont think people are as callous about abortion as that 
premise suggests said thomas h murray director of the center 
for biomedical ethics at case western reserve university if we 
get to that point im deeply worried 
murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to 
ensure that a womans decision to have an abortion would be kept 
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used 
for research 
robert j levine of the yale university school of medicine told 
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that 
would exclude transplanting the tissue of a fetus into a relative 
of the mother 
he said that was done out of safety considerations that 
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be 
present in the offsprings genes but coincidentally also serves 
to negate concern about custom pregnancies

the environmental protection agency says 
regulations to control the volatility of gasoline and the recovery 
of gasoline fumes could be twice as effective as originally 
expected 
as a result cities close to complying with federal clean air 
standards will get a greater than expected reduction in ozone when 
epa adopts the new rules 
implementation of the regulations had been expected to help 
antipollution efforts but epa administrator lee m thomas said 
thursday the benefit would be much greater than previously believed 
earlier epa calculations had indicated the gasoline regulations 
would reduce the emission of urban hydrocarbons to the atmosphere 
by 10 percent to 15 percent thomas said 
it could be as much as twice that thomas said 
some cities are so close to complying with the standard that 
they had been expected to come into compliance simply through the 
retirement of older morepolluting vehicles thomas said he did 
not know how many cities would benefit from the new findings 
but those helped the most will be areas where peak readings of 
ozone are in the 014 parts per million range and below he 
said some cities may find that measures such as pollution 
inspections of cars will be unnecessary 
there are 38 cities with peak readings of 014 ppm or below on 
epas list of the 68 urban and rural areas that have failed to meet 
the nations ozone standard 
gasoline fumes react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides from all 
fuel combustion to produce ozone which is harmful to the lungs 
ozone is the constituent of urban smog that makes the chest feel 
tight 
the federal standard calls for limiting peak ozone to 012 parts 
per million and limiting excursions above that to no more than one 
hour per year 
gasoline vapor emissions to the atmosphere will be reduced more 
than expected because the planned regulations will sharply reduce 
what analysts call running losses or the evaporation of 
gasoline from the tank and other fuel system components while the 
car is moving 
current cars must meet strict standards for emission of unburned 
gasoline vapor out the tailpipe and for evaporation 
evaporation is controlled by a vapor recovery system which 
stores gasoline vapor in a cannister of activated charcoal until 
they can be recycled to the tank it is tested by collecting vapor 
emitted when a car is stationary and for this the agency uses a 
test fuel whose volatility has remained unchanged since 1975 
actual volatility has increased sharply since then and on hot 
days it can overwhelm the cannister 
in such circumstances the car can emit to the atmosphere 25 
times more gasoline vapor than is permitted out the exhaust 
the volatility standard will reduce these emissions and the 
vapor recovery regulation will ensure that more of them are 
captured agency officials say the epa says this would remove a 
large source of urban ozone that the agency had not known was there

boston university rejected student protests and 
issued strict new rules prohibiting students from having overnight 
guests of the opposite sex and reducing the amount of alcohol in 
dormitories 
the rules were released thursday a day after 2000 students 
converged on campus for a threehour demonstration against the 
visitation policy 
all of life after 11 pm has been banned at bu jamie 
sanbonmatsu a senior at the college of liberal arts told the 
crowd the administration is stunting our growth and development 
by denying us the right to make decisions 
under the new guidelines some of which go into effect in late 
fall and others during spring guests must display identification 
cards and leave the dormitory by 11 pm on weekdays and 1 am on 
weekends 
overnight stays by members of the same sex will be allowed if 
roommates agree but members of the opposite sex will not be 
allowed overnight 
the amount of alcohol allowed into the dorms will be limited to 
a sixpack of beer and a liter of other alcoholic beverages for 
students over age 21 
kevin carleton a university spokesman said wednesdays protest 
did not faze bu officials 
i dont think any demonstration would have an effect said 
carleton what can have an effect is a reasonable discussion 
officials said they based their decision on concerns stated by 
students staff and parents that residences too often have failed 
to provide the kind of environment where an individual can quietly 
study and have his or her right to privacy respected 
bu officials cited problems such as parties latenight group 
study and peer pressure to put up with overnight guests there are 
8700 students housed in university residence halls 
parietal rules were dropped by many american colleges and 
universities including bu in the 1960s and 70s

federal investigators say the engines from the 
delta air lines jetliner that crashed last month in texas show no 
evidence of mechanical failure a finding that is focusing more 
attention on possible pilot error 
the national transportation safety board said thursday the 
evidence shows that all engines on the plane were running as 
commanded and capable of producing full power at the time of 
impact 
early speculation after the aug 31 crash at dallasfort worth 
international airport in which 14 of 108 people aboard delta 
flight 1141 died was possible engine failure because witnesses 
reported fire coming from an engine 
the cockpit voice recorder tape also included a reference by a 
crew member to engine failure seconds before the crash 
but the ntsb said that after the three pratt amp whitney jt8d 
engines were disassembled at the manufacturers facilities in 
connecticut there was no evidence of preimpact failure in any 
of the engines 
the findings also seemed to rule out the possibility that an 
object or bird was sucked into an engine since that would have 
caused damage or been determined when the engines were disassembled 
while the safety board is continuing to examine the possibility 
that there was a compressor stall because of improper air flow 
through an engine investigators believe that would have to have 
been caused by some other irregularity 
proper air flow can be disrupted through an engine if a plane is 
in an unusual angle that restricts the flow of air across the wings 
or fuselage according to aviation experts 
investigators have said the cockpit voice recorder tape includes 
at least five noises that could be engine compressor stalls but 
all of them occur after the plane already was having serious 
problems remaining aloft 
the engine findings according to one source close to the 
investigation have caused investigators to focus more closely on 
the possibility that an error by the pilots such as improperly 
configuring the aircraft for takeoff was the cause of the crash 
investigators for example have been puzzled by conflicting 
evidence as to the setting of the planes wing flaps according to 
the recording of cockpit conversation the copilot acknowledged 
during the preflight checklist that the flaps had been set at the 
proper 15 degree extension 
but investigators found that the flaps which help provide more 
lift for takeoff were almost completely retracted and that the 
flaps lever in the cockpit was in the retracted position further 
tests may show whether the crash impact might have contributed to 
the positioning of both the flaps and the lever or whether a 
mechanical failure caused the flaps not to slide into proper 
position 
meanwhile the cockpit crew members all three of whom survived 
the crash have yet to provide information that might shed light on 
the cause of the accident 
earlier this week capt larry davis who was at the controls 
during the takeoff told investigators he recalls one of the other 
pilots stating the flaps were properly extended but doesnt recall 
checking the flap indicators to verify if they indeed had been set 
he said he recalls two loud bangs or explosions possibly 
engine compressor stalls caused by improper air flow seconds 
after liftoff and that the plane began to roll according to ntsb 
officials 
the copilot carey w kirkland has told investigators he 
doesnt remember anything after the aircraft left the gate while 
the flight engineer steven judd gave only sketchy information

former president gerald r ford says the legal 
restrictions of the controversial war powers act never caused him 
to change any of the decisions he made during his presidency 
i did what i felt had to be done the former president told 
a senate subcommittee 
fords comment came thursday in response to a question from sen 
larry pressler rsd about whether any of fords national 
security decisions were affected by the executive branch 
restrictions contained in the 1973 law 
ford is a strong opponent of the law as have been all 
presidents since the measure was enacted over president nixons 
veto the law was a congressional attempt to check some of the 
power which legislators felt had greatly deepened the american role 
in the vietnam war 
the law directs the white house to send congress a report within 
48 hours after us military personnel are sent to areas of 
imminent hostilities those forces must then be withdrawn within 60 
days or in some cases 90 days unless congress votes to allow them 
to remain 
ford told the foreign relations subcommittee set up to study the 
war powers act that he and his successors sent 19 reports to 
congress under the law although the documents werent submitted 
under provisions of the act that could trigger the 60day 
withdrawal period 
he added in the 15 years of the war powers resolution its 
never been implemented never its a dormant piece of 
legislation it ought to be repealed 
but ford added that im practical i dont think it will be 
repealed i support the kind of amendments proposed in a reform 
backed by leaders of both parties 
the changes would eliminate the 60 or 90day automatic 
withdrawal period and would replace the reporting requirement with 
a requirement that a president consult with house and senate 
leaders about major national security decisions 
the latest war powers fights have centered on president reagans 
policy of protecting reflagged kuwaiti tankers in the persian gulf 
reagan has refused to invoke the law there have been seven 
votes in congress on attempts to force the administration to comply 
with the law but all have failed 
abraham d sofaer the state department legal adviser also 
argued that the law is unconstitutional 
it incoporates a view of the relative powers of the political 
branches of our government and of their proper roles that is at 
odds with the constitutions scheme and with over 200 years of 
relatively consistent experience sofaer said 
sofaer also objected to the 60day restriction because the 
imposition of arbitrary and inflexible deadlines interferes with 
the effective and successful completion of the initiative 
undertaken by the president 
such limits may signal a divided nation giving our 
adversaries a basis for hoping that the president may be forced to 
desist or at least feel pressured to do so he explained

michael k deaver had been drinking up to a 
fifth of scotch whisky a day when he first sought treatment for 
alcoholism only several weeks after he left president reagans 
staff according to testimony 
deavers wife carolyn told a doctor that her husband drank 
bottles and bottles of wine the weekend before he was 
hospitalized on june 3 1985 for alcohol detoxification dr 
william argy testified thursday at a court hearing on the former 
presidential aides medical condition 
deaver is trying to get a lenient sentence for lying under oath 
about his lobbying activities by presenting evidence that his 
memory was impaired by alcoholism when he gave sworn testimony 
before a grand jury and a house subcommittee in 1986 
argy said deaver was drinking as much as a bottle of wine or a 
pint of vodka a day when he was hospitalized in october 1986 for 
detoxification 
the former deputy white house chief of staff and longtime friend 
of the reagan family faces a possible fiveyear term and a 6800 
fine for each of three perjury convictions when he appears sept 23 
for sentencing by us district judge thomas penfield jackson 
deaver was found guilty of two counts of lying by telling the 
grand jury he couldnt recall contacting former reagan 
administration colleagues on behalf of highpaying lobbying 
clients the third conviction stemmed from his denial to the house 
energy and commerce subcomittee that he helped a south korean trade 
envoy get an appointment to see the president 
at thursdays hearing defense lawyer randall j turk told 
jackson that evidence would show that deaver was an alcoholic at 
all times relevant to the case and therefore his memory was 
impaired both during the events in question and when he was asked 
about them under oath 
but independent counsel whitney north seymour jr argued that 
records of deavers hospitalization for alcoholism in june 1985 and 
again in october 1986 show nothing to support any finding that 
his memory was impaired 
mr deavers ability to recall was absolutely functioning it 
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall 
seymour argued 
medical experts for both the defense and prosecution were 
expected to testify when the hearing resumed 
a roman catholic priest who runs an alcoholism treatment center 
in havre de grace md where deaver spent a month following his 
second hospitalization said the former presidential aide complained 
of memory blackouts when he was first admitted 
prosecutors showed the rev joseph martin a treatment notation 
stating that during his stay deaver enjoyed a nightly game of 
trivial pursuits a game that challenges players memory of 
facts about popular culture and other subjects 
many of us have a little storehouse of useless information 
you can show it in a game like that martin said 
martin said deaver came to realize that his drinking problem 
occurred because he abused power and money 
argy who had earlier treated deaver for kidney failure 
testified that the former presidential aide called him on may 30 
1985 to seek help with alcoholism on june 3 1985 deaver was 
admitted to georgetown university hospital for detoxification 
the defense tried to use this testimony to show that deaver was 
not lying when he said he couldnt recall telephoning 
thentransportation secretary elizabeth dole or white house aide 
rogert porter from his hospital bed on behalf of trans world 
airlines 
the calls were made while he was going through acute alcohol 
withdrawal and while he was sedated by tranquilizers turk argued 
argy said deaver received between 120 and 140 milligrams of 
valium to counteract the effects of alcohol withdrawal during his 
threeday hospital stay 
but seymour was able to show that deaver did not receive any 
valium until 45 minutes after he had telephoned mrs dole on june 3 
according to argy deaver was given his first tranquilizer a 
25milligram dose of librium 45 minutes before the 5 pm call to 
dole which was documented by a telephone log produced at the trial 
the call to porter was the next day 
the medical testimony about deavers alcoholism was not offered 
during the trial because defense lawyers rested their case without 
calling any witnesses

ignoring a lawmakers plea to show how tough 
we are by opposing the firearms lobby the house has likely 
killed for this year an attempt to force americans to wait a week 
before buying a handgun 
by a 228182 bipartisan vote thursday the house eliminated from 
an antidrug bill a sevenday waiting period along with an optional 
police background check of the purchaser 
the vote substituted a plan to be devised by the justice 
department that would allow gun dealers to quickly identify 
convicted felons seeking to buy pistols sponsor bill mccollum 
rfla said the amendment was his own idea and the major progun 
group the national rifle assocation came to him with its support 
the waiting period language was named symbolically after 
presidential press secretary james brady who was shot along with 
president reagan in the march 30 1981 assassination attempt 
against the president by john w hinckley jr 
bradys wife sarah vice chair of handgun control inc called 
the vote disappointing and discouraging she added we came 
close twentyfour more votes would have made a difference 
the nras chief political operative wayne lapierre predicted 
that any attempt to resurrect the waiting period in the senate this 
year would fail because sentiment there was even stronger 
against the waiting period 
to change the house result 24 members would have to reverse 
course a seemingly insurmountable number for such a politically 
sensitive issue 
the threemillionmember nra which once faced little opposition 
in its lobbying against gun control was up against a formidable 
foe this time a coalition of gun control groups and law 
enforcement organizations that was better organized than ever 
before 
supporters of the waiting period believed they had a better 
chance of winning their legislation by making it part of a popular 
antidrug bill near election time 
but they guessed wrong and the coalitions predictions of a 
razorclose vote proved inaccurate nra supporters were able to 
muster backing from 101 democrats and 127 republicans opposing 
were 137 democrats and 45 republicans 
the overall drug bill would add some 2 billion to the nations 
39 billion drug fighting effort a final house vote is expected 
next week the senate still has to consider its own drug fighting 
bill 
in the closing moments of debate waiting period supporter rep 
william j hughes dnj urged members to show how tough we are 
when it comes to bucking the national rifle association and the gun 
lobby 
nra backer rep harold volkmer dmo said after the vote that 
those comments backfired 
taking on the nra is one thing and taking on gun owners is 
another volkmer said theres no question the nra had a lot to 
do with it he said but attributed most of the substitutes 
support to individual gun owners who contacted their lawmakers 
both sides brought police officers to washington to lobby for 
their positions 
the mccollum amendment would order the justice department to 
develop within 180 days a system that would allow gun dealers 
to check whether the applicant is a convicted felon 
mccollum has said the system which would be submitted to 
congress could include a telephone check such as the one that 
stores use to verify that credit cards are valid 
his language also requires that probation be revoked for anyone 
found in possession of firearms 
dewey stokes president of the fraternal order of police said 
i dont mind losing a fight when its fair but we were outgunned 
on this and by outgunned i mean dollar bills its a shame when 
our congressmen have to listen to a singleshot issue group like 
the nra 
supporters of the waiting period had argued the device was 
effective in the 22 states that had it citing figures that 
california screened out more than 1500 ineligible gun applicants 
in 1986 and new jersey stopped an average of 500 felons each year 
from buying guns 
but rep harley o staggers jr dwva said a national 
institute of justice study says criminals actually avoid going 
through legal channels to obtain guns the institute is a justice 
department research agency

the reagan administration has decided to 
gradually withdraw small numbers of the servicemen sent to panama 
last spring on temporary security duty administration officials 
say 
the decision was made because a feared threat to us bases in 
panama has not materialized according to the sources who spoke 
thursday on condition of anonymity 
the sources said the move was recommended by gen frederick f 
woerner jr head of the us southern command it was blessed by 
the joint chiefs of staff defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
the white house after a review that focused on political 
sensitivities not military requirements the officials added 
the sources declined to say exactly how many of the extra 2200 
security personnel sent to panama since last spring would be 
included in the first withdrawal one source indicated the number 
would be fewer than 500 while another official said about 200 
would be involved 
this is a sensitive thing because our opposition to the 
government of strongman gen manuel a noriega hasnt changed and 
we dont want this to be misinterpreted said one official but 
theres no sense keeping extra soldiers in the country if you dont 
need them 
separately state department officials said thursday the 
administration has decided to reduce the size of its diplomatic 
presence in panama because of what one official called a 
potentially confrontational situation in that country 
the extent of the diplomatic cutback was not immediately 
determined but one official said up to 160 jobs could be affected 
officials who disclosed the planned withdrawal of us security 
forces from panama said the cutbacks will be carried out gradually 
they will come out over a period of time a source said 
we dont want to fly in empty aircraft and load them up all at 
once and have noriega claiming he won 
the situation has not improved but these people arent needed 
for the mission they were sent in for 
said another official most of these security personnel were 
put on as guards at the military installations and we havent been 
experiencing harassment in that area 
weve been having problems with other things besides gate 
security so if you dont have enough for them to do theres no 
reason to extend their tour or to replace them with fresh units 
the sources said the decision to begin drawing down the extra 
security personnel amounted to acknowledgement of a standoff with 
noriega that features harassment but no direct threat to us 
facilities 
the panamanian defense forces continue to hassle americans 
when they travel offbase and we still have occasional intruders 
at our oil tank farm said one official but the bases 
themselves have really not been threatened 
the united states has been pressing economic sanctions against 
panama for months now in a bid to oust noriega the panamanian 
general has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on 
drug trafficking charges 
last march and april citing growing instability in panama and 
the heavyhanded tactics of noriega in dealing with the 
situation the pentagon began sending army marine and air force 
military police and security specialists to the central american 
nation 
panama besides being the site of the panama canal is the 
home of the us southern command the organization responsible for 
all us military forces in central and south america about 10000 
american servicemen and a like number of dependents are stationed 
there permanently 
over the course of the twomonth buildup this spring the 
pentagon moved an extra 2200 servicemen into panama on temporary 
duty status to augment the roughly 600 security personnel assigned 
there permanently 
the issue of withdrawing those servicemen and replacing them 
arises now because under military regulations a temporary duty 
assignment cannot last more than 180 days

the gunshot that killed palau president 
lazarus e salii on aug 20 was selfinflicted the government said 
friday 
the inescapable conclusion is that the cause and manner of 
death was instantaneous by selfinflicted perforating gunshot wound 
of the head said the report issued by the offices of palaus 
attorney general and director of the bureau of public safety 
the report cited ballistic tests conducted at the fbi laboratory 
in washington dc an autopsy report from forensic pathlogist dr 
heeyong park on guam and statements from witnesses

the incessant surf rolled in a little 
higher than normal and even though it was late summer the peak 
time for tropical storms people werent too concerned 
after all this was galveston the largest and most prosperous 
town in texas the wall steet of the southwest and it had 
weathered storms before 
in september 1900 in the days before radio and satellite 
photographs people had no idea that out in the gulf of mexico a 
monster storm was brewing that would change texas history and bring 
death and terror on a scale that never has been seen before or 
since in the united states 
on sept 8 1900 galveston was home to nearly 38000 people 
when the sun rose the next day nearly onesixth of the citys 
residents were dead victims of buildings toppled by winds and 
waves drowned in the 15foot storm surge mangled by flying debris 
or washed out to sea 
the death toll was put at 6000 but its uncertain how many 
thousands of others were lost 
nobody knows the complete story of what happened at galveston 
nobody ever will know john edward weems wrote in his classic 
account of the storm a weekend in september 
ironically the book written in 1956 was rereleased this 
month to mark the 88th anniversary of the great galveston storm 
most of them wanted to talk weems says now recalling his 
conversations with storm survivors the tragedies were still with 
them but enough time had passed so they could talk about them 
i got the idea some of them might be paying respect to their 
dead friends and relatives by talking about them 
although weems believes all the hundreds of survivors he 
interviewed have died since jennie graham karboski is among the 
few still living who were there and what she remembers most is the 
water angrily rising and the bodies floating everywhere 
mrs karboski is now 100 and lives with her daughter in houston 
she was 12 and growing up in galveston when the storm hit 
they tried to have mass burials at sea but the next morning 
many floated back in on the surf she told the houston chronicle 
this week the men had to dig trenches and burn them my dad said 
they kept the work crews drunk they had to 
after a harrowing journey by rowboat and horse cart mrs 
karboskis family found shelter in a catholic seminary 
others who survived huddled in a lighthouse or a stormtossed 
ship or crammed inside the upper stories of their homes others 
clung to wreckage until the waters receded 
perhaps the most lasting monument to the 1900 storm is the 
galveston seawall a concrete embankment 17 feet above mean low 
tide built after the great storm to ward off future huge storm 
surges it has helped to moderate damage from hurricanes since 
a more significant effect however was that many businessmen 
who considered galveston the hub of activity for texas decided they 
would not put themselves through another such storm 
they moved inland about 50 miles to a mosquitoinfested swamp 
town called houston which 88 years later is the nations 
fourthlargest city

but for the summerlong writers strike the fall 
television season would have begun monday with typically fervent 
competition among the three networks and an advertising blitz for 
their new shows 
but network competition has been sidelined for the next couple 
of weeks as the 1988 summer olympics play in prime time on nbc 
while abc and cbs their new fall shows delayed for weeks by the 
strike basically twiddle their thumbs 
cbs is even hoping the olympics do well for nbc 
we face absent the olympics an audience thats going to be 
more restless than usual said david poltrack cbs vice president 
for marketing if theyre going to find a place to be diverted to 
while waiting for the season to be launched late the olympics is 
where id like to see them go not to independent stations or cable 
networks 
so at this point in time wed like to get the majority of the 
audience that the olympics dont get but id like to see the 
olympics do well 
cbs is also hoping good nbc numbers will help when cbs sells 
advertising in the 1994 winter olympics cbs is also seeking rights 
to the 1992 summer games 
abc is counterprogramming the olympics with halfhour comedies 
but it too has basically forfeited the lions share of television 
viewers to nbc 
we tried to do it with a little bit of fun a sense of 
humor said alan wurtzel abcs vice president for marketing 
recognize something comes along every four years and we know 
were not going to beat it 
cbs is running movies and firstrun sitcoms against the olympics 
in an effort to draw as many kids and older people the groups 
least likely to be avid watchers of the olympics 
abc has decided that if the olympics are high drama theyll 
counterprogram with laughs the network has scheduled a month of 
repeats of top abc sitcoms plus comedy movies and specials 
what we did was we looked at basically what did best against 
us when we had the olympics in the past how our competitors 
fared said wurtzel what we learned was people kind of dipped 
in and out of the olympics they dont necessarily like every 
event programs that did best were halfhour comedies nbc is 
predicting it will average about a third of the primetime viewing 
audience with olympics 
because of the strike delay the networks are at odds over when 
the new television season should be declared open 
advertisers buy commercials based on viewership of individual 
shows so they dont care who wins the seasonlong horse race in the 
ac nielsen co ratings but it is an image contest 
not surprisingly nbc believes the new season should begin 
monday since it will have undoubtedly big ratings for the olympics 
which would count on the season 
we did not have the starttime problem that some other people 
may have so were taking the traditional outlook and starting on 
the 19th said jeff boehme director of audience measurement at 
nbc 
several broadcasters dont have original programming im sure 
they would prefer to start it at a later time from our 
perspective we have our programming in place and we dont think 
it would be fair to us to delete firstrun programming from the 
season he said 
wurtzel says abc is marking the new season from about oct 24 
the week in which it will have half its new programs on the air 
poltrack said cbs would also have the season start oct 24 for the 
same reason 
if the late start is confounding the networks viewers could 
benefit even though the television season is starting late the 
networks have nevertheless put in orders for a full seasons supply 
of episodes for most series 
that means fewer reruns next spring

with yellowstone national parks 
wildfires still burning the famous tourist attractions gateway 
cities already are planning ways to lure visitors to the charred 
landmark next summer 
the geysers are still there the waterfalls are still there 
the elk and bison and bears are still there the streams and fish 
are still there said suzanne young executive director of the 
jackson wyo chamber of commerce 
our job will be to get out the message that yes there is 
still the yellowstone you love and remember despite the forest 
fires 
while the key landmarks are still there so is a mosaic of 
charred trees as a dozen enormous fires have blazed across nearly 
half of yellowstones 22 million acres in the past two months the 
flames forced frequent evacuations of campgrounds and lodging 
facilities and blanketed thousands of square miles with smoke 
the parks tiny gateway communities are vitally linked to the 
giant wilderness which in a normal year attracts 3 million 
visitors towns with economies strongly dependent on yellowstone 
include gardiner silver gate cooke city and west yellowstone in 
montana jackson and cody in wyoming and to a lesser degree 
driggs and victor in idaho 
officials say that so far this year tourist visits to 
yellowstone are down 125 percent from last years figures a loss 
of more than a quarter million visitors 
many merchants and innkeepers are wondering about the longterm 
economic impact of the worst fires in yellowstone in 300 years 
a month after the fires are out or at least after theyre off 
the tv nightly news we want a market research firm to do attitude 
perception surveys to find out what people think about a vacation 
in yellowstone said young 
will they be interested what will they expect to see our 
guess is that memory is short nobody can even remember a hurricane 
name from last week my hunch is people will want to come see what 
happened here 
steve tedder of park concessioner tw services which runs 
yellowstones lodging restaurants and transportation services 
expects sales to be down 4 million to 5 million a 25 percent 
drop from last year 
it certainly has been an interesting summer he said wryly 
july and august traditionally are our biggest months when we 
make up for the losses of our winter operation it has been very 
dramatic devastating from a visitor standpoint and an operations 
standpoint to date weve had to give early release to about 800 
employees i think it was by the grace of god that we have not lost 
any major structures 
john olson tw services marketing director said the fires have 
had a strong effect on the entire region 
we have got a big job this fall just convincing the local 
people to come back he said then we have to look at the 
national and international markets i know weve got a heck of a 
problem 
olson is busy accumulating videotape and photographs showing 
that many areas of the park are unaffected by the fires so we can 
be sure were telling the true story he already has traveled to 
london to talk about yellowstone with key tour group operators and 
newspaper travel editors 
in addition some university of wyoming students are using 
computer lists to contact tourists who canceled their reservations 
at yellowstone and find out why 
rick wilder executive director of the cody wyo chamber of 
commerce hopes the federal government will step in to help noting 
that a portion of profit from concessions within the park goes for 
park improvements 
were not looking for a handout or a giveaway but its going 
to be very difficult to add on any extra expense said wilder 
the federal government is spending 100 million to fight the 
fires so it doesnt seem unrealistic to think an extra 2 million 
could be spent to get people to come back to yellowstone 
john wilson head of montanas tourism promotion effort said 
montana gov ted schwinden and wyoming gov mike sullivan will be 
asked by their states travel and tourism officials to seek federal 
disaster money for the parks gateway communities

captain james t kirk of the starship enterprise 
looks skyward from a lonely windblown planet and says 
entapuraizu riku kara tenso shite kure 
for those listening to the english version of star trek 
captain kirk would have said enterprise beam me up 
dubbed in japanese star trek is just one of many vintage 
american tv programs boldly exploring the latenight tokyo airwaves 
during a typical week insomniastricken viewers in the tokyo 
area can watch burkes law the 1960s adventure show starring 
gene barry as a debonair los angeles police chief rod serlings 
the twilight zone the acclaimed science fiction series 
bonanza one of televisions longest running westerns starring 
lorne greene the beverly hillbillies the antics of a 
backwoods family in los angeles elitist neighborhood mission 
impossible the acclaimed bruce geller adventure series and 
the addams family a sitcom based on charles addams bizarre 
magazine cartoon characters 
i dont have any statistics on this said yoshihiro mishima 
of the tv tokyo network but we think the people who stay up to 
watch these programs are looking for a bit of the good old days 
when they might have been too young to watch the original 
broadcasts 
mishima said the viewers are mainly college students or adults 
in their 30s its part of the retro boom he said referring 
to a recent trend among some japanese to seek out things from the 
past 
but american tv shows are nothing new to the japanese audience 
there have been american programs on japanese tv for decades 
going back to ben casey and rawhide mishima said theyve 
lost popularity to domestic programing but people still watch them 
to get a look at america 
yuji tagami an editor with tv station magazine added they 
can develop devoted fans but ratings for latenight american 
programs in general are not very high 
limited viewership did not stop the tokyo broadcasting system 
from putting the nostalgic american tv series on its schedule 
last october since march the series has included surfside 6 
a 60s detective series set in miami beach starring troy donahue 
and van williams combat the longest of the world war ii 
adventures starring the late vic morrow and superman 
starring george reeves 
ratings arent a good way to judge latenight television 
shows popularity in that time slot viewership is small and more 
personal viewers are more attached to what they watch said 
masato ueda tbs producer of the series 
to young viewers the appeal of the rejuvenated old programs is 
in their newness ueda said 
we decided to go with the series when we went on the 24hour 
broadcasting schedule and though the retro boom was a part of 
the decision we wanted to give young people something completely 
new which to them these programs are 
many of the american programs also feature bilingual broadcasts 
with the original englishlanguage dialogue simultaneously aired on 
a subchannel available on specially equipped tv sets

when president reagan switched the other day 
and decided to release overdue payments to the united nations it 
was another sign that as far as us foreign policy is concerned 
his views have undergone extensive alteration since he entered the 
white house nearly eight years ago 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater explained the surprising 
switch on the dues as based on a determination by reagan that the 
united nations had reformed its operation 
that doesnt alter the fact however that one of the tenets of 
the political philosophy that nurtured reagan and gave identity to 
his pursuit of the presidency was severe skepticism of the united 
nations 
conservatives always have complained that the united states paid 
a disproportionate share of the un bills while serving as a 
convenient target of the soviet bloc and the socalled nonaligned 
countries 
but reagan told the state department to ante up and another 
corner was turned in his twilight months in the white house only 
his commitment to guerrillas trying to overthrow the sandinista 
government in nicaragua remains uncolored by the pragmatic fact 
that the contras are not making much headway 
on arms control after campaigning in 1980 against all major 
accords with the soviet union and putting negotiations on a back 
burner for months reagan gradually adopted a stance that even 
diehard opponents grudgingly acknowledged was far friendlier to 
arms control than they had expected 
they still are worried he may try to unravel the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty before heading home to california 
but the new 1987 accord to ban intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
is safely on the books 
it stands as the only ussoviet agreement to eliminate an 
entire category of nuclear weapons and it was negotiated on 
reagans watch 
meanwhile four summit meetings with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev have produced a conciliatory stance in the white house 
that is in striking contrast to early reagan rhetorical flourishes 
that included castigating moscow as an evil empire 
until november 1985 he was the first american president since 
herbert hoover not to have met with a soviet leader now he has 
held more oneonone superpower summits than any of them 
ironically reagan has moderated his arms control policy to such 
an extent that michael dukakis who is a liberal democrat 
suggested this week in outlining a nuclear missile strategy agenda 
that his views were not that far from the presidents 
the biggest difference is over reagans strategic defense 
initiative dukakis said he would stop pouring billions and 
billions of dollars into the pursuit of a spacebased defense 
against soviet ballistic missiles but he said he would continue a 
modest research program into possible missile defenses 
the republican candidate vice president george bush who 
projected himself in 1980 as a moderate alternative to reagans 
deep conservatism is working overtime meanwhile to align himself 
with reagans foreign policy initiatives his pitch essentially is 
that he would continue along the same course if he is elected 
having been part of the administration bushs job in lining up 
with reagan policies is hardly as difficult as the task confronting 
dukakis 
but the democratic candidates agenda on weapons moved him 
closer to reagan 
dukakis has voiced concerns about the costs of the b1 bomber 
and the midgetman missile but he endorsed production of the 
trident ii submarinelaunched missile and four other weapons 
more significant perhaps was his vow that well use force 
when its necessary to protect our territory our citizens or our 
vital interests to meet our treaty commitments and to deter or to 
respond to terrorist attacks 
the words were dukakiss but if you close your eyes and let your 
mind drift back to 1980 they might just as well have been ronald 
reagans

ladies and gentlemen sharpen your scalpels the 
show that dares to comment on patti lupones diction madonnas 
acting ability nell carters figure and sarah brightmans overbite 
has returned with malice and entertainment for all 
forbidden broadway 1988 which arrived thursday at 
offbroadways theater east is the latest edition of gerard 
alessandrinis vestpocket musical revues that mercilessly spoof 
the broadway theater and its the best version of the show yet 
in more than 25 musical sketches a hardworking company of 
four plus pianist philip fortenberry takes aim at some of 
broadways biggest hits including les miserables the phantom 
of the opera m butterfly speedtheplow anything 
goes and into the woods they score a bullseye nearly every 
time 
alessandrini who devised the show and supplied the new lyrics 
as well as the direction is a master at deflating bombast 
consider his blitz of les miserables a mock minimusical that 
deflates the big broadway blockbuster its not easy simulating 
trevor nunns turntable staging but alessandrini comes up with 
credible and hilaroius copy of it here but then he also supplies a 
chandelier for something called the phantom of the musical a 
duet for a masked andrew lloyd webber and a bucktoothed miss 
brightman 
the author is equally effective at lancing bigtime 
personalities theres a narcissistic miss lupone mushmouthing a 
cole porterstyle ditty called i get a kick out of me or an 
exasperated david mamet author of speedtheplow singing to 
the tune of the rain in spain we strain in vain to train 
madonnas brain 
the performers particularly the two women are superb mimics 
toni dibuono does a terrific lupone and a powerhouse ethel merman 
who battles it out on stage in a duet with a relentlessly perky 
mary martin played by roxie lucas miss lucas also lacerates 
elaine stritch parodying her ladies who lunch number in 
company with a song called ladies who screech 
the evening reaches the height of demented lunacy when miss 
dibuono and michael mcgrath take on kiri te kanawa and jose 
carreras and the practice of using opera stars to record famous 
broadway scores here alessandrini has them singing a song from the 
rock musical grease equally effective is mcgraths explanation 
of the bizarre plot of m butterfly done to the strains of 
poor butterfly 
david b mcdonald lends his booming voice to an effective sendup 
of joseph papp called papp the knife and papps practice of 
butchering the classics he also leads the audience in a sondheim 
singalong called into the words 
forbidden broadway seems to renew itself every season with 
the influx of new shows right now you can imagine alessandrini 
looking forward with glee to jerome robbins broadway and peter 
allen in legs diamond both big musicals scheduled to open this 
season they should provide particularly good material for his 
special brand of merry meyhem

the nations heartland is challenging 
swedens generous refugee policy raising fears that latent racism 
may be bubbling to the surface 
its happening in sjobo a small southern farming town where the 
tallest building is three stories high downtown is one street and 
everyone knows just about everybody else 
the 15000 citizens of the town and the surrounding district are 
holding a referendum sunday on whether to accept about 30 refugees 
it is a local issue but the question is drawing national 
attention and is dominating the final weeks of the campaign for the 
parliamentary election on the same day 
government figures say that from 1983 to 1987 62600 people 
sought political asylum in sweden a country of 84 million people 
making it the highest per capita rate in europe 
last year 245 of swedens 284 municipal districts took in 18000 
newcomers as the government tried to spread them outside stockholm 
and other cities where housing is scarce 
when the request came to sjobo the town council balked it 
voted last autumn by 2524 to put the question to a popular vote 
residents say the issue has split families friends and even the 
towns only church distrust and anger stop people from talking 
about it any more and a sullenness has fallen on the town 
a lot of people are very ashamed its terrible said 
madeleine ramel head of the local social welfare board the town 
has changed 
mrs ramel said the fight in sjobo may spread to other 
communities that have been reluctant to take in refugees but that 
have been too afraid of public scorn to refuse 
it is dangerous to ignore signals and what is happening in 
sjobo is one of the signals said mrs ramel 
the immigration department has said sjobo could have a say in 
which immigrants would be sent the decision has been postponed 
until after the referendum 
an influx of immigrants from iran lebanon and south america has 
spawned a rightwing backlash in france denmark and other european 
countries but that has not happened in sweden 
a lot of swedes have a negative attitude toward immigrants it 
is normally surpressed but having a referendum is bringing it to 
the surface said anders sonnerstedt a political scientist at 
nearby lund university 
swedish people are afraid to speak about the refugee question 
today because anyone who speaks out is called a racist said 
peringvar magnusson a fertilizer dealer who favors keeping the 
immigrants out 
magnusson chairman of the sjobo branch of the center party 
denied he is motivated by racism he said the town lacks housing 
and jobs for its own young people who are moving away and he 
professed astonishment at the attention the town has received 
they make us out to be stupid fools farmers who live in 
isolation he said in an interview the town simply wants to take 
care of its own first he said 
mrs ramel whose welfare board would handle the immigrants if 
they came dismissed magnussons argument its a silly question 
why cant 15000 people take care of 30 more people i think they 
the opponents just dont want foreigners here 
the naysayers in sjobo have been roundly condemned by national 
leaders the media and the public one waitress complained that a 
customer passing through asked rudely if the restaurant has 
racism on the menu 
magnusson said he gets hundreds of letters of support from other 
swedes many of them dont even dare to sign their names for 
fear of being branded as a racist 
swedens few openly racist groups are dismissed as an 
insignificant fringe but the fight in sjobo involves farmers who 
represent swedens roots and a political party with long and 
illustrious history 
the issue was an embarrassment to the national center party 
during its election campaign and party leader olof johansson 
threatened to expel the sjobo members they have made their last 
mistake in the center party he said in a television interview 
the centerright party governs the local council in a coalition 
with the conservative party on the national level it is in the 
opposition against the governing social democratic party 
set serenely among woodlands and wheatfields sjobo seems hardly 
the scene for a national confrontation the town of 4000 is laid 
out in neat rows of singlestory homes with welltrimmed gardens 
the immigration department has said the state would pay for 
housing and educating the immigrants 
but magnusson said the problem goes deeper he said the 
government must curb an unchecked flood of immigrants 
magnusson cited police reports that more than half the refugees 
seeking to live in sweden destroy their passports on their way here 
to make it difficult to deport them 
police say as many as 25000 people may be in sweden under false 
identities and that as many as 15 wanted terrorists move here every 
year 
among them were a palestinian who was killed by a car bomb in 
athens greece in july and a wanted terrorist from the irish 
republican army who was arrested in august by dutch police while 
traveling through the netherlands 
there are terrorists drug dealers and criminals coming in 
said magnusson if the government had more control of handling 
refugees there would be no need for a vote in sjobo

richard bowden of london came to this 
caribbean resort to get a tan he ended up spending a dark day in a 
rented car reading a horror story as he rode out hurricane 
gilbert the worst storm on record 
there was a lot of corrugated material flying about all over 
the place said bowden 35 it was like being in an aircraft in 
turbulence you felt the wind was going to lift you away 
other tourists crammed into cancuns hotels and shelters were 
becoming impatient by thursday the day after gilbert blasted the 
yucatan peninsula with 160mph winds and driving rain 
food was in short supply power was still out the airport was 
closed and roads out of the city nearly impassable 
hysterical one hotel receptionist said of the stranded 
vacationers 
about 6000 tourists were trapped in cancun when this normally 
idyllic resort of sandy beaches and warm clear waters turned into 
a fury of waves and wind in the predawn hours wednesday 
bowden drove into cancun tuesday only hours before the storm 
hit 
by then tourists at the beachfront resorts were being moved 
into shelters and hotels in the old part of the city about six 
miles away 
as the hurricane neared bowden also sought refuge in the city 
but was turned away by hotels already jammed with guests from the 
luxury resorts 
as gilbert roared into cancun bowden said he curled up in his 
car with a book a horror story involving a magic carpet 
i got sick of it if id had some postcards i would have 
written them to send to people but i did not have any he said 
bowden said he watched as airborne debris zipped past his car 
but even worse was the sound of two support lines of a radio 
transmission tower twanging like a badly tuned guitar in the 
wind 
shortly after dawn the storm still raging he said left the 
car looking for some place to get a cup of coffee unsuccessful 
he returned to the vehicle 
about 150 tourists who were given refuge at city hall had 
nothing but milk and cookies to eat 
i think everyones nerves are starting to get shot now said 
joseph camuccio of philadelphia who had arrived in cancun sunday 
everyone is going to the same bathroom he said there is 
no water or electricity they the toilets dont flush or 
anything everybody wants to get out 
some tourists said they were given virtually no warning that a 
dangerous storm was on the way 
maggie frederick of petaluma calif said she had just gotten

a woman who said a wild dog snatched 
and ate her newborn child has been found innocent of murder 
the court decision closes the book on an 8yearold case that 
divided australia and captured headlines worldwide 
the northern territory court of criminal appeal in darwin on 
thursday overturned lindy chamberlains sentence of life 
imprisonment with hard labor she spent about four years in jail 
it also quashed the conviction of her husband michael a pastor 
for the seventh day adventist church on charges of being an 
accessory to murder 
mrs chamberlain who was born in new zealand became a 
household name in 1980 when she said a dingo or native australian 
dog carried off her 6weekold daughter azaria while the family 
camped in the outback near ayers rock a sacred aboriginal site 
replete with rumors of black magic and a suicide that led to a 
break in the case the chamberlain story made page 1 in newspapers 
across australia and elsewhere all australians seem to have an 
opinion on the womans story 
in 1987 she was pardoned but her conviction was not overturned 
thursdays innocent verdict finally sealed the case shut 
gasps filled the courtroom when the decision was announced 
michael chamberlain clasped his hands to his head and wept his 
wife who had been staring at the judges slumped in her seat 
the law of the land holds the chamberlains to be innocent 
said the ruling 
the chamberlains defense attorney had accused the northern 
territory government which originally prosecuted the pair of 
waging a modernday witchunt 
the lawyer stuart tipple said the chamberlains were waiting to 
see whether the government would pay the couple compensation before 
deciding on any civil action earlier he said the couple was 
seeking about 750000 
after the verdict mrs chamberlain a tiny woman in highheeled 
red shoes was thronged by curious onlookers as she strode with 
straightened shoulders from the courthouse 
the crowd clamored for a closer look as the couple made their 
way through the large crowd to their car construction workers 
nearby downed tools and whistled while others jeered 
the chamberlain drama began on a cold night in august 1980 when 
mrs chamberlain cried out at the family camp side at ayers rock 
central australia a dingos got my baby 
at first the chamberlains story was believed but when the 
couple went to court mrs chamberlain was accused of slitting her 
babys throat 
the babys body was never found but bloodstains were found in 
the couples tent 
on oct 29 1982 the chamberlains were found guilty and mrs 
chamberlain was sentenced to life in prison where she to gave 
birth to a second daughter kahlia her husband was sentenced to a 
suspended 18month sentence 
the couple has two other sons aiden and reagan although the 
prosecution never alleged black magic as a motive many australians 
have linked the death of baby azaria to witchcraft and satanic 
rites believing the children have mystical names 
the family denied rumors that the name azaria meant sacrifice 
in the wilderness many australians also thought it significant 
that the death occurred at ayers rock sacred to aborigines in one 
of the most remote parts of australia 
in february 1986 a remarkable breakthrough in the case came 
when a british tourist jumped off the huge monolith to his death 
aboriginal trackers investigating the suicide found the tattered 
remains of azarias jacket which mrs chamberlain swore the baby 
was wearing the night she vanished 
the discovery of the jacket proved that mrs chamberlain had not 
been lying about at least one aspect of her babys death and 
prompted officials to reopen the case 
five days after the jacket was found mrs chamberlain was 
released from prison on june 2 1987 a federal judge pardoned her 
and said mrs chamberlain may have told the truth when she said the 
dingo snatched and ate the baby 
indeed the evidence affords the view that a dingo may have 
taken her federal judge trevor morling wrote in his opinion 
but under australian law the pardon was as far as trevor could 
go and the chamberlains returned to court to overturn the 
conviction 
there is no satisfaction no joy knowing they still believe 
you are guilty mrs chamberlain said at the time 
although the court case is over the chamberlain story will 
continue 
american movie star meryl streep recently finished filming a 
movie on the case based on a book titled evil angels the 
american release is provisionally called a cry in the darkness

with their currency losing ground rapidly in a 
spiraling inflation peruvians are buying up refrigerators and 
other durable goods not likely to lose value as fast as their paper 
money the inti 
after two years of prosperity peruvians are seeing an economic 
turnaround that is fueling the fastest increase in consumer prices 
ever seen here 
independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation 
will pass 500 percent this year two years ago inflation was 63 
percent 
the country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money said 
sen enrique chirinos an independent this is a horrifying 
perspective and never known before in our history 
consumer prices shot up 309 percent in july alone 
peruvians are trying to adjust they say they eat less work 
more and worry a lot 
now i have to buy less chicken i use it first for broth and 
then stew its the only way said housewife carmen alegre while 
shopping in limas workingclass la aurora market 
nearby tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were 
selling for 3000 intis equivalent to about 25 or half the 
minimum monthly wage 
cigarettes often sold singly because many peruvians cannot 
afford entire packs cost 10 intis each or seven times the january 
price 
analysts are now concerned that perus inflation could boil into 
fourdigit figures next year 
the middle class has begun renting spare rooms tutoring 
knitting and sewing piece work and selling homecooked food such as 
meatfilled empanadas in streetside stands to make ends meet 
but perus poor the vast majority of the population have been 
affected the hardest 
the poorest paid people in peru are earning less money than at 
any time since records have been kept the andean report an 
economic monthly said in july 
an old man begging in the shadow of limas downtown government 
palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer 
this fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing he said 
jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passersby 
antonio reyes manager of an appliance store said he telephones 
wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television 
sets stoves and toasters he sells 
but business has been good reyes said noting customers have 
pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen 
at 130 percent to buy durable goods whose value very well could 
rise in an inflation 
the only option a saver has with his money is spend it said 
the news magazine caretas those who do not have the ability to 
save will simply have to seek a second job 
guillermo fernandez 42 a married accountant with three 
children said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money 
trader on wall street the name given by peruvians to jiron 
ocona a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day 
now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation 
he said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking 
to supplement inflationpinched incomes with the small but quick 
profits offered by the dollar trade 
analysts say jiron ocona is also a financial barometer and the 
recent stampede for dollars reflects peruvians waning confidence 
in the governments ability to improve economic conditions 
in a recent survey peruvians rated the economy as the no 1 
problem replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked 
first a year ago 
president alan garcia imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments 
on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed 
creditors abroad to finance a consumptionbased economic 
reactivation that pulled peru from its worst depression of the 
century 
but heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at 
least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to 
subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year 
manufacturing has fallen sharply while speculation in consumer 
and industrial goods is rampant 
prosperity reflected by wellstocked stores two years ago has 
now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of 
medicines auto parts and basic foods such as milk and sugar 
garcia a populist whose term ends in 1990 recently installed a 
war economy aimed at holding down wage increases while 
allowing prices to rise 
but economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and 
predict inflation will continue to soar 
when inflation hits 500 percent it could very easily get out 
of hand said one leading independent economist alejandro toledo 
this is my biggest concern there will be a very high social 
cost and peru is not a stable country

movable panels of soundabsorbing material 
should improve the sound of music from the stage of carnegie hall 
say officials of the famous concert hall 
the beige clothcovered fiberglass panels were unveiled at a 
news conference thursday as a response to complaints from some 
critics and musicians about acoustics since the halls major 
renovation two years ago 
the panels in nine sections that can be carried on or off stage 
by stagehands cost a total of 30000 officials said 
isaac stern president of carnegie hall said the panels are 
designed to absorb midtohighrange sound 
the result is that you can feel the wood quality of a great 
violin and of a piano and woodwinds stern said adding he thinks 
orchestral blend also will be improved by the panels 
the challenge was to provide a modest amount of absorption 
that would absorb only in a certain frequency range said

george bush who has made lawandorder a 
centerpiece of his presidential campaign finds himself on the 
opposite side of law enforcement officials on the controversial 
issue of a mandatory national waiting period for gun purchases 
democrat michael dukakis prescription for cracking down on 
crime includes tougher gun controls including waiting periods for 
handgun purchases 
a provision calling for the handgun waiting period was 
eliminated thursday in the house from a bill calling for a 
multibillion dollar increase in the federal war on drugs the 
house already voted overwhelmingly last week in favor of a bush 
campaign promise to seek the death penalty for drug killers 
bush opposed the socalled brady amendment to the drug bill 
which would have required a federal waiting period the national 
rifle association waged a pitched battle against it 
bush a lifetime nra member told the national association of 
police organizations in a recent survey i am opposed to federal 
waiting period legislation as i have stated in the past this is a 
matter for the states to decide 
twentytwo states have laws requiring waiting periods the house 
amendment is being pushed by sarah brady wife of white house press 
secretary james brady who was one of four people shot during john 
hinckleys march 1981 attempt to assassinate president reagan 
mrs bradys lobbying group handgun control inc wants a 
sevenday wait on handgun purchases from licensed dealers 
under the amendment a dealer would have to send law enforcement 
authorities a sworn statement including the guns serial number and 
description and the buyers name address and birth date the 
police at their option could perform a background check 
dukakis told the police organizations i support legislation 
that allows law enforcement officials adequate time to review the 
criminal record or competency of anyone applying for a handgun 
permit 
dukakis record in support of gun control including a proposed 
ban on cheap saturday night specials used in many street 
robberies has angered gun owners in his home state of 
massachusetts signs at the states borders call attention to its 
mandatory prison sentences for illegally carrying a gun 
dukakis says government should respect the right of citizens to 
use firearms for hunting and target shooting and to own firearms 
to protect their homes and businesses subject to the regulation of 
state and local governments 
but the governor says there are too many illegally owned 
handguns across this nation and we must act strongly to control 
the use of handguns by criminals he says homicides committed 
with handguns claim 22000 lives each year 
bush in his campaign literature says i have always opposed 
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners but he adds 
that we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with 
the rights of society we must do all we can to keep guns out 
of the hands of convicted criminals 
in a debate with other republican candidates before the gun 
owners of new hampshire last feb 2 bush said im not only a 
hunter but im a lifetime member of the nra i do have a deep 
appreciation for the second amendment rights to keep and bear 
arms 
he assured the gun owners he would as president veto a bill 
drafted by sen howard metzenbaum dohio that would ban 
undetectable plastic handguns as a security hazard but he urged 
gun owners to work with police organizations to fashion a 
compromise 
im making a pitch here for reason on the part of hunters 
bush said the last thing you want to do is find yourself opposed 
by those that are on the cutting edge of fighting narcotics 
fighting against international terror and trying to protect 
international safety 
a compromise later was reached on the plastic gun issue the 
house and senate passed separate but similar measures now awaiting 
final action in a conference committee both candidates say they 
support restrictions on undetectable firearms 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen in an example of his many 
policy differences with the top of the ticket opposes a 
nationallymandated waiting period for handgun purchases i 
believe it ought to be done on a statebystate basis the texas 
senator said thursday 
bushs no 2 sen dan quayle also opposes legislation that 
would mandate the waiting period on the national level 
hubert williams president of the police foundation told 
reporters last month that letting states decide on waiting periods 
fails to recognize the immediate danger to our police posed by 
the drug gangs 
williams said bush has taken a position that is diametrically 
opposed to the interest of law enforcement 
we are particularly concerned because vice president bush has 
attempted to make law enforcement issues a central plank in his 
platform said williams bush cannot equivocate or stand 
with both the police and the nra on this one

justice sandra day oconnor says she at 
times yearned to escape the media attention she drew in her initial 
year as the first female member of the us supreme court 
oconnor told the annual meeting of the oregon state bar on 
thursday she became an instant novelty in 1981 the year she was 
appointed and that the press followed her everywhere 
my first year on the court made me long at times for 
obscurity she said 
oconnor said she was surprised about her appointment to the 
supreme court she was a state appeals court judge in arizona at 
the time 
i had never expected or aspired to be a supreme court judge 
she said 
she said she had plenty to learn because she had little 
experience with federal law or the federal court system 
it was several years before i felt confident in granting or 
denying petitions that seek to have the supreme court hear 
appeals she said 
she said although people probably perceive the court as being 
insulated from the rest of society she thinks its a good place to 
get an overview of the nations concerns because of the variety of 
cases it handles

the tiny island nation of singapore has turned 
into a prime market for american poultry particularly cut up parts 
of chickens an agriculture department trade analyst says 
peter kurz of the departments foreign agricultural service 
until recently the agencys trade officer in singapore said the 
countrys decision to eliminate pig farms is behind the poultry 
boom 
in a drive for a cleaner environment singapore has increased 
the tempo in eliminating all pig farms kurz said since many 
singapore pig farms also have poultry operations the number of 
poultry farms also has declined sharply 
consequently poultry production has dropped causing 
singapores poultry imports to rise to record levels 
kurz who now is serving with the usda agency in washington 
writes about the singapore poultry boom in the october issue of 
foreign agriculture magazine 
imports of chicken parts were up 20 percent with the united 
states accounting for more than half nearly 25000 metric tons 
that was about six times the level of imports from thailand the 
nearest rival 
meanwhile singapores imports of frozen whole chickens dropped 
14 percent last year reflecting a local preference for live 
poultry imported from malaysia kurz said subsidized shipments of 
frozen whole chickens from the european economic community have 
held us competition to a minimum 
however export opportunities for us suppliers may lie in 
the emerging market for breakfast meats particularly turkey roll 
and turkey meat kurz said 
us shipments of chilled and frozen ducks geese turkeys and 
guinea fowl also have increased and occupied a commanding 
position in the singapore market in 1987 he said 
is there a future for american poultry producers in singapore a 
country less than a fourth the size of rhode island and a 
population of 25 million 
everyone involved in this market from breeders to retailers 
believes that singapores poultry consumption especially chicken 
meat will rise although prices appear to be headed upward 
kurz said 
the price hikes and the conversion to a pigfree environment 
do not deter optimistic forecasts as more fastfood outlets and 
the restaurant trade boost the consumption of chicken he said

limited feed supplies could slow chinas 
ambitious drive to boost livestock and poultry production an 
agriculture department report says 
the current fiveyear plan for increasing the output of meat 18 
percent from 193 million metric tons in 1985 to 2275 million 
metric tons by 1990 is meeting with some success the report by the 
departments foreign agricultural service said thursday 
the limiting factor in chinese livestock and poultry 
production gains will be feed supplies the report said in 
turn feed grain imports will be constrained in the next two to 
three years by chinas ability to earn sufficient foreign exchange 
for these purchases 
china is an important but sometimes erratic market for us 
farmers and the livestock sector is watched closely for signs that 
more grain and feed sales may be developing 
one of the problems cited in the report which was included in 
the october issue of foreign agriculture magazine is this years 
rise in world grain prices caused by tighter supplies resulting 
primarily from the us drought 
should world commodity prices remain high the chinese 
government is likely to squeeze exports of corn and soybeans out of 
the domestic market in order to earn badly needed foreign 
exchange the report said 
in 198586 it said china exported more than 6 million tons of 
corn from its northern provinces while importing 400000 tons into 
the south 
as in the past china will continue to export soybeans for 
foreign exchange and barter with japan the ussr and other 
asian countries the report said

the agriculture department is seeking 
permission from the environmental protection agency to fieldtest a 
genetically engineered bacterium to control a serious disease of 
wheat 
officials said thursday that the test if approved by epa would 
begin next month on a 15acre site at washington state unversitys 
agriculture facility near pullman wash the test would be 
conducted by usda monsanto co and the university 
the test would involve a usdadiscovered strain of a bacterium 
pseudomonas which controls the wheat disease called take all 
the bacterium was genetically altered by monsanto so it can be 
tracked easily in the field 
before the bacterium can be turned into a commercial product 
for use by farmers to control take all we need to know exactly 
what happens when it is released into a field said r james cook 
of the departments agricultural research service 
cook said that among other things scientists need to know 
whether the bacterium spreads into surrounding plants or water or 
if it survives into the following season 
cook and his colleagues at the agencys root disease and 
biological control research laboratory in pullman discovered the 
bacterium strain and conducted seven years of tests to prove its 
ability to control the wheat disease the department said

a government proposal for a voluntary testing 
program for salmonella enteritidis a bacteria responsible for at 
least 11 deaths from grade a table eggs since january 1985 is 
drawing fire from the poultry and egg industries 
im an egg farmer i like my job and i dont want to make 
anybody sick richard mcgrath president of the us egg 
marketers association told a panel hearing comments on the program 
designed to wipe out the national increase in salmonella 
enteritidis 
ken looper of the united egg producers said voluntary programs 
dont work because one state might implement the program and the 
neighboring state would not this creates marketing problems 
another problem he said was onehalf of the hens in a state 
might be tested and these birds could then be reinfected by 
untested birds 
the federal centers for disease control recently reported a 
sixfold increase in the cases of salmonella enteritidis infections 
in humans from 1977 to 1986 said dr robert v tauxe of the 
atlantabased cdc he noted that between january 1985 and may 1987 
more than 2000 cases including 11 deaths were reported 
outbreaks this year in the northeast prompted health officials 
to halt sales of eggs from at least one supplier and the formation 
of a joint task force of the food and drug administration and 
department of agriculture which issued a fourpoint voluntary 
program to reduce contamination fda commissioner dr frank e 
young said 
young and dr kenneth a gilles assistant secretary of 
agriculture for marketing and inspection services conducted 
thursdays hearing on the program 
gilles said that while the regulatory program was distributed 
in a voluntary form federal agencies are prepared to adopt a 
mandatory alternative if the voluntary approach proves 
unsuccessful 
mcgrath and looper were among several industry representatives 
who pushed the government to make mandatory the testing and 
monitoring of egg farms slaughtering of infected laying flocks and 
diverting of any healthy eggs from such flocks to breaking plants 
for pasteurization as dry eggs 
the industry representatives also urged implementation of a 
compliance mechanism research and public education 
looper noted the unprofitability of selling eggs for 
pasteurization and said the usda should use its statutory powers 
to enforce the regulations by seizing and eliminating the infected 
flocks however he said he was not advocating the clause in the 
law which gives the usda the power to jail the noncomplying 
farmers 
shell egg consumption has decreased in the second quarter of 
1988 by 7 percent looper said 
our concern for the public safety and the confidence we need 
from the consumer has prompted us to take extensive action within 
our industry he said noting that one egg association invested 
1 million into research 
egg industry representatives also expressed concern about the 
possible effect of news media coverage of the problem 
young replied were not saying not to eat eggs at all but 
there is a problem at this time 
the most susceptible are the very old the very young those 
ladies who are pregnant and people whose immune systems are 
compromised those people with aids and other acquired immune 
diseases young said 
the bulletins advise highrisk consumers to avoid eating raw 
eggs lightly cooked or runny eggs and food containing raw eggs 
such as homemade caesar salad dressing hollandaise sauce ice 
cream eggnog and mayonnaise commercial forms of these products 
are safe because they are made with pasteurized eggs 
consumers seeking more information on handling eggs safely can 
call usdas tollfree meat and poultry hot line 18005354555 
between 10 am and 4 pm edt washington dc residents are to

the cost of bailing out failed savings 
institutions has risen so high that congress will have to provide 
regulators with more money according to the general accounting 
office 
frederick d wolf director of the finance division of the 
congressional watchdog agency said he now estimates the cost of 
eliminating insolvent sampls at 45 billion to 50 billion up from 
the 26 billion to 36 billion estimated by the agency in may 
private analysts have estimated the cost will hit 80 billion or 
more 
moreover wolf said the federal home loan bank boards revenue 
projections are highly optimistic adding there is a strong 
likelihood they will prove incorrect 
he testified to the house banking committee on thursday as 
debate intensified over whether taxpayer money will be needed to 
bail out the federal savings and loan insurance corp which is 
funded currently by an assessment on the sampl industry 
at this point i would say flat out that congress is going to 
have to do this fslic resources under any conceivable scenario 
will not be adequate he said 
the latest estimate of red ink by the bank board which 
regulates 3000 sampls is 31 billion well within the agencys 42 
billion projection of its revenue over the next 10 years 
bank board chairman m danny wall last week promised to release 
an updated cost estimate after the fiscal year ends sept 30 
a private consultant bert ely of alexandria va told the 
committee that the bank board already has committed itself to spend 
more in aid to insolvent sampls in the form of promissory notes or 
guarantees against loss than it can pay for through the premiums 
collected from healthy institutions 
wolf ely and rep fernand j st germain dri chairman of 
the committee called on the bank board to issue more realistic 
projections 
theres no question that getting it all on the table is the 
first requisite to dealing with the problem until the bank board 
is more willing or able to lay out the problems its going to 
fester wolf said 
st germain said the bank boards shifting tote board is doing 
nothing to enhance confidence 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said we will 
continue to be as we have been forthcoming with the numbers as we 
derive them 
hoyle also said bank board revenue projections are conservative 
because they do not include any return from the agencys ownership 
stake in rescued institutions 
wolf and ely criticized many of the transactions in a spate of 
rescues 13 billion worth over the last month as thin deals 
that bring little new private money to ailing institutions 
merging several insolvent institutions into a larger entity 
which remains thinly capitalized does not necessarily represent a 
final resolution wolf said whether or not such institutions 
can become viable entities without further assistance remains to be 
seen

twentyfive years ago a sunday school 
lesson about forgiveness ended with the blast of a bomb planted by 
a ku klux klansman and four black girls lay dead since then 
birmingham has learned much about forgiveness 
the bombing at the 16th street baptist church sparked outrage 
that helped fuel the 1960s civil rights movement which eventually 
eased the bitter racial divisions in this city speakers noted at a 
memorial service on the anniversary thursday night 
there has been a turnabout in human relations in this city 
which now has an improved image the rev john h cross told a 
racially mixed congregation of 1400 people gathered to remember 
cynthia wesley addie mae collins and carol robertson all 14 and 
denise mcnair 11 
twentyfive years ago the only blacks at city hall were 
elevator operators and janitors now we have richard arrington as 
mayor cross said 
cross was the churchs pastor on sept 15 1963 when the bomb 
planted beneath basement steps exploded after a sunday school 
lesson on the theme of a love that forgives the girls were killed 
as they were preparing to take part in a youth day program 
twentytwo other people were injured 
more than 40 earlier bombings had occurred in birmingham during 
the civil rights struggles of the late 1950s and early 1960s but 
no one was killed in those 
in a service that featured freedom songs of the civil rights 
movement arrington who is in his third fouryear term said the 
torch that we raise tonight is raised by two hands one black and 
one white 
we have the power to transcend that tragic event he said 
we are determined it will have a redeeming quality 
cross told the audience that he has never preached the sermon he 
prepared for the morning of the bombing and doesnt intend to 
he said he had planned to tell young people at the church to 
anchor their lives to the solid rock jesus christ the same 
yesterday today and forever 
a plaque in the church contains pictures of the four girls with 
the inscription may men learn to replace bitterness and violence 
with love and understanding 
all lowerlevel windows of the church now are covered with steel 
mesh a sharp contrast to 1963 when glass shards from the windows 
covered virtually every square foot on the side of the building 
where the bomb exploded 
prior to the memorial service black and white church 
congregations served food to people gathered in kelly ingram park 
a rallying spot for civil rights marches led by the rev martin 
luther king jr in the early 1960s nearby is the site of a civil 
rights museum planned by the city under arringtons impetus 
all visible racial barriers are gone in birmingham which has 
six blacks and three whites on its city council 
the current pastor of the church the rev james e young said 
birmingham has provided spiritual and moral leadership to the 
world for the past quarter century 
a retired automobile mechanic and ku klux klansman robert 
edward chambliss was convicted in 1977 of murdering miss mcnair 
he died in prison after eight years 
miss mcnairs father chris mcnair a former state legislator 
and now a jefferson county commissioner said he still is not 
satisfied although segregation in politics and business has ended 
it bothers him that most churches still are either white or black 
mankind needs the church or the synagogue he said this 
is part of mans inner being if they cant come together at that 
time then how are they going to come together in genuineness at 
any other occasion i have to doubt it

from aruba to zanzibar from australia to 
zaire the 1988 olympic games will be a television event 
pictures of the games will be beamed from seoul to virtually 
every country on the globe and are expected to be seen by an 
estimated 80 percent of the worlds population officials of the 
international telecommunications satellite organization said 
with just about every country participating in the games and 
picking up the feed the summer olympics from seoul will be the 
most watched event in world history said tony trujillo a 
spokesman for intelsat 
intelsat is a nonprofit international consortium whose global 
satellite network will provide pictures of the olympics to all 161 
countries that will be represented at the games in the next two 
weeks and several others not participating 
trujillo said nine of intelsats 15 satellites will be used to 
carry the feeds of hundreds of broadcasting companies and 
organizations back to their home countries where the pictures will 
distributed through domestic networks 
we started about seven years ago planning the international 
coverage of the games shortly after the site for the 88 games was 
announced said arnie meyers intelsats manager of broadcast 
services 
and plans likely will be changing throughout the games as 
broadcasters from countries whose athletes are doing better than 
expected request additional feeds on the satellite network he said 
the last event of such international viewing proportion was the 
1984 summer olympic games in los angeles when intelsat carried 
pictures of the competition on eight satellites to about 150 
countries trujillo said 
technological advances this year will permit a transmission to 
japan carrying the opening and closing ceremonies in high 
definition television which produces superior picture quality and 
sound 
japanese officials plan to use the feed to demonstrate the 
technology called hdtv at locations in about 50 cities throughout 
japan hdtv broadcasts are scheduled to begin in 1990 in that 
country beamed via satellite to small receiving dishes in viewers 
homes 
all of the pictures from the 19day competitions that are sent 
outside south korea will use the intelsat network including the 
pictures sent by nbctv which plans to telecast 179 hours from 
seoul to american viewers 
most of the pictures nbc sends back to the united states will 
come from the networks cameras but a significant portion will 
come from the korean broadcasting system the host broadcasting 
company which will provide the world feed said doug kelly an nbc 
spokesman 
intelsats 115 member countries own and operate the global 
satellite system that is used for international video data and 
voice communications and by some countries for domestic 
communications some 57 other countries including the soviet 
union are nonmember users of the network

the reagan administration claiming credit for 
eliminating or easing thousands of federal regulations over the 
past 7 years has 451 more significant changes it wants before 
leaving office 
but white house officials do not expect a repeat of the flurry 
of new regulatory proposals that sprang from federal agencies in 
the last days of president carters administration in january 1981 
you wont see any midnight regulations i dont think white 
house budget director james c miller iii said thursday 
miller made the comment after unveiling a 603page report to 
congress on the status of rules that federal agencies write and 
enforce for assuring everything from pizzas having enough cheese to 
encouraging pharmaceutical companies to come up with a vaccine for 
aids 
the largest areas of anticipated regulatory activity concern 
environmental and work place matters with 98 of the proposed 
actions in the environmental protection agency and 91 in the labor 
department most of them in the occupational safety and health 
administration 
epa the labor department and the departments of transportation 
and health and human services account for about 60 percent of the 
anticipated regulatory activity this year the report said 
of the 451 actions listed the report by the white house office 
of management and budget 87 have congressionally or courtmandated 
deadlines 
miller and other omb officials could not say how many would cut 
regulatory burdens and how many would increase them 
some of it is deregulatory in the clear sense but that is a 
relatively small part this year said s jay plager the new 
administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs 
at omb 
in an opening statement at the front of the report president 
reagan bragged that he and george bush have weeded out and 
eliminated wasteful unnecessary and intrusive federal 
environmental safety and other regulations costing american 
consumers tens of billions of dollars 
unlike a year ago when the white house report on the same topic 
never mentioned bush reagan this year shared credit with his vice 
president and a task force that bush chaired for eliminating 
unnecessary regulatory costs 
the steady but enormous progress the vice president and i have 
made over the past 7 years to improve the way government regulates 
has been one of our administrations proudest achievements the 
president said 
omb officials quipped thursday that the omission of bushs name 
in last years report probably was an oversight 
david plocher an attorney for omb watch a research and 
advocacy group that tracks the white house budget offices role in 
federal regulations said most of the work by the bushchaired task 
force was accomplished between 1981 and 1983 
it was resurrected in 1987 to give george bush something else 
to put on his resume plocher said but there has been 
virtually no evidence that the resurrected task force has 
accomplished anything he got the title but he actually hasnt done 
the work 
miller acknowledged that the bush task force had been relatively 
inactive until the past year but he said bush has been the key 
player in making the more than 100 agencies that issue and enforce 
regulations carry out reagans policies 
while omb carries a great deal of clout miller said it 
was really the vice president whose clout mattered in getting 
things done getting agencies to turn around and look at regulatory 
matters in ways they hadnt looked at them before

you dont preserve a forest by putting out all 
fires ecologists observe in defending the let it burn policy 
of the national park service 
the forest will keep changing as plant and animal species kept 
down by periodic natural fires establish themselves and youre 
going to culminate in a few species that can outcompete the 
others said jonathan roughgarden professor of biological 
sciences at stanford university 
it must be understood that nothing is preserved by stopping 
burning said roughgarden who was a member of a panel for 
reporters organized by the american association for the advancement 
of science on thursday 
the panel was trying to call attention to ecology the science 
that studies the relationships of organisms with their 
environments todays issue of science the weekly scientific 
journal of the association has a special section on the subject 
the word ecology is not properly a synonym for 
environment roughgarden observed at one point it is not 
something you should be for or against it is simply there 
others on the panel who were quick to point out they were not 
specialists in fire ecology said government agencies should not 
return to the days of trying to put out all fires and the forest 
service was widely using its antifire cartoon symbol of smoky the 
bear 
however they said revisions in the let it burn policy might 
be desirable in light of the burning of half of yellowstone 
national park this summer 
a backlash returning us to smoky the bear would be a larger 
disaster than the fires said henry wilbur professor of zoology 
at duke university 
the worst possible thing that could happen would be to go back 
to a total firesuppression policy said robert v oneill a 
research ecologist at oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee 
fire suppression brings reduced landscape diversity which can 
cause the transmission of disturbances such as fire or a pest 
said oneill the loss of diversity is a brandnew problem a 
new area of research 
there remains a good ecological basis for the plan of 
controlled burning that government agencies follow said 
roughgarden without fire you simply obtain an entirely different 
vegetation type 
though the national park service has been using controlled 
burning in some parks it had not been used in yellowstone

drogi said in an interview there was a better than 50 percent 
chance that union pluralism would be allowed 
it cannot be easy he said it needs some time and then i 
think we will open a process of negotiation 
the government overtures after seven years of deadlock comes 
amid signs that communist authorities are psychologically prepared 
to accept the permanent existence of an organized political 
opposition 
some officially published commentaries have even gone so far as 
to praise the effects of an active opposition movement 
states having a strong political opposition keep developing 
while the socialist states are sinking in crisis said one 
particularly startling commentary in the officially published 
weekly odrozenie 
after struggling without marked success to govern alone the 
ruling polish united workers communist party led by gen wojciech 
jaruzelski is hoping through roundtable talks with walesa to tap 
the energy of the opposition that it crushed in 1981 
but there is a catch whatever formula is devised it must 
somehow guarantee that the communist party keeps the dominant role 
proposals have been floated in the press such as reserving a 
significant minority of parliament seats for the opposition or 
creating a new upper chamber of parliament with limited powers 
which would not have a guaranteed majority of communist deputies 
but it is highly uncertain whether polands skeptical and 
pragmatic opposition would ever accept anything that smacked of 
tokenism or being coopted by the system 
krasucki said the majority of party membership is ready for a 
big compromise in political reform and that he thought 
jaruzelski would bring about the changes 
but a grand old man of the polish opposition movement socialist 
jan jozef lipski said he was skeptical of any speedy promises of 
reform 
the direction of changes will get deeper thats for sure 
he said but it will take much more time 
the governments decision to enter into talks taken in the 
midst of last months strikes and signs that polands downward 
economic spiral is worsening gives the appearance of a country 
coming full circle 
poland was also in dire economic straits in 1980 when strikes 
lifted the then unknown walesa into the role of spokesman for an 
entire societys grievances 
a tide of social unrest forced authorities then to deal with 
walesa but over the next 15 months it was confrontation not 
acceptance that characterized government actions toward the union 
the december 1981 martial law crackdown was merely the final blow 
outlawing solidarity and detaining thousands of its supporters 
only exacerbated the governments problems the economy continued 
to falter and the government had little domestic support to draw 
upon when mounting foreign debt forced it into unpopular austerity 
measures 
solidarity in turn has been frustrated by its outlaw status 
which has hampered its effectiveness as a trade union by subjecting 
members to legal reprisals and preventing them from working openly 
to organize factories 
both sides tired and fed up with the status quo would like to 
see a change 
possible outlines of a compromise emerged in the first interview 
with walesa published in the official polish press since the 
martial law crackdown 
since authorities will not totally abandon the official trade 
unions set up after solidarity a major question is how both 
solidarity and those unions can exist in the same workplaces 
speaking to the monthly konfrontacje walesa cited the example 
of west germany where multiple unions coexist in a single factory 
and negotiate jointly with management through elected workers 
councils

textilestate lawmakers racing to gain 
approval of their embattled importlimiting bill before congress 
adjourns confess anxiety over fresh delays being threatened in the 
house 
they could outdistance us we just dont have that much time 
in this congress sen ernest f hollings dsc said thursday 
after the senate approved the bill 5936 in a rerun of action it 
took last week 
designed to protect american industry from foreign competition 
the bill won approval last week only to remain bottled up in the 
senate when opponents seized on a technicality to delay it 
thursdays vote freed the bill from that snarl and sent it to 
the house 
the bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels 
and limit growth to 1 percent annually starting next year it would 
hold nonrubber footwear imports to 1987 levels and ban further 
increases in foreign producers share of the us market 
congress has been fighting over new import curbs for three 
years with sponsors saying they are needed to save both american 
jobs and an industry that is vital to the nations defense critics 
concede apparel companies have problems but say the textile 
industry is flourishing 
indeed opponents credit stepped up competition from overseas 
with prodding the textile industry to modernize they attribute a 
wave of layoffs since the early 1980s to increased automation 
president reagan vetoed an earlier version of the bill in 1985 
saying it would narrow consumer choices and cost more jobs than it 
would save 
the current version is moving slowly forward amid threats of 
another presidential veto 
the presidents going to veto it fortunately and i hope that 
we have the votes to sustain the veto sen bob packwood rore 
told the senate america cannot turn its back on the world its 
going to be part of it and frankly id rather participate in 
it 
textile forces had hoped that the house would give swift 
approval to the four changes that the senate made since the house 
passed the bill a year ago 
but the house ways and means committee voted wednesday to 
negotiate the differences in a housesenate conference committee 
a conference just delays the time hollings complained to 
reporters thursday after the senates action 
the ways and means action wednesday appeared to dash textile 
supporters hopes that the senate changes would get a stamp of 
approval and a quick trip to the white house but house speaker jim 
wright dtexas said it was not certain the measure would go to a 
conference committee 
the president can prevent a bill from becoming law when congress 
is not in session merely by not signing it this is called a pocket 
veto textile forces are trying to avoid one saying it would lower 
the political price paid by the administration with elections 
coming by keeping the spotlight off the issue 
the house and senate have set an adjournment target date of oct 
5 
avoiding a pocket veto and forcing reagan to actually use his 
veto pen also just could give textile forces a chance to try for an 
override and pass the measure into law over the presidents 
objections 
the bill has not demonstrated that it can gain the twothirds 
support needed for an override but hollings said that he could 
produce enough votes in the senate if it came to a showdown 
there are only four differences between the house and senate 
versions 
the house bill would freeze imports at 1986 levels and textile 
forces already have said they are prepared to change that to the 
1987 levels specified in the senate version 
a provision of the house bill would set up a oneyear pilot 
program under which the government would auction off import 
licenses to us importing firms 
to muster farm support the senate attached a provision that 
would guarantee textileexporting nations greater quotas in the 
us market if they increased their purchases of american farm 
goods 
the senate bill would establish a special quota for imported 
silk neckties the house version has no such provision

a harvard scientist wanting to know why birds have 
wishbones believes he has found the answer 
the wishbone turns out to be a spring said farish a 
jenkins of harvards biology department 
in a report published today in the journal science jenkins 
described a new way of studying the inner mechanics of birds in 
flight by taking movies of them with xray cameras and he detailed 
his first discovery with this tool the function of the wishbone 
at the university of pittsburgh researcher robert raikow was as 
impressed by the possibilities of xray movies as he was by their 
initial revelation 
its a pioneering new method of studying birds he said 
we can actually see the movement of the skeletal elements during 
flight thats pretty exciting 
jenkins and two colleagues kenneth p dial of harvard and 
george e goslow jr of northern arizona university took xray 
films of starlings flying in place against 2045 mph winds in a 
wind tunnel 
the movies allowed the scientist to look at the birds insides 
and see how the various bones work during flight 
until now researchers have tried to figure out such functions 
by looking at the skeletons of dead birds or the outsides of live 
ones 
in their report the researchers described the way the wishbone 
bends each time a bird flaps its wings at rest the upper ends of 
the starlings wishbone are 11 or 12 millimeters apart but when 
the wings descend that distance stretches to 18 to 20 millimeters 
just why it bends this way is not clear jenkins said the spring 
doesnt seem to help the bird beat its wings more efficiently 
instead he theorized that it helps the bird breathe in more air 
during flight so it can burn the extra energy it needs to stay 
aloft 
when a bird breathes air flows first into air sacs scattered 
throughout its body and then into its lungs among these sacs is 
one between the two arms of the wishbone 
the researchers speculate that as the bird beats its wings 
downward the wishbone spreads apart opening the air sac so it 
fills with air then on the upswing the birds sternum squeezes 
the air out again 
what we suspect is that there is an alternating bellows 
mechanism drawing air in and out of the sac and possibly in and out 
of the lung said jenkins 
not all birds have wishbones hummingbirds and some parrots are 
among the exceptions but jenkins believes that the starlings 
wishbone spring is typical of most feathered creatures including 
the turkey 
until now scientists had assumed that the bone was simply a 
strut between the birds shoulders however jenkins conceded that 
the wishbones springiness is obvious to thanksgiving day wish 
makers 
this is well known to everybody in the world he said 
its only scientists who discover the obvious

creditrepair companies little known before 
the 1980s have increasingly become the target of law enforcement 
agencies because of their deceptive practices say federal 
officials 
the companies promise to help remove derogatory information from 
individuals credit files and charge as much as 2000 for the 
service 
ms l jean noonan an official in the federal trade 
commissions bureau of consumer protection told a house 
subcommittee thursday it appears that a substantial segment of 
the industry engages in deceptive advertising and sales practices 
kenneth p walton inspectordeputy assistant director of the 
fbis criminal investiative division told the panel of a recent 
case involving creditrite inc of palmyra nj which defrauded at 
least 9000 consumers of 23 million in a creditrepair scheme in 
15 states and the district of columbia 
the investigation resulted in three convictions with the 
founderpresident james t gray being sentenced to seven years in 
prison jeffrey roberts former director of franchising receiving 
a prison sentence of 15 months and david gray creditrepair 
manager receiving three years probation 
the clinics take advantage of the law that gives consumers the 
right to challenge the information about them that credit bureaus 
have on file this provision requires a credit bureau to verify the 
information upon request generally within 30 days if verification 
is not completed on time the disputed data must be deleted 
under the law individuals who feel their credit records have 
inaccuracies can go directly to a local credit bureau and ask that 
they be corrected however accurate derogatory information can 
remain as part of an individuals credit history for seven years 
or in the case of a bankruptcy for 10 years 
walter r kurth president of associated credit bureaus inc a 
trade association representing over 1200 consumer credit bureaus 
said the wrong being committed by credit clinics is the promise 
held out to intimidated consumers that by some magic a credit 
clinic can accomplish things that the consumer cannot accomplish 
and that false promises rooted in half truths will cost the 
consumer several hundred dollars or more 
the illness of a poor credit history can only be cured by time 
and careful reconstruction of a consumers payment history with 
creditors in the future kurth told the house banking consumer 
affairs subcommittee 
the subcommittee is considering legislation introduced by 
chairman frank annunzio dill which would restrict the practices 
of creditrepair clinics

the nations first college croquet 
court will be dedicated next week to the professor who raised 
16000 to build it despite what he described as smith colleges 
embarrassment by the playing field 
my level of enthusiasm for the dedication ceremony is not 
particularly high by this time said richard b young a 
literature professor emeritus the playing court has been around 
for months 
the 105by84foot manicured lawn is the first regulation 
croquet court on an american college campus it was built last year 
with donations from alumnae and friends 
college president mary maples dunn will shoot the first wicket 
at the sept 24 ceremony naming the court after young smiths team 
will give a demonstration of the sport which evokes images of 
gentry in white dress 
the fields first tournament opened to little fanfare last april 
at the 2000student school and young said at the time that the 
school was embarrassed by the court 
im told that this court promotes the idea that smith is 
elitist he said if it werent theyd be out of business 
the dedication ceremony planned for that tournament was 
postponed because dunn was out of town college spokeswoman debra 
bradley said 
she said thursday that the ceremony was rescheduled for 
september because dunn wanted the dedication to coincide with a 
tournament so people could see the field being used the ceremony 
kicks off a weekend tournament involving new england collegiate 
croquet association teams 
the college has denied that the dedication delay had any 
connection to a survey that found many students and staff consider 
the school elitist 
young 66 who lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to 
his other foot during world war ii had given up on sports until he 
discovered croquet and founded the smith team 
he said he was of course extremely pleased by the naming of 
the field but added the timing doesnt galvanize me

television commercials still were inviting 
viewers to come back to jamaica on tuesday when a madison 
avenue advertising executive managed to get a telex from kingston 
to his home office 
emergency conditions total devastation cancel all tv and 
print advertising appeal as a national disaster 
account supervisor edward daleys dramatic cable to young amp 
rubicam inc was one of the first attempts by the tourism industry 
to deal with the devastation wrought by hurricane gilbert the 
centurys strongest storm 
there were few attempts at boosterism thursday as tourism 
officials attempted to assess the damage and help stranded tourists 
get home 
travel agents tour operators and airline spokesmen said they 
were offering rebookings or refunds to anyone who had booked trips 
for this week or this weekend for trips farther into the future 
policies varied 
a surprising number of tourists did not want to reschedule 
its amazing people think the storm just came and went and 
not much really happened said sisi gulmez president of 
magnatours inc which specializes in mexicos cancun our future 
bookings may have slowed down but they have not stopped by any 
means 
in beverly hills calif travel agency employee bradley jones 
said he was holding his reservations for cancun this tuesday at 
least for now 
im thinking of just landing and see what its like jones 
said i was thinking of doing some camping anyway 
despite the proliferation of television and newspaper reports 
from jamaica tourism officials said the island remained largely 
cut off from the outside world 
we have been answering questions but its very perplexing for 
us the frustration because we dont know whats going on said 
louise munsch director of operations and reservations for sunburst 
holidays one of the major bookers of trips to jamaica 
sunburst was offering refunds to anyone who had bookings for the 
next 10 days munsch said most customers with later bookings seemed 
to be waiting for more information before deciding whether to 
cancel 
still she said id be lying to you if i said i wasnt 
concerned 
most of the damage so far was in jamaica the cayman islands and 
mexicos yucatan peninsula raising the possibility that other 
caribbean resorts could benefit from the spillover 
on thursday for example two cruise ships docked unexpectedly 
in puerto ricos san juan harbor but lauren yankus a spokeswoman 
for puerto rico tourist co said the organization did not want to 
seem to encourage such detours for fear of seeming to take 
advantage of others misery 
one consolation was that tourism is relatively light in 
september largely because people dont like to visit the islands 
during hurricane season said jack bloch owner of jbs world 
travel consultants in new york 
commercial flights out of jamaica resumed thursday on a limited 
basis only daytime flights were possible because electricity was 
not fully restored at either airport said dinaz boga a 
spokeswoman for air jamaica in new york 
there were plans for about seven flights today she said 
in mexico mexicana airlines spokeswoman ruth shari reported 
late thursday she had received word there was no major damage to 
hotels 
club med inc had planes standing by waiting to carry home 
guests from its cancun resort as soon as airports reopened said 
jeanluc oizanchapon the chief operating officer 
ms shari said there was a chance the airport in merida about 
four hours by car from cancun could open by today 
hurricane gilbert did not seem to upset continental airlines 
which chose wednesday to announce its first expansion into the 
caribbean including daily flights to jamaica the service begins 
dec 16 
one man still stranded in jamaica on thursday was daley the ad 
man the roof blew off daleys hotel monday night and the phones 
were dead but associates at young amp rubicam said he managed to 
find a japanese employee of the mitsui amp co trading company who 
cabled his message here tuesday 
after taking care of business daley wrote tell family father 
is ok home this weekend hope

the head of the environmental protection 
agency said he wont issue any lastminute midnight regulations 
as the reagan administration comes to a close 
epa administrator lee m thomas in remarks to reporters 
thursday named only four major regulations he would try to 
complete before leaving office in january 
thomas said he also would try to nail down arrangements for an 
international conference in the next administration to strengthen a 
treaty limiting chlorofluorocarbon emissions 
im trying to make decisions that are logical and natural not 
speeding it up or slowing it down thomas said 
the four major regulations he said he would press for are 
new controls on gasoline volatility 
requiring larger gasoline vapor recovery systems on cars 
eventually banning the manufacture or import of asbestos and 
asbestos products 
revising the major regulation governing the superfund toxic 
waste cleanup program 
thomas said he was hoping to see the approval of several pieces 
of legislation including a revision of the clean air act setting 
new deadlines for cities to comply with federal clean air standards 
he also held out hope for these other legislative actions 
a revision of federal pesticide laws setting deadlines for the 
agency to review old chemicals and abolishing the requirement that 
the agency pay for inventories of banned products 
a bill providing 10 million to aid state programs dealing with 
radon pollution in the home 
a bill clarifying the agencys authority over medical waste 
these are the natural kinds of things for me to complete 
thomas said 
in 1981 the incoming reagan administration accused douglas 
costle epa administrator for president carter as well as heads of 
other agencies of hastily putting out regulations and making other 
decisions to preempt what the new administration could do 
reagans appointees revoked several of those actions 
were not going to wield the signature machine all night long 
on jan 19 thomas said

as vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen took 
the stage carrying michael dukakis message for the south the 
event resembled a reunion for democrats who once worked together 
and won the white house 
the texas senator was flanked by tennessees top elected 
officials gov ned ray mcwherter and sens albert gore and james 
sasser the audience was filled with cheering local sheriffs 
school board members and party activists 
i know whats happened the last two presidential elections 
bentsen told the shelby county democratic party fundraiser 
thursday night youve seen some of our democratic friends go 
into that voting booth pull that curtain and vote for ronald 
reagan 
now we understand that and we respect that he said 
pausing before the punch line but now were saying democrats 
who voted for reagan welcome home welcome back to our party 
the crowd roared 
the dukakis campaign knows that bentsen can repeat that scene in 
the south and southwest and it can only hope that the effort will 
help score a win on nov 8 for the democratic ticket 
tad devine who watches the polls and directs the vice 
presidential campaign from dukakisbentsen headquarters in boston 
says bentsen is an effective tool for convincing conservative 
democrats they can vote for the massachusetts governor 
i expect that hell continue to sort of credential governor 
dukakis before these audiences devine said in a telephone 
interview everywhere hes been so far hes been very well 
received in terms of the political impact including extensive 
coverage and interviews with the local press 
but there are doubts outside the campaign 
credentialing is an academic approach to saying the fella 
cant stand on his own two feet said claibourne darden an 
atlantabased pollster and consultant whose clients include sen 
sam nunn dga its like getting a phd because you cant get a 
job 
while its smart for bentsen to focus on the south and southwest 
you fish where the fish bite he said the vice presidential 
candidate can only open the door for the presidential candidate to 
walk through 
the question is how capable is michael dukakis at walking 
through these doors in the south the answer so far is not so 
good darden said in a telephone interview 
larry harrington the dukakisbentsen campaigns southern 
regional director said the evidence was to the contrary in the 
memphis hotel ballroom he pointed out local officials who wouldnt 
be caught near the two previous democratic tickets 
they call them leaders but really they tend to follow the 
voters he said theyre still moving toward the ticket 
theyre with the ticket 
but harrington acknowledged that bentsens easy popularity with 
southern democrats who voted for reagan wasnt enough 
youre definitely going to see dukakis follow up with more 
southern trips himself he said citing the governors previous 
southern swings i dont think he bentsen closes the deal 
harrington declined to say which southern states the democrats 
believe they are capable of winning but bentsens schedule this 
week follows the scenario the campaign acknowledges privately 
besides his native texas which is a neckandneck battle 
bentsen was hunting for votes in louisiana tennessee north 
carolina and florida he was in southern california just last 
weekend 
lance tarrance a houstonbased political consultant for the 
gop said oklahoma arkansas and louisiana also were states where 
bentsen helps the democratic ticket 
but lets be frank its california and texas with their 
47 and 29 electoral votes the democrats were after tarrance said 
and although bentsen had a lot of pride tied up in the texas 
race california is the one that really hurts the republicans if 
it goes to the democrats he said bentsen helped in southern 
california in areas where dukakis was weak he said 
the deep south especially states such as alabama south 
carolina and mississippi was very unlikely to produce a win for 
the democrats 
the south because of the reagan presidency is very strong for 
bush tarrance said and bentsens strength was more to the west 
in oilproducing areas 
harrington said it was too early to write off any state 
although he said obviously some were tougher for the democrats than 
others 
for cautious southerners bushs choice for his running mate 
dan quayle presented problems for the gop and an opening for 
bentsen and dukakis he said 
you can say president quayle in a room full of people and 
you get a combination of laughter and look of fear he said 
every so often the vice president tragically has to take that 
office 
darden said that while quayle was unquestionably not as 
palatable a vice presidential candidate to southerners as bentsen 
he doubted the texans presence was having a major impact he said 
people also tended to overestimate the impact of having 
locallyelected officials back the ticket 
a lot of people overplay the importance of the 
establishment he said bentsen appeals to that upper middle 
class southern white and its hard to peel off that vote from a 
republican 
devine said he expected bentsen to continue to focus on texas 
and the south and southwest 
hes not going to just campaign in the south however he 
said trips elsewhere reinforce his standing as a national 
candidate and that plays well in texas and elsewhere he said

as tom foley said it was just a simple 
14course picnic supper as president reagan played host for a 
congressional barbecue laced with tart lyrics by a troupe of former 
capitol hill aides 
foley the democrat from washington state who is house majority 
leader traded pleasantries with reagan at the conclusion of the 
annual event on the white house lawn thursday which will be the 
last for the president and first lady nancy reagan 
as lawmakers and administration officials dined on food from 
four tents giving them their choice of seafood cajun western or 
mexican cuisine entertainnment was provided by the capitol steps 
a group formed six years ago at a capitol christmas party 
the reagans joined in the applause as the steps aimed their 
satire both at the reagan administration and vice president george 
bush 
the president laughed heartily for instance as a member of the 
troupe impersonating the republican presidential nominee who has 
been charting an increasingly independent course sang 
i sorta kinda remotely 
distantly wanna be like you 
in another skit a singer representing bush sang to the tune of 
september song 
try to remember 
that date in september 
the day japan 
attacked pearl harbor 
the audience erupted in laughter at the reference to bushs 
speech at an american legion convention in louisville on sept 7 
in which he said that that day instead of dec 7 was the 
anniversary of the attack that plunged the united states into world 
war ii 
democratic nominee michael s dukakis did not get off scot free 
either as the singers hymned a presidential campaign pitting the 
duke of dullness against sir george of kennebunkport 
reagan even burst into laughter at what was probably the 
harshest satire of the evening one in which he was represented as 
musing upon his place in history and intoning 
well 
dont know much about history 
dont know much about geography 
dont know much about world war ii 
dont know much about who fought who 
but i know it followed world war i 
if we only fought in the wars we won 
what a wonderful world this would be 
in his concluding remarks the president said i want to thank 
the capitol steps for showing such mercy now youre all under 
arrest 
noting that it would be the last such affair he would host the 
president said after 6 oclock we all take off the cleats and 
come together as friends and colleagues 
foley told the president unanimously we wish you and mrs 
reagan thanks first of all for your many courtesies and secondly 
as you go in not to a retirement but a different part of your life 
in which i know youll be concerned as you have been for the future 
of this country and for its role in the world the best of every 
happiness success and satisfaction

the first american tourists back from jamaica since 
it was overrun by hurricane gilbert were thankful to escape though 
they conceded they got out relatively unscathed 
the tourists were much more fortunate than most of the 
jamaicans charles mckenney said thursday after clearing customs 
at miami international airport 
there are some people there who havent had food or water for 
several days but most hotels took care of their guests 
the worst part was not being able to contact anyone to let 
them know how you were said the new smyrna beach residents 
wife joanna 
with their luggage passengers arriving here brought tales of 
devastation in the villages and inconveniences in the resorts 
there were no lights no running water said eileen veskey 
of detroit who stayed in her 14thfloor montego bay hotel room as 
the hurricane blew through the island monday 
we were going to the pools for water to flush the toilets 
but tourists who arrived here thursday on an eastern airlines 
flight said few hotels or resorts were without some drinking water 
or food 
as the miamibound plane lifted off the montego bay runway 
cheers rang out and when it landed here tourists were still 
celebrating 
were home said dr paulette roy 65 of new york city 
oh yes were very happy to be back 
gilbert one of the centurys strongest hurricanes passed over 
jamaica with 175mph winds that destroyed homes and farms and cut 
off electricity and communication throughout the island where at 
least 26 people were killed the montego bay airport reopened 
thursday 
the island is still in pretty bad shape said jim cullipher 
one of 44 palm beach county travel agents who had been trapped in 
montego bay by the storm it seems we wont be sending people to 
jamaica for a while 
but in the cayman islands w norman bodden the tourism 
minister said visitors can begin returning to the threeisland 
chain that was spared serious damage from gilbert resorts and most 
of the homes on the islands received only minor damage he said 
things should be back to almost normal for visitors by monday

federal emergency planners say theyve moved 
into high gear in preparing to help remedy whatever damage is 
inflicted on south texas by hurricane gilbert 
trucks equipment and personnel were readied thursday for quick 
dispatch to texas as gilbert with maximum sustained winds of 120 
mph marched on across the gulf of mexico 
we are bringing every resource we have up to maximum 
operational capability in preparedness of relocating and mitigating 
this problem said grant c peterson in charge of the natural 
disaster program at the federal emergency management agency 
the pentagon said aircraft at naval air stations all along the 
texas coastline were dispatched to a civilian airport in midland 
sheppard air force base and biggs army airfield all in texas 
navy personnel and dependents were sent to lackland air force 
base 130 miles inland 
naval ships in the gulf of mexico were sent out to sea to avoid 
the storm 
army maj gen jd smith said procedures were streamlined to 
ensure this is not a bureaucratic slowmoving turtle 
the pentagon agreed to dispatch active duty military personnel 
to back up the texas national guard if necessary 
i think it is fair to say that we recognize that we face the 
greatest weather threat that we have ever faced in our part of the 
country we want to be certain our preparation is up to the 
challenge said sen phil gramm rtexas 
peterson and gramm said paperwork had already been prepared to 
allow president reagan to almost immediately issue a disaster 
declaration and set relief efforts in motion cutting through the 
five to seven days usually needed 
peterson said federal agencies would dispatch spanishspeaking 
personnel and spanishlanguage forms and pamphlets to help 
communication with the sizeable hispanic population along the coast 
the american red cross said it also had begun sending emergency 
supplies to four hurricane watch districts at several texas 
cities 
the red cross said thousands of blankets cots comfort kits and 
cleanup kits were on their way to corpus christi harlingen 
houston and beaumont texas in addition volunteers and staff 
members were sent to san antonio texas and birmingham ala 
staging areas for deployment after the storm hits

president reagan is expected to sign a bill to 
modernize the nations spy satellite network as part of 
intelligence agency activities over the coming year 
precise provisions of the measure which was approved by 
congress on thursday have not been revealed 
the senate approved by voice vote a compromise measure which the 
house had passed a day earlier 
the senate intelligence committee initiated the major 
modernization program for electronic spying after concluding that 
us photo and eavesdropping satellites are growing outmoded the 
nations spy capabilities in space have not been substantially 
updated in a decade 
in reviewing how well the united states could verify soviet 
compliance with the new intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf 
treaty the panel found that monitoring technology would be 
inadequate if the superpowers reach later agreement on deep cuts in 
longrange nuclear weapons 
a compromise was reached with the reagan administration on the 
amount of money needed for the program but it was uncertain 
whether congress will appropriate the funds 
that issue is tied up in a dispute over a separate pentagon 
appropriations bill 
the house appropriations committee opposes the initiative 
saying it has been too hastily conceived and would not 
substantially enhance us treatymonitoring ability 
the exact amounts for the spy satellite program and the overall 
intelligence budget are secret but total spending on us 
intelligence programs reportedly is approximately 25 billion 
nearly all of the money is hidden in the pentagons budget 
among other provisions in the intelligence bill 
stronger language prohibiting the government from aiding 
nicaraguas contra rebels unless specifically authorized by 
congress the issue became controversial during the irancontra 
affair when the reagan administration insisted prohibitions on 
intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did not extend to the 
presidents national security council staff the new legislation 
bars any entity of the government from unauthoried aid to the 
contras which would include the nsc 
a requirement that the central intelligence agency report to 
congress about the activities of the agencys internal inspector 
general who investigates allegations of wrongdoing the provision 
also would require the cia director to tell congressional overseers 
any time he bars the inspector general from undertaking a specific 
investigation 
the only dollar amounts mentioned in the unclassified version of 
the intelligence bill were a 237 million authorization for the 
244member intelligence community staff which serves the cia 
director in his role of coordinator of all government intelligence 
activities 151 million for fbi counterintelligence activities in 
keeping tabs on soviet inspectors at us weapons sites under the 
inf treaty and 1445 million for the cias retirement and 
disability fund

they were told to bring their own 
food drinks and blankets but warned to leave their pets booze 
and guns at home and they did 
as hurricane gilbert perhaps the mostfeared storm of its kind 
approached the texas coast residents fled their homes taking 
bedrolls and food supplies to red cross shelters on higher ground 
in this southernmost texas city where the eye of gilbert was 
predicted to pass sometime this evening 750 people filled the 
civic auditorium to its capacity within four hours while hundreds 
of others crowded into schools 
for some their flight to the shelters was reminiscent of 
hurricane beulah which struck brownsville in 1980 and hurricane 
allen which landed north of brownsville the same year 
we brought food water some milk but my husband forgot the 
stereo and all our medicine but i think we will be all right 
said 77yearold maria cardenas a diabetic in a wheelchair 
families staked out perimeters on the floor of the civic center 
placing blankets sheets and pillows on the floor next to bags of 
food and ice chests filled with meats and soft drinks 
some children brought their plastic toys and some brought their 
teddy bears while others turned on their small radios and tuned in 
to news of the storm 
most of the people who come here or to other shelters in the 
rio grande valley are those who dont have transportation to go 
north said ersel lantz head of the red cross effort at the 
civic center 
we have all kinds of people here from those that need 
pampers to those that need wheelchairs he said 
frank sanchez 19 said he boarded up the home of mother and 
grandparents in nearby olmito and drove them to the civic center 
we just decided this was the best place to be because of all 
the predictions of damage it could cause sanchez said 
maria elena silva 34 brought her children to the shelter 
because she feared staying in her secondstory apartment 
we know that there might be an emergency and we dont have a 
car and we knew we could come here where there are a lot of people 
and if something happened we knew we could get something if we 
needed it ms silva said 
ricky saldierna 7 said would rather be at home 
i think this hurricane is very bad because it could hurt 
somebody especially some kids like me he said i wish we were 
in school now and i wish we were back in our own house

only one opposition candidate was elected 
earlier this month but two of the losers will be appointed to join 
him in parliament under a controversial measure designed to ensure 
opposing voices are heard 
the measure whereby the two members will get 
nonconstituency seats was introduced before the last polls in 
1984 by amending the constitution to create limited opposition 
after the peoples action party won every seat in the four previous 
general elections 
the pap has been in power since 1959 under prime minister lee 
kuan yew 
lee said that in two years of cabinet discussion such 
alternatives as proportional representation and a second chamber in 
parliament were considered and rejected as unsuitable for this 
island republic of 26 million people 
opposition politicians condemned the new measure as a means of 
perpetuating pap rule 
chaim see tong of the singapore democratic party was the only 
opposition candidate to win at the polls on sept 3 the pap took 
80 of 81 seats 11 of them unopposed and 646 percent of the 
valid votes cast 
chaim who was first elected in 1984 repeated his rejection of 
nonconstituency seats sunday 
according to the measure the seats are offered to the three 
best performers among the opposition losers if one or two 
opposition candidates manage to win at the polls as chaim did 
extra seats are added up to a total of three 
those appointed must have polled at least 15 percent of the vote 
in their constituencies and must belong to a political party 
they enjoy most of the rights and privileges of the other 81 
parliament members and can speak on any issue but they cannot vote 
on noconfidence motions proposals to amend the constitution or 
bills to supply funds to the government or tax money from the 
people they represent no constituency 
opposition parties rejected the one appointment offered after 
the 1984 election when chaim and workers party leader jb 
jeyaretnam were voted into parliament 
jeyaretnam denounced the measure then as a ruse to try to keep 
the electorate thinking of the pap as the only government 
providing for everything including opposition mps 
jeyaretnam still heads the workers party but was ousted from 
parliament and disqualified for five years from 1986 for allegedly 
falsifying party records 
after a week of heated intraparty debate jeyaretnam announced 
saturday that two of its losers would accept the offer to enter 
parliament if he had said no seats would have been offered to the 
next two highestpolling losers 
jeyaretnam said his party remained opposed to the concept of 
nonconstituency seats and its acceptance of them should not be 
regarded as a precedent for the partys decision in future cases 
the workers party will be represented by lawyer francis seow 
and a physician lee siew choh 
seow 59 a former solicitor general and president of the law 
society is a newcomer to party politics and was widely expected to 
run as an independent 
he was released on july 16 after 72 days in jail under the 
countrys internal security act which permits detention without 
trial the government alleged that seow conspired with us 
diplomats to increase the parliamentary opposition to the 
government 
however he has since been accused of income tax evasion and 
faces trial in december if convicted seow would lose his 
parliament seat

a yearandahalf after his death andy warhol 
has sprung another surprise hundreds of diamonds sapphires and 
other jewelry worth 12 million and found hidden in a file cabinet 
curators uncovered the secret cache at the artists manhattan 
townhouse sothebys announced thursday 
the value of the jewelry was put at 12 million but as last 
springs auction proved anything associated with warhol is likely 
to sell for far more than its book value 
sothebys said two curators were moving file cabinets at the 
townhouse in june when they discovered the jewels stashed in 
falsebottom drawers 
the find included hundreds of diamonds dozens of sapphires and 
a 300carat emerald sothebys said there also were 96 watches by 
such makers as patek philippe rolex and cartier 
the jewelry will be auctioned dec 4 with proceeds going to the 
andy warhol foundation 
at the earlier auction jewelry that had been valued at 
approximately 500000 brought in 19 million as a frenzy of 
warholmania sent prices of his art and belongings soaring 
the flat file cabinets with the jewels had been used by warhol 
to store unframed drawings and prints they had been examined 
before last springs auction but no one noticed the hollow 
bottoms sothebys spokesman matthew weigman said 
the curators discovered the false bottoms only after they 
removed the bottom drawers to lighten the cabinets before moving 
them he said 
warhol died in february 1987 at age 58

hurricane gilberts growth from a harmless low 
pressure zone off africa to a ferocious killer in the gulf of 
mexico was fueled by a combination of heat moisture and wind that 
baffles forecasters 
its a matter of getting everything together in the right 
place in the right time gil clark of the national hurricane 
center said thursday it doesnt happen very often how it 
develops we dont know 
gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters sept 3 as a 
dry low pressure trough moving west out of africa 
we get 50 or 60 of these off africa every summer about one of 
six develop said clark 
by sept 8 the system became a depression it reached tropical 
storm status by saturday and a hurricane sunday 
a tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling 
when sustained winds reach 39 mph the system becomes a named 
tropical storm it reaches hurricane status when sustained winds 
hit 74 mph 
why gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems 
didnt is a mystery more or less said university of miami 
meteorology professor rainer bleck 
the first part of the summer we were biting our nails 
wondering why these other disturbances didnt develop he said 
thursday thats something meteorologists would like to know more 
about 
but the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once 
development begins and they know that development is sparked when 
winds converge and that growth is affected by time and place 
if that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in 
the lower atmosphere the bottom 10000 feet or so this 
convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation bleck 
said 
if clouds form the heat of condensation in the clouds 
occasionally provides positive feedback to the convergence 
pattern that strengthens it he said adding that storms can 
begin budding only off the equator because of the earths rotation 
eventually a vortex is created 
any time you contract an air mass they will start spinning 
thats what makes the tornadoes hurricanes and blizzards those 
winter storms bleck said 
hurricanes are useful to the climate machine their primary 
role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere 
he said the sun puts energy into the water the top of the 
oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere that has to be 
distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere 
when the depression that would become gilbert neared barbados 
warm atlantic waters nurtured it 
this time of year in the northwest caribbean is best for 
development clark said if you get a storm in this area in 
september when the waters warmest it can just explode this is 
where camille formed and exploded referring to the 1969 storm 
that slammed into the gulf coast 
it is an exciting thing to watch if youre on the beach 
watching the storm surge its a different story he said 
the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on 
record in terms of barometric pressure measured at 2613 inches 
tuesday night that broke the 2635 inches of the 1935 hurricane 
that devastated the florida keys

prime minister edward seaga ordered 
police to ensure that gasoline stations and stores open today after 
hurricane gilbert pounded the island killing at least 26 people 
and leaving 500000 homeless 
seaga declared much of the island a disaster area thursday night 
and invoked special emergency powers to push forward with an 
enormous cleanup effort the powers allow the government to 
requisition private vehicles and heavy equipment to distribute 
vital supplies to the hardest hit areas 
the purpose of this period of public emergency is to ensure 
the restoration of normality as quickly as possible in the most 
affected areas seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast 
gilbert pounded into jamaicas east coast monday its 145 mph 
winds smashing the length of the island severely damaging or 
destroying 80 percent of the countrys 500000 homes seaga 
estimated damage at 8 billion and officials estimated the death 
toll could rise when they regain communications with the interior 
five people were reported killed in the dominican republic and 
10 in haiti where the military government declared its own state 
of emergency on the southern peninsula 
the disaster area contains more than 1 million of this caribbean 
island nations 23 million people and embraces four of jamaicas 
14 parishes or counties on the badly hit east coast kingston 
st andrew st catherine and st thomas 
seaga also authorized the police to see that gasoline stations 
and stores selling food hardware drugs and fuel were opened for 
business by 8 am today 
even before seagas action people were on the move cleaning up 
the damage telephone crews replaced snapped utility poles and set 
up hundreds more that had lain toppled alongside or across just 
about every street in kingston the capital 
phone service was reestablished by midmorning in the kingston 
area though lines destroyed in the islands eastern region were 
expected to take months to replace 
the jamaican defense force police firefighters and rescue 
crews were joined by thousands of volunteers in clearing streets 
and sidewalks of debris trees rocks glass shards bricks 
pieces of smashed furniture 
hundreds of foreign tourists stranded on the island by gilbert 
filled kingstons battered norman manley airport as commercial 
flights resumed at montego bay on the islands north side the 
international airport also resumed service 
the prime minister appeared to acknowledge the volunteer spirit 
saying i expect full cooperation from the public so that none of 
the emergency powers will have to be used with full cooperation i 
expect that the period of public emergency will be brief 
seaga said the governments top priorities are to provide 
shelter for the homeless and assure adequate food supplies 
few downtown kingston buildings escaped unscathed the national 
gallerys windows were blown out exposing paintings to passersby 
on the street 
people are trying to do what they can do said kingston taxi 
driver samuel alice theyre trying to get some food and trying 
to get some shelter 
at the pegasus one of kingstons luxury hotels workers fished 
deck chairs and tables from a swimming pool while another crew 
cleared the smashed remnants of its mammoth satellite dish 
nearby two regulars determined to resume their daily routine 
cleared away the blownout roof of the hotel tennis clubhouse and 
played three quick sets 
with electricity still out thursday night stranded tourists in 
kingston sat in muggy candlelit bars sipping warm drinks and beer 
gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane 
saturday night 160 miles south of puerto rico it skirted the 
dominican republic and haiti on sunday plowed straight through 
jamaica on monday brushed past the cayman islands tuesday and 
slammed into the yucatan peninsula wednesday morning the hurricane 
today headed toward northern mexico and southeastern texas

when republican vice presidential 
candidate dan quayle told reporters he didnt live in this 
century some thought for a moment they really had a scoop 
but it was just the latest example of quayles occasional 
tendency to garble his words when as is his wont he speaks 
extemporaneously rather than from a written text 
on thursday quayle got wrapped up at a news conference in a 
question about the holocaust what was his opinion of that time in 
which six million jews were executed under adolf hitler he was 
asked 
it was an obscene period in our nations history quayle 
replied 
when a reporter suggested that perhaps he had not meant to say 
our nations quayle tried to explain that he had meant in 
this centurys history 
we all lived in this century i didnt live in this century 
in this centurys history he said we did not have as a 
matter of fact we fought hitlerism the holocaust is a critical 
point in history that we should as a nation understand 
history lessons notwithstanding reporters following the indiana 
senator have long observed his propensity for malapropism 
last week in springfield ill quayle told his audience that 
george bushs day care proposals would give parents more freedom in 
determining what kind of care their children would have the 
result he intended to say would promote a better parentchild 
relationship 
this is what came out 
we understand the importance of having the bondage between the 
parent and the child 
quayles aides say the senators verbal stumbling is not a major 
campaign concern 
not everybody has a golden tongue everybody makes mistakes 
from time to time said david prosperi quayles press secretary 
such instances usually occur when quayle is not speaking from a 
prepared text in fact he is known to be much more comfortable 
speaking extemporaneously with only a few notecards as a prop 
but last week when he discarded his prepared text on defense 
issues in a speech before a chicago audience out came a confusing 
paraphrase of indiana university basketball coach bobby knight 
bobby knight told me this there is nothing that a good 
defense cannot beat a better offense in other words a good 
offense wins quayle said 
and on thursday quayle responded to a question about negative 
campaigning by saying it was an unfortunate aspect as the 
campaign unravels

the usbacked contra rebels accepted 
a government proposal to hold a preliminary meeting next week that 
could lead to highlevel talks on ending the 7yearold civil war 
roberto ferrey one of seven contra board members said thursday 
in a telephone interview that the rebels would go to guatemala 
monday to discuss the possiblity of resuming ceasefire talks 
the leftist sandinistas and the contras signed an agreement 
march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the fighting which has 
caused more than 28000 deaths but the talks broke off june 9 and 
each side accuses the other of ceasefire violations 
ferrey said the decision to hold the preliminary meeting 
proposed by the government did not mean the highlevel summit would 
be renewed 
we are not going to negotiate anything he said its a 
contact to see if we can overcome obstacles 
for example he said further highlevel talks cannot be held 
unless political opposition figures are released from prison 
sandinista police arrested more than 40 opposition figures july 
10 after an antigovernment demonstration in the southern city of 
nandaime 
the agreement to seek a negotiated settlement came three weeks 
after the united states cut off all military aid to the rebels the 
pact surprised washington and caused deep division among the rebels 
in washington a us official on thursday endorsed the contras 
acceptance of the sandinista offer 
they are asking the sandinistas to be reasonable said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the reagan administration has backed the contra rebels since 
1981 in their fight to oust the sandinista government the 
sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular revolutionary war 
that deposed the dictatorship of anastacio somoza

hurricane gilbert has similarities to allen 
which had winds up to 200 mph but diminished before it reached the 
texas coastline in 1980 meteorologists say 
allen caused heavy flooding and two deaths but its assault on 
texas in august 1980 was far less serious than had been feared 
allen one of the most powerful hurricanes then on record 
slammed across the caribbean with lethal force and built to 
category 5 strength 
gilbert also built to the same strength before weakening as it 
passed over mexicos yucatan peninsula 
allen with a diameter of more than 600 miles rapidly built in 
intensity and crossed the gulf on aug 7 with winds near 200 mph 
it sent hundreds of thousands of people on an exodus from the 
coast but its rush toward land suddenly stalled as a highpressure 
ridge fended it off 
by the time allen crashed into the coast early aug 10 its 
winds had diminished to around 100 mph and it was classified as a 
category 3 hurricane 
at least 67 people were reported killed in haiti after allen 
raced over the caribbean island of hispaniola

president corazon aquino today hailed 
the formation of a new political party organized by her supporters 
but said the move must not divide democratic forces into 
permanent hostile camps 
formation of the new party is the latest step in a realignment 
of forces which ousted leader ferdinand marcos in february 1986 and 
swept mrs aquino into power 
mrs aquino made her remarks in a speech to the opening session 
of the first national convention of the new party the struggle 
of the democratic filipino 
rep ramon mitra speaker of the house of representatives was 
elected president of the party which organizers hope will bring 
together progovernment forces under a single banner and serve as 
the presidents own party 
but some proaquino politicians have attacked the new party as a 
bid by the presidents relatives and others to consolidate their 
own power in advance of the 1992 presidential election 
mrs aquino who has vowed not to seek reelection told the 
5093 delegates she hoped the new party was founded not only for 
the 1992 elections but to help our people face and overcome their 
problems 
mrs aquino acknowledged the country must reinforce its newly 
won democracy by establishing disciplined national parties parties 
here have traditionally formed around personalities of their 
leaders rather than ideology 
without the organization of political beliefs and programs 
into disciplined parties we would have only a riot of conflicting 
opinions but no effective action mrs aquino said 
she said political factionalism enabled her ousted predecessor 
ferdinand marcos to impose eight years of martial law in 1972 
mrs aquino said the current political realignment was creating 
disenchantment among the filipino public who fear a return to the 
oldstyle politics of bickering and infighting that led to martial 
rule 
delegates to the inaugural convention included 108 of the 202 
members of the house of representatives six of the 23 senators 42 
provincial governors and more than 1170 city and town mayors 
sen neptali gonzalez convention chairman said he was not 
disappointed by mrs aquinos reluctance to give the party a 
ringing endorsement or to join its ranks 
you dont expect the president to say this is my party 
gonzalez said i think her presence here is enough inspiration to 
add membership to the party 
mitra said mrs aquino avoided a clearcut endorsement of the 
party as the principal administration party because she might be 
accused of playing politics 
he told reporters the party was organized to consolidate 
political support for the government and establish a grassroots 
mass movement behind mrs aquino 
but there are others who do not believe in this thinking 
mitra said he was referring to the refusal of 18 liberal party 
members in the house to join the new party 
the liberals led by senate president jovito salonga are among 
six parties united in the government coalition but the liberals 
have disagreed with other progovernment parties and with some of 
the presidents politically influential relatives 
last month vice president salvador laurel and opposition sen 
juan ponce enrile announced formation of a new opposition party 
mrs aquino ran under laurels united nationalist democratic 
organization in the 1986 presidential election but the two fell 
out over differences in philosophy and personal rivalry

the food and drug administration is close to 
banning a chemical that once was used widely as a propellant in 
hairsprays according to the agencys director 
we feel all the evidence indicates it is a hazardous 
substance said dr frank e young at a hearing of the house 
small business committees regulation subcommittee on thursday 
just the introduction of this for just a few seconds in the 
air in the bathroom every morning is a risk young told the 
lawmakers 
the cosmetics industry has conceded that the chemical is 
hazardous for cosmeticians who might use it several times a day 
but has argued that it is safe for consumers 
the fda proposed banning use of methylene chloride in 1985 
because the agency believes it is causes cancer 
the agency should announce its final decision on the substance 
by the end of the year other government agencies also would have 
to consider the proposal before it becomes official

the us judicial conference has announced an 
experiment that could eliminate court stenographers 
the judicial conference a 28judge board which sets policy for 
the nations federal courts announced thursday that it has 
approved a twoyear experiment for some federal courts to videotape 
their proceedings 
the experiment marks a radical departure for the federal 
judiciary because unlike many of their state counterparts the 
federal courts ban all electronic coverage of courtroom proceedings 
the experiment to be conducted in six trial courts and two 
appeals courts which have not been identified is designed to find 
out whether videotapes should replace written documents as official 
records of trial and appellate court proceedings 
public access to the videotapes is something that has not been 
determined yet said conference spokesman david sellers 
the experiment which will be supplemented by stenographic 
record will be monitored by a committee led by us district judge

a senate panel has voted to give the federal 
government authority to seize a development site adjacent to a 
civil war battlefield in suburban virginia 
the energy and natural resources committee on thursday voted 
118 to approve a measure that would authorize congress to acquire 
the 542acre william center development tract near the manassas 
national battlefield park 
the measure introduced by sen dale bumpers dark is 
identical to a bill that passed the house last month and allows for 
purchase of the land and up to 30 million in construction of new 
roads around the park 
the panel rejected a compromise measure offered by sen john 
warner rva under which only part of the parcel would be 
acquired 
if we dont act to preserve that property you can go down 
there three weeks from now and it will be gone for all intents 
and purposes bumpers said maintaining the entire tract was 
historically significant itll be a shopping mall 
committee chairman sen j bennett johnston dla said he 
hoped the bill would reach the senate floor by next week president 
reagan has threatened to veto any legislation similar to the 
bumpers bill

the department of energy has more than doubled 
its count of inactive waste sites at nuclear weapons production 
facilities across the country according to the general accounting 
office 
the inactive waste site figure went from 1447 to 3276 
according gao reports released by sen john glenn dohio chairman 
of the senate governmental affairs committee 
does disarray in counting and assessing its inactive waste 
sites is further evidence of this and earlier administrations 
willingness to place the publics health and safety at risk in 
their rush to produce nuclear weapons glenn said 
the fact that doe doesnt know how many inactive waste sites 
it has or how hazardous they are suggests that this cost estimate 
is low glenn said noting that doe previously had estimated it 
would cost 60 billion to clean up the waste sites 
glenn said that if we add all these costs up the bill will be 
at least 175 billion over the next half century

the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee has approved legislation that would extend the us 
territorial limit to 12 nautical miles 
thursdays voice vote approving the measure would make the first 
change in the threemile protection zone along the us coast since 
1793 when president thomas jefferson instituted it 
the panel also approved legislation that would require that 
foreign fishing vessels stow their gear when passing through the 
200mile us economic zone and carry transponders so satellites 
could track their location 
those proposals were attached to a new ussoviet fishing 
treaty and were sought by washington state lawmakers after seven 
japanese trawlers were videotaped fishing in american waters off 
alaska in january 
the expansion of the territorial limit will allow the united 
states to exercise complete control over a broader area that would 
enhance our nations ability to intercept and board vessels which 
may be carrying contraband or drugs off our coast and the 
ability of soviet ships to monitor and detect the movement of us 
submarines is lessened said rep mike lowry dwash sponsor of 
the bill

doctors often incorrectly instruct patients on 
using nicotine gum or fail to prescribe it at all even though it 
can help heavy smokers quit according to studies published today 
most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25 
percent of patients who try to quit smoking said one of five 
smokingrelated studies in todays journal of the american medical 
association there is a widespread need for physician education 
about how to use nicotine gum more effectively 
for instance nearly 40 percent of 208 internists surveyed in 
the study said they would prescribe nicotine gum to help patients 
cut down on smoking violating a key guideline for using it the 
manufacturers guidelines call for patients to stop smoking 
completely before using it 
and onefourth of the internists surveyed said they had recently 
prescribed sedatives to help patients stop smoking although 
there is no evidence that sedatives are useful for that 
purpose said the study by dr steven r cummings and colleagues at 
the university of california medical school in san francisco 
i would guess that the confusion and difficulties with using 
the gum are very widespread cummings said 
nicotine gum a prescription drug marketed under the trade name 
nicorette by lakeside pharmaceuticals of cincinnati can be an 
effective tool to help some people quit smoking particularly heavy 
smokers concluded three other studies in the journal 
but one study found that 34 of 538 patients or 68 percent who 
were given nicotine gum to help them quit smoking were still 
chewing it after a year 
those longterm gum chewers also represented 25 percent of the 
patients who succeeded in staying off cigarettes for a year said 
the report by researchers at the university of london 
i dont think physicians ought to supply it just 
willynilly said dr stephen p fortmann an assistant professor 
at the stanford university school of medicine most people whove 
quit smoking did it before the gum was available so were by 
no means advocating it 
the gum shouldnt be seen as either a miracle or as a 
necessity but as a useful adjunct 
another study in the journal found that heavy smokers those 
who consume more than 25 cigarettes daily are more physically 
addicted to nicotine and have a harder time quitting than people 
who smoke no more than 15 cigarettes a day 
that study suggested nicotine gum might better help heavy 
smokers overcome withdrawal symptoms caused by their physical 
addiction when they stop 
lakeside spokesman bill donaldson said the manufacturer 
estimates 2 million people have quit smoking by using nicotine gum 
as part of a stopsmoking program since nicorette was introduced in 
1985 
he said the company had no reports of patients becoming addicted 
to nicotine from the gum itself any dependence on the gum is a 
transference of the patients nicotine addiction from smoking and 
is part of the weaning process donaldson said

dorothy eber says her children and grandchildren 
respect her strong views but they dont want to see her go to 
prison even though thats where the 63yearold activist may be 
headed 
they wish it was somebody else doing it but me the suburban 
villa park mother of four and grandmother of 11 said thursday 
ms eber faces six months and 3 years in prison for her part in 
the missouri peace planting in which she and 13 others entered 10 
missile sites and planted flowers or trees 
it was the first time i saw a missile silo and it was 
devastating ms eber said recalling her first protest aug 15 
out on the grassy plains to me it looked like a monster 
after writing peace slogans with her own blood on the silo 
cover ms eber said she sat down and waited nearly two hours for 
police 
for her trouble she was given a ban and bar letter which 
forbade her to enter missile sites again 
but she and some others went back three times during the next 
two weeks 
and for that ms eber is scheduled to be tried oct 24 in 
kansas city on four counts each of criminal trespass and damage of 
property less than 100 
all i did was cut the padlock she said it cant be worth 
more than 50 cents 
ms eber whose husband died two years ago began her activism 
in the wake of the civil rights movement when her youngest son 
started high school in 1967 she began tutoring children in an 
inner city parish and then started a program in which high school 
students from the suburbs came into the city to tutor 
but she felt her efforts were not changing very much and that 
she needed to concentrate on changing the system itself so she 
began civil disobedience and was arrested four times in 1983 for 
demonstrating at the plants of several local defense contractors 
for that she said she got 30 days of courtordered supervision 
it really didnt mean much she said 
now unless the charges against her are reduced she faces a 
mandatory minimum sentence of six months in jail if she is 
convicted and she expects a conviction 
her son fred eber 46 supports his mother in her activism but 
doesnt entirely agree with her goals of nuclear disarmament he 
said he has come to realize that its more than a possibility 
his mother might go to prison 
his four children ages 16 to 25 also are worried but they 
respect the fact that shes willing to stand up for her beliefs 
eber said 
i try and make a lesson about it that all we can do is be true 
to ourselves he said sometimes i wish there was something i 
felt so strongly about 
ms eber said she doesnt push her views on her grandchildren 
but if they ask she tries to explain why she is risking 
incarceration 
i tell them that they must always question and never close 
their minds she said 
and while she will miss her family if she does go to prison she 
has no regrets about her activism 
for me its going to be very lonely to be separated from my 
family she said but i feel im doing it for them

hundreds of radical students shouting 
yankee go home mounted protests against the olympics today on 
the eve of games and burned an effigy of president reagan 
students staged protests at three schools in seoul to demand the 
olympics be shared with communist north korea and to denounce the 
government of president roh taewoo the olympics start saturday 
oppose dictators olympics and crush military 
aggression students yelled 
about 300 protesters armed with firebombs and clubs marched out 
of kookmin university to fight riot police after burning effigies 
of reagan and roh as well as a us flag but riot police watched 
from a distance and did not intervene as the protesters repeatedly 
blocked traffic 
students one of whom hurled a single firebomb at a passing 
police truck and missed tired of taunting police and dispersed 
about 500 students took part in a similar protest at seoul 
national university in the south of the capital they marched to 
the gate and burned an effigy of roh 
riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets 
watched but did not intervene the students made no move to attack 
the police 
the protesters then marched to a gym on the campus where olympic 
table tennis events are to be held and yelled antiolympic slogans 
outside the building before dispersing 
a small antiolympic protest was also held at yonsei university 
with less than 100 students taking part 
antiolympic protests have been small by korean standards and 
the radicals have failed to attract support violent clashes with 
riot police have dropped sharply in recent days as the number of 
students taking part has dwindled 
a few onlookers even shouted abuse at protesters at kookmin 
accusing them of trying to wreck the olympics go home you are 
shaming our nation screamed an angry old man 
the radicals are demanding the olympics be shared with north 
korea to promote reunification of the korean peninsula divided 
since 1945 
radicals also contend the roh government is a front for military 
rule and is using the olympics to cement its rule with aid from the 
united states 
the great majority of koreans including most students want the 
olympics to be a major success students know the people are 
against these demonstrations a student leader said today 
north korea is boycotting the olympics because its demand to be 
a cohost of the games was rejected the international olympic 
committee said the games are awarded to a single city and cannot be 
shared

accusations against 19 defendants in the 
fraud trial over the washington public power supply systems 
default on 225 billion in bonds amounts to fraud by 
hindsight a defense lawyer says 
there is no evidence to support charges of conspiracy peter 
nickles representing the engineering firm of ebasco said in 
opening statements thursday 
jurors were told by other defense attorneys that utility 
officials who sat on the systems board of directors were parttime 
public servants who relied on experts and had nothing to gain by 
misleading investors who bought bonds in the two nuclear plants 
these people always acted in good faith said al malanca 
who represents 12 of the 16 public utilities that are among 
defendants they had no motive to do wrong 
malanca opened the defendants case by disputing plaintiff 
attorneys arguments that utility members of the wppss board 
controlled the supply system and plotted to defraud bond buyers 
defendants including another engineering firm and a financial 
adviser to wppss are accused of making misrepresentations and 
withholding crucial information from investors who bought bonds to 
finance construction of two nuclear power plants 
plaintiffs include more than 24000 bond buyers in the case 
which resulted from the 1983 default by wppss on the 225 billion 
in bonds it was the biggest default in the history of the 
municipal bond market 
the trial began last week the judge excused jurors until 
monday when opening arguments by defense attorneys were to resume 
nickles said what happened to the wppss projects was happening 
to the entire nuclear industry by the late 1970s 
he said plantconstruction prices dramatically escalated because 
of inflation and required changes to make nuclear plants safer and 
the 1979 three mile island accident he said wrecked the nuclear 
industry 
malanca told jurors that the plaintiffs would have them believe 
the 16 utility defendants had the power to control federal and 
state agencies and were able to induce major engineering and 
financial firms to knowingly make false claims on official bond 
statements 
but the utilities were relatively small and were far down on 
the pecking order among the energy powers in the northwest he 
said the federal bonneville power administration he said 
dominated the region 
while wppss in the 1970s with five nuclear plants under 
construction was also a major player in the energy scene said 
malanca the utility officials that directed it were parttime 
participants 
he said they considered their appointments to the board a matter 
of civic duty went to meetings only periodically hired the best 
experts they could find and generally followed directions of those 
experts and wppss 
the supply system staff had more power in directing wppss and 
board members were not even to speak to the media as 
representatives of wppss he said 
if they did anything wrong they were acting as board members 
of the supply system not of the utilities he said 
he stressed that public utility officials are not paid 
receiving only per diem allowances for their work 
dennis bromley another defense lawyer said utilities from the 
23member wppss board sent one representative each to the supply 
system 
but he said the utilities had no control at all over how that 
representative voted and didnt stand a chance of controlling the 
supply system 
the supply system was created in 1957 to build and operate major 
powergenerating facilities in the northwest

scientists trying to get to the root of americas 
ozone pollution should reconsider the role trees play researchers 
say 
trees contribute such a high amount of hydrocarbons to the 
atmosphere pollutioncontrol efforts would be more effective if 
they sought to limit nitrogen oxide instead according to research 
by georgia tech faculty members 
aware of ronald reagans killer trees theories of 1980 
georgia tech geophysicist wl chameides hastens to say that trees 
dont cause ozone pollution any more than the sun does 
chameides concedes the conclusions place him and his colleagues 
out on a scientific limb but said thursday i think there are 
other scientists that are coming along with us 
he said he expected that the conclusions would be accepted 
despite what he called institutional inertia 
ozone is produced by the combination of sunlight hydrocarbons 
and nitrogen oxides it protects the earth from harmful radiation 
at high atmospheric levels but can harm humans and crops at low 
levels 
all three ingredients must exist before ozone can be formed and 
no one has inferred from that that the sun was a polluter or that 
we should put a big screen over the united states to protect it 
chameides said 
during the 1980 presidential campaign reagan angered 
environmentalists by suggesting that trees and other parts of 
nature were the chief culprits of air pollution the idea led to 
jokes about killer trees and the appearance of protesters who 
dressed themselves as trees and carried signs saying chop us 
down before we kill again 
chameides stressed that the researchers do not suggest cutting 
down trees but instead believe pollution control efforts should 
center on nitrogen oxides which are produced by many of the same 
processes that emit hydrocarbons 
chameides led a team of georgia tech researchers who studied the 
production of hydrocarbons or hydrogencarbon compounds in 
atlanta a heavily wooded city that frequently fails to meet 
federal airquality standards 
the study found that vegetation principally trees emit as many 
hydrocarbons as cars and factories and on a hot day can provide 
enough hydrocarbons on their own to form illegal levels of ozone 
published in todays edition of science magazine the study says 
the environmental protection agencys decision to attack ozone 
through limiting hydrocarbons is therefore doomed to failure 
the clean air act has sought to limit ozone through devices on 
cars and in factories that reduce the emission of hydrocarbons 
paying little attention to nitrogen oxide chameides said 
weve pursued the hydrocarbon strategy for about 10 years or 
so and i think its pretty clear that for some reason we have not 
been successful chameides said we need to reevaluate what 
were doing instead of continuing down the same garden path 
epa spokesman chris rice agreed that airquality rules have not 
succeeded in reducing ozone levels significantly but he said we 
estimate that in the absence of control programs hydrocarbon 
levels would be close to 80 percent higher than they actually are 
weve basically treaded water in the 80s 
during the creation of ozone natural hydrocarbons are used up 
faster than manmade hydrocarbons and thus can have a significant 
effect in spite of their low concentrations the study says 
chameides said his findings should be viewed cautiously but 
he added just because there are some uncertainties you dont 
ignore a source of 50 percent of hydrocarbons weve got to include 
all of the scientific evidence thats available 
he said he is anxious for other scientists to check his work and 
for research to be conducted in other cities

a state appellate court has overturned 
a 1986 initiative sponsored by tax activist howard jarvis that 
requires voters to approve all taxes imposed by local governments 
in declaring proposition 62 unconstitutional the 4th district 
court of appeals ruled thursday that requiring voter approval 
constitutes a gross interference with the fiscal responsiblity of 
local governments 
its a sad day for the california taxpayer said joel fox a 
spokesman for the california tax reduction movement in los angeles 
the antitax group campaigned for proposition 62 after jarvis died 
on aug 12 1986 the measure was approved by state voters in 
november 1986 
the appellate court reversed a decision by a santa ana superior 
court judge in january who upheld proposition 62 against a legal 
challenge brought by the city of westminster and said the measure 
was constitutional and enforceable 
the initiative sponsored by jarvis the selfstyled tax 
reformer requires local governmental agencies to stop collecting 
any new tax imposed after july 31 1985 unless it is approved by 
the voters by nov 5 1988 
javis drafted proposition 62 several months before he died he 
said it was needed to plug loopholes in the landmark proposition 
13 the statewide initiative passed in 1978 that jarvis backed and 
which sharply curtailed property taxes 
agencies failing to comply with proposition 62 would face the 
loss of an equivalent amount of property tax revenue 
westminster is among 45 municipalities in california that faced 
a potential loss of property tax revenue under the measure state 
and county officials said 
the unanimous appellate court ruling written by justice thomas 
f crosby jr found that westminster has the authority to impose a 
utility users tax without a citywide vote 
just what effect the ruling will ultimately have is unclear 
however because a similar case in sonoma has been appealed to the 
1st district court of appeals in san francisco 
fox said his organization would appeal the 4th district ruling 
to the state supreme court if the high court chooses not to accept 
the case on appeal fox said his group would consult with others to 
consider mounting another initiative campaign

us and vietnamese experts will 
conduct unprecedented joint field investigations this month asking 
villagers about us servicemen lost in vietnam more than 15 years 
ago a us official said 
lt col joe harvey said thursday that the two sides agreed in 
talks earlier this week to form two joint teams to search a broad 
area roughly 38 miles north of vietnams capital hanoi 
the search will begin sept 25 and last about 10 days harvey 
said it would be the first time us specialists will be allowed 
to interview villagers in the countryside and the first joint field 
activity since the two sides in late 1985 unearthed the wreckage of 
a us b52 bomber near hanoi 
harvey commander of the us joint casualty resolution center 
headed the us side at this weeks talks 
were going to do joint investigations of incidents not just 
crash sites but places where people were last thought to be but we 
dont know exactly what happened to them harvey said in a 
telephone interview from honolulu 
i think its a very significant development he said we 
think this will be the first of many such joint activities he 
said 
the united states wants to account for nearly 1800 servicemen 
and civilians listed as missing in action or mia from the war 
that cost about 58000 american lives until us forces withdrew in 
1973 
since communist north vietnam defeated usbacked south vietnam 
in april 1975 ending the war progress on the mia issue has been 
hampered by frequent bickering and the lack of diplomatic relations 
between washington and hanoi 
harvey said each joint search team will include three us 
experts drawn from the casualty resolution center and the army 
central identification laboratory both honolulubased units 
entrusted with resolving the fate of missing us servicemen 
the teams will talk to local government officials and villagers 
who may have witnessed the incidents in which the american soldiers 
were lost he said 
harvey said the teams would focus on several of the 70 
discrepancy cases that the united states has asked vietnam to 
resolve urgently 
in these cases the united states says there is strong evidence 
the men survived and were captured or otherwise came under 
vietnamese control and vietnamese authorities should have 
information about them they include cases where downed airmen 
failed to emerge from prisonerofwar camps 
potentially all the discrepancy cases could be resolved 
through a series of joint investigations harvey said 
a special us presidential envoy retired gen john w vessey 
gave foreign minister nguyen co thach the list of 70 names in 
august 1987 when the two men reached agreement on accelerating 
cooperation on the issue 
in july this year thach pledged to try to resolve the 70 cases 
by years end 
in return for cooperation on the mia issue the united states 
has sent medical teams to vietnam and encouraged private relief 
organizations to help the impoverished nation the sixth such 
medical team visited hanoi sept 67

the government closed all schools for 
the day today saying antigovernment rebels planned to use the 
children to provoke civil unrest on this wartorn island 
the closure is a precautionary measure taken by the 
government to prevent those groups committed to violence using 
innocent schoolchildren to forment civil disturbances in the 
country a government statement said 
on thursday the government imposed emergency laws to curb 
strikes by sinhalese militants who oppose an accord aimed at ending 
five years of bloodshed in the northern and eastern provinces 
president junius r jayawardenes government invoked the 
emergency laws declaring all shops transport and health agencies 
as essential services 
any essential services that close without the governments 
permission may be indefinitely shut down or seized it said 
the moves follow a nationwide strike monday called by the janata 
vimukti peramuna or peoples liberation front to protest the 
death of a sinhalese lawyer while in police custody 
the strike paralyzed businesses and public transport nationwide 
the government contends most businesses closed because of threats 
by sinhalese militants 
the front is the most militant sinhalese group it has vowed to 
kill anyone who supports the peace agreement that would grant 
tamils limited autonomy in the northern and eastern provinces and 
end their war for a separate nation 
at least 500 people including members of the governing united 
national party have been killed by sinhalese militants 
sri lanka last week merged the two provinces which the tamils 
claim as their homeland and said a provincial council would be 
chosen later to take over administrative duties now handled by the 
federal government 
the merger is a key provision of the peace accord signed by 
india and sri lanka in july 1987 india which has an estimated 
47000 troops stationed on the island became involved in the 
conflict because 60 million tamils living in southern india are 
sympathetic to the rebels cause 
sinhalese militants contend the accord grants too many 
concessions to the tamils who comprise 18 percent of the islands 
16 million people 
tamils mostly hindu claim they are discriminated against by 
the sinhalese mostly buddhists who make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military

an undetermined number of protesters were taken into custody 
during the demonstration thursday which was prompted when manuel 
bustos president of the united workers federation and arturo 
martinez federation vice president were exiled for 1 years for 
allegedly violating security laws by calling a violencemarred 
national strike 
bustos was sent by police car to parral 210 miles south of 
santiago and martinez was flown in a police plane to chanaral 600 
miles to the north 
each must spend the next 541 days within those city limits

headquarters in washington that union leaders from north america 
and 10 european nations had joined a protest march to the palace of 
justice when they were caught in a melee between demonstrators

institute for free labor development were knocked down and 
teargassed by police

roughed up dresser indicated that none of the americans required 
hospitalization 
bustos and martinez were found guilty and sentenced aug 20 by 
the supreme court which reversed a lower court acquittal the high 
court also gave federation strike coordinator moises labrana a 
60day suspended jail sentence 
the three were convicted of breaking chilean internal security 
law by calling for a general strike last oct 7 to protest the 
rightwing military governments economic policies and to support 
demands for wage increases

mario biaggi whose congressional career ended 
last month after he was convicted of racketeering saw his 
electoral career end with a defeat in the democratic primary he 
said he did not want to win 
new york voters thursday gave two other prominent politicians 
tainted by political scandal the chance to remain in office as they 
seek to clear their names 
state senate minority leader manfred ohrenstein and rep robert 
garcia both survived democratic primary challenges in districts 
where winning the primary is tantamount to election 
biaggi who had quit his seat after his conviction in the 
wedtech scandal was still given a good chance because of his 
popularity but the voters turned instead to state assemblyman 
eliot engel 
with 97 percent of the vote counted engel had 12831 votes or 
50 percent to 6538 or 25 percent for former state assemblyman 
vincent marchiselli and 6405 or 25 percent for biaggi 
though biaggi will be on the november ballot as the republican 
candidate engel is expected to be the easy winner 
garcias name has come up in testimony in the wedtech case but 
he has not been charged with any wrongdoing he said thursday night 
that the questions about his connections to wedtech made his 
primary victory sweeter 
after 22 years in public with never as much as a bad word 
against me this hit me like a ton of bricks said garcia i 
feel the people of my district said ok bob were in this 
together lets go 
with all the returns in garcia had 16517 votes or 60 percent 
to 7515 or 27 percent for pedro espada a community health 
center director and 3471 or 13 percent for ismael betancourt 
who had lost two earlier primaries to garcia 
ohrenstein a 28year veteran of the state legislature narrowly 
beat back a challenge from joseph rose 29 the son of a wealthy 
developer 
rose spent more than 500000 most of it family money trying 
to make sure every potential voter in the district knew that 
ohrenstein has been indicted for putting campaign workers on the 
senate payroll during the 1986 elections ohrenstein has denied any

the 1988 drought has increased the need for 
more mental health services in rural areas says a former cabinet 
official 
the drought this summer has made a bad situation worse for 
many said bob bergland the exsecretary of agriculture who 
headed a special commission on rural mental health problems 
citing research conducted before the drought the national 
mental health associations commission on rural mental health 
issued a study thursday recommending the creation of a federal 
office of rural mental health and increased funds for alcohol drug 
abuse and mental health programs 
the study rural mental health the time for action is now 
also recommends a broader crisis counseling network for farmers 
were fighting a myth that rural america is a healthier place 
to live if that was ever true its not true today said dr 
peter g beeson director of planning for the nebraska department 
of public institutions 
bergland said much of the stress on rural residents is triggered 
by economic problems 
besides the economy other parts of the rural environment have 
changed the study said the traditional image of a closelyknit 
rural community revolving around church and family activities no 
longer fits the report said 
consequently psychological distress becomes more common and 
rural residents problems often arent treated promptly because 
rural areas frequently lack mental health services bergland said 
the biggest problem isnt that were sicker in rural places 
the problem is we dont have resources said bergland during a 
news conference to unveil the study

authorities expect to file charges soon in 
the apparent sabotage of orings made for space shuttle booster 
rockets an fbi agent says 
hydrapak which manufactures the orings in west jordan a salt 
lake suburb discovered in june that a small number of the 
rubberlike seals had been deliberately cut 
officials notified booster maker morton thiokol the fbi and 
nasa the federal agencies began a joint investigation 
we do have suspects and the case will be prosecutable fbi 
special agent cal clegg said thursday right from the inception 
we have been discussing the case with the us attorneys office 
and we feel that arrests or indictments will be imminent 
clegg said charges could be filed within a month 
clegg said he did not know whether more than one person was 
suspected but the number could expand it depends on the 
evidence that is gathered 
james dockstader hydrapak vice president of production said 
earlier that none of the damaged seals had been shipped to morton 
thiokol which manufactures the rockets at its northern utah plant 
he said thursday he could not comment on the fbi probe however 
he said hydrapaks internal investigation had determined that 
allegations of lax security shipment of substandard orings and a 
company coverup were without foundation 
dockstader said the internal investigation completed monday 
found no irregularities in manufacturing shipment or inspection 
processes or in the security procedures at the plant about 20 
miles south of salt lake city 
he said steps had been taken to increase security but would not 
give details 
the orings are used as seals between segments of the booster 
rocket to prevent leakage of superhot gases from burning propellant 
after the 1986 challenger explosion a presidential commission 
found that an oring allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape and 
ignite the shuttles main liquid fuel tank triggering the blast 
that killed the shuttles seven astronauts 
improvements to the booster joint have been the focus of morton 
thiokols effort to redesign the rocket last month the company 
conducted a final testfiring of the shuttle discovery the first 
flight planned since the challenger disaster 
the national aeronautics and space administration has scheduled 
the launch for late this month or early october

top us officials are for the first time 
talking seriously about removing military bases from the 
philippines and the chief philippines negotiator says the country 
is preparing for such a possibility but still negotiating 
secretary of state george p shultz said thursday the united 
states wants to keep giant clark air base and subic navy base and 
other installations in the philippines but there are alternatives 
which we are having now to examine 
shultz said talks in manila on bases compensation and other 
issues basically arent going well 
on wednesday defense secretary frank carlucci told visiting 
philippine foreign minister raul manglapus in what one official 
described as blunt terms that the united states is prepared to 
pull out of the bases if the philippines insists on too much 
compensation 
other officials have suggested they might be relocated to guam 
or elsewhere in the pacific with estimates of the cost of such a 
move ranging over 10 billion defense officials have said in the 
past that the bases are vital to security of a vast area stretching 
from southeast asia into the persian gulf 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said in a speech today that 
the kremlin is ready to give up its base at cam ranh bay vietnam 
if us forces leave the philippines 
us officials have said this would not be a balanced exchange 
cam ranh bay is the soviets major naval deployment base abroad 
while clark and subic are the united statess largest foreign bases 
manglapus in an interview thursday said the two sides in the 
negotiations now in recess are not far apart on how much the reagan 
administration should seek from congress in direct payment for use 
of the bases but several other issues in the talks remain 
unresolved 
both sides agree that the hard component cash of our mutual 
proposals were not too far apart and that in addition we would be 
looking for creative ways of raising the level of the compensation 
to that which was proposed by the philippines manglapus said 
he said additional help might come in the form of procurement of 
philippine products and the writing off of some of the nations 26 
billion foreign debt 
manglapus did not say how much aid has been offered by the us 
panel but congressional sources have said it is close to 500 
million including a doubling of direct basesrelated aid to 360 
million for fiscal 1989 manglapus declined to say how much the 
philippines originally wanted but manila news reports have put the 
demand as high as 12 billion a year 
manglapus said he was not surprised by carluccis remarks about 
pulling out and asserted that the philippines is preparing for a 
loss of the bases 
he said studies show that conversion of the bases to civilian 
use could provide even more benefits including replacement of the 
thousands of jobs that would be lost if the united states pulls out 
he said that while the bases provide significant economic 
benefit even american analysts agree that their security value to 
the philippines is minimal 
your own analysts and your own leaders stress the priority 
importance of the global strategy that is fulfilled by these 
bases he said 
manglapus said unresolved issues in the bases talks include the 
storage of nuclear weapons on the bases ownership of improvements 
to the bases procurement policies and the writeoff of debts for 
military equipment 
we have not gotten anything out of the american panel he 
said 
manglapus said he is discussing the bases issue with a variety 
of us officials but has not moved the negotiations from manila to 
washington 
surveys of filipinos show only a small percentage of outright 
opposition to the bases he said but a large number of people say 
they would want the bases out if the americans do not improve the 
bases agreement including additional compensation 
manglapus who lived in us selfexile during the last decade 
of expresident ferdinand e marcos rule said he has found 
democrats more responsive on philippine issues than republicans 
but he said the views of the two parties on the bases appear to be 
the same 
manglapus plans to meet shultz again at the united nations at 
the end of the month 
the philippine official also will attend the new york debut of a 
musical comedy he wrote during his exile the play which deals 
with the us takeover of the philippines between 1898 and 1902 is 
called manifest destiny an evening of yankee panky

the number of aids cases in the united states 
will jump nearly fivefold by 1992 and about 263000 people will 
have died from the disease by then the national centers for 
disease control predicts 
as of this week 72766 aids cases have been reported to the 
cdc 41064 people or 56 percent are dead by the end of 1992 
the number of cases will hit 365000 and 72 percent of those 
patients will be dead the cdc says 
the predictions came thursday in a report summarizing the cdcs 
latest quarterly report on aids to the white houses domestic 
policy council 
actual aids reporting has run slightly higher than predicted 
the agency in 1986 predicted 15800 cases in 1986 and 23000 in 
1987 and the actual totals were 17100 and 25200 respectively 
we think theyre very close said dr tim dondero an aids 
specialist at the atlantabased health agency i think the 
message is that at least for the first couple of years this 
method gives some pretty reliable estimates 
the cdc in 1986 issued its aids predictions for 1991 which 
forecast 270000 cases by the end of that year 
in the report released thursday the agency predicts 80000 
cases of aids in 1992 alone with 66000 deaths that year a total 
of 172000 living aids patients will require medical care in 1992 
at a cost of 5 billion to 13 billion the cdc predicts 
the cdc also said its current estimate of 1 million to 15 
million americans currently infected with the virus which causes 
aids is a reasonable working estimate based on mathematical 
analysis by experts convened by the cdc in april 
thursdays report noted that the national infection estimate has 
remained the same since it was devised in 1986 the rate is about 
04 percent to 06 percent 
this does not mean that no new infections have occurred the 
cdc said the 1986 estimate was based on preliminary data and 
was probably too high at the time

the man who admitted killing two people 
with homemade bombs to cover up his forgeries of mormon documents 
was in critical but stable condition today from a drug overdose in 
prison a hospital official said 
mark hofmann 33 was in a coma when taken by helicopter from 
the utah state prison to the university of utah health sciences 
center officials said he began coming out of the coma shortly 
before midnight thursday 
hospital spokesman john dwan said the overdose was from an 
undetermined tricyclic antidepressant drug which showed up in lab 
tests at toxic levels 
hofmann also suffered minor to moderate burns on his right 
forearm and chest he said he said the cause of the burns was not 
immediately known but they were not considered serious 
hofmann had been prescribed a sleeping medication but juan 
benavidez a state department of corrections spokesman said he did 
not know what it was or the dosage 
hofmann is serving a five years to life prison term following 
his january 1987 plea agreement in which he admitted killing two 
people in 1985 
at a hearing before the board of pardons in january hofmann 
said he felt remorse for the families of his victims but the board 
ruled 21 that he should spend the rest of his life in prison 
from 1981 to 1985 hofmann had virtually set the agenda for 
scholars of mormon history with a string of discoveries of 
purported documents relating to early church history most later 
proved to be his own forgeries some of which were expertly done 
while others were crude

a man who says hes paid 2000 in traffic 
fines held up a sign warning motorists to slow down because police 
were ahead and was promptly arrested for obstructing traffic 
i stood there for about 20 minutes john thiry said 
thursday that would have been about a total of 3000 in fines 
they would have gotten people for 
thiry 22 of pittsburgh was arrested wednesday on obstructing 
traffic charges after he stood on schenley park plaza with a sign 
that read slow down police ahead with vascar 
vascar is a device akin to a stop watch that calculates a cars 
speed by measuring the time it takes for a car to travel between 
two lines painted across the street 
i stopped a lot of people from having a miserable day he 
said people were beeping at me they were waving 
thiry said pittsburgh police make you go 25 mph where they 
know 25 is an unreasonably slow speed try and go the speed limit 
and just see what happens see how many people pass you 
police chief ralph pampena said there are signs posted 
throughout the city warning drivers that police use vascar devices 
to enforce speed limits 
the signs are very clear he said if the signs are posted 
as 25 mph then thats the speed we expect people to go 
thiry said he was upset because he had been issued many tickets 
recently had lost his license for the third time and had to leave a 
job as a salesman 
the tickets included at least five in the past two years from 
police using vascar devices plus others for speeding on the 
interstate he said he estimated he has paid about 2000 in fines 
but said he has never been involved in a traffic accident 
police sgt leo mccafferty and officer william orourke said 
they noticed motorists suddenly were driving slower and arrested 
thiry after a motorist informed them of the sign 
thiry said he will appeal the charge of obstructing traffic 
which carries a fine of 4850 
i wasnt blocking traffic thiry said i dont think they 
had the right to arrest me because i wanted to warn people what if 
i was just yelling thats freedom of speech 
edward patterson commander of the traffic division said any 
time youre out in the street youre obstructing traffic

at a news conference in front of the hospital thursday family 
and friends of ms huertas expressed outrage at the alleged police 
beating 
i want to condemn the city of san francisco and the police 
department for permitting this type of activity to go on said

st francis hotel to respond to bushs statements against the ufw 
grape boycott when she was herded into an area where she was 
severely beaten by a member of the san francisco police 
department

the wives of two american professors held 
hostage in lebanon said today they believe the kidnappers demands 
have softened and their husbands will be freed soon 
badr turner wife of jesse turner a mathematics professor and 
feryal polhill wife of professor robert polhill spoke a day after 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine issued a 
handwritten statement and a photograph of two hostages to a western 
news agency in beirut 
the statement written in arabic hinted that the moslem group 
would free its hostages if the reagan administration undertook an 
initiative within one week in support of the palestinian uprising 
in israelioccupied territories the unrest began dec 8 
the two american educators pictured turner 41 of boise 
idaho and alann steen 49 of boston have been held for nearly 20 
months they were seized along with polhill 54 originally of new 
york city and mithileshwar singh 60 an indian who is a legal 
resident alien of the united states on jan 24 1987 from the 
campus of the usaffiliated beirut university by gunmen posing as 
riot police 
official us policy is that washington will not bargain with 
the captors 
we feel they are going to be released badr turner said in a 
telephone interview but she added we dont want to be 
overoptimistic to avoid disappointment 
mrs turner a lebanese of palestinian origin delivered the 
couples first child a baby girl six months after her husband was 
kidnapped 
its a positive statement she said of the message released 
by islamic jihad it looks like theyve the kidnappers relaxed 
their conditions this makes one be more may be a little more 
optimistic 
we cant say anything concrete has happened but its a step 
toward a solution said mrs polhill in a separate interview 
steens wife virginia was travelling in the united states and 
could not be reached 
the picture showed steen and turner smiling broadly resting on 
a mattress with a flowered pattern and a violet pillow each was 
holding a cigarette both wore navy blue outfits and had long hair 
steen was cleanshaven and turner had a bushy beard 
the islamic jihad group is believed to be sympathetic to the 
palestinians as well as irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
the four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed 
held hostage in lebanon nine of them americans the longest held 
is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press who was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
the statement said our organization plans to undertake a 
positive initiative to ease the issue of the hostages but it needs 
adequate reactions by international forums toward the rights of our 
moslem palestinian people in their struggle against the zionist 
enemy 
the us administration should be the first among the 
governments that should declare a clear positive stance toward the 
rights of our people in harmony with its claims of defending human 
rights 
it concluded at this sensitive stage of the uprising led by 
comrade strugglers in the interior of the occupied territories 
we offer this initiative and expect from the governments concerned 
a response within one week of the publication of this statement we 
then will be ready to advance further in this initiative 
the statement said the groups offer was timed to coincide with 
the 10th month of the palestinian uprising 
steen was a communications instructor when kidnapped from the 
college and turner a visiting professor of mathematics and computer 
science polhill lectured in accounting and singh was a visiting 
professor of finance

fortyone homeless people whose possessions 
were destroyed in a police sweep will receive 500 each according 
to terms of a settlement that some recipients said could free them 
from life on the street 
the city admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement which provides 
20500 to be divided among those affected in the incident city 
officials confirmed the settlement thursday but declined to comment 
the claims resulted from a june police sweep of two homeless 
camps in the shadow of city hall authorities said they gave an 
estimated 50 people 30 minutes to clear out but many were away 
looking for food or work they returned to find their possessions 
including medicine identification papers and clothing were gone 
although the agreement doesnt guarantee that such sweeps wont 
be conducted again lawyers representing the homeless said it is an 
important victory that should discourage officials from similar 
seizures 
i believe this has already affected the attitude and practice 
of police everywhere in this city said attorney james h davis 
who filed the claims on behalf of the homeless men and women 
many of the recipients said they would use the 500 to find 
permanent shelter 
were going to get a place and get married said joseph 
wilson 27 of his plans for the money 
im trying to get ahead im trying to have a future said 
wilson who added he has been sleeping on the street while studying 
word processing at a technical school 
joseph gabriel 48 said he hopes to get a place and get off 
the street the streets are making me old 
however ted hayes an activist for the homeless and one of the 
41 to file a claim against the city warned five hundred dollars 
is not going to get anybody off the street

president reagan says there isnt an iota of 
truth to an account that aides questioned whether he was mentally 
fit to serve at the height of the irancontra crisis but a former 
aide said today it would have been irresponsible for him not to 
raise the issue 
theres no truth to any of this reagan said thursday when 
asked about the report in a new book that aides weighed whether to 
invoke the 25th amendment providing for the vice president to take 
over if a president is unable to discharge his duties 
its just ridiculous reagan said while attending the annual 
white house picnic for members of congress there isnt an iota 
of truth in the whole story 
as to whether people were considering invoking the 25th 
amendment the president said i never knew that anyone was i 
dont think anyone was 
james cannon a former senate aide to howard h baker jr who 
was on the transition team when baker succeeded donald t regan as 
white house chief of staff confirmed most of the account 
attributed to him in the book landslide by reporters jane 
mayer of the wall street journal and doyle mcmanus of the los 
angeles times published by houghton mifflin 
cannon in an interview on cbs this morning defended his 
decision to raise the issue of the presidents mental state and the 
possible use of the 25th amendment to baker after he had 
interviewed several white house staff members as part of the 
transition 
i think it would have been irresponsible not to given what i 
had been told by senior staff member who had been working with him 
reagan cannon said 
cannon said he interviewed white house aides on feb 27 and 28 
1987 just after baker accepted the job and a pattern of 
responses evolved that the real problem you have to worry about is 
the president they would say hes not paying attention hes 
not reading his memos he doesnt come to the office he stays over 
in the residence 
on march 1 the book says cannon wrote a memo to baker 
suggesting that his first priority be to consider the possibility 
that section four of the 25th amendment might be applied 
after cannon presented and discussed the memo at a meeting at 
bakers home that night baker is quoted in the book as saying 
well it doesnt sound like the ronald reagan i just saw but 
well see tomorrow 
baker on thursday said he does not recall any serious 
consideration ever of invoking the 25th amendment 
he called reagan strong and assertive and perhaps the most 
presidential man i ever knew and said reagan was fully in 
charge fully capable and fully presidential 
according to the book baker and his top aides were prepared 
when they assembled in the west wing of the white house the morning 
after cannon raised the problem to watch the president closely 
to determine whether he appeared mentally fit to serve 
the account goes on to say that at a working lunch which baker 
and three aides attended reagan seemed relaxed and animated and 
cannon wondered what the hell is going on here the old fella 
looks just dandy 
cannon in an interview with cable news network said that of 
the staffers he talked to not all but most said in one way or 
another that the president was inattentive that he had lost 
interest in his job 
he later said on the cbs evening news my concern then and 
today is that they were more loyal to don regan than they were to 
ronald reagan 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the march 2 
luncheon did occur but senator baker and culvahouse and others 
dont describe any kind of situation the way jim cannon does 
what you have here is you have cannon talking to a bunch of 
people who for all practical purposes had just been relieved of 
their duties effectively every one knew when regan left they were 
all leaving they all were gone within a week 
however tom dawson who was one of regans top aides when he 
was chief of staff said lets start thinking who those people 
might have been there were not very many of them i cant even get 
up to five so cannon has an arithmetic problem 
regan asked in portland maine about the books assertion that 
the president was out of touch said well im a little doubtful 
of that of course the white house was in somewhat of disorder he 
was down because he had had an operation in early january but i 
think by that time he had fully recovered from it 
in his book for the record published last spring regan 
portrayed reagan as disengaged and indecisive 
dawson said cannon did not talk to him fitzwater said he did 
not talk to him either fitzwater also said that colin powell then 
the deputy national security adviser told him cannon did not talk 
either to him or to his superior frank c carlucci carlucci who 
was succeeded as national security adviser by powell is now 
secretary of defense 
peter wallison former white house counsel who was replaced by 
culvahouse after baker became chief of staff said he did talk to 
cannon but he didnt ask me about the question of the 
presidents mental health and i didnt tell him anything about the 
presidents mental health 
i never saw anything that suggested the president wasnt fully 
in charge wallison said

mikhail s gorbachev made another pitch today for 
improving soviet relations with china and renewed a call for a 
sinosoviet summit 
we stand for the full normalization of relations with the 
peoples republic of china for their development up to the level 
adequate to our two countries responsiblity for peaceful world 
policy gorbachev said in a major speech in the siberian city of 
krasnoyarsk 
gorbachev first proposed a summit with chinese leader deng 
xiaoping in a speech in the eastern soviet city of vladivostok 
near the chinese border on july 28 1986 
chinese communist party general secretary zhao ziyang said last 
month the first sinosoviet summit since 1960 was possible if 
moscow first urged vietnam to leave cambodia 
since the vladivostok speech gorbachev has taken several steps 
to remove obstacles to improving ties with the chinese 
china has listed the impediments as the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan moscows support of vietnams occupation of cambodia 
and soviet troops stationed along the soviet border with china 
the kremlin has moved to clear some of the obstacles in may it 
began withdrawing its troops from afghanistan and has pulled some 
of its forces out of mongolia which borders china 
gorbachev also has offered to accept chinas request that the 
two countries border be fixed at the main navigation channel in 
the amur river 
the kremlin agreed to its first direct talks with the chinese 
focusing solely on the cambodia issue in fiveday talks that began 
aug 29 in beijing both sides said they found common ground but 
achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10yearold cambodian 
conflict 
in his speech today gorbachev said the beijing discussions on 
cambodia had contributed to improving sovietchinese relations 
according to the tass news agency he also called for direct talks 
between china and vietnam on the issue 
since the vladivostok speech soviet and chinese top envoys have 
been meeting regularly to discuss normalization and border issues 
the kremlins ties with beijing have been strained since the 
communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences 
in the early 1960s 
gorbachev said the people of the two countries are ready for a 
rapprochement 
there is ever more goodwill and trust in relations between the 
soviet and chinese peoples he said their profound interest in 
one another has been resumed and is being filled with new content 
mutual attraction is growing

a motion to dismiss drugtrafficking charges 
against panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega has been 
sealed at the request of a prosecutor who says it could influence 
the us presidential election 
but miami attorney neal sonnett noriegas principal lawyer on 
thursday denied noriega was trying to plant a political bombshell 
saying the motion was routine and that prosecutors had an 
overactive imagination 
sonnetts dismissal motion filed thursday was ordered sealed 
in advance by presiding us district court judge william hoeveler 
at the request of prosecutor richard gregorie 
my concern is that noriega would see this as an opportunity to 
put materials in there that could have some bearing on our election 
and might use that as some sort of blackmail to cut himself a deal 
with the us government gregorie said thursday 
i want to be sure that this is not being used as some 
political tool to attempt to coerce the administration into some 
sort of deal he said it doesnt matter to me whos in power 
im a prosecutor not a politician i just dont want them to play 
politics with it 
sonnett has indicated in past hearings that he would argue that 
the indictment should be dismissed because the us government has 
no legal right to indict the panamanian leader and because us 
courts have no jurisdiction to try him 
a 12count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in miami 
in february accused noriega of accepting 46 million in bribes 
from colombias violent medellin drug cartel a grand jury in tampa 
indicted noriega the next day on three marijuana importation counts 
the reagan administration offered in may to drop criminal 
charges against noriega if he agreed to step down but protracted 
negotiations broke down without agreement

ptl founder jim bakker says he doesnt 
have the money to repay his former ministrys 52 million claim 
against him and others but he says that doesnt matter because he 
plans to win the case 
us bankruptcy court judge rufus reynolds halted the trial 
thursday and scheduled it to resume oct 17 reynolds said that 
during the interim he will read depositions from bakker and others 
and defense attorneys will prepare to respond to evidence presented 
by ptl 
attorneys for the fort millbased ministry want bakker his 
wife tammy and former aide david taggart to repay money they say 
was lost through mismanagement of ptl accounts and grossly inflated 
compensation 
when asked outside the courthouse thursday how he would pay if 
he lost the suit bakker responded you cant get blood from a 
turnip i dont intend to lose 
the trial which is being held without a jury began monday 
bakker said in court thursday that ptl attorneys and the irs 
were wrong about the amount of money he received 
i see figures on there charts presented by ptl attorneys 
that i cant recall at all like in 1984 that 390000 bonus i 
cant recall that at all bakker testified 
looking at the charts in this room and the figures and those 
in the irs preliminary report compared to our research shows so 
much error that proper auditing and examining must be done to 
obtain the truth he said 
he said he believes some financial records were destroyed after 
he left the ministry in march 1987 amid a sex and money scandal 
last week bakker had claimed he had the financing to regain 
ptl which reynolds has ordered sold ptl trustee mc red 
benton had called bakker the leading bidder with a 172 million 
offer until bakker could not prove he had the money 
testifying in the bankruptcy court trial this week bakker 
contradicted testimony that the board of directors never approved 
his salaries 
he said his salary was set by the board which also approved his 
raises but earlier former board member charles h cookman 
testified that the board never ruled on salaries 
peter bailey a former accountant and financial director at ptl 
testified that he routinely warned bakker of the financial troubles 
the ministry was having he said top executives received bonuses in 
some cases in anticipation of future donations when there wasnt 
money in the bank to cover the checks 
but bakker attorney ryan hovis told reynolds that the continuing 
financial crisis ptl experienced under bakkers leadership was par 
for the course 
every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of 
financial crisis hovis said it goes with the territory

the government today mocked 
three escaped detainees holed up in the us consulate calling 
them failed martyrs and it pledged to leave them alone if they 
left the building 
but the rev allan boesak a prominent antiapartheid leader 
said the three have no faith whatsoever in the governments 
pledge 
the prominent antiapartheid leaders escaped to the consulate 
tuesday after slipping away from police guards while undergoing 
physiotherapy at a hospital each had been held at least 14 months 
without trial 
so far they have spurned the governments offer to let them 
leave the consulate without fear of being arrested again they are 
seeking assurances possibly guaranteed by the united states that 
they will not be detained or restricted in any way if they leave 
foreign minister pik botha in a statement today said he had 
told us ambassador edward perkins that the south african 
government was not interested in the activists 
as far as i am concerned they are merely guests of the 
american consulgeneral at the expense of the american taxpayer 
botha said they are deeply disappointed that they did not 
succeed in becoming martyrs and the fact that they will have to 
leave the us consulategeneral with their tails between their 
legs with all of south africa laughing at them 
but boesak who met with the activists said they did not 
believe the government 
the government is not to be trusted said boesek president 
of the world alliance of reformed churches 
many activists once freed from detention have been placed 
under restrictions limiting their freedom of movement and barring 
them from political activities the foreign affairs department said 
this would not happen in the case of the three escapees 
there can be no intention to limit them in terms of talking to 
the press or their political activity a botha spokesmen roland 
darroll told the associated press 
but boesak said several activists including aubrey mokoena 
head of the release nelson mandela campaign had been placed 
under restrictions in the past 24 hours 
how can we accept the word of minister of law and order 
adriaan vlok when he offers to let three detainees walk out of 
here free while banning other people on the same day boesak said 
the escapees are murphy morobe acting publicity secretary of 
the banned united democratic front mohammed valli moosa the 
fronts acting general secretary and vusi khanyile chairman of 
the banned national education crisis committee 
morobe and khanyile are black valli moosa is indian 
the activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the 
consulate on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office building 
they rejected proposals to be flown to another country 
us officials say the activists will not be forced to leave the 
consulate despite a worldwide us policy of not formally granting 
asylum in diplomatic offices south africa would need us 
permission to enter the premises 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

campaign trial but is hardly bothered by it 
once in a while you do get sore once in a while you might get 
a little tense but you know when you make a mistake like that i 
expect somebody to jump on me bob hope did it didnt bother me 
johnny carson did it and that didnt bother me bush said 
the subject was first raised in a questionandanswer session at 
the school by a girl who shouted when was pearl harbor 
last week in louisville ky bush mistakenly said the 
anniversary was sept 7 not dec 7 
replying to the girl bush said im glad you asked that 
question you ever made a mistake in your life anybody here i 
know she hasnt 
but has anyone here made a mistake ever come on guys bush 
said 
now let me tell you how that happens its a good question 
fair question i tell you how it happens you get a little tired 
from time to time im glad to be here in connecticut he joked 
but if you really want a serious answer to it i remember 
because i fought for my country in war bush said recounting his 
service as a naval bomber pilot in world war ii and noting that he 
was shot down in combat 
so let there be no mistake about it bush saidi remember 
pearl harbor pretty well firsthand and i hope well never have

solidarity leader lech walesa and a team 
of union activists met with interior minister czeslaw kiszcak today 
to set an agenda for talks on the future of the banned trade union 
the meeting which included at least 10 solidarity members or 
advisers marked the first time since the union was banned in 1982 
that so many union activists sat down with government officials 
the third encounter between walesa and the government began this 
afternoon at an undisclosed location outside warsaw said roman 
catholic church attorney jacek ambroziak 
after two meetings of our chairman alone there is now a 
serious delegation said senior solidarity adviser bronislaw 
geremek 
the expansion of the number of participants in the talks is a 
serious step in the right direction geremek said a solidarity 
delegation is talking to the authorities at last 
at least 23 people including 11 officials led by kiszczak and 
two priests were participating in the talks 
earlier walesa said he was optimistic that broader talks with 
the government on solidarity would begin soon 
the comment came after walesa met for more than four hours 
thursday with kiszcak his second meeting with polish authorities 
in six years 
the two agreed thursday to continue working toward an early 
start of talks on polands future with broader participation 
they also agreed to expand the group of participants at todays 
working meeting and to agree on the topics composition as well as 
the procedure and work schedule of the later talks the staterun 
news service pap said thursday 
walesa told reporters after the meeting that the atmosphere is 
encouraging but difficule problems remain 
the government agreed to the talks and walesa moved to halt a 
wave of strikes last month that posed the most serious threat to 
the government since solidarity was crushed in 1981 it was 
declared illegal a year later 
todays meeting was to include some leaders of solidarity 
strikes last month as well as at least five members of the official 
trade union alliance opzz said franciszek ciemny an opzz 
spokesman 
in another development an official newspaper published an 
interview with walesa for the first time since the imposition of 
martial law in december 1981 
the interview in the september issue of the monthly publication 
konfrontacje which came out thursday seemed to underline walesas 
return to official respectability and the new emphasis on 
considering divergent views 
the monthly sponsored by the official national unity 
organization pron interviewed the solidarity leader at his home on 
sept 1 the day a strike at the gdansk shipyard led by walesa 
ended 
you are the first polish journalists from the officially 
published press to come to me asking for an interview since dec 
13 1981 walesa said referring to the exact date of the martial 
law crackdown that suppressed solidarity the first independent 
trade union movement allowed in the soviet bloc 
there must be solidarity the interview quoted walesa as 
saying but in it he added it certainly does not have to be a 
carbon copy of that of 1981

a federal appeals court today struck down two 
previous orders that had directed the environmental protection 
agency to recalculate automobile fuel economy ratings 
the order by the full us circuit court of appeals here 
relieves the epa of any obligation to comply with the courts 
previous orders to recalculate the fuel economy ratings according 
to a method that could cost ford motor co and general motors corp 
millions of dollars in fines 
the decision today made in a brief order by the courts 11 
members reversed a 55 vote taken may 17 that had upheld a 1986 
ruling by a threejudge panel that the fuel standards be 
recalculated 
in the previous vote the court divided along bitter ideological 
lines over whether the center for auto safety and other petitioners 
had standing to challenge the epas 1985 decision to relax the 
fueleconomy standards 
the epa action had lowered penalties that ford and gm would be 
assessed for failing to meet fleetwide fuel economy standards set 
under the environmental policy and conservation act of 1975 
the law requires manufacturers to be fined 5 for each tenth of 
a mile a car model falls short of the milespergallon standard set 
by the epa regulations manufacturers are given credits for models 
that surpass the standards that can be carried over to subsequent 
model years 
the court said today that after considering the epas motion to 
reconsider that decision we have decided that our original 
disposition was not an appropriate one 
we now hold that as a majority of the court was unable to 
satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction the court should 
not have taken any affirmative action on the merits including 
reinstatement of the panel opinion the court said in an unsigned 
order 
in may the court had said that it would uphold the 1986 ruling 
but that that holding would not become a legal precedent because 
the circuit judges could not agree on the issue of legal standing

the united states and vietnam will begin joint 
efforts to find the remains of american sericemen missing in 
action defense secretary franc c carlucci said today 
his announcent came at a national powmia recognition day 
ceremony on capitol hill where house minority leader robert michel 
urged the administration to press for an accounting of each and 
every one of the 2393 american troops still unaccounted for 
following the vietnam war 
the defense department is committed to doing everything 
possible to resolve the powmia issue successfully carlucci told 
a crowd of several hundred gathered on the capitol steps 
today we are encouraged in our quest but we still await the 
results that we know are possible from those who hold the 
answers he said although last month vietnam temporarily 
suspended its offer to conduct joint operations it recently agreed 
to resume cooperation and i am pleased to announce that joint 
activity will begin on sept 25 
michel rill and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
pledged continued congressional support for efforts to uncover the 
facts about 79000 troops missing in action from world war ii 
8000 from the korean war and those unaccounted for in southeast 
asia 
we must continue to seek the truth about our powmias 
michel said but the two greatest enemies of truth are rumors and 
false hopes 
nothing could be more cruel to the families of mias and pows 
than to lend credence to false rumors to raise hopes without the 
fact to support them to muddy the waters and confuse the issue 
nothing could be more detrimental to this cause than to let emotion 
cloud our judgment 
meanwhile wreath laying ceremonies were scheduled today at the 
arlington national cemetery in memory of pows and mias from the 
korean war 
an organization dedicated to remembering the families of missing 
soldiers no greater love estimates that there are 8100 mias and 
389 pows still unaccounted for in korea

pope john paul ii today bluntly told 
the 20yearold polygamist king of this tiny mountain country that 
god intended a husband to have only one wife 
the pontiff who arrived from lesotho this morning was escorted 
by spearcarrying warriors and soldiers with machine guns into a 
soccer stadium to celebrate mass he first was driven in the wrong 
direction then slipped off a platform without injury 
then the mass was interrupted by the arrival of king mswati iii 
of swaziland who rolled into the stadium in a lincoln limousine to 
the whistles of the crowd a turret manned by a soldier with rifle 
and binoculars topped the altar where a cross was stamped with a 
spear shield and war ax 
mswati acceeded to the throne two years ago he has four wives 
and is engaged to a fifth 
christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the 
foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with 
the original plan of god for marriage the pope told a crowd of 
about 10000 people 
hence any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and 
women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that 
chirst the king of peace brought into the world 
vatican sources said john paul had been warned by local prelates 
to tread carefully before addressing the issue 
king mswati wearing redandwhite robes and with five bird 
feathers decorating his head listened expressionless to the popes 
admonission at the end of the mass in an unscheduled breach of 
protocol the king formally thanked the pope for his visit the two 
met later at the royal palace 
earlier today redcoated soldiers greeted john paul at the 
international airport of manzini when he arrived at the stadium 
the popes open car mistakenly drove out the gate to the dismay of 
the spearcarrying warriors and vatican security men 
after returning to the stadium the pope slipped off a platform 
on the soggy field before climbing onto the altar he was not 
injured 
on thursday in maseru lesotho john paul told about 15000 
young people at a rally to renounce every form of violence and 
hatred in southern africa 
organizers expected 1 million people at the rally and blamed a 
bloody bus hijacking rainy winter weather and expensive 
accommodations such as 25dollaranight tents for the small 
turnout 
the pope visited the queen elizabeth ii hospital in lesotho 
thursday to comfort 20 survivors of the hijacking many still 
shaken from the shootout that ended their 27hour ordeal 
i am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on 
this pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such 
anguish and ended in bloodshed john paul said thursday the day 
after police stormed the bus in lesotho with four hijackers and 71 
hostages aboard including nuns and schoolchildren 
all four hijackers and two passengers including a 14yearold 
girl died in the exchange of gunfire wednesday between authorities 
and the hijackers officials said twenty others were injured 
the government said police stormed the bus after the hijackers 
ordered the driver to crash the vehicle through the closed gate of 
the british high commission the gunman called for a return to 
civilian rule in lesotho they also demanded to meet the pope king 
moshoeshoe ii and the high commissioner 
after his eighthour visit to swaziland today john paul was 
scheduled to continue to wartorn mozambique the last stop on his 
10day tour of five southern african countries the pope also went 
to zimbabwe botswana and made a brief unscheduled stop in south

republican george bush said today rival michael dukakis has 
been made over in an effort to win back democratic voters who 
twice put president reagan in office dukakis was striking an 
anticrime note on the west coast 
bush toured a steel plant in columbus ohio that was once 
headed by his grandfather and sought steelworkers votes by saying 
he had more common ground with them than the democrats 
dukakis was campaigning in southern california stressing the 
fight against drugs and crime with an appearance at a police 
academy the democratic nominee also was expected to announce plans 
to expand the drug enforcement administration if elected 
bush said dukakis was way over in left field on some issues 
of concern to bluecollar workers these people dont want gun 
control they do favor the death penalty the vice president said 
bush referred to dukakis brief ride in an m1 tank earlier this 
week and said you cannot fool the soviet leadership by knocking 
americas defense for 10 years and riding around in a tank for 10 
minutes you cant fool the american people 
the republican nominee said dukakis was modifying his positions 
on defense to woo back the reagan democrats who could decide the 
election 
hes gone to states like this found that his message of 
cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular bush 
said hes coming out with policies quite different but which 
ones do you believe 
running mate dan quayle also assailed dukakis today turning a 
question on his own qualifications into an attack on the democrats 
lack of foreign policy experience i have 12 years of experience 
in congress i understand national security measures which is a 
very important requirement the indiana senator said in overland 
park kan 
a day earlier bush selectively used economic statistics to 
charge tha dukakis had led massachusetts into a budgetary three 
mile island the democratic nominee initially reluctant to join 
the rhetorical fray defended his states economy as sound 
questioned about bushs charges a reticent dukakis told 
reporters joining him on a tour of fireravaged yellowstone 
national park that he would reserve comment until sometime next 
week 
but later the democratic nominee chose to respond to the 
attacks and cited his states low unemployment rate 3 percent 
and 10 straight balanced budgets 
upon arriving in los angeles dukakis again without prompting 
told reporters what mr bush has given us is a mountain of debt 
record deficits a record trade deficit and an economic future that 
does not bode well for the american people 
two days before the summer olympics bush told a business group 
in san francisco that dukakis is the gold medal winner in the 
taxandspend competition 
the republican nominee added under my opponent massachusetts 
has lost lost 26000 jobs since 1983 more than any other state 
in the country 
federal figures show that massachusetts has gained more than 
230000 jobs in the past five years while losing manufacturing 
jobs the text of the vice presidents speech said manufacturing 
jobs and bush aides said the campaign stands by that description 
bush also said that as governor dukakis has tried to raise 
taxes five times including a 180 million jump in business taxes 
sales taxes and personal income taxes this past summer 
there have been no broadbased tax increases in dukakis two 
terms as governor beginning in 1983 while there have been numerous 
tax cuts but bush said correctly that dukakis pushed through a 
major tax increase in 1975 during his first term that hike was 
repealed when taxpayers rebelled 
the fact is the socalled massachusetts miracle is really the 
massachusetts mirage and right now that state is approaching a 
fiscal fiasco that might best be described as a budgetary three 
mile island facing a budgetary meltdown the vice president 
said 
in los angeles dukakis answered the charge saying anybody 
whod compare my states economy with three mile island must be 
suffering meltdown 
one debate the democratic nominee refused to get involved in was 
the argument over whether the forest fires that have decimated the 
west should have been allowed to burn unchecked 
this isnt the time to discuss what might have been or should 
be dukakis said as he toured the park everbody agrees that 
once the fires are out itll be a good time to sit down and think 
through exactly how we deal with this problem in the future 
bush at a questionandanswer session with high school students 
in concord calif was drawn into the question of a pardon for 
irancontra figure oliver north 
the question is for me pardon imputes guilt and therefore i 
have refused to speculate on this because i want to see this man 
have a fair trial i hope hes found innocent 
in my description anybody that shed his blood in vietnam with 
two or three purple hearts is a hero for that bush said now 
did he make some mistakes maybe so but youre not going to see me 
picking on ollie north 
one high school girl teased bush about his verbal faux pas last 
week on the date of the japanese attack on pearl harbor the vice 
president mistakenly said the anniversary was sept 7 ot dec 7 
when was pearl harbor she asked 
bush joked about being in connecticut rather than california 
asked the girl if she ever made a mistake and then recalled his 
service as a naval bomber pilot in world war ii 
i remember pearl harbor pretty well firsthand and i hope 
well never have another one

a man who claimed to be liberaces lover gave 
evidence leading to new murder charges in a 1981 quadruple slaying 
for which pornographic film star john holmes was acquitted it was 
reported today 
scott thorson who is awaiting sentencing for a drugrelated 
armed robbery linked convicted cocaine dealer adel nasrallah to 
the bludgeoning attack on five people at a hillside home in 
exclusive laurel canyon the los angeles times reported the story 
cited unidentified sources familiar with the case 
nasrallah 59 who goes by the name of eddie nash and his 
former bodyguard gregory dewitt diles 40 were charged sept 8 
with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the 
case 
neither have entered pleas to the charges and both are being 
held without bail if convicted they could face the death penalty 
holmes king of pornographic films in the 1970s was 
unsuccessfully prosecuted for the murders in 1982 he died of 
aidsrelated complications in march at the age of 43 
thorson 29 is being held under tight security at the county 
jail while he awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to the armed 
robbery 
when the charges against nash and diles were filed deputy 
district attorney dale a davidson said new witnesses had come 
forward but declined to identify them or discuss the evidence 
on thursday he refused to say whether thorson will be called to 
testify against nash thorsons attorney in the robbery case 
deputy public defender cathy dreyfuss also declined to comment 
the times quoted sources as saying that thorson who lived with 
liberace and served as the pianists chauffeur secretary and by 
his own account his lover from 1977 until 1982 also maintained a 
close relationship with nash during much of that period 
eddie was scotts cocaine connection the newspaper quoted 
one source as saying 
according to testimony at holmes 1982 trial the porn star once 
told los angeles police that he had led killers to a home in laurel 
canyon at the request of nash who prosecutors said wanted revenge 
because he had been robbed two days earlier 
four people were bludgeoned to death the fifth survived but was 
unable to identify her attackers 
thorson filed a highly publicized lawsuit against liberace in 
1982 in which he contended that the entertainer who never 
acknowledged being a homosexual had reneged on promises to support 
him for the rest of his life the suit was settled out of court 
shortly before liberace died of aids in 1987

republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle said today his experience in congress and understand of 
national security issues qualify him for high office and that his 
youth should not be any barrier 
addressing the suburban overland park chamber of commerce before 
campaigning in nebraska and iowa the indiana senator also joked 
that his campaign managers sometimes try to hide him from the 
public when things go wrong 
sometimes they tell you to go to your room quayle said 
and with some of the comments that ive made ive been told that 
several times its no fun sitting alone in your room 
dealing with the issue of his fitness to serve as vice 
president quayle said 
i have 12 years of experience in congress i understand 
national security measures which is a very important requirement 
a lot has been made about my age and that 41 is too young jack 
kennedy was about my age when he ran for president 
john f kennedy was 43 when he beat republican vice president 
richard nixon for the presidency in 1960 
at oklahoma city on thursday at his first news conference in 
two weeks quayle said that the voters eventually will see the 
real dan quayle what he stands for and make up their own minds 
he dismissed as irrelevant questions about his past such as 
his college performance and why he did not make public his academic 
records 
quayle has said he did not want reporters scrutinizing his less 
than stellar grades 
winston churchill was not a great student quayle said he 
was a great leader fdr franklin d roosevelt failed the bar 
examination a number of times he turned out to be a great 
president 
according to biographies roosevelt entered columbia university 
law school in 1904 a year after graduating from harvard he took 
and passed the bar examination in 1907 and left columbia that year 
before receiving a degree 
referring to controversies over his military service during the 
vietnam war his academic performance and his personal life quayle 
said he was not going to focus on what i have done in the past 
but on what i stand for what i articulate to the american 
people 
the american people will judge me on what i am saying and what 
i have done in the last 12 years in the congress he said 
quayle said he was not worried about a poll this week indicating 
that a substantial portion of likely voters have reservations about 
his credentials to serve in high office 
a cbsnew york times poll found that onethird of those 
responding said quayle was qualified to be president compared with 
threefifths who said the same of his democratic counterpart sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas 
i think its fair to say that in the last few weeks the 
american people have been told a different story about dan quayle 
than what dan quayle has tried to communicate to the american 
people he said 
quayle was asked to explain his comment last week that mikhail 
s gorbachev was no different from other soviet leaders and that 
his perestroika policy of economic restructuring was nothing more 
than refined stalinism 
i have a hunch that restructuring in fact is to make sure that 
gorbachev gets his people into the political system and the people 
who are not supporting him out quayle said that is classic 
stalinism thats the way stalin ran the country 
quayle was asked how he would finance such costly proposals as 
modernizing us strategic nuclear missiles and president reagans 
star wars plan for a spacebased missile defense system at a time 
of steep budget deficits 
there will be some tough choices quayle replied 
he said defense budget increases would have to be limited to 1 
percent to 2 percent above inflation over the next two to five 
years

a group of house republicans charged today 
that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis appointed 
three antiisraeli propalestinian members to the partys 
ruling body and challenged him to dismiss them 
the challenge was a clear effort to counter problems in the 
campaign of gop nominee george bush who has dumped eight campaign 
advisers in the past week following charges of antisemitism 
against them 
rep norman lent rny said the three objectionable members 
were appointed to the 400member democratic national committee 
following the partys july convention in atlanta as a gesture of 
conciliation to defeated presidential contender jesse jackson 
he identified the three as the rev willie barrow executive 
director of jacksons chicagobased operation push robert farrell 
a los angeles city councilman and close jackson associate and ruth 
ann skaff of houston whom he said is a spokeswoman for the 
propalestinian ad hoc committtee on lebanon 
lent said barrow and farrell are supporters of radical muslim 
leader louis farrakhan who has made antisemitic statements he 
said skaff has led antiisrael demonstrations 
the presence of the three on the democratic team raises 
questions about michael dukakis judgment and his submission to 
jesse jackson lent said at a news conference obviously 
governor dukakis has failed to grasp the message his appointments 
send 
lent said bush had acted quickly to clean house when similar 
allegations were raised about members of an ethnic coaliton 
supporting his campaign and when it was reported that bush adviser 
frederic v malek made a count of jews in key jobs at the bureau of 
labor statistics in 1971 
its time for michael dukakis to show that he truly is in 
charge lent said he is the nominee of his party and should 
have control over the party structure 
appearing with lent were reps benjamin gilman rny john 
miller rwash guy molinari rny and vin weber rminn 
another republican member of congress sen rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota told reporters he had turned down a request from bush 
campaign aides take part in the attack 
i dont want to do it boschwitz a prominent jewish 
politican i dont think theres any political future in these 
charges and countercharges 
two of the three dnc members under attack skaff and farrell 
defended their stance on israel barrow could not be reached 
immediately for comment 
attacking individuals such as myself and rev willie barrow 
and councilman farrell is a desperate and dangerous move by the 
bush campaign said skaff the texas coordinator for the arab 
american institute 
targeting me as an arabamerican and targeting my views on 
this issue truly endangers the political security of americans of 
arab heritage am i guilty of crime because my grandparents came 
from lebanon she said 
skaff said she favors an independent palestinian state but only 
premised upon the security of israel and she said that she has 
always condemned terrorism but recognizes the palestine liberation 
organization because palestinians have themselves chosen the group 
as their representative 
farrell was criticized in 1985 when he refused to sign a 
newspaper ad condemning antisemitic remarks attributed to louis 
farrakhan leader of the nation of islam 
farrell said thursday he was unaware of the farrakhan remarks at 
the time and that he would gladly sign any letter opposing 
antisemitic remarks 
im very disappointed in someone in the republican camp who 
would take something as serious as relationships between blacks and 
jews and exacerbate them for political gain he said 
barrow was quoted in a 1985 article in the washington post as 
saying i love my brother minister louis farrakhan the devil 
dont like it chicago dont like it the world dont like it but 
we love it 
she said thursday she was praising farrakhans role in 
encouraging economic development in black communities at a meeting 
held to discuss that development 
she said she supports a palestinian homeland along with israeli 
security 
bushs campaign could not immediately be reached for comment 
a spokeswoman for the democratic national committee robin 
diamond said that body had no immediate comment

the nicaraguan contras have accepted a 
sandinista offer to hold preliminary talks in guatemala city on 
monday to end the conflict in the central american country and have 
set up meetings today with us congressional leaders 
we hope we can achieve a breakthrough and create momentum 
bosco matamoros a spokesman for the contra rebels who oppose 
nicaraguas marxist government said thursday 
he said the resistance had urged the sandinistas to then proceed 
to highlevel talks sept 2628 in guatemala costa rica or the 
dominican republic 
but matamoros said the nicaraguan government would have to free 
all remaining political prisoners and permit freedom of 
expression for negotiations to succeed 
it was not clear whether this amounted to the contras setting 
conditions and whether they would be acceptable to the sandinistas 
in the meantime contra leaders planned separate meetings on 
capitol hill with speaker jim wight dtexas and house republican 
leader bob michael of illinois 
we are concerned there be an adequate climate and we ask the 
government of nicaragua to remove these obstacles matamoros said 
he said victor tinoco nicaraguas vice minister of foreign 
affairs had been notified in managua of the contras acceptance of 
the preliminary meeting 
at the same time matamoros stressed it was up to the 
sandinistas to create a favorable climate for a round of 
negotiations at the high level to work out a peaceful settlement 
negotiations between the two sides broke down in managua in june 
after 11 weeks in a dispute over whether the steps demanded by the 
contras were part of a central american peace plan 
the sandinistas say the negotiations collapsed because of 
lastminute contra demands over what were essentially domestic 
political issues 
secretary of state george p shultz met wednesday with 
resistance leaders matamoros and a us official said the decision 
to accept the sandinista offer for a preliminary meeting was made 
independently by the resistance group 
asked if the preliminary talks would lead to highlevel 
negotiations and a settlement the official said it depends on 
the sandinistas and whether they were willing to release arrested 
demonstrators and lift restrictions on la prensa and a roman 
catholic radio station 
the reagan administration repeatedly has called on nicaragua for 
political reforms while urging congress to finance arms and other 
support for the contras who are fighting to bring down the leftist 
government

democrat michael dukakis saying the reagan 
administation has shortchanged the war on drugs promised today he 
would double the number of federal drug agents and hire more 
federal prosecutors 
we are going to give state and local law enforcement officers 
the money to fight the war dukakis said in remarks prepared for 
delivery at the los angeles police academy 
were not going to try to nickel and dime you to death as 
this administation has done he said 
dukakis said that as president he would double the number of 
federal drug enforcement administation officials over five years 
aides to dukakis said he was prepared to spend 50 million to 
hire 600 new agents next year toward the goal of 2800 new agents 
he said he would put 100 of those new agents in southern 
california where he was campaigning today 
the dukakis campaign said the candidate was committed to hiring 
800 more federal prosecutors to help handle drug cases and other 
crimes 
dukakis ridiculed remarks by vice president george bush two days 
ago in san francisco quoting bush as saying he is almost 
haunted by severe drug problems in inner cities 
dukakis said american children do not need our pity they 
need strong leaders and first rate law enforcement officers 
they dont need a change of heart in washington they need a change 
of leadership 
on thursday dukakis traveled to the charred forests of 
yellowstone national park to show support for firefighters 
standing across a river gorge from a blackened hillside dukakis 
refused to be drawn into the debate in the west over whether the 
reagan administration should have acted sooner following national 
park service policy the government allowed those fires that were 
ignited naturally to burn themselves out until late july 
this isnt the time to discuss what might have been or should 
be dukakis said everybody agrees that once the fires are out 
itll be a good time to sit down and think through exactly how we 
deal with this problem in the future 
the democratic nominee putting aside his newly aggressive 
demeanor for a moment sounded nearly as cautious when asked about 
bushs assault on his economic record as governor of massachusetts 
an area dukakis made the centerpiece of his candidacy 
ill be responding to that sometime next week dukakis said 
at first good luck to mr bush 
bush the republican nominee said dukakis state led in 
spending increases and was second in tax increases under his 
administrations and called him the gold medal winner in he 
taxandspend competition 
several minutes later appearing to reconsider the notion of 
allowing bushs charges to go unanswered dukakis delivered a 
response without prompting arriving in los angeles later he again 
volunteered a reaction 
weve balanced 10 budgets in a row we have a 3 percent 
unemployment rate we have more jobs than people to fill them 
personal income is rising at the second fastest rate in the nation 
and weve cut taxes five times in the last five yearrs he said 
what mr bush has given us is a mountain of debt record 
deficits and record trade deficts and an economic future which 
does not bode well for the american people 
the issue of when to battle forest fires has produced divisions 
in the rocky mountain states and poses political pitfalls interior 
secretary donald hodel has suggested the policy may be changed but 
the policy of letting fires burn themselves out unless they 
threaten lives or structures has won support from some 
environmentalists who argue that fire is a natural process that 
makes way for new growth 
dukakis said he wanted to hear more about the issue but he 
recognized that argument 
dukakis has campaigned in the rocky mountain states and at the 
height of his midsummer popularity aides were speaking hopefully 
of the nominees chances in those states especially montana but 
as the race has tightened everywhere the rocky mountain states 
which have been reliably republican in presidential races even 
though they elect democratic state officials are looking 
increasingly difficult for dukakis

hurricanes of the future may be even more 
powerful than any that have come before as a result of the 
socalled greenhouse effect warming of the earth a scientist is 
warning 
kerry a emanuel of the meteorology department at massachusetts 
institute of technology expressed his concern even as hurricane 
gilbert perhaps the most powerful tropical storm of the century 
was churning a path of destruction through the gulf of mexico 
because hurricanes gain their energy from the warm ocean waters 
in tropical areas rising temperatures could increase the strength 
of these storms in the future he explained in a telephone 
interview 
over the warmest parts of the oceans a change in seasurface 
temperature of 1 degree celsius 16 degrees fahrenheit will 
change the minimum sustainable pressure in a hurricane by 15 to 
20 millibars emanuel reported 
the pressure in the center of a hurricane is generally 
considered a good indication of its strength with lower pressures 
indicating a more powerful storm normal sea level pressure is 
1013 millibars while in a powerful storms like gilbert readings 
can drop into the high 800s 
emanuel commented however that its too soon to tell whether 
hurricane gilbert is a product of the greenhouse warming 
this is kind of an extraordinary hurricane but i dont think 
we can take it as an indication we are seeing any kind of trend 
he said if the predictions of some climate models come true and 
thats a pretty big if we can expect to see some more intense 
hurricanes in 50 years or so 
that means the strong storms of the future would be more 
powerful than the strong ones of today he explained although 
there wouldnt necessarily be more storms 
there generally seems to be a limit to how low the pressure can 
fall in even the strongest storms explained emanuel but warmer 
ocean waters could lower that limit and that he said is what 
could result in the stronger storms 
the greenhouse effect has been widely reported in recent years 
climate experts explain it as the result of increasing carbon 
dioxide and other polluting gases in the atmosphere 
those gases allow the incoming sunlight to continue to warm the 
earth but block some outgoing radiation leading to a gradual 
increase in the planets temperature it is a situation similar to 
that of a greenhouse where heat from the sun is captured to warm 
plants 
studies by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 25 
percent since the mid1800s and continues to grow scientists have 
estimated that the overall temperature of the earth has risen by 
more than 1 degree fahrenheit over the same time and could rise by 
another 2 degrees over the next few decades 
computerized models using complex mathematical formulas to 
predict the result of such a warming have warned of a variety of 
dire consequences ranging from drought over croplands to melting of 
the polar ice caps raising sea levels and inundating coastal 
communities 
emanuel is the author of a study toward a general theory of 
hurricanes which appears in the julyaugust edition of american 
scientist 
in it he noted that while many things about the giant tropical 
storms remain a mystery in recent years scientists have come to a 
better understanding of the storms 
the power for hurricanes he explained comes from the transfer 
of moisture and energy from the oceans into the overlying air this 
air rises forming a low pressure area and wind from surrounding 
area begins blowing in a spiral toward that center bringing in 
more moisture from the warm ocean 
since the rate of evaporation increases with wind speed the 
faster the wind the more water and energy it can pick up in the 
storm 
the inwardflowing air cannot get to the actual center of the 
storm because the laws of physics would cause it to increase its 
spin to an infinite velocity emanuel explains thus at some 
point the wind stops moving inward and begins to ascend forming 
the wellknown cloudy eyewall of a hurricane 
because ocean heat drives these big storms scientists have 
found that among the conditions necessary before a hurricane can 
form is an ocean temperature of 26 degrees celsius about 82 
degrees fahrenheit and that warm water needs to extend down about 
60 meters or 165 feet 
in addition the storms will not form if there are strong cross 
winds which disrupt the rising motion that helps form the center 
of the storms

republican george bush said today that 
democratic rival michael dukakis is a campaign convert on defense 
issues who is trying to fool american voters and soviet leaders 
by riding around in a tank for 10 minutes 
bush said photographs of dukakis wearing a military helmet and 
riding in an m1 tank at a defense contractors plant in michigan 
earlier this week were at odds with his record on national defense 
all i can do is cite his position bush said declaring that 
dukakis has opposed the railroadbased mx missile the midgetman 
missile and the b1 bomber 
now suddenly he rides around in a tank jumps out of the tank 
takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions the 
gop nominee said as he toured the buckeye steel co plant in 
columbus under the silent gaze of steelworkers some wearing 
dukakis tshirts 
dukakis opposes the mx and midgetman missile programs and 
initially expressed opposition to the b1 bomber although he said 
later that production of the aircraft should be allowed to proceed 
bush said he was encouraged by the reception he received from 
the steelworkers at the plant where his grandfather samuel 
prescott bush was once president about 150 employees stood 
quietly throughout the speech neither jeering nor applauding 
admittedly the applause meter didnt go off the chart bush 
said nor did the boo meter go off the chart these days we 
measure things by both meters 
bush said dukakis was way over in left field on some issues 
of concern to bluecollar workers these people dont want gun 
control they do favor the death penalty the vice president said 
in findlay ohio a city that calls itself flag city usa 
bush declared that the flag is back and then seemed to stumble 
into the pledge of allegiance 
at a flagdraped rally bush said what is it all about its 
the symbol of these united states of america and to the liberty 
for which it stands one nation under god with freedom and justice 
for all and lets never forget it 
bush told reporters in columbus that dukakis is tailoring his 
message in an effort gain the support of democrats voters who 
previously had voted for president reagan 
hes gone to states like this found that his message of 
cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular and 
so now hes been made over bush said hes coming out with 
policies quite different but which ones do you believe you 
believe this 30day conversion as you climb out of a tank 
the vice president added 
the tanks did not fit its time to take another message to 
michael its very straightforward you cannot fool the soviet 
leadership by knocking americas defense for 10 years and riding 
around in a tank for 10 minutes you cant fool the american 
people 
bush also made an apparent misstatement saying he stands for 
antisemitism when asked about the resignation of six probush 
campaign aides on ethnic groups who allegedly had pronazi or 
antisemitic ties he said the aides left voluntarily to avoid 
diverting attention from campaign issues 
i hope i stand for antibigotry antisemitism antiracism 
bush said that is what drives me its one of the things that i 
feel very strongly about 
the gop nominee said in california on thursday that he hoped 
former white house aide oliver north would be exonerated of all 
charges stemming from his role in the irancontra affair 
but bush refused to rule out a presidential pardon if north is 
found guilty and today he ducked a question whether he would 
offer north a job in any bush administration 
bush stopped in columbus on his return to washington after a 
twoday campaign swing through california highlighted by a 
statistical assault on dukakis as an olympicclass 
taxandspend governor of massachusetts 
trying to project a disastrous us economy under a dukakis 
administration bush said the massachusetts governor had presided 
over a state that lost 26000 jobs since 1983 the text of the 
speech said manufacturing jobs but bush skipped over the word 
press secretary sheila tate said the omission was inadvertent 
official figures also show that under dukakis the states job 
market as a whole has seen a fiveyear increase of 230000 jobs to 
more than offset the loss of manufacturing jobs 
on another point bush said massachusetts in the last two years 
has turned a surplus into a growing budget deficit that according 
to massachussetts legislators appears to be approaching 500 to 
700 million for fiscal 1989 
in fact the state has no deficit now and tate said the vice 
president was only referring to the future projected deficit 
massachusetts in fiscal 1988 had a 67 million surplus after 
cutting 450 million in spending and dipping into some reserve 
accounts critics questioned the surplus and said it could only be 
the result of tax and fee increases government borrowing and a 
raid on the state pension fund 
bush also noted that dukakis has borrowed about 200 million a 
month since june for operations and bush called it lastditch 
borrowing 
but dukakis says the shortterm loans are needed to cover 
municipal aid that is now dispensed in a lump sum annually instead 
of in periodic installments as was the case before 1986 and that 
helps the local municipalities avoid heavy borrowing while waiting 
for state aid 
on taxes bush listed massachusetts as second in the nation in 
growth in per capita taxes since 1963 
that means taxes are higher per person than in any state but 
connecticut but it is not due to a tax hike by dukakis bush 
economics adviser michael boskin acknowledged 
in fact there have been no broadbased tax increases in dukakis 
two terms that began in 1983 
tax revenues went way up due to growth in income and other 
economic factors boskin said adding that the bush criticism is 
that dukakis let the taxes rise without instituting any relief for 
taxpayers 
hes allowed them to rise without returning them to 
taxpayers or seeking tax limitation measures as other states have 
done said boskin 
there have been numerous tax cuts during dukakis last two terms

firefighters battling 
wildfires contended with higher winds today and looked forward to 
an approaching canadian cold front expected to bring showers and 
cooler temperatures to burning woodlands this weekend 
on thursday presidential candidate michael dukakis gave crews 
at fireblackened yellowstone national park a pep talk and 
expressed awe at natures devastation 
i cant remember a year in my lifetime when the weather seemed 
to be more important to us in many ways the 55yearold democrat 
said during his tour of the park 
the drought the heat and now a massive hurricane bearing 
down on us are reminding us not only of our mortality but of the 
importance of pulling together and caring for each other the 
massachusetts governor said 
blazes burned today in wyoming montana idaho oregon and 
washington state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued 
more than 4 million acres including 21 million acres in alaska 
have gone up in smoke 
the 8400 soldiers and civilian firefighters in droughtparched 
yellowstone got a break this week from cooler calmer weather but 
park superintendent bob barbee said were not out of the woods 
yet 
firefighters continued to beef up protection of areas that could 
be threatened if conditions worsened efforts thursday focused on 
lake village which could be threatened by a 335000acre fire 
said fire information officer bob valen 
winds kicked up today and were expected to hit 20 to 35 mph but 
the forecast contained some good news a canadian cold front 
bearing cool rainy weather was expected to reach yellowstone by 
sunday 
the wind will definitely make increased fire activity but we 
dont anticipate any runs like we had last weekend said park 
spokeswoman linda miller 
dukakis toured yellowstone with the democratic governors of 
wyoming montana colorado and idaho 
i know i speak for every single american citizen when i tell 
you we are grateful to you and i know you have been taking on what 
is a massive undertaking dukakis told firefighters adding he 
was awestruck by whats happened here 
the fires which now form one huge blaze have affected 11 
million acres of the 22 millionacre park but according to new 
infrared scans they have burned only about 50 to 60 percent of the 
land within fire perimeters 
dukakis refused to be drawn into the debate over whether the 
reagan administration should have acted sooner following national 
park service policy the government allowed naturally ignited fires 
to burn until july 
the other governors agreed that the park service should have 
attacked the fires sooner because of this years dry conditions 
said colorado gov roy romer 
interior secretary donald hodel has said the letburn policy 
may be changed 
in westcentral montana today a battalion of 540 soldiers from 
washington state were on fire lines relieving weary firefighters 
mopping up the smoldering 247000acre canyon creek fire 
it looks real good the forecast is for additional 
precipitation in fact its showering here right now fire 
information officer jack kendley said today 
in glacier national park near the canadian border winds and 
temperatures in the 80s kept nearly 1000 firefighters busy 
officials expected the fire to continue spreading east today as 
shifting winds gust to 25 mph said fire information officer jim 
payne 
weve got a sleeping giant thats tied down pretty well 
except hes trying to wiggle free on the northeast side payne 
said today the fire grew by about 2000 acres overnight to 34500 
acres 
the approaching canadian cold front may bring rain to the area 
this weekend or even snow at higher elevations forecasters said 
were all hoping for snow tomorrow every one of us said 
spokeswoman stephanie gibert 
in idaho about 300000 acres of forest fires continued to burn 
in washington officials said land in the eastern section of the 
state would be reopened to the public this weekend due to gains 
made against wildfires a ban on hunting and fishing was to be 
lifted at midnight tonight and statewide bans on logging were 
relaxed 
in oregon 14 more fire crews were ordered into the struggle 
against a blaze in willamette national forest boosting the force 
to more than 1600 firefighters and support crews hot windy 
weather was predicted this weekend 
infrared aerial photographs taken thursday night put the fire at 
7232 acres an increase of 882 acres over the previous night 
the main objective is to hit the fire hard the next two to

the first uso club is moving due to fewer 
customers and a less than wholesome environment for the 
military officials said 
the bob hope uso club which opened in 1940 and became a spot 
where soldiers rubbed elbows with stars is moving to long beach in 
december with a satellite club in barstow 
thats where the military is anne milkes the 
organizations executive director said thursday we decided to 
take mohammed to the mountain 
the hollywood uso club was a model for the chain of uso clubs 
chartered by congress in 1941 to serve the military overseas 
at its height the hollywood center attracted up to 25000 
servicemen a year ms milkes said 
but now most service people in the area are unwilling to make 
the trek to hollywood where the uso shares a street with a club 
featuring nude dancers 
we wanted to provide a wholesome environment for young people 
and hollywood had a lot of problems ms milkes said 
its two new locations are accessible to 60000 military 
personnel she said 
not everyone in long beach is pleased with the move 
its going to kill the rest of the businesses downtown 
complained marcia lamb coowner of overreact gallery an art 
gallery across the street from the new uso site were trying to 
develop a community feeling and a reputation for a certain 
consistent type of nighttime entertainment 
but ms milkes said such fears are based on outdated perceptions 
those who object are carrying around an image of drunken 
sailors from the past she said

authorities said 
an investigation by the lane county medical examiners office 
determined that joseph a kight of creswell died from an injury 
after he was struck in the upper abdomen by a teenage friend 
police are not releasing the name of the friend because he is a 
juvenile 
police said the boys were trading punches in a friendly manner 
on aug 9 when kight collapsed

a taxreform group said it will appeal 
a court ruling that overturned proposition 62 the 1986 initiative 
that requires local governments to seek voter approval for local 
taxes 
proposition 62 a finetuning of the landmark taxcapping 
proposition 13 that was championed by the late tax reformer howard 
jarvis was overturned thursday by the states 4th district court 
of appeal 
the unanimous decision said requiring voter approval constitutes 
a gross interference with the fiscal responsiblity of local 
governments 
its a sad day for the california taxpayer said joel fox a 
spokesman for the california tax reduction movement in los angeles 
the antitax group campaigned for proposition 62 after jarvis died 
in 1986 
fox said his organization would appeal the ruling to the state 
supreme court if the high court refuses to hear the case fox said 
his group would consider another initiative campaign 
the appellate court reversed a decision in january by a superior 
court judge who upheld proposition 62 against a challenge brought 
by the city of westminster 
the appellate court ruling said westminster has authority to 
impose a tax on utility users without a citywide vote 
a similar case is before the states 1st district court of 
appeal in san francisco

of hurricane gilbert this week he recalled the 1935 hurricane that 
claimed 50 relatives when it blasted the florida keys with 200 mph 
wind and a 15foot wall of water 
ive been following this thing and i know the 1935 hurricane 
was tougher no maybe about that said russell who lost his 
mother three sisters grandparents aunts uncles nephews and 
cousins in the labor day hurricane one of only two category 5 
hurricanes to make us landfall since recordkeeping began 
when i see the pictures from jamaica you can see tall coconut 
palm trees still standing there wasnt one left on my island 
only stumps russell 69 said by telephone thursday from his 
daughters home in frostproof fla 
gilbert was a category 4 storm when it devastated jamaica this 
week then strengthened to category 5 which signifies sustained 
wind speed greater than 155 mph and interior barometric pressure 
less than 2717 inches and other factors 
after crossing mexicos yucatan peninsula gilbert had declined 
to category 3 on its way to landfall near the texasmexican border 
friday it had killed more than 50 people 
russell then 17 was in the center of the 1935 hurricanes 
14milewide swath that destroyed a railroad peeled the matecumbe 
keys down to bare rock and killed 600 408 in the keys the retired 
carpenter still lives at islamorada in upper matecumbe 
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said 
gilbert at its peak was bigger in size and stronger in barometric 
pressure than the one that struck sept 2 1935 although the 
earlier one was more powerful when it struck land 
the other category 5 hurricane to make us landfall was 
camille which killed 256 in the mississippi coastal area in 1969 
in an interview at the time of the 50year anniversary of the 
keys hurricane russell relived the giant storm that was forecast 
to move into the florida straits between key west and cuba but 
after a morning of sunshine winds became ferocious and heavy rain 
fell 
what was known then as the us weather bureau was unaware the 
hurricane had changed course 
at 8 pm it got so black you couldnt see your hand in front 
of your face russell said he and his family sought refuge in a 
nearby building 
the building began to shake and muddy water came in under the 
door my father said wed have to leave the building he told us to 
grab hold of each other and try to hang together 
we opened the back door and became separated i was holding 
onto my sisters and nephews but we were pulled apart he said 
russell grabbed the door frame as the building toppled 
there was debris everywhere it was a boiling pot the water 
rose quickly and my leg got caught i stretched my neck and cupped 
my hands over my mouth as the water got higher 
i heard a voice in the distance and i kept yelling at the 
person to keep yelling later i worked down the pile of trash and 
my face pushed into something it was my father the voice i heard 
in the distance he had been only an arms length away 
one of my cousins was found 40 miles from here recalled

anyone who wants to buy a condom in the 
city limits had better see a doctor a pharmacist or a patent 
medicine store according to a municipal ordinance that just about 
everyone agrees cant be enforced 
the 1953 law limits the places that can sell contraceptives it 
also prohibits the display or advertising of contraceptives or 
sexinciting devices apparently meaning that marshall 
university officials became lawbreakers when they began selling 
condoms from vending machines three weeks ago 
obviously if we had known about it we would have checked it 
out and confronted the issue said ray welty the marshall 
administrator in charge of vending 
city attorney charles f dodrill said thursday the law cant be 
enforced because the us supreme court voided similar laws as

senate democrats offered friday to expand 
slightly an existing subminimum wage for fulltime students to head 
off what they called a hire em and fire em 90day training 
wage backed by republicans 
sen edward m kennedy dmass offered an amendment to his 
bill raising the minimum wage from its current 335 an hour to 
455 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12 
students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week 
at 85 percent of the minimum wage 
only about 100000 students are now earning the 285 subminimum 
wage according to labor department officials compared with 
515000 students in 1978 kennedy said his proposal would allow 
employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage 
on their payrolls 
the tactic was aimed at heading off a republican amendment by 
sen orrin hatch of utah to establish an 80 percent training wage 
for newly hired workers for up to 90 days 
hatch indicated that republicans were unwilling to vote friday 
on kennedys student wage putting off the key 
republicandemocratic showdown on the politically volatile minimum 
wage issue until next week eight weeks before the november 
election 
president reagan vice president george bush and sen dan 
quayle rind bushs running mate in the past have all 
conditioned any increase in the minimum wage to a massive expansion 
of the subminimum wage 
bush campaigning in ohio refused again friday to specify how 
big of an increase in the minimum wage he favored 
i dont know how much of an increase he said but repeated 
that any upward adjustment should be coupled with a differential 
for a lower training wage 
quayle silent on the subject in recent days offered an 
amendment while the bill was still in the senate labor committee in 
june to couple a minimum wage increase to 4 an hour over two years 
with a subminimum training wage the amendment was never voted on 
kennedy complained none of the republican training wage 
proposals require employers to provide any training he said the 
real purpose was to give employers a windfall lower wage in 
jobs that have turnover rates of up to 400 percent a year 
who honestly believes that it takes three months for someone 
to learn to mop a floor or change the sheets on a bed kennedy 
said this is a pure and simple wage cut 
he said the republican proposal would provide employers with a 
powerful incentive to throw working families out on the street 
once every 90 days and replace them with a new force of trainees 
this is the hire em and fire em wage maybe we can call it 
the churn em and burn em wage kennedy said the bush push 
will turn americas working people into vagabonds and gypsies 
thrown from job to job every three months can this be what george 
bush means when he talks about a kinder gentler america 
hatch called kennedys counterproposal for an expansion of the 
currently allowed student waivers a not really very effective 
bureaucratic way of doing things 
the purpose of the training wage is not to help fulltime 
students hatch said the purpose is to open the door of 
opportunity for those who have nothing who are undereducated 
unskilled 
hatch cited various studies estimating that increasing the 
minimum wage would cause the loss of between 200000 and 800000 
new jobs over the next three years 
the reason 16 million new jobs 12 million of them at 10 an 
hour or more have been created since 1981 is because we havent 
had an increase in the minimum wage he said 
the federally mandated wage floor has been frozen at 335 since 
january 1981 the longest time in its 50year history without an 
increase meanwhile its purchasing power has dropped 30 percent to 
260 measured in todays dollars 
kennedys bill would raise by 40cent increments each year to 
375 in 1989 415 in 1989 and 455 in 1990 a total of 358 
percent over the three years it also would increase the exemption 
for small businesses from the current threshold of 362000 in 
gross sales to 500000 
according to labor department figures about 67 million workers 
were paid the minimum wage or less in 1986 but the bill also would 
directly benefit 115 million other workers earning between 335 
and 450 
house speaker jim wright dtex said friday that the house is 
awaiting senate action before considering the issue 
the likelihood is well take it up vote pass it he said

a doctor who treated michael k deaver for 
alcoholism testified friday that the former presidential aide 
suffered memory impairment when he took tranquilizers during 
hospital treatment for the disease 
dr william e flynn said the combination of alcohol withdrawal 
and heavy doses of the tranqilizer valium impaired deavers 
judgment and memory during a 1985 hospital stay 
he wasnt really processing or dealing with things in an 
appropriate manner said flynn head of the alcoholism clinic at 
georgetown university hospital flynn testified at a court hearing 
on deavers medical condition 
defense lawyers are trying to convince us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson that deavers alcoholism is a mitigating 
factor that should be taken into consideration when deaver is 
sentenced next week for three perjury convictions 
the former white house deputy chief of staff was convicted last 
december of three counts of lying to a federal grand jury and a 
house subcommittee by saying he couldnt recall contacting 
government officials on behalf of highpaying lobbying clients 
deaver 50 faces a possible fiveyear prison term and a 6800 
fine for each of the three convictions sentencing is scheduled for 
sept 23 
the defense contends deaver wasnt lying in 1986 when he 
testified he couldnt recall telephoning thentransportation 
secretary elizabeth dole from his hospital bed on june 3 1985 on 
behalf of trans world airlines 
flynn who also treated deaver for alcoholism in october 1986 
testified that the former presidential aide had reduced mental 
functions during the detoxification treatments 
do you believe under the circumstances that his judgment was 
impaired in any way defense lawyer randall j turk asked flynn 
i would say definitely flynn said 
and his memory turk continued 
definitely the doctor replied 
later flynn said he noted impairment of deavers memory of 
the kinds of things that were happening to him during the 
threeday hospital stay 
but the doctor also said that throughout the visit deaver 
remained quite alert and never showed any signs of depression or 
any signs of heavy sedation while he took large doses of valium 
deaver has remained sober since undergoing a monthlong 
treatment in 1986 at a clinic 
the medical testimony was not offered during deavers trial 
because the defense rested without calling any witnesses 
the presentation during a twoday hearing that began thursday 
appeared to be as much an attempt to put deavers defense on the 
record for an appellate court as it is to persuade jackson to 
impose a lenient sentence 
the defense is expected to argue on appeal that rulings jackson 
made during the trial last year made it impossible for deaver to 
put on a defense 
during the trial jackson refused to strike from the indictment 
certain allegations of perjury left unproven at the close of the 
prosecutions case 
jackson ruled that he would keep these elements of the case 
intact until after the close of the defense case giving the 
prosecution an opportunity to prove those points when questioning 
deaver or other defense witnesses 
the defense then rested without calling any witnesses including 
deaver or medical experts who could testify about how alcohol 
impaired his memory 
independent counsel whitney north seymour jr argued thursday 
that the medical records would show no evidence of a memory loss 
seymour contended that deaver chose to remember some things and 
forget others when he testified under oath in 1986 during the 
investigations of his lobbying for possible ethicslaw violations 
flynn testified that deaver insisted on checking out of the 
hospital after his first visit sooner than doctors thought 
advisable and refused to enter a treatment program 
he was adamant he didnt need further treatment he would 
handle this himself flynn said at this point deaver had not 
really faced up to the fact that he was an alcoholic even though 
flynn said he thought the former presidential aide had been 
drinking heavily for several years 
he was the kind of alcoholic who had been very successful at 
hiding from a large number of people his alcoholism flynn said 
deavers family was not told of his problem until shortly before 
his first hospitalization 
when he returned for treatment in october 1986 deaver again 
resisted going into a clinic flynn said 
but after some encouragement by his family and advice from his 
lawyers deaver agreed to enter an alcoholism rehabilitation center 
in havre de grace md flynn said

a justice department official urged a house 
subcommittee on friday to reject illconceived legislation to 
compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners 
and people who lived downwind of 1950s us atomic tests in nevada 
the bill does not require that causation between exposure to 
radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of 
liability on the part of the united states be proven said steven 
valentine deputy assistant attorney general in the departments 
civil division 
valentine restating opposition voiced by justice officials for 
more than a decade said the department does not believe a link has 
been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people 
receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests 
the assumptions underlying this illconceived proposal are 
either subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous said 
valentine adding that the department would recommend a veto of 
legislation being pushed by lawmakers from utah to compensate 
victims or their survivors 
i am incredulous responded rep barney frank dmass 
chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and 
government relations frank said radiation victim compensation 
will be high on the subcommittees agenda next year it wont 
go away 
franks hearing centered on bills introduced by rep wayne 
owens dutah and sen orrin hatch rutah to pay compensation 
similar to what congress has voted in recent years to military 
people who participated in the tests and to marshall islanders 
injured by us nuclear tests in the pacific 
their proposal would give 50000 each to people who lived in a 
designated downwind area of nevada utah and arizona during the 
nevada tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a high 
probability of being caused by the radiation 
payments of 100000 each would go to people who worked for 
minimum periods in underground uranium mines in utah colorado new 
mexico and arizona between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lung 
cancer and other respiratory problems 
the lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a us 
appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awarded 
damages to some 1200 downwind residents on grounds that the 
government had failed to warn them of the tests dangers 
owens who as a private attorney represented some of the 
plaintiffs said that he also has had personal experience with 
health problems of former miners 
last year my brotherinlaw died from lung cancer owens 
testified he worked in the marysvale uranium mine in utah for 
less than six months a healthy man who never smoked a single 
cigarette in his life dies from lung cancer 
owens said payments to the miners are justified because the 
government knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failed 
to warn the miners or force the mine owners to install proper 
ventilating equipment 
the government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the lives 
of these uranium miners he testified the uranium miners 
became mere guinea pigs in a government death watch 
arden higgins who worked in the marysvale mine from 1953 to 
1959 told the subcommittee that although he never smoked he lost 
his right lung to cancer in 1983 
ive watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer 
higgins said it seems that each year another one dies 
he said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in the 
mine and that physicians tested the workers they never mentioned 
once what the radiation was doing to us he said they told us 
we were all right

business inventories in july rose at the 
slowest rate in 11 months the government said friday suggesting 
to analysts that underlying economic growth remains strong despite 
a pause in business sales 
the commerce department said inventories rose 03 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 7337 billion it was the 19th consecutive 
gain but the smallest since a 02 percent increase in august 1987 
economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of 
weakness fearing that too many goods piling up on shelves and 
backlots will trigger production cutbacks and layoffs at factories 
however they point out that the buildup over the last year and 
a half has been trong sales despite a dip in july 
the key thing to me is that inventories are remaining very 
moderateaccompanied by s so basically the implication is for strong third 
and 
fourth quarter growth said robert wescott chief economist of 
alphametrics a consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
business sales fell 02 percent in july to 4877 billion the 
first decline since november when some buyers were spooked by the 
october stock market crash 
however the slight drop followed a very strong 14 percent jump 
in june the second best in more than a year 
when you put june anl relatively 
active the coneshaped dwellings date back more than a century 
she planted metal spikes into the ground that will show future 
researchers where the huts are even if everything above ground is 
later burned away 
the fire hasnt hit them yet but theres a good chance they 
may she said thats a resource that very well could be lost 
in fire activity but they the wickiups have been recorded 
at one point this summer another cluster of wickiups in the 
northwestern corner of yellowstone was threatened but the plans 
people firefighting strategists were ready to protect them 
capek said 
as the fire approached the dwellings she notified the fire 
command of their existence and precautions were taken 
in many cases archaeologists will have to wait until the fires 
abate before they can learn what happened to historical sites 
for example timothy mann a park naturalist and historian said 
he could not say whether the flames had claimed trees that early 
park explorers initialed or ones bearing rope burns made when us 
army troops chased chief joseph and his nez perce tribe in 1877 
winching their wagons down a steep slope 
mann also wondered about the fate of trees along yellowstones 
southern boundary that bore markings by the first surveyors of 
yellowstone 
paradoxically the fires can be beneficial to archaeologists in 
one way in burning away thick undergrowth that hides lithic 
scatters arrowheads primitive stone tools and spear points in 
the ground that would not be damaged by fire capek said 
though fear continues about sites that existed before 
yellowstone became a park it was authorized in 1872 the parks 
more modern structures have fared better 
some decadesold cabins have burned but the parks five 
federally designated landmarks the old faithful inn the madison 
museum the norris museum the log canopy over the northeast 
entrance gate and the fishing bridge museum all have escaped the 
flames 
also spared was the queens laundry a bathhouse dating to the 
1880s that was one of the first federally funded structures built 
in yellowstone said capek

federal officials are proposing new rules 
aimed at preventing disasters like last years collapse of an 
apartment building that killed 28 construction workers 
the us occupational safety and health administrations 
proposed rules may not be implemented until next summer after the 
administration evaluates comment on the plan 
the proposal applies only to liftslab techniques which were 
being used when the partially completed lambiance plaza collapsed 
the technique is a seldomused method in which concrete floor 
slabs are poured on the ground one on top of the other after the 
slabs are cured they are jacked upwards along vertical steel 
columns then fastened at their proper levels 
an osha official roy gurnham said the rules clarify the 
requirement that all nonessential workers be cleared from a 
liftslab building while the floors are being lifted 
the rule always has been in effect but was interpreted by 
workers and managers to mean that construction crews could work 
below a floor that was fastened 
osha officials previously assumed that a permanent floor above 
the workers would break the fall of a higher concrete floor that 
slipped and fell 
other portions of the new rules would require that a qualified 
designer design liftslab projects 
also the rules say that all jacks lifting the floors should be 
able to lift 25 times the weight expected to be applied and all 
slabs should be lifted in a level position

the condition of admitted pipe bomb killer 
and forger mark hofmann was upgraded friday from critical to 
serious and stable following a prison drug overdose but police 
still could not interview him 
he has improved considerably overnight his pulse blood 
pressure and heart rate are all stable said university of utah 
health sciences center spokesman john dwan hes waking up 
coming out of the coma he is only able to whisper at this time 
but he appears to be oriented and hes following medical 
instructions 
officers were called to hofmanns cell thursday by his cellmate 
who could not wake him up for lunch hofmann initially was reported 
in critical and unstable condition following what dwan said was an 
overdose of an undetermined antidepressant drug 
hofmann was sentenced to five years to life after pleading 
guilty in january 1987 to having planted pipe bombs that killed 
steven christensen a documents collector and kathleen sheets 
wife of christensen associate gary sheets on oct 15 1985 at a 
january hearing the state board of pardons told him he would spend 
the rest of his life in prison 
hofmann 33 confessed that he killed christensen and sheets to 
cover up his career as a forger of historical documents many of 
which he sold to the mormon church 
dwan said hofmann was gradually regaining consciousness friday 
and was taken off a respirator but was in no condition to be 
interrogated 
hes still not lucid dwan said our medical personnel 
have had to sedate him twice for medical purposes 
armed corrections officers supplemented by hospital security 
and university police guarded the door to hofmanns room and 
entrances to the intensivecare unit 
corrections spokesman juan benavidez said prison officials were 
concerned the overdose might have been a prelude to an escape 
attempt although investigators had no hard evidence of that 
dwan said the security was for hofmanns safety too 
weve received a couple calls here already from people saying 
why dont you just let him die and so forth he said 
theyre here to make sure he doesnt escape but also that no one 
bothers him 
hofmanns wife doralee recently filed for divorce and hofmann 
signed a consent form about five week ago he spoke with her and 
his children by telephone wednesday but gave no indication anything 
was amiss prison officials said 
he had been on administrative lockdown confined to his cell 23 
hours a day since a purported hofmann plot against pardons board 
members was uncovered his attorney ronald yengich has denied 
such a plot existed

assault on the caribbean and despite forecasters predictions 
gilbert showed little sign of strengthening as it headed for the 
area around brownsville at the southern tip of texas 
it has not strengthened since it left mexico but we still 
believe some strengthening is possible its not ever going to get 
back up to category 5 strength with 175 mph winds but it very 
possibly could reach 130 or 140 mph said jim gross a hurricane 
specialist at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla 
the hurricane center said if gilbert continued in the same 
direction the eye of the storm would come ashore near the 
texasmexico border sometime this evening

a group of republican congressmen sought to 
defuse charges of antisemitism in the gop campaign by charging 
friday that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
appointed three antiisraeli propalestinian members to the 
partys ruling body 
rep norman lent rny said the three objectionable members 
were appointed to the 400member democratic national committee 
after the pention in atlanta as a concession to 
defeated presidential contender jesse jackson 
the presence of the three on the democratic team raises 
questions about michael dukakis judgmentartys july conv and his submission 
to 
jesse jackson lent told a news conference 
obviously governor dukakis has failed to grasp the message 
his appointments send said lent challenging dukakis to force 
the resignations of the three 
lent identified them as the rev willie barrow executive 
director of jacksons chicagobased operation push robert farrell 
a los angeles city councilman and close jackson associate and ruth 
ann skaff of houston whom he said is a spokeswoman for the 
propalestinian ad hoc committtee on lebanon

the repmer secretary says navy should use fewer consultants 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
former navy secretary john lehman said friday 
the navy should use fewer consultants but he strongly defended his 
tenure against criticism arising from the current pentagon bribery 
investigation 
the changes that we made in the navy procurement system were 
deep and fundamental lehman told the house armed services 
committee i do not believe that any of the changes that we made 
could by their nature increase the incidence of improper behavior 
lehman resigned last year after leading the naval buildup that 
was a key part of president reagans defense program 
but the navy is now the center of a bribery investigation by 
federal prosecutors who are looking at allegations of payoffs and 
bribes from consultants many of whom were former pentagon 
employees 
the consultants were seeking information from pentagon officials 
about details of contracts information that could make the 
difference in winning multimillion dollar contracts no charges 
have yet been filed 
a key figure of the investigation is melvyn paisley the former 
assistant navy secretary for research and engineering and a close 
associate of lehman during their navy tenure paisley resigned and 
became a highpriced consultant shortly after lehman quit to take a 
wall street job in april 1987 
lehmans testimony to the committee was his first major public 
comment since the investigation became public three months ago 
lehman declined to talk about details of the investigation and 
committee members did not ask him for specifics because they did 
not want to affect the probe 
lehman noted the navy has more consultants than the other 
services chiefly because the navy has fewer officers consultants 
do work for the navy performed by officers in the air force and 
army he said 
but i was never comfortable with the dependence on 
consultants lehman said detailing what he said were generally 
unsuccessful efforts to reduce the number of consultants 
consultants are essential but we do have too many he said 
the navy could substantially reduce its reliance on consultants 
two reforms suggested in the wake of the investigation are 
requiring consultants to register and requiring them to disclose 
all their contracts to prevent conflicts of interest lehman 
endorsed those changes 
the combative former official also strongly defended changes he 
made during his tenure some critics have suggested the changes 
such as more centralized management and elimination of some layers 
of bureaucracy caused the climate which led to the investigation 
with regard to strong centralized policymaking and 
decentralized execution i see no way that either principle 
increases the opportunity for waste fraud and abuse he said 
i am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the 
navy during my tenure he said i do believe the changes that 
led to that success made the system by its nature more susceptible 
to waste fraud and abuse 
overall said lehman the pentagon should be reorganized to give 
much more authority for daily decisions to lowerlevel personnel 
rather than top officials he opposed the creation of a single 
purchasing czar a change proposed by some legislators 
in rough book value the department of defense equals the top 
30 companies on the fortune 500 list combined he said and yet 
the pentagon is organized in theory like a small business with all 
operational authority and decisionmaking drawn up in one 
centralized office 
he proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy 
and turn all other major decisions over to the three services 
the staff should also be reduced by half he said and that goal 
could be easily achieved 
normal attrition in the military and civil service is about 8 
percent per year so careful use of hiring freezes brings a rapid 
natural shrinkage he said increased opportunity for voluntary 
early retirement with pensions or large severance payments would 
enable a new administration to cut the pentagon bureaucracy by 30 
percent in three years without firing a single person

president reagan is to blame for a lack of 
coordinated leadership in the nations fight against the aids 
epidemic several business leaders said friday at a conference on 
the deadly disease 
the simple truth is that the president has a moral and 
probably constitutional imperative to trigger americas best 
defense from this plague he has failed said stephen e herbits 
executive vice president of corporate development for joseph e 
seagram amp sons inc 
individual government agencies such as the federal centers for 
disease control have made great strides against aids said dr 
theodore cooper chief executive officer of upjohn co a 
pharmaceutical manufacturer 
but there is no leadership thrust in the government as a 
whole to coordinate aids research developments and public policy 
proposals said cooper who chaired the national institute of 
medicine aids oversight committee 
leslye arsht the white house public information officer 
assigned to answer aids policy questions was in a meeting friday 
afternoon and not immediately available for comment a receptionist 
said 
cooper called on the reagan administration to recreate a central 
presidential commission on aids to coordinate policy and research 
herbits and cooper were among more than a dozen leaders from 
business labor and government who spoke at the conference 
sponsored by the national leadership coalition on aids based in 
washington 
the conference was aimed at spurring greater corporate 
leadership in the national war on aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome a fatal incurable disease that destroys the 
bodys ability to fight sickness 
the absence of our leadership will convince other community 
leaders that this is not really an important problem cooper said 
herbits who was a special assistant in the white house and 
defense department before joining seagrams in 1977 said reagan 
failed to make aids a top priority 
in seven state of the union speeches mr reagan stood before 
our nation and never even mentioned that aids exists herbits 
said in a speech prepared for the conference each year until 
this congress doubled the reagan administrations request for 
funds dedicated to the fight on aids 
yet the administration still underspent its appropriation 
he said the administration is still taking too long to approve 
drugs for experimental therapies and still delays approval of 
contracts to search for appropiate therapies for those who already 
have the virus 
as of this week 72766 aids cases have been reported to the 
cdc 41064 people or 56 percent are dead 
while aids still primarily afflicts homosexuals and intravenous 
drug users a cdc official estimates that 5 percent of the cases 
were spread by heterosexual contact

nagornokarabakh in february with street demonstrations and 
strikes at least 32 people were killed in rioting related to the 
dispute in the azerbaijani city of sumgait

president reagan said friday reducing the us 
diplomatic presence in panama would not harm efforts to stem the 
flow of drugs into the united states 
were concerned right now about some of our people there and i 
think that this is just a measure were taking and probably 
temporary reagan said 
about half of the 160 diplomatic posts in panama including some 
at the regional drug enforcement administration are to be vacated 
a state department official said 
the reagan administration last may suspended virtually all 
diplomatic contact with panama this has left many us diplomats 
in the country with little to do 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said there 
have been some threats against mission personnel and that the 
administration wanted to reduce their vulnerabilities 
the cutback was recommended by ambassador arthur davis and has 
been under way since last spring redman said it would be completed 
unless secretary of state george p shultz received appeals 
from other agencies and decided in their favor 
other offices that may be closed or severely reduced are the 
justice department and the us customs service 
reagan was asked if the cutback would hamper antidrug efforts 
while he was having his photograph taken with nato secretary 
general manfred woerner in the oval office 
no i dont think were doing anything to reduce our ability 
to interdict drugs reagan replied 
three state department officials stressed meanwhile there 
would be no reduction in the us southern command or in the panama 
canal commission 
were doing it because the lessons of history have taught us 
that when we are in a potentially confrontational situation it 
makes sense to reduce potential vulnerability one of the 
officials said thursday night 
after all he said the united states was trying to get rid of 
the head of panamas armed forces gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega the effective leader of panama has been indicted on 
drug trafficking charges by federal grand juries in florida he has 
successfully countered all us efforts to drive him out 
these included cancellation of all normal dealings with the 
country the prohibition is so extensive american diplomats are 
even forbidden to apply for a renewal of their automobile license 
plates 
despite persistent reports that noriega was on the ropes the 
general has held on while eric arturo delvalle who had us 
backing to succeed noriega was ousted in february by the 
pronoriega national assembly 
administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said some of the extra us security personnel sent to panama last 
spring by the pentagon would be withdrawn gradually 
according to an official of the southern command 240 cases of 
harassment of us servicemen were reported between february and 
august 
the command has about 10000 american servicemen stationed in 
panama permanently and a like number of military dependents 
referring to the diplomats redman said we are reducing the 
vulnerabilities inherent in having a large number of united states 
government personnel living and working in areas dominated by the 
noriega regime

ariel sharon of the rightwing likud bloc has 
proposed a war game to test the rival labor partys claim that 
israel could surrender some of the occupied west bank without 
undermining its security 
the former defense minister issued the challenge in a letter 
thursday to the prolabor council for peace and security his 
office released the letter friday 
the council a group of retired military officers contends 
israels defense would be enhanced not compromised if it 
surrendered occupied land in exchange for peace with the arabs 
as defense minister sharon was the architect of israels 
muchcriticized 1982 invasion of lebanon aimed at ending 
crossborder attacks from the arab state 
in the letter sharon proposed a public debate followed by a 
war game in which we will test again in public the different 
military strategic concepts concerning the defense of israel 
sharon now israels commerce minister and a highranking member 
of prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc called for the 
confrontations before the national elections nov 1 the public 
should see for itself and make its own judgment he said 
national security and the future of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip have become central issues in the election campaign 
the executive committee of the council for peace and security 
met friday to consider sharons proposal and will respond in the 
next several days said moshe amirav secretary of the group 
a sharon aide said that before the war game research institutes 
would be asked to define arab positions and strengths sharons 
team then would defend israel from within current boundaries 
including the occupied territories while the council would have to 
defend from a more limited land area 
the likud has consistently opposed any landforpeace plans and 
has stressed keeping the territories to strengthen security against 
invasion from neighboring arab states the leftist labor party led 
by foreign minister shimon peres has favored compromise 
israel has occupied the west bank and gaza strip since the 1967 
middle east war palestinians launched an uprising in the 
territories dec 8 to try to end israeli rule since then more than 
260 palestinians have died mostly in clashes with israeli security 
forces six israelis also have died 
israel gat international secretary of the labor party accused 
sharon of preposing a david and goliath show for media purposes 
he said if the debate and war game were held mr sharon would 
come out empty because his solutions are not well based 
uri dan a sharon aide said the minister would probably lead 
his own team in any debate and mock battles dan said sharon a 
retired major general sees such activities as a way to take 
politics out of the issues 
another possible contender in the proposed games would be the 
officers and academics for security and peace a group of prolikud 
retired officers organized to counter the activities of the council 
for peace and security 
but yehoshua saguy a founding member of the prolikud group 
was cool to the idea of a war game 
a game is a game is a game saguy said other elements are 
important such as how to measure the possibilities of coming to 
compromise with jordan or the palestinians and strategic 
questions

a newspaper has located a girl who 
may be the daughter of a couple suing a hospital for 100 million 
because they claim their healthy newborn was swapped for a sickly 
infant 9 years ago 
reporters using public records found the blueeyed girl in the 
southwest florida city where she lives with her father the st 
petersburg times said friday she is the only other white girl 
reported born at tiny hardee memorial hospital at the time the 
plaintiff gave birth the times said 
to protect the child the paper did not identify her 
regina and ernest twigg sued in federal court in tampa last 
week accusing three doctors and a nurse at the wauchula hospital 
of keeping their biological child a healthy baby born dec 2 
1978 the suit contends the twiggs were instead given a sickly 
infant 
that child arlena died aug 23 after a long battle with a 
heart problem 
the twiggs say blood tests performed at johns hopkins hospital 
in baltimore shortly before arlenas death prove that the child 
they raised was not their biological daughter they claim personnel 
at hardee memorial swapped infants in order to give away or sell 
the real baby twigg and then altered the hospitals records to hide 
their actions 
marvin ellin attorney for the twiggs said he hopes to locate 
the girl found by the newspaper and determine if her blood matches 
the twiggs otype blood 
if shes opositive and shows any family resemblance to the 
twiggs its going to be incredible he said 
we would like for the child to know that we in fact did not 
give her away twigg said we would want her to know that we 
would like to have her but if she is happy we may feel 
differently about it 
the girls family dismisses the idea that she could be the 
twiggs biological daughter 
my sympathy goes out to those people the girls father told 
the times they have every right to pursue their real child my 
daughter is not their child she will never be their child 
the times did not indicate whether the girl was adopted or if 
the mans late wife had given birth at hardee memorial 
the man told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap he 
would not disclose his daughters blood type and said he would 
resist attempts to draw the girl into the twiggs battle the girl 
knows nothing of the search 
until they get an indictment or a conviction i have 
nothing to say he said im an innocent bystander 
besides mrs twigg records show only one other white woman gave 
birth to a girl during the two weeks before mrs twiggs discharge 
from hardee memorial according to oliver boorde state registrar 
for vital statistics 
the legal mother of that girl died in march 1981 when the child 
was 2 two months after the womans death her husband married a 
worker he met in the hospital where his wife had been treated that 
marriage ended in divorce last december 
the girl was immature for her age and had troubles in school 
but was loving the exwife told the times she lost a mother and 
she knew me as a mother for seven years and then lost me whats 
next the woman said

george bushs assault on michael dukakis fiscal 
record renews a debate over statistics that are generally favorable 
to dukakis but show some holes in massachusetts economic rebound 
bush struck at the heart of dukakis candidacy his stewardship 
of massachusetts during its economic boom with a speech thursday 
that selectively used statistics to point out chinks in the state 
financial record but that also gave a misleading characterization 
of the states tax picture 
you can pretty much do what you want with selected 
statistics said betsy hodeling spokeswoman for dukakis 
department of revenue if you wanted to call day night you could 
probably find a statistic to support that 
an obvious example is jobs bush cited the states loss of 
26000 manufacturing jobs since 1983 state officials have put the 
number closer to 100000 but they also cite a net gain of more than 
400000 jobs since 1983 
bush said massachusetts spending increased between 1983 and 1987 
at a rate faster than any other state and that tax increases in 
that period were second only to connecticut 
dukakis administration officials did not dispute bushs 
assertion on spending state budgets have grown by nearly 1 
billion a year since 1983 fueled by soaring state revenues much 
of the increased spending has been in the form of aid to cities and 
towns hurt by a voterapproved property tax cap and the reagan 
administrations decision to halt revenue sharing with 
municipalities 
on the tax side however administration officials denounced 
bushs figures which do not take into account the record increase 
in percapita income in massachusetts over the fouryear period the 
vice president cited 
during that period state taxes have been cut several times 
including the repeal of a surtax dukakis authored in 1975 his 
first year as governor dukakis initially opposed most of the tax 
cuts 
bush chose the per capita figures because they appear to 
show that taxes went up said hodeling what they fail to show 
is that people here are making a lot more money so of course they 
are paying more taxes percentagewise taxes have been cut 
bush cited the surtax to support his position that dukakis was 
the biggest tax raiser in massachusetts history dukakis sought the 
increase to erase a 600 million deficit inherited from his 
republican predecessor 
there are probably a zillion ways to measure taxes said 
house republican leader steven pierce who met with bush in july to 
discuss state finances in any political campaign you have 
charges and countercharges and statistics can be used to support a 
variety of things 
the vice president chided dukakis for approving 74 billion in 
longterm borrowing for capital projects during his tenure and for 
not fully funding the states pension system 
however wall streets two major bond rating agencies recently 
termed massachusetts longterm debt moderate compared to many 
states and said its economy appeared strong enough to support the 
debt and it was dukakis who last year convinced the legislature to 
pass a plan to fund the pension system an effort which he had made 
a priority in his second and third terms dukakis did tap into 
surplus pension funds this year to help offset a 450 million 
revenue shortfall 
bush also asserted that dukakis has turned a state surplus into 
a deficit that could grow to 700 million by the end of the current 
fiscal year 
dukakis last year won passage of about 180 million in new taxes 
and cut state spending by more than 200 million to end fiscal 1988 
with a 67 million surplus and to support revenue projections in 
the current budget 
many legislators most of them republicans have predicted the 
state will fall short of money again this year but even dukakis 
harshest critics say it is too early to make a credible assessment 
i personally think 700 million is a reasonable estimate but 
you cant prove it said barbara anderson executive director of 
citizens for limited taxation and a dukakis enemy nobody can 
prove it but candidates snipe at each other 
dukakis has stood behind his revenue projections but has 
promised to cut spending if necessary 
he was forced into that position last year and the state has had 
to borrow on a shortterm basis for the first time since 1980 
issuing more than 1 billion in notes in the past eight months to 
pay its bills that will cost taxpayers about 20 million in 
interest payments

the vietnamese government has agreed to a 
joint effort to find the remains of us servicemen missing in 
action during the vietnam war the administration announced friday 
us officials said the investigation will focus on seven cases 
in which there is evidence that the victims were alive at the time 
they came under vietnamese custody 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said the seven 
are part of the 70 most compelling cases which us officials 
raised with vietnamese authorities last year 
other officials said that that although the 70 were presumed to 
be alive when captured all have long since been presumed dead 
because there is no evidence to prove otherwise 
a 90day period beginning sept 1 was set aside for carrying 
out the investigations redman said with each one limited to 10 
days 
about 2400 us servicemen have been listed as missing in 
action in southeast asia 
defense secretary frank carlucci announced the agreement with 
vietnam during a powmia recognition day ceremony on capitol hill 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois urged the 
families of the missing americans to ignore the rumors that will be 
inevitable during the pending search 
we have to continue to press for an accounting of each and 
every one even though the prospects of finding anyone alive 
diminish with the passing of time michel told the crowd of 
several hundred 
we must continue to seek the truth he said but the two 
greatest enemies of truth are rumors and false hopes nothing could 
be more cruel to the families of mias and pows than to lend 
credence to false rumors to raise hopes without the facts to 
support them to muddy the waters and confuse the issue 
carlucci said he was encouraged by recent agreements between 
vietnamese vice premier nguyen co thach and president reagans 
special powmia emissary to hanoi gen john w vessey jr 
although last month vietnam temporarily suspended its offer to 
conduct joint operations it recently agreed to resume cooperation 
and i am pleased to announce that joint activity will begin on 
sept 25 the secretary said 
laos has agreed to similar efforts but we still await the 
results that we know are possible from those who hold the 
answers he said 
carlucci called on cambodia to repatriate remains it claims to 
hold and criticized the government of north korea for failure to 
return those of united nations forces missing in the korean war 
the north koreans have a golden opportunity this year to 
display their willingness to rejoin the real world by dealing in 
good faith through the proper channels on this vital human issue 
said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas who joined 
carlucci and michel in addressing the crowd 
lets hope that when we meet again next year we can report 
real progress and real results dole said the bottom line is 
well never forget and well never give up 
as part of the day of remembrance wreathlaying ceremonies were 
being held at the arlington national cemetery in honor of pows and 
mias from the korean war 
an organization dedicated to remembering the families of missing 
soldiers no greater love estimates that there are 8100 mias and 
389 pows still unaccounted for in korea 
an estimated 79000 us servicemen were missing in action in 
world war ii

liberaces exlover provided some of the new 
evidence tying a hollywood drug dealer to the 1981 laurel canyon 
slayings for which the late sexfilm star john holmes once was 
tried the los angeles times reported friday 
scott thorson 29 who was liberaces companion from 1977 to 
1982 helped authorities build their case against nightclub owner 
and convicted cocaine trafficker adel nasrallah in the four laurel 
canyon beating deaths the times said citing unidentified sources 
the killings allegedly were in revenge for a cash and drug 
robbery of nasrallah authorities have said and holmes admitted 
bringing the assailants to the laurel canyon home 
holmes like liberace died of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
nasrallah 59 who went by the name eddie nash and former 
bodyguard gregory dewitt diles 40 were charged sept 8 with four 
counts of murder and one of attempted murder they are being held 
without bail and face possible death penalties if convicted 
four people were bludgeoned to death during the nighttime attack 
in the affluent residential neighborhood and a fifth was left for 
dead she survived but was unable to identify her attackers 
deputy district attorney dale davidson who is prosecuting nash 
and diles said friday that authorities have new witnesses in the 
case but would neither confirm nor deny thorsons involvement 
and right now im most interested in protecting my witnesses 
and avoiding anything that might prejudice the case against mr 
nash and mr diles so i cant ethically say anything one way or 
another the prosecutor said 
nash and diles were scheduled to name attorneys and enter pleas 
in a court appearance monday at which time the prosecution will 
provide a list of its witnesses and an outline of its case he said 
the names of the witnesses will be out before long but it 
would be wrong for me to be the first one to give them out 
davidson said 
thorson who sued liberace for more than 12 million and wrote a 
kissandtell book about their relationship remained in jail 
friday awaiting sentencing for a drugrelated armed robbery 
telephone messages left for his lawyer deputy public defender 
cathy dreyfuss were not returned 
holmes a heavy cocaine user was the top pornographic film star 
of the 70s often portraying a detective named johnny wadd during 
his 1982 trial witnesses testified that holmes fenced property 
stolen by the murder victims to nash who exchanged them for 
cocaine 
a police detective testified that holmes admitted taking killers 
to the house the night of july 1 1981 to placate nash who 
allegedly was angry after being robbed of drugs and 10000 by two 
of the victims two days before 
the robbery was allegedly holmes idea and investigators 
contended the victims allowed the killers inside the house about 10 
miles west of downtown los angeles because holmes was with them 
holmes never took the stand and was acquitted he was later 
jailed for 111 days for contempt of court for refusing to talk to a 
grand jury he agreed to testify before the secret panel in 
november 1982 after nash was sentenced to prison for possessing 
about two pounds of cocaine valued at 1 million 
holmes grand jury testimony remains sealed and davidson said 
it cant be used against nash or diles 
the sexfilm star died of aids complications in march after 
reportedly granting deathbed interviews to police still 
investigating the killings however his statements apparently 
yielded little of use to authorities and davidson said the 
evidence used to file the new charges didnt come from holmes 
nash who ran a chain of stripjoints and punk nightclubs 
supplied thorson with cocaine the times said 
in an acknowledgment in his recently published book behind 
the candelabra my life with liberace thorson named nash as one 
of six people who over the years offered him personal support 
and understanding 
thorson filed two highly publicized lawsuits against liberace 
contending the flamboyant entertainer reneged on promises to 
support him for the rest of his life and libeled him by having 
relatives publish a magazine article calling him a blackmailer 
the first suit was settled out of court for 95000 and the 
other was dismissed shortly after liberace died of aids in 1987 
bludgeoned to death in the laurel canyon slayings were roy 
deverell 42 joy audrey miller 46 barbara richardson 22 and 
ronald launius 37 launius wife susan then 25 was badly beaten 
but survived the attack

an exhibit of three generations of wyeth 
family art was staged in palaces and ultramodern museums during its 
world tour but james wyeth says the works look best hanging in his 
hometown 
the exhibition of 115 works by nc wyeth his son andrew and 
his grandson james opens sunday in brandywine river museum in 
chadds ford it is the final stop of a 1year tour that also 
included stops in the soviet union italy japan and england 
james until recently has answered to the family nickname of 
jamie but he now wants to be known as james 
speaking at a press preview friday he said ive seen the 
paintings hanging in a czarist building in moscow in a 
ultramodern museum in tokyo in an oldstyle building in 
cambridge england but it still looks a hell of a lot better here 
at home 
chadds ford southwest of philadelphia is where nc wyeth 
settled after traveling through the old west during the late 1800s 
and early 1900s andrew and james were raised here and many of 
their works explore the people and surroundings 
other works examine the people and atmosphere of maine where 
the family has a second home 
the most celebrated wyeth 71yearold andrew was scheduled to 
attend the press preview but a touch of the flu and a drained 
feeling he gets when he completes a work caused him to stay away 
friday his son said 
through the worldwide tour people flocked to the exhibit in 
recordbreaking numbers to get a glimpse of art that explores such 
american traditions and lifestyles as farming and halloween 
but the collection also shows the enduring tradition of an 
artistic family and james wyeth said that is what appealed most to 
the exhibits audiences abroad 
it was the continuity that really struck them he said 
the exhibit opened in leningrad in march 1987 and was the first 
exhibit under the newest cultural exchange program between the 
united states and the soviet union 
the people were really dying to see the art he said at 
some openings people just stand around with their backs to the 
paintings but there they were almost pushing me aside to see the 
paintings 
included in the exhibit are three of andrew wyeth famous 
helga paintings a series of nudes and other figure studies of 
the same woman that caused a sensation when its existence was 
disclosed two years ago 
when asked if he had any secret paintings james wyeth laughed 
yes of a lot of pigs he said 
he posed for photographs before one of his more famous works 
portrait of a pig a 4by7foot painting done in 1970 the pig is 
one of his favorite subjects and the exhibit displays several 
paintings of other farm animals as well 
the first portion of the exhibit displays nc wyeths art 
although there are several paintings of western scenes and a small 
selfportrait from 1913 the majority of the 38 works on display 
are book illustrations 
nc wyeth who died in 1945 illustrated such classics as 
robert louis stevensons treasure island and kidnapped and 
mark twains the mysterious stranger in the 1910s and 1920s 
the exhibit runs through nov 20

a detroit newspaper urged a federal appeals 
court friday to lift an order that for a second time stalled its 
plans to combine business and production departments with a larger 
rival 
attorneys for the detroit free press asked the us court of 
appeals for the district of columbia circuit to allow the agreement 
to go forward saying entry into a joint operating agreement is 
by its nature an emergency remedy 
the court late thursday barred the joint operations from 
beginning after the expiration at 715 pm saturday of a 
lowercourt stay the superseding order carried no expiration date 
the appeals court ordered the delay to gain time to study the 
complex case the court clerks office said the court gave no 
indication when a ruling might come 
michigan citizens for an independent press a group of 
advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers joint operating 
agreement had asked for a delay in implementing the joint 
operating agreement the court declined to grant the groups 
request but on its own authority issued a stay 
the general manager of the free press bob hall said the stay 
just gives the judges a couple of days to look at the filings 
and has no bearing on the merits of the case 
the partial merger under the newspaper preservation act 
requested by the newspapers in 1986 was approved last month by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
michigan citizens succeeded in blocking immediate implementation 
of the agreement through a challenge in us district court in 
washington 
the lower court on wednesday rejected the challenge and 
michigan citizens the next day asked the appeals court to consider 
the case 
free press attorneys said michigan citizens had failed to show 
they were likely to succeed in an appeal or that denial of the stay 
would cause permanent damage 
michigan citizens contends the joint operating agreement would 
set a precedent because it would allow a merger in a case where the 
newspapers financial losses were due to management decisions 
rather than the normal competition in the marketplace 
the group said such a precedent could end newspaper competition 
in 20 cities served by multiple newspapers 
the organization argued that the lower court in granting a 
stay had accepted the premise that allowing the partial merger to 
proceed while under challenge would be contrary to the public 
interest 
the free press owned by knightridder inc had a daily 
circulation last year of 638720 the news owned by gannett co 
inc had circulation of 678720 according to the audit bureau of 
circulation 
knightridder has said it will close the free press if the joint 
operating agreement does not go through at a cost of 2000 jobs 
the merger of the newspapers business advertising circulation 
and production departments would result in the loss at both 
newspapers of 600 to 800 jobs

blaze 
gary wayne parris 39 appeared in nevada county court thursday 
on a charge of felony count of reckless burning he is also charged 
with public drunkenness he was being held friday on 50000 bail 
parris was at first charged with a misdemeanor count but the

disregard of the fire danger according to district attorney john 
darlington 
parris apparently lived in an abandoned home in a remote area 
near nevada city about 50 miles northeast of sacramento 
the state department of forestry encouraged the district 
attorney to file the more serious charges to get parris off the 
street for his own safety and so he can receive psychological help

say started the huge blaze sunday by burning toilet paper outside a 
makeshift outhouse 
the fire destroyed 102 homes and 57 outbuildings according to

economic toll has risen beyond 15 million including 11 million 
in property damage and 42 million in suppression costs the fire

pope john paul ii urged the marxist 
government friday to make peace with guerrillas and offered to let 
the church mediate in this wartorn country where 6 million people 
live on the edge of famine 
in the face of this lamentable situation when the opportunity 
arose i have never ceased to repeat no to violence and yes to 
peace the pontiff told president joaquim chissano after 
arriving from neighboring swaziland 
the efforts of my brother bishops in mozambique have always 
received my backing john paul told chissano who was baptized a 
roman catholic but now is nonpracticing about oneeighth of 
mozambiques 117 million people are catholic 
the bishops have been urging chissanos government to start 
negotiations with antimarxist rebels of the mozambique national 
resistance known by their portuguese acronym renamo the 
government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops 
for advocating talk with armed bandits 
the weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively 
to defend our countrys freedom and our nation chissano told the 
pope at the ponte vermelha red point palace built by the 
portuguese colonialists before mozambique became independent in 
1975 
your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces the 
paths of hatred the trade of war the murder of innocents and the 
inadmissable methods of terrorism chissano said 
the 11yearold civil war in this southeast african country has 
forced about 1 million mozambicans to flee into neighboring 
countries nearly half mozambiques 145 million people are in need 
of food aid according to relief organizations 
mozambique is the final stop on the popes 10day tour of 
southern africa in addition to swaziland he also has visited 
zimbabwe botswana and lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop in 
south africa on wednesday after his plane was diverted in bad 
weather 
the renamo guerrillas believed to number between 12000 and 
22000 roam the countryside almost at will and have caused 
tremendous econonic damage 
no government acknowledges assisting the rebels who have been 
accused of widespread civilian atrocities renamo denies the 
charges 
the us state department in a report released in april 
estimated the rebels killed 100000 civilians in the past two to 
three years 
renamo this week announced a ceasefire during the popes visit 
and wished the pontiff a good stay still mozambique announced 
extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling 
to see him at stops in nampula beira and maputo the capital 
mozambique receives most of its military assistance from the 
soviet union but increasingly has been making overtures to western 
nations the united states is the largest donor of food aid in 
mozambique and britain has been providing military training 
mozambique also has been working to improve relations with 
neighboring south africa which has backed renamo in the past 
south africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms 
of a 1984 mutual nonaggression pact but mozambique has continued 
to accuse south africa of providing assistance 
mozambique regularly refers to south africa as the racist 
regime but on monday chissano hosted south african president 
pw botha on his first summit meeting in a blackruled african 
nation 
the vatican has tried to prod the peace process in mozambique by 
sending one of john pauls top cardinal aides to meet separately 
with botha and chissano in july also some mozambican bishops 
reportedly have maintained contacts with renamo 
chissano met the pope in may in rome but the vactican appears 
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an 
incentive to move the peace process ahead 
in mbabane swaziland earlier friday the pope preached about 
the virtues of monogamy at a mass attended by swazilands 
20yearold king and his four wives 
king mswati iii the worlds youngest monarch sat 
expressionless as the pope told a crowd of 10000 at the capitals 
national stadium that god intended each husband to have one wife 
the pope who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escorted 
by spearcarrying warriors spoke from an altar topped by a turret 
manned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars

pope john paul ii preached about the 
virtues of monogamy friday at a mass attended by the 20yearold 
king and his four wives 
king mswati iii the worlds youngest monarch sat 
expressionless as the pope said god intended each husband to have 
one wife 
the pope arrived at the capitals national stadium in his 
popemobile escorted by spearcarrying warriors he spoke from an 
altar topped by a turret holding a soldier with a rifle and 
binoculars a cross on the structure was stamped with a spear 
shield and war ax 
christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the 
foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with 
the original plan of god for marriage the pope told a crowd of 
about 10000 in the national stadium 
hence any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and 
women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that 
christ the king of peace brought into the world he said 
vatican sources said john paul was warned by local prelates to 
tread carefully before addressing the issue of polygamy but he 
went ahead anyway 
an estimated 70000 of swazilands people roughly 10 percent 
of the population are catholics but the king is not one of them 
mswati has never issued any statement on his religious beliefs 
his father supported freedom of religion and said he was a member 
of all religions mswati is believed to follow in the same 
tradition but that has never been confirmed 
later friday the pope went on to mozambique the last stop on a 
10day visit of southern africa that also included zimbabwe 
botswana and lesotho he urged mozambiques marxist government to 
negotiate with rightist rebels 
swaziland a stable country of 700000 people wedged between 
south africa and mozambique is a dual monarchy under the king 
offically known as the lion and a queen mother called the great 
she elephant 
polygamy is no longer practiced extensively in swaziland but it 
is a tradition in the royal family 
mswatis father king sobhuza ii had more than 50 wives and at 
least 68 children during his 60year reign which ended with his 
death in 1982 
also attending the mass were the queen mother and the former 
queen regent who briefly ruled the country after sobhuzas death 
the mass was unusual from the start john pauls opentopped 
popemobile was driven in the wrong direction after it circled once 
around the track at the stadium the warrior escorts and vatican 
security men expressed dismay when the popemobile started driving 
out the gate 
after driving back into the stadium the pope slipped off a 
platform onto the soggy field and climbed back onto the altar 
then his celebration of the mass was interrupted by the arrival 
of the young king who rolled into the stadium in a lincoln 
limousine to welcoming whistles from the crowd 
later the pope was kept waiting for 20 minutes inside his 
mercedes at the doors of royal palace until the kings limousine 
was moved from the driveway 
after the delay john paul chatted with the king and other 
members of the royal family for 10 minutes the meeting had been 
scheduled for 30 minutes 
as they spoke and exchanged gifts inside the palace security 
men crawled on the floor in order not to disturb the view of the 
king and the pope 
during his three other african trips john paul frequently 
condemned polygamy marital infidelity and promiscuity 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire was hurriedly married a few 
days before the pope visited in 1980

two of the states leading democrats won 
renomination even though they were brushed by scandal but voters 
took the advice of a third democrat who resigned his post after a 
criminal conviction and said he did not want to be nominated 
among the winners in thursdays primaries were every democratic 
incumbent in congress and in the state legislature who had sought 
reelection 
fiveterm bronx congressman robert garcia who was tied to the 
wedtech influence peddling scandal but has not been charged with 
criminal wrongdoing and state senate minority leader manfred 
ohrenstein of manhattan who has been charged in a criminal 
indictment with doling out public money for private campaigns both 
survived primary challenges 
a former incumbent rep mario biaggi did lose to state 
assemblyman eliot engel in a threeway race for the democratic 
nomination for biaggis old congressional seat 
biaggi had resigned from congress in august after his conviction 
in the wedtech scandal and said he didnt want to be designated as 
his partys nominee ironically though he will still be on the 
november ballot because the oncepopular politician received the 
gop nomination with no primary opposition 
there were no primary races in the only major statewide office 
up this year the us senate seat held by democrat daniel patrick 
moynihan his gop challenger in november will be lawyer robert 
mcmillan 
all of thursdays democratic incumbent winners in new york city 
are virtually assured of victory in the general election in the 
heavily democratic city 
john marino executive director of the state democratic 
committee said state party leaders are now focusing on suburban 
and upstate congressional races where democratic winners thursday 
face tough contests for seats now held by republicans 
what they have to do now is build upon the momentum that they 
created for themselves and let that take them into nov 8 he 
said 
the seats include the one held by rep jack kemp who opted not 
to seek reelection in order to made a bid for the gop presidential 
nomination 
the wedtech scandal in which biaggi was convicted and garcia 
was implicated involves a nowbankrupt bronx defense contractor 
whose officials allegedly bribed a number of local and federal 
officials 
ohrenstein whos been in the state senate since 1960 faces 
nearly a 400count indictment in manhattan charging that he misused 
public funds to finance the private campaigns of senate democratic 
candidates in 1986 
ohrenstein narrowly repulsed a primary challenge from joseph 
rose 29 the son of a wealthy developer who outspent ohrenstein by 
a 3to1 margin 
the drawing power of one famous political name fell short in 
suburban westchester county as former state official nita lowey 
defeated hamilton fish iii and a third candidate for the right to 
oppose republican rep joseph dioguardi in november 
fishs father hamilton fish jr a republican represents a 
neighboring district in congress that had previously been 
represented by his father also named hamilton fish

president reagan and natos new secretary 
general manfred woerner on friday discussed the thorny problem of 
sharing the alliancess costs and burdens an issue one top aide 
said is at the top of the list for the pacts members 
i feel confident this alliance has the strength courage and 
imagination to overcome our difficulties woerner told reporters 
after he emerged from his halfhour meeting and hourlong lunch 
with the president in the white house 
the president mentioned the american interest of his 
administration of congress in a more equitable burdensharing and 
i told him that the alliance takes this issue very seriously we 
are working at it woerner said 
a chorus of electionyear unhappiness has been voiced in 
congress due to the disproportionate share the united states bears 
for forces in allied nations whose postworld war ii economies 
have boomed and whose companies now compete on the international 
stage with american firms 
as a message to the allies the senate overwhelmingly approved a 
pentagon spending bill last month that included restrictions on 
spending for american troops overseas under the plan in the bill 
us allies would have to pay for the american troops if the cost 
rises above the 1988 level 
woerner who said he was optimistic about the future of the 
north atlantic treaty organization said he believed the alliance 
will make progress on the cost issue but he also warned that the 
question cant be reduced to financial considerations alone 
we shouldnt treat it in a controversial way we should look 
at it as an alliance task he said its not a confrontation 
between the united states and the rest of the alliance its a 
common task of nato as an organization and an alliance 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway who briefed 
reporters following woerners visit said of the burdensharing 
question that everyone agrees that its a subject that has to be 
at the top of the list 
she noted that woerner during his meetings earlier this week 
with secretary of state george p shultz and secretary of defense 
frank c carlucci has given it his personal priority 
on both sides of this conversation there is a conviction 
that this discussion has to be an intraalliance discussion that 
it cannot become an usvsthem a usvsallothers kind of 
discussion mrs ridgway said 
the state department official said woerner and reagan did not 
discuss the topic in great detail but she added that woerner is 
pressing ahead with a study of the issue 
the official said that the nato visitors did report that they 
were struck by the attention the issue is receiving in the 
united states it is the kind of question that if nonexamined 
can become divisive and no one wants that to happen mrs ridgway 
said

a political director of the nicaraguan contras 
said friday he hoped the rebels will reach agreement within the 
next three weeks on a longterm peace accord with the leftist 
managua government 
but even if the talks do not succeed said directorate member 
alfredo cesar the militarily weakened rebels will have captured 
the moral high ground by demonstrating their willingness to seek 
peace 
there is the perception that the negotiation process is 
stalled and that the resistance has not done everything possible 
to keep it on track cesar told reporters after meeting with 
congressional leaders the contras have been blamed for the breakup 
of peace talks june 9 
the new rebel initiative means both congress and the new 
administration taking office in january will definitely have 
found that we went the extra mile he said 
taking the decision to go back into talks with the sandinista 
government without military aid is a very extraordinary gesture of 
good faith on the part of the resistance cesar said 
the contras formally known as the nicaraguan resistance 
announced on thursday that they would send a delegation to 
preliminary talks in guatemala city on monday aimed at a resumption 
of the peace talks 
cesar said they will offer to begin formal highlevel peace 
talks sept 2628 in guatemala costa rica or the dominican 
republic 
the rebels say they will place no preconditions on the talks 
but will ask that the sandinistas release 39 people jailed july 10 
after an antigovernment demonstration in nandaime a town near 
managua 
col enrique bermudez the rebels military commander and a 
newly elected directorate member said the prisoner release would 
create a good climate for the negotiations 
in separate meetings with house speaker jim wright dtexas and 
minority leader robert michel rill members of the rebel 
directorate said they hoped to reach an agreement that would let 
their troops most of which have been withdrawn from nicaragua into 
camps along the honduran border relocate in previously designated 
ceasefire zones inside nicaragua 
they also said they wanted to establish goals for democratic 
reforms to be implemented in nicaragua and promised that with 
these reforms undertaken they would lay down their arms 
in a letter to congressional leaders the rebels asked that a 
27 million humanitarian aid package now pending as part of a 
disputed pentagon money bill be modified to permit training for 
contra soldiers in human rights hygiene leadership skills and 
political education civic action to aid civilians affected by 
the war including medical supplies and basic work tools 
communications gear to maintain contact with troops in the field 
and unspecified equipment needed to preserve physical 
safety for troops en route to ceasefire zones 
rep david bonior dmich a leading contra opponent said it 
was unlikely the aid package would be modified its a delicate 
compromise reached after three weeks of negotiations among senate 
democrats he said adding im very skeptical of peoples 
motives

farmers have offered to take an additional 34 
million acres of highly erodible cropland from production under the 
10year conservation reserve program or crp the agriculture 
department said friday 
milton hertz administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service said the offers or bids 
were made in the seventh signup for the program held july 18 
through aug 31 
under the program farmers agree to take land from production 
for 10 years in return based on bids they submit farmers get 
annual rental payments from the government and onetime assistance 
pay for half the cost of planting grass trees and shrubs to guard 
against erosion 
the annual rental payments have been averaging around 50 per 
acre 
acceptance of the bids will be announced around dec 15 hertz 
said congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 
million acres for the program by 1990 
new crp contracts may not be entered into which provide for an 
annual rental rate in excess of the prevailing local rental rate 
for comparable land he said making this determination on each 
bid will require extra time 
including more than 255 million acres signed up earlier the 
latest offers would boost the program to almost 29 million acres if 
all of the new bids are accepted 
hertz said he was encouraged by the continued interest in the 
crp particularly in view of the 1988 drought 
kenneth a cook senior associate of the conservation 
foundation a private nonprofit research organization based in 
washington dc said the latest offerings were really a pretty 
amazing signup when it started at the worst of the drought 
cook said the signup could have turned out to be light since 
crop prices were going up rapidly because of the drought and it 
would have been tempting for many farmers to think about growing 
crops instead 
but a lot of them may have thought these high commodity 
prices arent here to stay cook said also the department 
raised the bid levels the corn belt and that helped

the prosecutions attempt to pin the 
torturemurder of a us drug agent on three men is like an effort 
to catch a greased pig that keeps slipping away a defense attorney 
said at the murder trial friday 
barry tarlow accused assistant us attorney jimmy gurule of 
altering the facts in the case as the prosecution tried to weave a 
web of circumstantial evidence around the defendants and he said 
key prosecution witnesses were criminals who are lying in an 
attempt to get lenient treatment 
no matter how mr gurule tries to twist and distort the 
evidence im convinced you will see the truth tarlow said 
tarlow represents jesus felix gutierrez 38 who is charged as 
an accessory to the murder of drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena he made the greased pig comparison in the first 
day of closing defense arguments in the eightweek federal court 
trial 
camarena was abducted outside the us consulate in guadalajara 
mexico on feb 7 1985 his badly beaten body and that of 
associate alfredo zavala avelar were found a few weeks later 
buried on a remote mexican ranch 
the defense lawyer told jurors a folksy tale saying he was 
recently complaining about the prosecutions case to a country 
lawyer friend the friend tarlow said told him prosecution 
efforts reminded him of the carnival game where people try to catch 
a greased pig 
that pig started to slip and slide and slither away tarlow 
said 
tarlow then attacked the testimony of prosecution witnesses 
calling them liars cheats and perjurers contending they were 
influenced by prosecutors promising lenient treatment in other 
cases 
he admitted that the jury had a difficult task in trying to 
determine the guilt or innocence of felix an admitted drug 
trafficker 
can a mexican citizen drug dealer get a fair trial in a 
horrible case like this one what with the war on drugs on 
everybodys mind and with sympathy for agent camarena tarlow 
asked jurors 
thursday gurule called camarena a heroic law officer who paid 
the ultimate price when he was slain while working undercover 
in mexico 
charged with murder in the case are raul lopez alvarez 28 and 
rene verdugo urquidez 36 felix is accused of helping mexican drug

got all of his facts wrong bentsen said reminding his 
snickering audience of 1000 people about bushs remark last week 
that sept 7 rather than dec 7 was the anniversary of the japanese 
attack on pearl harbor 
standing in the shadow of a statue of a confederate soldier the 
texas senator praised the democratic presidential candidates 
gubernatorial record 
under mike dukakis massachusetts unemployment is the lowest 
rate of any major industrial state in this union bentsen said 
wages are growing twice as fast as the national average personal 
income growing faster than any other state and he submitted 10 
balanced budgets in a row 
when george bush speaks out against mike dukakis he said 
we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against 
arms to iran when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with 
gen noriega of panama when it came to speaking out against 
economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt 
george bush didnt speak he just voted present 
ill tell you when it comes to strong leadership george bush 
has got himself a bad case of laryngitis said bentsen who will 
complete a fourday southern campaign tour in florida 
im looking for old friends who wandered away in recent 
years he told the greenville crowd his biggest of the week 
im talking to the reagan democrats im urging them to come 
home and theyre responding 
earlier in the day at memphis tenn bentsen told a breakfast 
crowd of party loyalists that dukakis positions on trade the 
economy education and defense were ones that southerners could 
support 
he said bushs attacks grew out of panic over the democratic 
tickets early lead in public opinion polls 
mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are prepared to pay the price 
to defend freedom and you have my word on it bentsen said 
introduced by sen albert gore dtenn and former mississippi 
gov william winter bentsen said the republicans were trying to 
hide such policy failures of the past eight years as a 
neartripling of the national debt 
george bush talking about balanced budgets he said in 
greenville its like dan quayle talking about his resume 
theres really not much to say 
democratic gubernatorial candidate bob jordan of north carolina 
compared quayle with bentsen and said god help us if bush is

find gore asked 
we dont have to apologize to anybody anywhere for the 
ticket we are putting before the american people this year

searchers on friday found the bodies of 
four people amid the wreckage of a singleengine plane that crashed 
and burned a week ago en route to a flyin at this northern maine 
town authorities said 
authorities were unaware of the missing plane until they were 
notified late wednesday by relatives who failed to hear from the 
travelers said ronald roy director of the aeronautics division of 
the state department of transportation no flight plan was filed 
he said 
a search was launched thursday and on friday one of six civil 
air patrol planes spotted the wreckage in trees along the northwest 
side of lily bay mountain about 10 miles north of greenville said 
steve mccausland spokesman for the maine state police 
a medic who was ferried to the scene in a national guard 
helicopter confirmed that there were no survivors among the two men 
and two women mccausland said 
the cessna 182 had taken off from lawrence mass on sept 9 to 
participate in a weekend flyin in greenville roy said 
the search was concentrated within 10 miles of greenville after 
investigators determined the pilot had made radio contact with the 
control tower at bangor international airport and that radar tapes 
from the federal aviation administration in boston indicated the 
plane had reached the greenville area

criminal investigators are looking for a 
connection among three decapitated bodies of young men found since 
may in widely separated areas of georgia 
the only current ties in the three deaths are that none of the 
bodies showed signs of a struggle and that they shared similar 
physical characteristics officials said 
the first was found in may near cartersville in northwestern 
georgia the second sept 6 near warwick in southern georgia and 
the third wednesday near bogart in the northeastern part of the 
state 
all three were missing hands and head with one also missing his 
feet 
none of the three has been identified and officials have 
released no cause of death in any of the cases 
theres no question to find bodies like this in georgia is 
very very unusual said john bankhead spokesman for the georgia 
bureau of investigation 
were trying to see how they might be linked but theres no 
way we can be sure if they are right now he said the bureau is 
checking with other states to see if there are similar cases 
local sheriffs said each man appeared be of average height 
between 5feet6 and 6feet and of average build officials 
believe each man was killed elsewhere and then left where the 
bodies were found 
investigators hope they can find leads from the clothing found 
on the bogart and bartow bodies the warwick body was clad only in 
underwear

a new technology means that coal often 
considered a major culprit in the greenhouse effect warming of 
the earth could be a source of benign energy a government 
researcher told a senate committee friday 
meyer steinberg a chemical engineer and coal expert at the 
brookhaven national laboratory in new york proposed to the senate 
environment and public works committee a new technical option for 
longterm consideration a hydrogen economy based on coal made 
possible by brookhaven research 
energy experts have eyed hydrogen for decades as a possible fuel 
when the world can no longer burn petroleum though hydrogen is an 
extremely dangerous gas to handle burning it simply produces water 
as a combustion product liquid hydrogen has been used as a rocket 
fuel 
most methods of making hydrogen also produce carbon dioxide the 
principal gas among several whose increasing concentration in the 
atmosphere according to some climatologists is causing the earth 
to warm by a halfdegree fahrenheit per decade these scientists 
say the warming will raise sea levels and shift rainfall patterns 
to make drought in the central united states more likely according 
to many climatologists 
some analysts have speculated that hydrogen would have to be 
produced from the decomposition of water using nuclear or some form 
of solar energy or electricity from water flowing over dams these 
energy sources leave no carbon dioxide behind 
we have developed a very efficient process to produce a 
hydrogenrich gas from coal said steinberg we are suggesting 
that coal refineries be built based on this process 
steinberg offered few details of the process he called 
hydrocarb which he said was originally developed to produce 
carbon black a pure form of carbon important in producing tires 
and in segments of the chemical industry carbon black now is made 
from petroleum or natural gas 
the carbon produced by the new process he suggested could 
simply be stored and used as a clean fuel if carbon dioxide 
emissions from combustion could be tolerated all impurities 
would already be removed he said 
steinberg said such a strategy would have severe costs but 
probably not any more severe than going all the way to the nuclear 
option 
direct removal of carbon dioxide from smokestacks is possible 
he said but what are we going to do with gigatons billions of 
tons of carbon dioxide 
steinberg and a colleague hsing cheng calculated in 1986 that 
direct removal of carbon dioxide from utility smokestacks would be 
so costly that the price of electricity could double the project 
would consume 11 percent to 16 percent of the electrical capacity 
of the nation and could require a pipeline network to dispose of 
liquid carbon dioxide on the ocean floor that would need an 
investment of 284 billion in 1980 dollars or about 330 billion 
today 
a spokesman for the national coal association john grasser 
said he had not heard of the brookhaven development but it 
sounds like an interesting process 
several techniques are already used to produce combustible gas 
from coal generally yielding a mixture of hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide with a heating value from 10 percent to 30 percent of 
natural gas burning these gases yields carbon dioxide from the 
carbon monoxide 
coal accounts for about 80 percent of the carbon dioxide 
emissions from electricity generation in the united states the 
committee is considering a bill that would require new fossil power 
plants to double fuel efficiency after 2010 cars to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by 75 percent after that date all new furnaces 
and water heaters in five years to equal the performance of todays 
best and all new air conditioners to double their efficiency in 
five years 
the committee released an analysis by the office of technology 
assessment concluding that actions called for by the bill until 
2010 would be possible with todays technlogies but after that new 
technology would be needed unless society is prepared to accept 
nuclear power

america is getting the lead out 
thats the word from the us geological survey which reports 
that the amount of lead in the nations rivers and streams declined 
over a decade 
the general reduction in lead levels is likely a result of 
reduced use of leaded gasoline the recently published study said 
survey scientists checked the water at some 300 locations across 
the country and found declines in lead at twothirds of the 
stations including significant drops at 30 percent of them 
between 1974 and 1985 
although we have not completed intensive trend analyses on 
data collected since 1985 preliminary results indicate that the 
overall decline in lead concentrations has continued said 
richard b alexander in a statement 
alexander and richard a smith hydrologists at the surveys 
reston va national center compiled the report which was 
published in the most recent edition of water resources bulletin 
this decline is certainly good news as far as the water 
environment is concerned alexander observed 
lead is considered a hazard because if ingested it can cause 
brain damage and eventually even death 
the survey said increases in lead in stream water were found in 
a few locations principally along the texas gulf and lower 
mississippi valley regions none was in water that was used for 
drinking however 
the increases were thought to be largely due to declines in the 
volume of water flowing in those areas in the last few years of the 
study declining water volumes tend to concentrate pollutants 
assessing the effectiveness of pollution abatement efforts is 
often hard to do because of the lack of widespread longterm 
measurements the surveys waterquality measurements which have 
been conducted since the early 1970s are at least one way to do 
this said alexander 
gasoline is believed to be the primary source of lead in streams 
and rivers and the drop in river concentrations of the metal has 
occurred in parallel with the reduction in use of leaded gasoline 
he pointed out 
the largest part of the reduction in lead in rivers and streams 
occurred in 197980 alexander noted and that was the same period 
that saw the steepest decline in the use of leaded gasoline 
industrial discharges of lead into streams and rivers were sharply 
cut prior to 1977 he noted

mikhail s gorbachev said friday that soviet 
forces will abandon a strategic naval base in vietnam if the united 
states pulls its armed forces from bases in the philippines 
in a key foreign policy speech the soviet leader announced that 
the kremlin has frozen its nuclear weapon stocks in soviet asia he 
also responded to us allegations that a siberian radar violates a 
superpower arms treaty by suggesting the station be used to study 
space 
gorbachev made the 1hour speech during a meeting with 
communist party and local government workers in the city of 
krasnoyarsk 2000 miles east of moscow and the site of the 
controversial radar the official tass news agency carried a 
summary 
a sevenpoint plan aimed at strengthening security in the 
asiapacific region highlighted the speech the first major 
address by gorbachev since he returned monday from a sixweek 
vacation 
it was the first time gorbachev focused on relations with asia 
since a july 28 1986 speech at the pacific port of vladivostok 
in that speech gorbachev called for a summit with china and 
peace in the region fridays speech reiterated the call for a 
summit with beijing and urged japan not to increase its military 
strength 
aware of the asian and pacific countries concern the soviet 
union will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in the 
region it has already been practicing this for some time and is 
calling on the united states and other nuclear powers not to deploy 
them additionally in the region gorbachev said according to the 
tass summary 
if the united states agrees to the elimination of military 
bases in the philippines the soviet union will be ready to 
give up the fleets material and technical supply station in cam 
ranh bay 
the pentagon describes cam ranh bay in vietnam as the soviets 
largest naval deployment base abroad threatening us military 
presence in the philippines us officials in bangkok said about 
7000 soviet personnel are stationed there 
the united states maintains six bases in the philippines the 
two major bases subic bay naval base and clark air base are the 
largest us military installations outside the united states but 
americanfilipino talks on an agreement to review the final two 
years of the leases which expire in 1991 have stalled 
in washington president reagan commented on gorbachevs 
proposal regarding the bases 
i havent had an opportunity to go into it in detail in what 
it is hes proposing but i look forward to doing that because 
certainly we want to do anything we can to help bring about a 
better relationship between our two countries reagan told 
reporters 
on thursday secretary of state george p shultz said talks in 
manila on compensation for the bases and other issues basically 
arent going well 
gorbachev proposed that a center for international cooperation 
in the utilization of space for peaceful purposes be set up on the 
basis of the krasnoyarsk radar station tass said 
although his wording was vague gorbachev appeared to be 
offering to dismantle or convert the 30story radar the us 
government says the installation violates the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty and is a major obstacle to talks in geneva toward 
halving longrange missile arsenals 
speculation about the krasnoyarsk radar station continues 
the soviet leader said in remarks carried by soviet television 
its turning out to have a slowing effect on the geneva 
negotiations 
the move would also put more pressure on the reagan 
administration to act on soviet complaints the united states is 
violating the abm treaty particularly by its star wars program for 
a spacebased missile defense 
our concern over the construction of the us radar stations 
in greenland and britain remains experts say that they are a 
downright violation of the abm treaty we expect that washington 
will take appropriate measures in response to our initiative he 
said 
the soviet union offered last month to dismantle the radar 
equipment if the united states agreed to commit itself to the abm 
treaty for nine or 10 years 
asked about gorbachevs proposal on the krasnoyarsk radar white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated the us position that 
the facility must be dismantled because it violates abm treaty 
the united states has maintained the radar violates the treaty 
because it is not at the edge of the country pointed outward as 
the pact stipulates such a radar must be 
the soviets maintain the radar is designed for the tracking of 
satellites and spacecraft and not for the detection of any incoming 
missiles 
tass implied that gorbachev agreed to us demands that the 
krasnoyarsk base be scrapped 
this is our reply to the wests concerns over the krasnoyarsk 
station tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
on china gorbachev said soviets stand for the full 
normalization of relations and noted goodwill and trust have 
been increasing with the chinese 
the kremlins ties with beijing have been strained since the two 
communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences 
in the early 1960s 
fridays speech came at the end of a fiveday visit to the 
krasnoyarsk region during which gorbachev heard numerous complaints 
from residents about poor living conditions 
the 57yearold communist party chief referred to those 
complaints in fridays address and said social problems are a 
priority especially food shortages

a liquid resembling blood on the embassy steps and then chained 
themselves to the main entrance were identified as dale 
asharadavis 34 of baltimore md john schuchardt 49 of new 
haven conn and sara story 26 and charlie litery 57 both of

rains that began in midaugust and continued 
into early september provided much needed relief to parched areas 
of the midwest and southeast president reagans interagency 
drought committee said friday 
these rains provided little benefit to this years grain crop 
due to their occurrence late in the growing season but they will 
improve forage supplies and soil moisture conditions for 1989 
crops the committee report said 
the report was the fourth since the committee was formed in 
midjune a final summation will be prepared in december the 
report said 
in recent weeks the focus of the 1988 drought has shifted 
from agriculture to the severe wildfires in the far west the 
report said 
nationwide over 68000 wildfires have destroyed over 41 
million acres it addedl as a result of excessive heat and 
dryness in the west no relief is expected in the near term for the 
nations forests the economic impact of forest damage this year 
will extend into future years 
in the case of agriculture the drought caused crop damage and 
other losses that are estimated to total about 14 billion to 16 
billion this year in terms of 1982 farm prices the report said 
however the net cash income of farmers is expected to be about 
equal to last years level because of sales from inventory stocks 
and higher commodity prices 
the committee headed by agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
included interior secretary donald hodel and representatives of the 
vice presidents office the army corps of engineers the energy 
department the tennesee valley authority the office of management

textilestate lawmakers won a key tactical 
victory friday in the house persuading a committee chairman to 
change course and push for approval of senatepassed import 
legislation without any changes 
in my opinion this will insure passage of the textile bill by 
congress this year sen strom thurmond rsc said after 
receiving word of the decision the biggest danger we face now is 
a presidential veto 
the bill designed to protect american manufacturers from 
foreign competition would freeze current textile and apparel 
imports at 1987 levels and hold growth to one percent annually 
starting next year 
advancing amid a flurry of reagan administration veto threats 
the measure would also cap nonrubber footwear imports at 1987 
levels with no provision for increases 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill met for 45 minutes with 20 textilestate lawmakers and then 
consulted with senior committee members before deciding on an 
aboutface that will avoid sending the bill to a housesenate 
conference committee 
at rostenkowskis urging the committee had approved wednesday a 
plan to send the bill to a conference committee with the senate to 
resolve differences textile lawmakers said the measure could 
become snagged in the conference committee 
house speaker jim wright dtexas told reporters thursday that 
it was not certain that the measure would go to a conference 
committee he indicated that there was still time to change course 
the bills supporters say it is needed to save american jobs 
that will inevitably dwindle as the us market becomes flooded 
with textile and apparel imports critics say the measure 
represents protectionism that would narrow consumer choices and 
actually cost more jobs than it would save when asian 
textileexporting nations retaliate 
congressional supporters of the textile industry expect reagan 
to veto the legislation he vetoed an earlier version in 1985 
thus far industry supporters have been unable to muster the 
twothirds support in either house needed to override a veto and 
pass the measure into law over the presidents objections 
at all costs however they hope to deny reagan the opportunity 
to exercise a socalled pocket veto the president may prevent a 
bill from becoming law when congress is out of session merely by 
refusing to sign it 
congress had set a target date for adjournment of oct 5 
although that easily could be extended an extra week 
textile industry supporters say forcing reagan to use his veto 
pen and not merely kill the bill with a pocket veto would exact a 
much higher political price from the republican ticket in 
textileproducing states 
differences between the senate bill and the yearold house 
version are few the house bill would freeze imports at 1986 
levels it would set up a oneyear pilot program under which the 
government would auction off import licenses 
it would guarantee better quotas to countries that increased 
their purchases of us farm goods and it would set up a special 
quota for imported silk neckties other than that the two measures 
are the same

a sinkhole that opened up beneath a 
stretch of railroad track caused 27 cars of a freight train to 
derail csx transportation officials said friday 
the hole is the cause of the accident there is no doubt about 
that its as if a bridge fell or a tunnel collapsed its obvious 
the whole track dropped fix to six feet but we dont know why 
csx spokesman lloyd lewis said 
the whole crossing where that track is contained is gone he 
said 
another csx spokesman lindsay leckie said a depression about 
100 feet long 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep formed under the 
tracks as the train rolled along early thursday 
there was apparently some water intrusion under the roadbed 
which caused the track structure to collapse the key question is 
what caused this intrusion leckie said 
he said the appearance of the hole was sudden unobservable 
and undetectable adding that four locomotives and eight cars 
passed over it before the derailment and other trains had used the 
tracks an hour earlier 
tanker cars damaged in the derailment spewed noxious fumes into 
the air two florida highway patrol troopers were hospitalized for 
respiratory problems after inhaling potassium hydroxide and 
several other officers and railroad workers were treated for 
respiratory problems 
the derailment forced the closing of five major intersections 
and 45 nearby businesses four intersections and the businesses

roundtable meeting of social groups on major polish problems 
walesa last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of 
walkouts after obtaining from the government an agreement to meet 
the labor unrest posed the most serious threat to solidarity since 
it was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981 
twentyfive people took part in fridays meeting among them 
other solidarity leaders and representatives of the officially 
sanctioned trade union alliance opzz who were invited to the 
preparatory talks for the first time 
during the talks matters related to the organization of the 
round table were discussed said a joint communique issued after 
the meeting and carried by the state news service pap 
the positions of the sides were brought closer it said

stelmachowski a law professor who has been the gobetween in 
arranging the meetings reported no definite decisions were 
taken but there was some progress 
he said it would be too early to say that authorities have 
agreed to restore legal status to solidarity

a jury decided friday that valerie harper was 
right and lorimar telepictures corp was wrong in the dispute that 
ended her role in the valerie television series awarding her 
nearly 2 million in damages and a share of the profits 
the jurors gave miss harper and her husband tony cacciotti who 
worked as a supervising producer for the show 185 million in 
general damages 
the jury found that miss harper also is entitled to 125 percent 
of the adjusted gross profits of the series for the 198788 season 
even though she was no longer on the show for most of the season 
the contract wold have run through 1991 
her lawyer estimated that her share of last seasons profits 
could eventually amount to as much as 15 million if the show is 
syndicated 
jurors found that lorimar had acted with oppression and 
malice in firing her but the jury declined to grant her and her 
husband any punitive damages 
the television business is just like any other business 
said jury foreman archie mcdaniels a postal worker you have 
good and bad this verdict doesnt condemn the tv industry you 
just have to treat people fairly 
some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering 
their verdict to get miss harpers autograph the actress engulfed 
by wellwishers and reporters as she left the courtroom said she 
felt vindicated 
she said she hoped the decision will be a landmark in terms of 
how actors are dealt with 
people have to be accountable for what they do she said 
thats the real victory in this case 
lorimar attorney donald engel called the verdict a mixed bag 
and said that from lorimars standpoint it could have been 
worse he said he was pleased that no punitive damages were 
awarded and added that in a case that pitted an an individual 
against a big corporation we didnt do so bad 
he said an appeal was unlikely because the verdict is so 
small but lorimar spokeswoman barbara brogliatti said were 
disappointed in the verdict and our attorney has advised us there 
are grounds for an appeal and we are considering it 
lorimar sued miss harper claiming she breached her contract by 
quitting the nbc show valerie a countersuit by miss harper and 
her husband contended she was wrongfully fired from the show 
lorimar offered extensive testimony depicting miss harper as a 
temperamental star who wanted complete creative control miss 
harper testified she wanted input on creative decisions but was not 
trying to wrest complete control 
she had stressed that she brought the concept of the valerie 
series to nbc and expected to help shape the episodes she claimed 
the writers and producers changed the show to minimize her role and 
focus on the teenage boys in the series 
sandy duncan replaced miss harper on the show which was 
retitled the hogan family

a federal appeals court reversed two previous 
court decisions and let stand friday changes the government imposed 
three years ago in the way automobile fuel economy is tested 
critics of the 1985 changes by the environmental protection 
agency had charged that the changes had allowed automakers to save 
millions of dollars in penalties for failing to meet fuel economy 
standards 
a threejudge panel and later the us circuit court of appeals 
had ruled in favor of a suit filed by the center for auto safety 
challenging the epas 1985 decision which eased methods used by 
automakers to determine gas mileage for each of their car models 
those tests are used to determine fleetwide fuel economy 
figures that each automaker must meet under separate regulations 
the national highway traffic safety administration establishes the 
fleet average and if an automaker does not meet the average and 
does not have credits from past years it must pay a civil penalty 
the full appeals court said friday that the two previous 
rulings in 1986 and last may were in error as a result the epa 
testing procedures imposed in 1985 will stand 
the full 11member appeals court said that it had not been 
determined that the center for auto safety had standing to 
challenge the regulatory change by the epa noting that the court 
that issued the earlier decision had been sharply divided on that 
issue 
the ruling last may in favor of the center for auto safety suit 
came in a 55 vote 
we now hold that as a majority of the court was unable to 
satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction the court should 
not have taken any affirmative action on the merits of the 
case the court said friday 
the issue involves testing methods used by the automakers for 
determining the fuel economy of each car model the epa in 1985 
agreed to allow a series of technical changes in those methods 
which critics said made it easier for the manufacturers to attain 
higher mileage figures and in turn made it easier to meet 
fleetwide fuel economy requirements 
as a result the suit argued manufacturers such as ford motor 
co and general motors corp which were having difficulty meeting 
the fuel economy requirements anyway saved millions of dollars in 
penalties 
the effect of todays decision is to let gm and ford off the 
hook from having to pay any penalties for failing to comply with 
fuel economy standards in previous model years said cornish 
hitchcock an attorney for the center for auto safety 
the automakers welcomed the appeals court decision 
it reinstates epas original rulemaking which ford believes 
did account for the effects of changing test procedures on our 
corporate average fuel economy said donald buist director of 
fords automotive emissions and fuel economy office in dearborn 
mich 
william h noack a washingtonbased spokesman for general 
motors said the company welcomed the decision but said it 
would have no effect on gms fleetwide fuel efficiency performance 
for 1988 through 1990 models 
federal law requires a 275 miles per gallon fleetwide fuel 
economy standards for 198990 model cars but nhtsa has proposed 
lowering that to 265 mpg it has lowered it to 26 mpg in each of 
the past three model years arguing that consumer demand for large 
less fuel efficient cars make the 275 standard difficult for 
automakers to reach

sixteen congressional committee chairmen 
subcommittee chairman and ranking republicans asked the 
environmental protection agency on friday not to begin a major 
study of the superfund toxic waste cleanup program so late in 
the administration 
the agency should concentrate its full energy and resources on 
implementing amendments to the cleanup law passed in 1986 
rather than on reopening many policy questions which were hotly 
contested during enactment and during reauthorization less than two 
years ago the leaders wrote to epa 
second it is inappropriate to spend superfund money to 
undertake a costly superfund reauthorization study during the final 
days of this administration the group said 
the agency had planned to give the conservation foundation 25 
million for a study to define issues that should be dealt with in 
the superfund program environmentalists had objected that such a 
study really should be done as part of the congressional work 
leading to renewal of the law in 1991 
any longterm superfund study going beyond data gathering 
should be developed by the next administration the chairmen said 
craig deremer an aide to thomas said the agency had to study 
the letter before replying but it appeared that they have 
misunderstood some of the purposes of the study he said thomas 
wanted an examination of all hazardous waste issues not just 
superfund 
he noted that thomas in a thursday conversation with reporters 
had said most superfund issues could be characterized as both 
policy and implementation issues such as the question of 
how clean is clean standards 
in that conversation thomas noted i havent had anybody yet 
come to me and say lee this is a dumb idea however he said 
we probably wont proceed if environmental groups decline to 
serve on the study steering committee 
the issues are going to be the same in any administration 
deremer said there is no reason to wait changes can always be 
made in the new administration

advocates for the homeless told a federal 
judge friday that the department of housing and urban development 
violated the law by selling foreclosed homes to the highest bidder 
without determining whether they could be used by the homeless and 
lowincome people 
william bradford representing the coalition of advocates for 
the homeless told us district judge oliver gasch that hud 
receives 70000 singlefamily houses each year about 7000 a 
month but the agency cannot proceed as if it is simply in the 
real estate business they must consider the homeless 
in a related case the national coalition for the homeless also 
argued that the reagan administration has defied a congressional 
mandate to release underutilized federal property as housing for 
the nations homeless 
ms maria foscarinis a coalition attorney said there are 
thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the 
homeless she said that of the 12 facilities have been identified 
as underutilized by the veterans administration the defense 
department and the general services administration only two have 
been made available to the homeless 
government attorney w robert irwin argued that the 1987 stuart 
b mckinney homeless assistance act named after the late 
connecticut congressman who was a leading promoter of the measure 
does not apply to singlefamily dwellings 
they want to shut down a program that has been going on for 50 
years irwin said they want to tie up the program 
arthur goldberg another government lawyer said all the 
agencies have complied with the provisions of the homeless act 
congress was trying to match up the needs of the homeless with 
the properties available he said it is not a perfect match 
gasch who heard three separate cases brought by homeless 
advocates against the government took them under advisement 
saying he would decide as soon as he can whether to issue 
preliminary injunctions 
bradford told the judge that two temporary restraining orders 
issued last month preventing hud from auctioning off its foreclosed 
singlefamily homes were to expire at the end of business friday 
gasch merely said i would hope they would maintain the status 
quo 
hud general counsel j michael dorsey said the federal agency 
would follow the restraining order voluntarily until the end of 
business next wednesday it was anticipated that gasch would decide 
the case by then 
hud has said that it generally sells the homes to the highest 
bidders frequently investors but insists that it has several 
programs designed to help homeless people find places to live 
recently hud has been selling an average of 7100 properties 
each month houses that had federal housing administration 
mortgage insurance and that went into foreclosure when their owners 
could no longer keep up the mortgage payments the program has 
produced some 24 billion in proceeds since oct 1 1987 the 
start of the current fiscal year 
hud officials have argued that the court decisions if upheld 
could cost the agency 3 billion a year and bankrupt its 
singlefamily mortgage insurance fund 
the mortgage bankers association of america in a 
friendofthecourt brief said if gasch issued an injunction it 
would interfere with the orderly and efficient way hud replenishes 
and restores the actuarial soundness of the fha program 
the association said it would reduce future refunds of premiums 
paid by current fhainsured home owners increase premiums of 
future fha homeowners make singlefamily programs unavailable or 
less attractive to prospective home buyers and reduce the 
opportunities of home ownership for individuals and families in the 
future

supporters of president corazon 
aquino launched a new proadministration political party friday 
but she said the move must not be allowed to divide democratic 
forces 
mrs aquino hailed the formation of struggle of the democratic 
filipino the latest step in the realignment of forces that toppled 
president ferdinand marcos 20year regime and propelled her to 
power in february 1986 
mrs aquino made the remarks in a speech to the first national 
convention of the party 
perhaps it is time to have political parties she said in a 
speech opening its first convention perhaps indeed the time for 
realignment is now yet i hope that these realignments do not 
portend the permanent and total division of the forces of democracy 
in our country for should that happen it will mean the end of all 
of us 
she said divisions among prodemocracy filipinos enabled marcos 
now in exile in hawaii to impose eight years of martial law in 
1972 and prolong his rule 
it is good for the country and for democracy if people with 
shared ideals and programs organize themselves into separate 
parties mrs aquino said but it would be disastrous if we 
divided ourselves again into permanent hostile camps 
rep ramon mitra speaker of the house of representatives was 
elected president of the new party which organizers hope will 
bring together progovernment forces under a single banner and 
serve as the presidents party 
in february 1986 mrs aquino ran for president under the banner 
of the united nationalist democratic organization or unido the 
party of her running mate salvador laurel since then vice 
president laurel has criticized mrs aquinos policies unido has 
fared poorly at the ballot box and many of the partys legislators 
have defected to proaquino parties 
last month laurel formed an opposition movement the union for 
national action he accused mrs aquino of incompetence and urged 
her to resign to make way for new elections but he received little 
popular support 
some proaquino politicians say formation of the struggle for 
the democratic filipino is a bid by the presidents relatives and 
others to consolidate their own power before the 1992 presidential 
election among the partys main organizers is rep jose cojuangco 
mrs aquinos influential younger brother 
mrs aquino who has vowed not to seek reelection told more 
than 5000 delegates that she hoped the party was organized not 
only for the 1992 elections but to help our people face and 
overcome their problems 
she said filipinos were disenchanted with traditional political 
parties and the bickering and constant jockeying for positions 
political parties in the philippines traditionally revolved around 
personalities rather than ideology 
mitra said mrs aquino avoided giving the party a ringing 
endorsement because she did not want to be accused of playing 
politics mrs aquino said she was not favoring the party over 
other parties in the government coalition and would keynote their 
conventions if invited 
mitra said thursday that the party was organized to consolidate 
political support for the government and establish a grassroots 
mass movement behind mrs aquino 
but there are others who do not believe in this thinking 
mitra said he was referring to the refusal of 18 liberal party 
members in the house to join the new party 
the liberals led by senate president jovito salonga are among 
six parties in the government coalition but the liberals have 
disagreed with other progovernment parties and with some of the 
presidents influential relatives

the army imposed curfews friday on 180000 
arabs living in gaza strip refugee camps to prevent violence after 
activists called a general strike to mark the 1982 massacre of 
hundreds of palestinians in lebanon 
in southern lebanon troops fatally shot three plo guerrillas 
who the army said planned to attack israeli settlements 
a palestine liberation organization official told an israeli 
daily the plo wants to negotiate peace but would not abandon 
attacks against israel 
police questioned israeli peace crusader abie nathan who met 
this week with plo chief yasser arafat in violation of israeli law 
nathan 61 was released on 3000 bail 
i violated the law to promote peace and im ready to pay 
the price said nathan a former fighter pilot and owner of the 
pirate radio station voice of peace 
in the west bank city of nablus troops fired at palestinian 
stonethrowers critically wounding a 14yearold boy in the 
stomach hospital officials said the army said it was checking the 
report 
the army denied another report by arab hospital officials that 
israeli troop gunfire wounded a palestinian in jabaliya refugee 
camp outside gaza city 
a 25yearold jewish woman was hit by a rock and suffered a 
skull fracture while driving past dahariyeh south of hebron in the 
west bank on her way home to a settlement near jerusalem said 
tammy lunenfeld spokeswoman for beershebas soroka hospital 
also friday the army banned distribution of the proplo al fajr 
newspaper in the occupied territories for 45 days the military 
government announced 
it said the paper based in arab east jerusalem violated the 
law by publishing a very antisemitic cartoon depicting a jew as 
a nazi without submitting the cartoon to military censors 
at least 266 palestinians and six israelis have been killed 
since the palestinian uprising began dec 8 in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
propl0 leaders of the uprising called a general strike for 
saturday to mark the sixth anniversary of the slayings of hundreds 
of palestinians by israeliallied christian militiamen in the 
beirut refugee camps sabra and chatilla 
the army imposed indefinite curfews on the gaza strip refugee 
camps bureij jabaliya nuseirat khan yunis and shati to prevent 
clashes during the anniversary confining 180000 palestinians to 
their homes four west bank villages also were under curfew 
in gaza city islamic militants belonging to the underground 
group hamas or zeal painted graffiti calling on merchants to 
observe the strike one slogan written in hebrew and arabic read 
death to the jews arab witnesses said 
the three guerrillas killed in southern lebanon belonged to 
arafats fatah faction the largest in the plo israel radio said 
the squad carried sovietmade kalashnikov rifles equipped with 
silencers and apparently was planning to attack border settlements 
in northern israel the report said 
an army patrol spotted the guerrillas on the northern slopes of 
mount dov on the israelilebanese border and opened fire the army 
said the israeli troops did not suffer casualties 
the clash was inside israels selfproclaimed security zone a 
six to10milewide strip north of the border it is patrolled by 
about 1000 israeli troops and an equal number of israelibacked 
lebanese militiamen 
in an interview published friday in the jerusalem post daily 
plo spokesman bassam abu sharif said the organization would not 
cease acts of violence against israel or call a halt to the 
uprising 
military operations that have been carried out against israel 
the israeli army will definitely continue as an act of 
resistance abu sharif said 
but he also said the plo was ready to deal with any 
representatives of the israelis who are courageous enough to sit 
and talk and negotiate peace 
nathan was interrogated for 90 minutes by police in the tel aviv 
suburb of petah tikva police officials said that once the 
investigation is completed it is up to the state attorney to 
determine whether nathan should stand trial 
nathan could face up to three years in prison for violating a 
1986 law that bars israelis from meeting with members of terror 
groups israel considers the plo a terror group 
nathan who made millions selling hamburgers in tel aviv before 
becoming a peace activist said he didnt think he broke the law 
because he met with arafat to promote peace 
as nathan arrived at the police station about 20 members of the 
antiarab kach movement waved an israeli flag and shouted a rope 
for the traitor nathan turned to the demonstrators and tapped 
his index finger against his temple to show he thought they were 
stupid 
nathan said he requested a meeting with prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to brief him on what arafat said 
shamir said he would not see the activist but told reporters 
one of his assistants might receive nathan

george bush took his patriotic road show to 
this northwest ohio community friday where some sponsors of the 
local flag city festival complained that he turned the 
nonpartisan event into a republican photo opportunity 
the gop presidential nominee told about 1000 people waving 
flags outside the elks lodge that the flag is back and rambled 
into a paraphrase of the pledge of allegiance during his halfhour 
speech 
i wish the cynics around our country on the east coast and 
west coast could be in findlay today to see the outpouring of 
patriotism bush said 
i thrill to the site of the flag ive seen it burned by 
enemies abroad and scorned by the misguided in our country and 
ive seen it wrapped around the coffins of young men he said 
what is it all about its the symbol of these united states 
of america and to the liberty for which it stands one nation 
under god with freedom and justice for all and lets never forget 
it 
neil scott a local businessman protested in an interview that 
what was intended to be a nonpartisan promotion of fun and 
patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private 
gain by a candidate 
dean fout president of the north end merchants association 
also expressed annoyance that bush would come charging in with i 
pledge allegience and all that stuff and take a lot of credit 
away from us 
the event was conceived by local merchants to celebrate 
patriotism and town spirit fout said findlay officially calls 
itself flag city 
local democrats planned to hold a proflag rally after 
bushs visit to promote the flag as a nonpartisan symbol that 
belongs to all of us scott said

a national institutes of health advisory 
committee recommended friday that medical research using tissue 
from intentionally aborted human fetuses receive federal backing 
although all the votes taken by the 21member panel of outside 
medical ethical religious and legal experts were tentative the 
panels chairman acknowledged at a news conference that he could 
not visualize a reversal of the fundamental recommendation 
the vote to recommend that research proceed was 190 with 
two abstentions 
the recommendation sets up a possible confrontation with the 
white house where one adviser to president reagan has made clear he 
wants to push for an executive order banning federal involvement in 
such research however it remains unclear whether that stance by 
adviser gary bauer has direct support from reagan or other top 
administration officials 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen told reporters 
thursday he has no intention of taking a position on the matter 
until nih officials have conducted a full review and said that 
could take several months bowen said that while he is personally 
opposed to abortion the procedure is legal and suggested it would 
be a waste not to use fetal tissue for treating parkinsons and 
similar diseases 
bowen also said it was unclear to him whether bauers memo 
reflected reagans wishes of the advisers own 
the committee chairman retired federal appeals judge arlin m 
adams defended the makeup of the panel which has been criticized 
by some antiabortionists as being skewed in favor of allowing 
fetal tissue research 
adams said he helped pick the panel and did so without knowledge 
of the members personal views on abortion 
he said a reading of his own opinions while a judge would 
reflect that he was very concerned about abortion 
i didnt know how i was going to vote until i had heard the 
testimony said adams who voted in favor of allowing the 
research 
dr kenneth j ryan head of the department of obstetrics and 
gynecology at brigham and womens hospital in boston acknowledged 
that fundamental questions about the morality of abortion were in 
the background hovering over us all the time 
ryan chairman of the scientific issues portion of the committee 
meetings said it was a testimony to the intellect of the committee 
members that even some of those with personal reservations about 
abortion were able to divorce those beliefs from the question of 
whether the remains from legal abortions could ethically be used in 
research 
the key to the threeday meeting was can you divorce the 
two he said it was a kind of tug of war whether you could or 
could not divorce it 
after spending several hours thursday night and most of the day 
friday discussing the fundamental question of whether it would be 
acceptable ethically to use purposely aborted fetal tissue in 
research the panel was left little time to consider details of the 
safeguards it concluded must accompany such a policy 
it did reach agreement that a pregnant woman should not be 
induced to terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for 
transplantation or medical research 
it also agreed that the mothers decision to have an abortion 
should be kept separate from her decision to allow the remains to 
be used for research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid 
commercialization of fetal tissue perhaps similar to the rules 
governing the handling of hearts kidneys and other organs used for 
transplant 
as part of those basic guidelines the panel suggested that 
anonymity be maintained between the donor and recipient and that 
the timing and method of abortion not be influenced by potential 
uses of the fetus for research 
although there was a distinct consensus on what safeguards the 
committee wants to see in its final recommendations most were not 
put in writing 
im not even sure what i voted on because i voted on so many 
principles without words said georgetown university law 
professor patricia a king 
her point made with a smile was not to complain about the 
procedure but to embrace adams plan to have the committee staff 
reduce the panels work to writing as soon as possible to make sure 
there were no misunderstandings before final votes are taken 
adams recessed the meeting late friday until an unspecified 
future date he said the issues were too important to rush and that 
the panel would have to meet again to finish its work in time to 
make its formal and written recommendations to a standing nih 
advisory committee by dec 1 
neither adams nor ryan would be drawn into expressing their 
views about assertions attributed to bauer suggesting the panels 
work might have little bearing on reagans eventual decision on 
whether to issue an executive order banning federal participation 
in fetal tissue research 
because its an election year i think its very difficult to 
comment on why people do what they do said ryan 
he did say that for the government to form an advisory committee 
and then make a decision before the panel had completed its work 
would fly in the face of the usefulness of appointing the 
committee in the first place

a businessman recently adopted by a 
german baron has a kingsize worry a 3 million mortgage that he 
must repay by next month to keep a bank from seizing the family 
castle 
richard hemmelsbach however is confident that his plans to 
turn the 1428yearold 100bedroom castle into a hotel will go 
forward before the bank acts 
we need to keep the castle in the family thats where it 
belongs said hemmelsbach the owner of two small marketing 
companies here 
hemmelsbach was adopted last month by the baron freiherr 
theodore von liebieg after the heirless baron conducted a 
nationwide search for an heir on the syndicated television show a 
current affair 
the hemmelsbach family and the barons family had known each 
other 40 years ago after world war ii and the baron recognized 
hemmelsbachs name from among about 10000 people who wrote asking 
to inherit the castle 
the new baron richard james von liebieg hemmelsbach said friday 
he is negotiating with a major us hotel chain interested in 
renovating a portion of the castle and turning it into a 
firstclass hotel and he is confident a deal with the company 
would secure the 3 million 
if hemmelsbach does not pay off the 3 million by oct 15 the 
bank holding the mortgage will offer the estate to other parties 
who have already expressed interest in buying it 
we need to keep the castle in the family thats where it 
belongs hemmelsbach said 
von liebieg who lives about 15 miles from the castle began his 
search for an heir to maintain the deteriorating estate after the 
bank recently repossessed it from a german businessman to whom von 
liebieg sold the castle 15 years ago 
the businessman also had planned to turn the castle into a 
hotel but financial troubles forced him to abandon his plans 
hemmelsbach said 
the castle reportedly the oldest in germany is located on the 
banks of the mosel river at the base of the eifel mountains 
hemmelsbach would not name the company interested in developing 
the property but said several others and a group of investors were 
waiting in the wings if the deal falls through he said he believed 
it would cost between 9 million and 12 million to renovate the 
castle which sits on 100 acres he said the castle accompanying 
estate and vineyards are worth 10 million 
meanwhile he is selling one of his marketing companies so he 
can devote his time to raising funds and expect to make his third 
trip to the castle within three weeks 
it was love at first sight hemmelsbach said of the estate

the state education department says communities 
are responsible for the education of children living within their 
boundaries even if they live in temporary shelters state parks or 
other temporary situations 
the policy was issued thursday after the hingham school 
department refused to allow four children in a family living 
temporarily in tents in wompatuck state park to attend hingham 
schools 
hingham school superintendent lewis j ernst had said the park 
was considered to be under state jurisdiction and that town 
taxpayers support school districts hingham is about 10 miles of 
boston on hingham bay 
the children have been going to school this month in nearby 
norwell where the school committee voted unanimously to let them 
attend school without paying outoftown tuition 
state education commissioner harold raynolds jr said in a 
statement that the law entitles all children to attend the public 
schools in the towns in which they live 
that law applies to children irrespective of their living 
situation whether they live with parents or other relatives in 
foster homes or in temporary shelters or motels because they have 
been displaced from their homes he said 
edward melikian spokesman for the education department said it 
is up to john and kitty montgomery who are living with five 
children four of school age in three tents in the state park to 
decide whether to transfer the children from norwell to hingham 
schools 
the parents said they would like to keep the children in norwell 
schools 
norwell has been so incredibly gracious with our kids said 
montgomery the montgomerys moved from tucson ariz in late 
august to be near mrs montgomerys father while montgomery has 
found a job and his wife also hopes to work they have not found

seabrook nuclear power plant officials 
said friday that preparations for lowpower testing will begin 
immediately following a nuclear regulatory commission vote to clear 
a major obstacle toward a license 
but opponents declared the fight to stop seabrook from operating 
is far from over 
at a news conference edward brown president of new hampshire 
yankee hailed fridays nrc action as another major step forward 
for seabrook 
he said seabrook will require about five weeks of preparation 
before the plant would be ready to begin testing at 5 percent 
power actual issuance of the license could take another four 
weeks and atomic tests could begin two weeks after that he 
estimated 
the nrc by a 40 vote approved a rule change that emergency 
sirens do not have to be in place before lowpower testing begins 
but the commission left open the question of whether seabrooks 
owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests 
ill say without absolutely no qualification whatsoever there 
is no hazard to public safety from lowpower testing absolutely 
none brown said in regard to the nrc decision to allow the 
testing without sirens 
opponents however denounced the nrc vote as weakening 
protections to the public 
the decision again shows the reaganbush administration is so 
blindly committed to getting seabrook on line that public 
protection doesnt matter said rep edward j markey dmass 
the administration has placed the shortterm economic 
interests of one utility ahead of the longterm health and safety 
of citizens living around the plant its goal is to get this plant 
plugged in and turned on before nov 8 so that no one can turn it 
off later 
brown denied there was a connection between seabrooks plans and 
the november election saying the timing is pure coincidence 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee has been a longtime opponent of seabrook he 
denounced the latest decision in a prepared statement saying the 
nrc the not responsible commission is experiencing a meltdown 
in its thinking process 
regarding seabrooks finances brown predicted that a final 
agreement will be in place within several weeks to cover payments 
being skipped by the owner of the fourth largest seabrook share 
massachusetts municipal wholesale electric co 
brown also said he doubts that the bankruptcy judge overseeing 
public services reorganization would block lowpower testing once 
he hears the facts on lowpower and not the myths 
however tom moughan of citizens within the 10mile radius 
said nrcs decision to deal with financial questions later means 
the fight isnt over 
we think the public needs to understand that the fullpower 
license possibilities are distant still he said

michael dukakis pledged friday to double the number of federal 
drug agents over the next five years as he charged the reagan 
administration with using a nickel and dime approach to the war 
on narcotics george bush ridiculed dukakis attempts to portray 
himself as a defenseminded candidate 
you cannot fool the soviet leadership by knocking americas 
defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 
minutes the vice president said referring to his democratic 
rivals visit earlier in the week to a tank design facility in 
michigan you cant fool the american people 
bush played tough in his television commercials as well airing 
an advertisement in dukakis home state of massachusetts that 
accused him of failing to clean up polluted boston harbor 
the vice president headed for washington after a threecity tour 
of ohio while dukakis was flying home to massachusetts on saturday 
night both men have set aside large parts of next week to prepare 
for their first debate of the fall presidential campaign a 
90minute nationally televised session a week from sunday in 
winstonsalem nc 
democrat dukakis has spent much of the week trying to regain the 
momentum in the race for the white house and his tough anticrime 
speech in a visit to the los angeles police academy was part of 
that effort 
in what has become the standard madefortelevision element of 
every campaign day he observed officer jerry mulford demonstrate 
cover and concealment tactics at a simulated street scene 
mulford ducked behind wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at 
various moving and popup targets normally live ammunition is 
used in such exercises but the secret service protecting dukakis 
vetoed that idea 
dukakis said he would assign the first 100 new drug agents to 
southern california and he said he would double the total number 
of agents nationally over the next five years 
we are going to hire the state and local law enforcement 
officers the money to fight the war he said we are not going 
to try to nickel and dime you to death as this administration has 
done 
aides said he was prepared to spend 50 million to hire new 
agents next year toward a fiveyear goal of 2800 agents although 
a fact sheet issued to reporters said the cost of the agents would 
be offset by seized drug profits 
aides also said dukakis was committed to hiring 800 additional 
federal prosecutors 
were going to send a message to drug kingpins he said 
as far as mike dukakis is concerned theres nowhere you can run 
theres nowhere you can sail theres nowhere you can hide there 
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere 
on this earth 
but while making an appearance at a chula vista calif police 
station dukakis was greeted by probush demonstrators some 
wearing striped mock prison uniforms and chanting let me out 
ill kill again the chant referred to the massachusetts 
governors furlough program since modified that enabled a 
convicted killer to go to another state and rape a woman 
other demonstrators recited the pledge of allegiance in a dig at 
dukakis veto of a constitutionally doubtful bill requiring 
massachusetts teachers to lead students in the pledge 
bush used his first news conference in two weeks to try and 
blunt some of the work dukakis did earlier in the week to buttress 
his own defense credentials he opened with a statement saying the 
tank dukakis rode in did not fit 
later he said hes gone to states like this found that his 
message of cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not 
popular and so now hes been made over hes coming out with 
policies quite different but which ones do you believe 
dukakis delivered a speech in washington earlier this week in 
which he renewed his opposition to some weapons but pledged 
support for others and criticized the reagan administration for not 
devoting enough attention to tanks and other conventional weapons 
the vice president who has moved up markedly in the polls in 
the last few weeks acknowledged that some of his aides do not want 
him to take questions from reporters for fear it would distract 
from campaign themes he stresses in his other appearances its 
just some lowerlevel handwringers who think im going to screw 
up he said 
bush campaigned at a buckeye steel mill in ohio where he noted 
his grandfather samuel prescott bush was one of the firms 
founders in a speech seemingly aimed at democrats who voted for 
reagan in 1980 and 1984 a key bloc of voters in the industrial 
midwest bush stressed his opposition to gun control and abortion 
and his support for prayer in schools and capital punishment 
bush also rambled into a paraphrase of the pledge during a 
flagdraped appearance in findlay ohio where he paid tribute to 
the american flag its the symbol of these united states of 
america and to the liberty for which it stands one nation under 
god with freedom and justice for all and lets never forget it 
he said 
in washington members of the dukakis campaign the democratic 
national committee and jesse jacksons national rainbow coalition 
stressed unity during a news conference in which they announced a 
steppedup registration and getoutthevote effort 
joseph warren the general election coordinator for the dukakis 
campaign said the drive targets 42 cities in 14 states the 
democratic party will take the lead in the campaign which will 
try to register 2 million new voters and win 70 percent black voter 
participation in the nov 8 election 
bushs appearance in findlay at a flag city festival drew 
criticism from some of the events organizers who said they had 
intended it to be a nonpartisan event 
the campaign understudies were hunting votes as well 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle poked fun at 
himself and the controversy that has dogged him sometimes they 
tell you to go to your room the 41yearold indiana senator said 
of his aides some of whom are older than he is 
democrat lloyd bentsen criticized bush for having a bad case 
of laryngitis when it comes to leadership

democratic candidate michael dukakis promised 
friday to double the number of drug enforcement agents and vowed 
there will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits 
anywhere on this earth 
the massachusetts governor delivered a tough anticrime speech 
during an appearance at the los angeles police academy where he 
observed a training exercise on a simulated city street called 
hogans alley 
while dukakis stood a few feet away officer jerry mulford 
demonstrated cover and concealment tactics ducking behind 
wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at various moving and 
popup targets 
trainees usually use live ammunition in such exercises but the 
secret service vetoed the practice during dukakis visit 
in his speech dukakis told police recruits that the reagan 
administration was trying to nickel and dime you to death by 
cutting funds for drug enforcement 
were going to give the state and local law enforcement 
officers the money they need to fight this war he said 
youre the ones who take the risks youre the ones who make 
the busts youre the ones who bear the costs of this war and you 
deserve the best equipment and the best communications and the best 
training we can give you dukakis said 
in a later appearance at a chula vista calif police station 
dukakis was greeted by demonstrators who needled the massachusetts 
governor for his sincemodified prison furlough policy and for his 
veto on constitutial grounds of a bill requiring teachers to lead 
students in the pledge of allegiance 
one group wore mock prison uniforms and chanted let me out 
ill kill again and another carried progeorge bush signs and 
recited the pledge 
dukakis said at the police academy he would double the number of 
drug enforcement administration efforts over the next five years 
and added were going to send the first 100 of those new agents 
here to south california 
he said the cost of the new agents would be more than covered by 
the increased revenue in seized drug profits 
dukakis aides quoted dea estimates that each agent seized an 
average of 259000 in drug profits in 1987 more than double what 
it cost to keep them in the field 
dukakis also pledged to hire 800 more federal prosecutors and to 
wage an allout effort to hunt down to freeze and to seize drug 
profits wherever we can find them 
were going to send a message to drug kingpins he said 
as far as mike dukakis is concerned theres nowhere you can run 
theres nowhere you can sail theres nowhere you can hide there 
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere 
on this earth 
republican presidential nominee george bush has criticized 
dukakis for his refusal to endorse bushs proposal for imposing the 
death penalty on drug kingpins 
dukakis continued his drug war theme during a mexican 
independence day celebration at roosevelt high school in east los 
angeles an area with a large mexicanamerican population 
there he told students that under the reagan administration at 
one point it got so bad that agents of the drug enforcement 
administration had to have a bake sale to raise money to finance 
drug stakeout operations 
however aides said afterword that the bake sale described in a 
book by elaine shannon entitled desperado was to raise money 
for drug education programs 
we need a president in this country who will make a difference 
and not excuses he told a cheering crowd composed mostly of 
students 
i hope many of you will become the future political leaders of 
this country he said 
hispanics make up 23 percent of the population of california

iraq on friday refused to receive a un 
team to investigate allegations that it used outlawed poison gas 
against its kurdish minority 
acting ambassador ali mahmoud sumaida delivered the iraqi 
governments formal rejection friday night to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the response was negative sumaida told reporters after his 
meeting we declined to receive such a mission because there is 
no basis for evidence for such a mission 
he said that reports by a turkish team of experts and the 
turkish red crescent turkeys equivalent of the red cross did 
not provide sufficient evidence to warrant dispatching a team of 
investigators 
at least a dozen nations including the united states britain 
and nordic countries had urged the secretarygeneral to send a team 
to investigate the charges that iraq was using chemical warfare 
against kurdish rebels 
iraq has said however that foreign journalists were welcome to 
investigate although the united nations was not welcome 
no immediate response came from the secretarygeneral the 
united nations is circumspect when the soveignty of a member is 
involved however and it is unlikely the world organization would 
consider sending an investigatory team lacking cooperation by the 
host country

fires in yellowstone 
national park picked up again friday but fire officials were 
confident moisture from storms last weekend and work since then 
would prevent the fires from growing 
this week i think theyre fairly confident with the measures 
theyve taken during the early part of this week that theyll be 
able to hold the fires said fire information officer linda 
miller i think theyre fairly confident that they wont have any 
major problems 
the fires which now form one huge blaze have affected 11 
million acres of the 22 millionacre park but according to new 
infrared scans they have burned only about 50 percent to 60 
percent of the land within fire perimeters 
park officials said the fires remained inside fire perimeters 
friday 
i dont think anything slopped over any lines said park 
spokeswoman sonya capek 
temperatures in the park only reached the mid60s and steady 
winds approached 35 mph the weather forecast offered some good 
news for saturday with a chance of light snowshowers in the 
afternoon and temperatures in the 50s the storm also could bring 
some heavy winds but capek said the high humidity and cold 
temperatures will keep the fires down 
firefighters had taken advantage of the wet cold weather 
earlier in the week to strengthen existing lines around fires and 
extend lines and by friday had contained 50 percent of the 
335500acre north fork fire the most troublesome of the blazes in 
the park 
blazes also burned friday in montana idaho oregon and 
washington state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued 
more than 4 million acres including 21 million acres in alaska 
have gone up in smoke 
denny bungarz north fork fire incident commander said 
officials believe it would take seven days of continued dry weather 
before yellowstone would return to the tinderdry conditions that 
allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres daily 
and 700 marines from camp pendleton in california reached the 
park friday to help with firefighting efforts bringing the 
military force in the countrys first national park to 4100 
thirty canadian firefighters arrived friday the first canadian 
crew to arrive since the us forest service accepted that 
countrys offer to help 
firefighters had contained 70 percent of the 413380acre clover 
mist fire in the parks northeastern corner that leaves the wolf 
lake fire on the northeast edge of the north fork as the only 
fire where containment figures were below 50 percent firefighters 
had contained 8 percent of that blaze 
to the south officials in the bridgerteton national forest 
declared the 225500acre huckmink complex of fires fully 
contained 
wildfires continued to burn in most of idahos national forests 
friday and fire bosses welcomed a weekend forecast of cooler 
wetter weather 
i dont know if were over the hump as far as the fire season 
goes but weve been saying were guardedly optimistic said 
sandi sacher an information officer at the boise interagency fire 
center 
fires that so far had consumed more than 190000 acres remained 
out of control and outside wilderness boundaries in the nez perce 
challis panhandle and salmon national forests ms sacher said 
restrictions on the use of several national forests in western 
montana were lifted friday 
we had enough moisture so that we dropped down to a 
moderate fire danger said bob krepps of the forest service 
meanwhile a fire in glacier national park had grown about 2000 
acres by friday and in westcentral montana hundreds of soldiers 
helped crews mop up the 247000acre canyon creek blaze

the 1988 summer olympics the largest 
and most tightly guarded in history began in a blaze of pageantry 
saturday as marchers in traditional korean costumes entered the 
main stadium to the beat of a dragon drum 
about 70000 spectators in the olympic stadium and up to a 
billion television viewers around the world watched the spectacular 
show that began at 1030 am 830 pm edt friday in sunny 
weather 
it was the first olympic opening ceremony with a prelude outside 
the main stadium before the performances in the olylmpic stadium 
a flotilla of 458 boats sailed by on the han river adjacent to the 
stadium 
the theme of the threehour extravaganza with 13000 
performers was beyond all barriers a phrase stressing the 
seoul games as a stage for the first eastwest competitions at the 
summer olympics in 12 years 
political boycotts had marred the 1980 moscow games and the los 
angeles competition four years ago 
about 160 countries sent nearly 10000 athletes to the games to 
compete for 237 gold medals making these 16day games the 
bestattended ever by competitors 
south korean security forces ringing the stadium and on alert 
across the nation were on guard against terrorism officals called 
the measures the most extensive ever to protect a sports event 
greece led the parade of teams a tradition honoring the country 
as the site of the ancient olympics 
teams marched according to the korean alphabet with ghana 
second in the procession as the host nation south korea was last 
most teams were garbed in matching jackets and pants or skirts 
but african delegations wore native garb of flowing robes with 
colorful print patterns 
the processions seemed less formal than at past olympics opening 
ceremonies some teams broke ranks to wave to the cheering crowd 
an american athlete carried a sign proclaiming hi mom im 
here 
the teams gathered on the infield after circling the running 
track the march route took them past the seating area for 
dignitaries including south korean president roh taewoo and juan 
antonio samaranch president of the international olympic committee 
before the teams marched in a chorus sang an ancient seafaring 
ballad and thousands of blue and white balloons floated skyward a 
replica of the huge dragon drum used in ancient korean ceremonies 
was transfered from ship to shore then carried to the stadium 
huge balloons were released from a shindan tree sacred in 
korean mythology and then the olympic flame was revealed on a 
72foot pedestal resembling a traditional korean candleholder 
korean dancers in greek tunics and flowing gowns danced and 
whirled as silvercolored confetti rained down from the sky 
i believe god is blessing my country for its years of hard 
work and preparation said yuk heejin 17 a spectator im 
really proud of my country the whole world will now know more 
about korea 
the opening ceremonies as conceived planned practiced and 
practiced again were designed by the games hosts to portray the 
eastern philosophies of harmony and balance factors longwanting 
in koreas tumultuous history 
planners drew from the concept of yin and yang the symbol on 
the korean flag that is also a major oriental philosophy yin and 
yang represent opposing forces that come together in a bond of 
harmony and friendship 
so the script for the olympic opener mixed the yin of the old 
and the yang of the new 
music for the show came from ancient korean drums and wind 
instruments as well as a synthesizer that pumped out modern pieces 
composed by contemporary korean artists 
the koreans invited dancers from 60 nations to participate in 
the program of native dances from hungary peru senegal saudi 
arabia the united states and other nations 
music to accompany the marchers was composed from folk music of 
the various nations 
the koreans also sought to keep harmony among the nations 
marching in the opening ceremony plans to limit the number in the 
process were quickly scrapped after protests from several 
countries including the united states 
and while the program called for women in flowing white robes to 
march in front of the delegations carrying signs with each nations 
name iran was granted its wish that a man front their team because 
of the moslem nations strict fundamentalist tenets that forbid 
women from such public displays 
on friday a runner carried the olympic torch to city hall in a 
snowstorm of confetti streamers and balloons 
the torch relay began aug 23 in olympia greece site of the 
ancient olympics 
elsewhere in the capital hundreds of radicals staged 
antiolympic protests at three universities friday they burned the 
us flag and an effigy of president reagan and yelled down with 
the dictators olympics onlookers shouted at them as riot police 
watched from a distance 
in the protests radicals some of them armed with firebombs and 
clubs demanded the olympics be shared with communist north korea 
and charged the games were being used to cement authoritarian rule 
in south korea 
north korea declared again friday that the seoul government is 
using the games to further divide the korean peninsula 
the two koreas have been divided since the end of world war ii 
and fought the korean war in 195053

army militiamen backed by helicopter gunships mounted a twopronged 
assault against shiite moslem and leftist guerrillas in south 
lebanon on friday police reported 
a police spokesman said at least three lebanese villagers were 
wounded and more than 10 houses sustained severe damage in the 
attack it was apparently aimed at blunting increased guerrilla 
activity against israel 
at least two helicopter gunships flew several strafing runs in

even as one of the worst hurricanes of the 
century smashes through the gulf of mexico a scientist is warning 
that the socalled greenhouse effect could result in even stronger 
tropical storms 
dr kerry a emanuel of the massachusetts institute of 
technology said thursday the strongest hurricanes of the future 
could turn out to be even more powerful than storms such as 
hurricane gilbert 
hurricanes gain their strength from the energy transferred from 
the warm ocean waters to the air and clouds above warmer 
temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect could lead to more 
evaporation and heat transfer from the oceans and thus possibly 
stronger storms he explained

wage backed by republicans 
sen edward m kennedy dmass offered an amendment to his 
bill raising the minimum wage from its current 335 an hour to 
455 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12 
students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week 
at 85 percent of the minimum wage 
only about 100000 students are now earning the 285 subminimum 
wage according to labor department officials compared with 
515000 students in 1978 kennedy said his proposal would allow 
employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage 
on their payrolls 
the tactic was aimed at heading off a republican amendment by 
sen orrin hatch of utah to establish an 80 percent training wage

polls showed the social democrats who control 159 seats in the

a report that some hunters are skinning 
seals alive has touched off a bitter dispute in norway where 
hunters and fishermen say seal killing is crucial to their way of 
life 
odd f lindberg an author and photographer who sailed as a 
governmentappointed inspector on a hunting boat east of greenland 
last spring said in his report that seals were not only skinned 
alive but killed in deliberately sadistical ways 
the report came as authorities sought to ease controls on seal 
killing because fisherman complain that thousands of the animals 
have invaded norways northern coast eating fish and damaging nets 
since my report i have received at least 100 telephone 
threats with some saying they are going to tear my limbs off 
said lindberg 
the ministry of fisheries which employed lindberg to do the 
inspection refuses to accept his report 
it may be that he lindberg believes he has seen things that 
he has not seen said trond s paulsen a senior ministry 
official the ministry has no plans to take action on his report 
he said 
but the report drew widespread sympathy for seals following a 
summer of death for the animals further south a distemper virus 
killed 13000 seals along the coasts of denmark norway sweden 
the netherlands and west germany since april 
norways leading newspaper aftenposten devoted its front page 
to a color picture it said was taken by lindberg of a seal pup in 
the water being clubbed with the blunt side of a long spiked pole 
killing pups in the water is prohibited and it would appear 
from the photo that the hunter had apparently missed a clean kill 
on the head 
in the 1970s the french actress birgitte bardot greenpeace and 
other environmental organizations successfully campaigned against 
seal slaughter here and in canada 
their campaign led to a 1983 ban by the european economic 
community on imports of seal skins a heavy blow to the seal 
hunters whose main market was the european fur industry 
after the eec import ban the canadian government banned the 
killing of seal pups which are coveted for their white coats 
norways seal hunting fleet dwindled from about 50 vessels to 
five and the catch was cut from several hundred thousand seals a 
year to a quota of less than 40000 
however disgruntled seal hunters now see the chance for a 
comeback 
later this year the eec will start talks on the possibilities 
of either lifting the ban or making it permanent a decision is 
expected next year 
last years seal invasion softened public opinion in norway 
fishermen complained they could lose their livelihoods if the seals 
were allowed to continue to eat their catch and destroy their nets 
we count on the import ban being changed said spokesman jan 
lauritson at the ministry of fisheries there are no logical 
scientific grounds for it 
norway hunts seals during the spring in waters east of greenland 
and in the barents sea north of the soviet union 
lindberg was one of three inspectors assigned this year to make 
sure the killings were carried out according to detailed rules 
intended to minimize the animals suffering he spent from 
midmarch to midapril aboard a seal hunt vessel off greenland 
lindberg said he turned in his report to the ministry of 
fisheries at the beginning of july and that it created panic 
the animals are rarely checked to see if they have been 
fatally shot the report said and are often alive when they 
are hoisted aboard as a result it often happens that the animal is 
skinned while growling its eyes pleading and its mouth snapping at 
you 
he said he had seen animals that appeared to be dead but woke 
up while being skinned 
before releasing lindbergs report sept 2 the ministry issued 
a statement saying a committee of experts had found lindberg not 
trustworthy 
other inspectors made no such complaints said paulsen 
officials said no formal qualifications are needed to be an 
inspector but that they usually employ biologists students and 
researchers they said lindberg had offered to do the job without 
pay 
lindberg 43 has specialized in conditions for marine mammals 
in polar areas

the nationalist chinese military long the 
backbone of the government is under attack by critics who contend 
it remains too powerful at a time of easing tensions with rival 
communist china 
emboldened by the relaxed political atmosphere on taiwan after 
nearly four decades of authoritarian rule some taiwanese claim the 
military abuses its power despite the lifting of martial law here a 
year ago 
newspapers which customarily hushed up any allegations of 
military wrongdoing in the past now give wide coverage to the 
charges of abuses 
the nationalist government and armed forces led by chiang 
kaishek fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the 
communists on the mainland and remain technically at war with 
beijing 
china still regards taiwan as a renegade province but has not 
launched a significant military action since 1958 when communist 
forces fired hundreds of thousands of artillery shells at two tiny 
nationalistheld offshore islands quemoy and matsu 
soldiers used to be admired for defending the country with 
their lives said legislator chang shihliang of the governing 
nationalist party but with the absence of wars for so long 
people began to question what they have been doing 
a central figure in the controversy is taiwans only fourstar 
general hau peitsun head of the general chiefs of staff since 
1981 and one of those who came to taiwan after the communists won 
the mainland in 1949 
hau who commands taiwans half a million troops was praised 
for ensuring a peaceful transfer of power after the death in 
january of president chiang chingkuo the son of chiang kaishek 
who lifted martial law despite his strong ties to the military 
but critics argue that chiang chingkuos successor lee 
tenghui has little control over the armed forces which are 
allocated an estimated 46 percent of taiwans annual budget of 
nearly 20 billion 
no military officers dared to give an order without the prior 
approval from chiang chingkuo but it appears no one can control 
them now said chang chungtung history professor at national 
taiwan university 
lee a native taiwanese has yet to build up his own power base 
in the nationalist military that remains dominated by officers who 
came from mainland china that also has led to speculation that 
haus influence is growing 
some liberal newspapers and magazines recently criticized hau on 
grounds that he promoted several of his own men including two 
generals demoted by chiang chingkuo for dereliction of duty 
newspapers also have suggested that hau played an influential 
role in crafting the nationalist partys new policymaking central 
standing committee that was named in july the military retained 
three of 31 committee seats including one held by hau 
opposition politicians have assailed the armed forces for their 
role in trying to crack down on dissent claiming military police 
and intelligence agents have appeared at major antigovernment 
demonstrations where only a police presence was appropriate 
in august several dozen members of the opposition democratic 
progressive party staged a protest in taipei to demand the 
impeachment of hau because a military jail burned the memoirs of a 
renowned dissident prisoner 
the liberal independence evening post said in an editorial july 
27 that with the lifting of martial law we thought military 
personnel would reduce their role to that of defending the state 
and civilians 
rather we saw the military openly intervening in political 
factional disputes continuing to have a hand in social and 
economic affairs and having too much say in government personnel 
changes it said 
a defense ministry spokesman maj gen chang huiyuan called 
the newspapers accusations malicious slandering and an 
insult to our troops 
to counter the intense criticism the military has launched a 
campaign to stress the importance of national defense in speeches 
and through concerts plays and television shows including one 
showing the 69yearold hau swimming golfing and playing with his 
grandson 
in a speech marking soldiers day on sept 3 hau urged 
taiwanese not to reduce the sense of crisis while living in 
comfort claiming that communist china still could invade taiwan 
at any time 
professor chang reflects widespread sentiment when he labels as 
unlikely the possibility of a military coup or a militaryled 
campaign to reverse the recent liberalization trend that has 
permitted political opposition and relaxed unofficial ties with 
china 
military officers must have realized that the public would not 
support them in case of a coup he said they must also ask 
whether they could control the troops before moving to seize 
power 
most of the troops are native taiwanese who make up 85 percent 
of the islands population

when discoverys countdown clock 
reaches the 9minute mark on launch day it will stop automatically 
and be held there for 10 minutes while one man decides whether to 
give the final goahead for liftoff 
he will look to many experts analyzing every scrap of 
information for help they will report on the condition of the 
shuttle and its thousands of complex parts the state of the 
weather overhead and at prime and emergency landing sites around 
the globe the readiness of the launch and flight control teams to 
support the mission 
before the 10 minutes is up he will say go or nogo 
it is a new and awesome responsibility a product of the 
challenger disaster and it lies with robert l crippen a 
50yearold navy captain and an astronaut who has gone into space 
more often on the shuttle than any other person he piloted the 
first launch in 1981 and has commanded three other flights 
his fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own 
calling that critical shot 
rick hauck another navy captain who will command discovery on 
the first shuttle mission since challenger said i flew my first 
mission with him in 1983 and i cant think of anyone who is reverse transcriptase 
an enzyme the aids virus uses 
to replicate itself and spread through the body 
the experiment to grow crystals of the aids protein was 
developed by researchers at burroughs wellcome in research triangle 
park nc and nasa officials determined it was safe to fly on the 
shuttle 
another experiment involves taking photographs and video of 
lightning at night to study relationships between it and other 
elements such as thunderstorms such research may one day lead to 
better weather forecasting 
the altitude we fly at gives you kind of a unique perspective 
we get a very broad view of thunderstorms we can see a third of a 
continents worth of thunderstorms its spectacular nelson said 
astronauts also will photograph the sky immediately after sunset 
and after sunrise to measure the brightness of earths atmosphere 
at those times the information can be used to build sensors for 
future unmanned satellites nelson said 
the five other experiments consist of two separation processes 
and three basic research projects that include examining how metal 
melts and resolidifies in zero gravity mixing immiscible fluids 
and watching them separate and studying how blood flows and 
collects in weightlessness

almost all the men who ignored the warnings 
and gave the goahead for the challenger launch are gone and new 
ones are in place as the shuttle program returns to flight 
one shuttle astronaut richard truly now is at the helm of 
nasas spaceflight program another robert crippen who has been 
on four shuttle missions will give the final nod to commit 
discovery and other future shuttles to flight 
the top officials of morton thiokol which built the booster 
rocket that doomed the challenger are gone gone too is most of 
the nasa hierarchy and gone are the directors of nasa centers 
investigated by the presidential challenger commission 
there are two notable exceptions arnold aldrich one of the 
nasa bosses who gave final approval for the jan 28 1986 flight 
and allan j mcdonald a morton thiokol engineer who argued against 
the launch but was overruled aldrich is director of the shuttle 
program at nasa headquarters and mcdonald is in charge of thiokols 
space operations 
the rogers commission presented its conclusion that challenger 
was an accident rooted in history but it did not recommend any 
criminal indictment still sen ernest f hollings dsc 
demanded that every single person be identified and disciplined 
that seems to have been done without resorting to the courts 
lawrence b mulloy former manager of the booster rocket program 
at the marshall space flight center who had brushed off the thiokol 
concerns and stanley reinartz manager of shuttle projects who 
decided not to tell top launch officials about those concerns both 
left nasa so has george b hardy the marshall official who told 
thiokol he was appalled at the firms original recommendation 
that the launch should not take place 
the national aeronautics and space administration was working 
without its chief on the day of the tragedy and the man with the 
title of acting administrator was new to the agency 
administrator james m beggs had stepped aside in early december 
1985 when he was indicted on charges unrelated to nasa dr william 
r graham who had been deputy administrator for only 10 days when 
beggs stepped out had to take the heat for the worst tragedy in 
americas space program 
after challenger beggs resigned and graham remained as acting 
administrator until dr james c fletcher returned in may 1986 from 
private life and reassumed the job of administrator he had held for 
eight years in the 1970s 
where management is weak we will strengthen it he 
promised where engineering or design processes need improving 
we will improve it where our internal communications are poor we 
will see that they get better 
the purge had begun much earlier 
the first to step down after challenger was jesse moore 
assistant nasa administrator for spaceflight who had already been 
named to take over as director of the johnson space center in 
houston truly was summoned from the us navy space command to 
take charge he proclaimed the nasa cando spirit is intact and 
quickly set out a conservative agenda to get back into the 
spaceflight business 
in the nasa structure center directors wield considerable power 
and those directly concerned with shuttle flight were quick to fall 
moore remained at johnson only a few months and left to take an 
illdefined headquarters job that lasted six months richard smith 
left the kennedy space center for a private space firm dr william 
lucas retired from the marshall space flight center which has 
charge of nasa propulsion systems and received the most criticism 
from the rogers commission 
nasa went to the air force for lt gen forrest s mccartney to 
head the kennedy space center at johnson aaron cohen was moved up 
and marshall got j r thompson a veteran space engineer who came 
back to nasa from princetons plasma physics laboratory 
three of the four thiokol officials who overruled their 
engineers and acceded to the challenger launch still are with the 
company but in nonshuttle positions they are jc kilminster now 
in the automotive products division rk lund vice president of 
advanced technology and calvin wiggins general manager of the 
huntsville division jerald e mason boss of the booster division 
retired early 
roger boisjoly a thiokol engineer said the company harassed 
him for his strong testimony before the rogers commission and sued 
thiokol for billions of dollars the case was dismissed and he has 
left the company long ago

sometimes usa today is goofily inspired especially in the 
first show when robin young stood inside an impressionist painting 
and then apparently walking toward a fan that made her hair 
billow melded into a beach scene from the film a man and a 
woman 
edie magnus played more tricks on the mind by doing live 
interviews with george bush and michael dukakis after explaining 
neither one was in the studio she stood and chatted with a screen 
synchronizing her questions to answers taped earlier in the day 
the implicit message is that nothing is real not here anyway 
nor is anything so important that you the viewer need to think 
about it 
but why watch it takes less concentration to watch nova or 
a bill moyers special on pbs 
if you miss the intro to a segment forget it poor sound 
quality in some of the interviews doesnt help either in a segment 
wednesday on the national geographic voices were repeatedly 
smothered by annoying music 
before usa today hit the air it suffered a certain amount 
of sniping from critics because of its commitment to an upbeat 
journalism of hope which accentuated the positive and 
eliminated the negative 
whats been accentuated is pace coherence and content have been 
eliminated you have to give up something to jam 18 topics into the

if all goes well the agriculture departments 
new rules for paying out subsidies under 1989 commodity programs 
will make those notorious multimilliondollar handouts to a few 
super farmers a thing of the past 
the usda is holding training sessions to explain the new 
regulations to those involved in administering the programs among 
other things local state and federal officials must know who is a 
farmer and who is not 
after years of seeing news reports about huge payments to big 
operators some individuals collected more than 4 million in some 
years the government got serious about cracking down 
the farm law of 1970 included the first attempt at putting a lid 
on payments and there were subsequent modifications as congress 
wrote new laws and rewrote others usually it turned out there 
were big loopholes 
it became almost routine for some large operators to divide 
holdings among family members or friends thereby each qualifying 
for a share of the subsidy pie to circumvent the letter of the law 
so the usda and congress tried again in the food security act 
of 1985 and again in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 
the 1985 farm law which is still operative set a lid of 
50000 on the amount of deficiency payments and land diversion 
payments with certain exceptions that a person could collect in 
any one year the law also set an overall 250000 maximum which 
included deficiency disaster and other federal payments 
but the abuses continued the general accounting office an 
investigative agency of congress reported last year that 
individuals and other legal entities can avoid the 50000 
payment limitation in a variety of ways 
the 1987 law set up a payment eligibility standard as well 
as a limitation provision these are the mainstays of new 
regulations that usda recently adopted to carry out the mandate of 
congress to crack down on excessive payments to individuals 
a new farm program fact sheet developed by the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service soon will be 
circulating to agency offices farmers and others 
here are some of the main points being developed for 1989 crop 
programs administered by the agency according to a draft of the 
report 
the regulations apply to payments made under the annual 
programs for wheat feed grains upland cotton extra long staple 
cotton rice and honey 
payments made on land owned by public schools or to states for 
land owned by a public school district or state which are used to 
maintain a public school are not subject to the rules 
the law requires that before any person is eligible to 
receive payments that person must be actively engaged in 
farming 
a person can be an individual farmer an individual who is a 
member of a joint operation a corporation a joint stock company 
an association a limited partnership a trust an estate or a 
charitable organization 
husband and wife may be separate persons if they can show 
that each brought separate farming operations into their marriage 
and have maintained them as separate farming operations throughout 
their marriage 
the rules also include specifics for cash rent tenants 
corporations trusts estates and minor children 
in defining actively engaged in farming the rules require 
those applying for payments at county ascs offices to provide local 
governing committees with information to substantiate their active 
engagement in farming 
providing such information is voluntary but if information is 
not provided the county committee will not be be to make an 
actively engaged in farming determination and the producer will 
be ineligible to receive any payments the report said 
in general it added to be actively engaged in farming a 
person has to make a significant contribution of capital land 
labor andor equipment to their farming operation as well as a 
significant contribution of active personal labor andor active 
personal management 
the significant contribution also is spelled out for 
example a significant contribution of active personal labor means 
that a person personally provides at least 1000 hours of labor 
or at least 50 percent of that persons commensurate share of the 
total labor necessary in the farming operation 
again the county committees will determine whether a person is 
properly contributing to the farms operation there are certain 
exceptions for persons who are landowners family member and 
sharecroppers and those are all spelled out in detail 
in addition to the provisions requiring active engagement in 
farming the 1987 act also provides that foreign persons that are 
not lawfully admitted into the united states shall be ineligible to 
receive any program benefits including commodity price support 
loans unless that foreign person provides a significant 
contribution of active personal labor the agency said

the decreasing likelihood that hurricane gilbert 
would seriously disrupt gulf of mexico energy production and 
indications that iraq was balking at coming under opec output 
restrictions have helped curb the recent oil futures rally 
on the new york mercantile exchange wholesale unleaded gasoline 
for october delivery closed down 139 cents at 4563 cents a gallon 
on thursday after rising 321 cents in the previous session 
the october wholesale heating oil contract fell 137 cents a 
gallon to close at 4270 cents after a 224cent rise on wednesday 
the october contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude settled 50 cents lower at 1490 per barrel 
following an 84cent rise in volatile trading on wednesday 
crude prices generally had been rising since plunging briefly to 
twoyear lows on monday but factors that strengthened the market 
recently began to fade early in the trading day thursday along with 
reports that hurricane gilbert was headed for the us gulf of 
mexico coast analysts said 
oil and gas companies operating in the gulf had evacuated many 
of their personnel from refineries and oil platforms but observers 
said the prospect of a major disruption in oil supplies due to the 
approaching hurricane waned 
traders seem to feel that hurricane gilbert is not going to 
do a lot of damage now said john hill of merrill lynch energy 
futures 
companies reporting the evacuation of oil platforms and 
refineries along the gulf indicated they would not restart 
operations until next week 
but analysts said it was unlikely there would be any spot 
shortages of oil products such as gasoline and heating oil and no 
effect on contracts scheduled for october delivery 
approximately 870000 barrels per day of oil and 8 million cubic 
feet of natural gas are produced at gulf facilities according to 
the minerals management service 
also depressing prices thursday was a statement from iraqs oil 
minister that his country would not lower its oil output if asked 
to do so by the organization of petroleum exporting countries and 
instead might raise production 
the ministers statement punctured the upward momentum that 
began monday when saudi arabias king fahd made a rare public 
statement calling for cooperation among opec and nonopec 
oilproducing nations in restraining oil production 
iraq has refused to abide by its opecassigned quota of 15 
million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 27 
million barrels a day some observers hoped that after a recent 
ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iran iraq would join with 
other opec nations in setting production limits that would help 
raise prices 
other opec nations also are exceeding quotas 
the iraqi statement also dampened hopes that a sept 25 meeting 
of opecs price monitoring committee would produce substantive 
results

just when many speculators were betting that 
robert maxwell would retreat from a transatlantic bidding war for 
macmillan inc the british publisher counterattacked in force 
maxwell raised his offer for the us publishing giant to 241 
billion cash on thursday in a surprise move to counter a 236 
billion buyout deal that macmillan accepted earlier this week from 
the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
maxwell who previously had offered 84 for each of the 
companys 2776 million shares said he now was willing to pay 
8680 a share he also offered to pay the companys recently 
declared 20cent per share quarterly dividend 
alternatively maxwell his sept 8 offer to purchase 11 
macmillan information businesses for 14 billion still was good 
maxwells late afternoon announcement surprised many wall street 
traders many of whom previously had assumed he probably would back 
away from macmillan in light of its kohlberg kravis agreement 
traders scrambled to buy macmillan shares in anticipation of a 
bidding war pushing the stock up 2 a share to 8650 in new york 
stock exchange composite trading 
i kind of thought it might be over but this really reignites 
the whole situation said bert boksen a strategist who follows 
macmillan for raymond james amp associates inc an investment firm 
in st petersburg fla im quite sure macmillan doesnt want to 
sell to maxwell 
david jackson macmillans vice president for investor 
relations said the company had no comment on the new maxwell 
offer kohlberg also said through its public relations firm kekst 
amp co that it had no comment 
on the surface maxwells offer is more attractive to 
shareholders the tender offer announced monday by macmillan 
management and kohlberg would pay shareholders 80 in cash and 5 
in securities and likely would involve selling chunks of the new 
yorkbased company 
some analysts speculated macmillan management and kohlberg 
kravis would be hard pressed to top maxwells latest bid but 
others said macmillan managers remain fiercely opposed to selling 
the company to maxwell whom they regard as an unpredictable and 
capricious businessman who knows little about the us publishing 
business 
harcourt brace jovanovich inc another big american publishing 
concern successfully thwarted a maxwellled takeover last year by 
loading itself up with billions of dollars in new debt that forced 
it to sell a number of business 
maxwell is considered a real maverick in this industry a 
difficult person to work for or with and somebody that might pare 
the company up boksen said hes not the type of person your 
more traditional publishing companies want to associate with 
some speculated macmillan would find a way to raise the offer or 
perhaps find a third white knight friendly acquirer for the 
company 
the kohlberg deal was structured as a leveraged buyout in which 
the purchase money is borrowed and repaid with the acquired 
companys cash flow earnings or asset sales it was considered 
likely that macmillan would have to sell part of its operations to 
finance such a deal 
macmillan is a leading publisher of educational textbooks it 
also owns a range of other information businesses that range from 
telemarketing services to the berlitz language training school 
chain

chevrolet has announced two new car lines 
including a new line of four imports designed to give the auto 
giant a larger share of the small car market 
chevrolet executives on hand here to preview the new lines for 
dealers on thursday said the new imports and a new midsize 
domestic series would boost its standing against cars made by rival 
ford motor co 
one of the new lines the geo will have four models and will be 
offered only through chevrolet dealers company officials said 80 
percent of their 5000 dealers had agreed to handle the line using 
separate signs and display areas 
the second line the lumina will replace the celebrity series 
chevrolet motor division general manager robert d burger said 
the geo was created to significantly broaden our customer appeal 
and to attract buyers who currently may not consider buying a 
chevrolet 
mike erdman general marketing manager for chevrolet a division 
of general motors corp said 40 percent of car sales are small 
cars a market dominated by imports erdman said surveys indicate 
28 percent of the people who buy imports never have been in a 
domestic manufacturers dealership 
promotion of the geo will mark the most aggressive special 
marketing effort ever undertaken at chevrolet erdman said 
there are 400 nameplates out there he said of the growing 
auto market competing for a share of the market is a real 
challenge 
asked about the cost of the imports considering the current yen 
rate erdman admitted its going to be a very difficult challenge 
to make money on them the yen has risen sharply against the 
dollar since 1985 making japanese products more expensive in the 
united states 
fred schaafsma chief engineer for chevrolet division said the 
american auto manufacturer is actively working with all three of 
our affiliates to get costs down 
erdman said he expected the lumina line to account for 17 
percent of chevrolets sales by 1991 lumina will replace all 
celebrity models except the station wagon by the 1990 model year 
the 1990 model of a lumina sedan will be introduced next spring 
burger said chevrolet expects to sell more than 3 million cars 
and trucks in the 1989 model year provided the us economy 
continues to support a forecast of 15 million car and truck sales 
next year 
chevrolet officials attending a news conference to unveil the 
new products vowed the automotive giant would top sales of ford 
cars next year 
in the 1988 model year which began oct 1 1987 ford has sold 
1450010 cars from its ford division through sept 10 up 7 
percent from the same period in the 1987 model year chevrolet has 
sold 1401190 cars in the current model year 3 percent fewer than 
during the same period in the 1987 model year 
the geo line will include the prizm metro and spectrum cars and 
the tracker utility vehicle chevrolet said geo car prices will 
range from 5999 for the metro which is advertised at getting 53 
mpg to 7610 for the spectrum now made in japan by isuzu motors 
ltd 
the base price for the tracker will be 10195 distribution of 
the tracker will be limited to a dozen states on the east and west 
coasts 
the tracker and metro will be made by suzuki motor co ltd in 
japan and the prizm will be made in fremont calif by new united 
motor manufacturing co inc a joint venture of gm and toyota 
motor corp

ashland oil inc officials have reacted 
bitterly to criminal charges lodged against the company for a 
massive oil spill saying the charges will impair efforts to comply 
with environmental laws 
the company is disappointed that criminal actions will be 
pursued in light of ashlands efforts to mitigate the spills 
impact and the fact that the company quickly accepted 
responsibility for the incident ashland spokesman roger schrum 
said thursday 
on thursday a federal grand jury indicted ashland for 
violations of the federal clean water and the refuse acts the 
first criminal charges arising from the jan 2 spill that 
contaminated drinking water in three states 
us attorney j alan johnson said the two misdemeanor counts 
were the most stringent that could be brought because federal 
environmental laws do not contain felony provisions for 
corporations for such offenses 
were doing the best we can he said were following the 
evidence based on the law that exists here 
conviction carries a maximum penalty of a 200000 fine on each 
count or double the monetary loss suffered as a result of the 
criminal conduct so far the losses amount to more than 10 
million johnson said 
schrum said ashland voluntarily has paid more than 114 million 
for cleanup costs and to reimburse claims from individuals 
businesses and government agencies 
the decision to prosecute ashland goes against past practices by 
the justice department to pursue criminal violations only in 
instances of deliberate acts he said 
we think such actions impair rather than promote environmental 
compliance schrum said 
the spill occurred when an ashland oil riverside storage tank at 
the companys floreffe terminal in jefferson near pittsburgh 
collapsed while being filled with 38 million gallons of fuel oil 
about 1 million gallons escaped the containment dikes at the 
facility and more than 700000 gallons spilled into the 
monongahela river and traveled downstream well beyond the rivers 
confluence with the ohio river 
the government said the accident represented one of the largest 
inland oil spills in the nations history affecting drinking water 
supplies and plant and animal life in pennsylvania ohio and west 
virginia about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents went without 
tap water for almost a week 
the indictment said ashland had disassembled a 48yearold oil 
storage tank near cleveland in 1986 and then reassembled it at the 
floreffe terminal it was placed in service in august 1987 
in may investigators for an independent research institute that 
studied the accident said a dimesize flaw in the tanks brittle 
steel walls caused the collapse aggravating the condition were the 
relative weakness of the world war iiera steel pressure from the 
diesel fuel and cold weather according to the battelle memorial 
institute 
besides failing to obtain all necessary local permits for 
erecting the tank ashland said it failed to fill the tank with 
water before use a test recommended by the american petroleum 
institute an industry group 
johnson said the indictment does not end the federal 
governments investigation of the oil spill he said the government 
still must determine if any ashland employees or officials violated 
the law 
the state attorney generals office also is conducting a 
criminal investigation but has brought no charges 
in a separate civil action in july the justice department filed 
a proposed consent decree requiring ashland based in ashland ky 
to complete the cleanup of the spill and to reimburse the 
government 680000 for emergency response work by federal agencies 
ashland has agreed to the decrees terms

the nuclear regulatory commission has set the 
stage for two key votes that could remove the final regulatory 
obstacles in the seabrook nh plants long road toward a 
lowpower operating license 
if the commission acts today in favor of the plant seabrook 
could be eligible for the license within 30 days but massachusetts 
officials have vowed to fight the license in federal court 
the lowpower license has been a key pressure point in the 
struggle between seabrook owners the nuclear industry and new 
hampshire state officials on one side and massachusetts gov 
michael s dukakis local officials and antinuclear activists on 
the other 
seabrook must obtain the license which would allow it to test 
the reactor at 5 percent of capacity before securing a fullpower 
commercial operating license 
the nrc is to decide two issues the first is whether to allow a 
reactor to operate at low power without having an emergency system 
in place to alert neighbors in case of a plant accident 
massachusetts municipalities in the 10mile zone forced seabrook 
officials to remove the sirens 
under the new rule the siren system would have to be in place 
only for fullpower license consideration seabrook officials are 
working on plans to mount sirens on trucks and helicopters 
the second issue which was tentatively scheduled for an nrc 
vote was a petition by opponents urging the commission to break 
from its regulations and consider the financial condition of the 
plants owners 
the lead owner public service company of new hampshire filed 
for bankruptcy protection in january public service owns 36 
percent of the plant 
in june massachusetts municipal wholesale electric co which 
is the fourth largest seabrook shareholder at 12 percent announced 
it was withdrawing from the project and would stop making its 2 
millionamonth payments 
for opponents blocking the lowpower license is critical 
because they say 5 percent power tests would contaminate the 
facility with radioactive fuel ruling out a future conversion to a 
gasfired plant or other facility advocated by nuclear critics 
plant officials say the tests would not rule out a conversion 
seabrook opponents believe plant owners and the commission are 
trying to win lowpower license approval before the possibility of 
encountering a dukakis presidency that could further hinder the 
licensing process 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee says it would be 
impossible to quickly evacuate residents from the massachusetts 
seacoast towns that lie within the plants 10mile emergency 
evacuation zone an area that swells with summer tourists and has 
congested roads on normal days 
the idle 56 billion reactor is losing 50 million each month 
in maintenance and finance costs 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said last week that 
if the two regulatory obstacles were removed by the nrc the state 
would fight the license in federal appeals court

a management group may make a 33 
billion bid to buy hospital corp of america one of the worlds 
largest hospital chains and it is trying to line up financing for 
the bid 
but financial analysts were divided over whether hca was worth 
the 47ashare offer the group which includes the companys 
chairman might put on the table 
i have no reason to believe that there is a second wouldbe 
buyer out there but if someone had asked me where it would go i 
would have said between 50 and 55 margo durow an analyst with 
a jc bradford amp co said thursday 
elaine hughey smyth of equitable securities corp said the 
offer was reasonable and that the time was right for hca to move 
into private hands 
there are no compelling reasons for hospital companies to have 
access to public markets any more she said they are not in a 
growth pattern any more 
wall street also mulled over the propsal in heavy trading on 
the new york stock exchange hca had soared to 4750 a share 
thursday before closing at 4375 up 662 
hca which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide said 
on thursday that the group of managers including chairman thomas 
f frist jr had advised the board of directors about the intended 
proposal of 47 a share in cash for hcas 706 million shares 
outstanding 
an hca statement said frist planned to negotiate with 
unidentified third parties to obtain financing for a leveraged 
buyout in which a company is acquired largely with borrowed money 
repaid from the target companys profits or asset sales 
the nashville newspaper the tennessean quoted unnamed sources 
as saying the new york investment banking firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc was expected to arrange the financing 
drexel also handled the sale of highinterest junk bonds in 
hcas 164 billion sale of 104 of its hospitals to healthtrust 
inc last year 
hca said its board had established a special committee to review 
any management proposal for an acquisition and had received no 
guarantee that one would be 
we believe in todays environment hca as a private company 
could better serve all of its constituents including patients 
employees physicians and our various communities including and 
especially nashville frist said 
frist was the only member of management identified in the 
attempt 
hca currently owns 79 medical surgical hospitals and 51 
psychiatric hospitals it also manages 225 other hospitals and owns 
or manages 42 international hospitals 
the company reported in july that its profits for the quarter 
ending june 30 increased by 15 percent partly because of increased 
inpatient and outpatient revenues 
for the second quarter aftertax profit totaled about 708 
million or 1 a share on revenue of 102 billion for the same 
period a year earlier earnings were 613 million or 74 cents a

the american brands board of directors continues to believe 
that the best longterm interest of american brands and its 
shareholders is that the company continue to operate as an 
independent company said william j alley american brands has 
no interest in engaging in discussions with mr lebow with respect 
to an acquisition of american brands 
american brands said on thursday that brooke partners lp 
which is controlled by lebow had filed for federal antitrust 
clearance to acquire more than 15 million worth of the companys 
stock and might acquire more than 50 percent of american brands 
outstanding shares 
american brands closed at 4837 a share thursday down 37 
cents in new york stock exchange trading based on thursdays 
closing price and the companys roughly 110 million common shares 
outstanding american brands has a market value of about 532 
billion 
it was the second takeover overture this year for american 
brands which in february acquired eii holdings inc for 11 
billion after eii launched an attempted hostile buyout of american 
brands 
american brands said lebow had approached the company in july 
about a possible acquisition of its american tobacco co by liggett 
group inc which lebow also controls american tobacco brands 
include lucky strike and tareyton cigarettes and half amp half pipe 
tobacco among others 
americans brands officials rejected liggetts proposed deal 
saying it was not in the companys best interests 
in a letter to americans chairman lebow said he continued to 
believe the economic logic of combining liggett and the tobacco 
operations of american brands compels us to effect such a 
combination 
lebow said in the letter that brooke continued to be interested 
in acquiring the greenwichbased firms tobacco business rather 
than the entire company 
alley noted that american brands was pursuing a restructuring 
program aimed at sharpening the companys focus and increasing 
shareholder value 
in the past 16 months alley said american brands has invested 
2 billion to acquire seven businesses designed to strengthen 
the companys core business strategy 
the company has also divested itself of businesses that do not 
meet its goals and has purchased 171 million million shares of its 
common stock alley said

government officials vowed friday that japan will 
not open its market to foreign rice imports and expressed hopes 
the united states will reject a petition from american rice farmers 
seeking to sell in japan 
rice should be a serious concern to all japanese economic 
planning agency chief eiichi nakao told a cabinet meeting friday 
every cabinet member should take this matter seriously and 
protect domestic rice production 
nakaos remarks were quoted in a statement from the agency 
the agriculture minister and other officials expressed regret at 
a complaint filed with the us trade representatives office 
wednesday by the us rice millers association 
the organization which represents 11000 american rice growers 
demanded that japan allow foreigners to provide 10 percent of its 
annual rice consumption of 10 million tons within four years 
the petition was based on a section of the recently passed 
omnibus trade law which requires the president to retaliate 
against a country deemed protectionist by the us congress the 
trade representatives office has 45 days to decide whether to 
accept the petition before it starts investigations 
the two governments have agreed not to negotiate this matter 
on a bilateral basis agricultural minister takashi sato said at 
a news conference we regret such a complaint was filed in spite 
of the agreement 
the rice millers association filed a similar complaint in 1986 
but it was turned down tokyo has sought arbitration at the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade an international body that governs 
world trade 
selfsufficiency in rice production is a sensitive issue in 
japan where rice remains the staple food rice growers comprise 
nearly 80 percent of all japanese farmers

britains annual rate of inflation rose to 57 
percent in august the highest level in three years the government 
announced friday 
nevertheless the increase from 48 percent in july was not as 
bad as some investors and economists had feared stocks showed 
little reaction 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson warned on wednesday 
that there would be a significant increase in the rate because of 
britains practice of including mortgage rates in the calculation 
britains mortgage rates have climbed sharply and are in 
13percent range following the governments move in recent months 
to push interest rates up to curb inflation by dampening the 
countrys strong consumer spending 
britains annual inflation rate has climbed substantially so far 
this year and is much higher than had been forecast 
the rate stood at 33 percent in january

fending off hostile takeovers of the nations largest supermarket 
chain 
in two class action lawsuits filed thursday the shareholders

from adopting the plan

family known for its takeover forays had received government 
clearance to buy at least 15 million worth of kroger stock

trying to protect their own financial interests not the interests 
of shareholders with the proposed restructuring 
by proposing the restructuring plan they have displayed their 
predisposition and determination to reject and thwart tender and or 
other offers and proposals by third parties for enhanced 
shareholder value so as to preserve and protect their emoluments 
and positions with the company one suit contends 
the suits both filed as class actions on behalf of all 52000

ames department stores will jump from 
fifth place to third among the nations largest discount retailers 
with its acquisition of zayre corps 388 discount stores ames 
president said 
we will also gain entry into new and profitable markets such 
as florida and illinois as well as increase our penetration in 
other markets peter hollis ames president and chief executive 
officer said thursday 
the deal announced thursday was valued at about 800 million 
company officials said 
ames currently operates 348 discount stores primarily in small 
towns in 18 states in the northeast and midatlantic region 
with the deal ames will have its first stores in florida and 
illinois as well as alabama georgia lousiana mississippi 
tennessee and wisconsin said catherine g leonard ames director 
of investor relations 
zayre discount stores are similar to ames stores although some 
are located in larger metropolitan areas in 26 states leonard 
said the two chains have 12 stores that compete in the same 
communities leonard said 
ames marketing strategy has been to locate in small towns and 
operate as oldfashioned general stores about 45 percent of its 
inventory is apparel and domestic items such as sheets pillow 
cases and rugs 
the remaining 55 percent is hard line hardware houseware 
jewelry health and beauty aids and automobile parts 
leonard said no decision had been made on the possible closing 
of some stores or possible layoffs 
one of the first things we will do is study all zayre 
locations for their longterm profit potential she said 
ames chairman james a harmon said the company had been 
analyzing the zayre discount business for several months 
the transaction has been extensively studied from every point 
of view we believe it is a unique opportunity under most favorable 
terms he said 
in the fiscal year ended jan 30 ames had revenue of 21 
billion and net income of 342 million in addition to its 
discount stores ames operates 161 smaller variety stores under the 
gc murphy variety stores name 
framingham massbased zayre stores currently the nations 
fourth largest discount retailer had annual sales of 35 billion 
last year and a profit of 1433 million 
its discount stores however werent profitable posting 
losses last year 
zayres other businesses include tj maxx hit or miss and miss 
chadwicks of boston inc 
ames said zayre will receive cash 200 million in subordinated 
notes and preferred stock convertible to 8 million shares of ames 
common stock at a price of 25 a share 
zayre will own a 175 percent share of ames stock when the deal 
is completed leonard said but a 10year agreement was put into 
effect that limits zayre to owning a maximum of 20 percent of the 
voting securities of ames 
zayre said in a statement that its estimated net cash proceeds 
would be 620 million after expenses and refinancing of the 
subordinate note 
the company said that after paying about 250 million in 
shortterm debt it plans to use a substantial portion of the 
balance to benefit shareholders possibly through a major stock 
buyback 
zayre also said it will incur a onetime charge in the third 
quarter of about 110 million because of the discontinued 
operations 
we are pleased to be able to enhance the value of our shares 
through the redeployment of our assets as evidenced by this 
transaction zayre chairman maurice segall said 
ames said zayre will have the right to nominate two directors 
the boards of both companies have approved the deal which is 
still subject to regulatory approval and completion of ames 
financing ames said it has a commitment from citibank na 
the transaction was expected to be completed in 45 days

business inventories rose only a modest 03 
percent in july even though sales were down by 02 percent the 
government said today 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose 22 billion to a seasonally adjusted 7337 billion 
while sales edged down by 12 billion 
the july gain in inventories followed a 08 percent rise in june 
and was the 19th consecutive month without a decline however the 
july increase was the smallest since a 02 percent rise in august 
1987 
economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of 
economic weakness too many goods in reserve could lead to 
production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants however 
analysts have not been worried over the past year because the 
inventory gain has simply been keeping up with strong sales 
the july drop in sales was the first since november and followed 
a strong jump of 14 percent in june 
the june inventory accumulation was led by 05 percent increases 
at both the manufacturing and wholesale levels inventories shrank 
by 01 percent at the retail level where sales have been weakest 
in recent months 
in sales a 09 percent decline at factories more than offset a 
06 percent rise at the wholesale level and a slight 01 percent 
increase at retail stores 
an advance estimate of retail sales for august released 
thursday showed a 02 percent decrease 
the combination of weak sales and slowly rising inventories left 
the inventorytosales ratio unchanged at 15 in july that means 
it would take 15 months to exhaust inventories at the july sales 
pace a ratio not considered abnormally high

the government disclosed new evidence of a weakening economy 
today reporting a rise in business inventories last month that 
coincided with a decline in sales 
the commerce department said business inventories rose 03 
percent in july while sales fell 02 percent the july increase in 
inventories was the 19th straight month without a decline the drop 
in sales was the first since january and followed a strong jump of 
14 percent in june 
economists sometimes interpret rising inventories and slowing 
sales as a signal of economic weakness too many goods in reserve 
could lead to production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants 
the report came a day after the commerce department said sales 
of retail merchandise a narrower category of sales fell 02 
percent in august and the federal reserve said us industrys 
operating rate was unchanged in august the first time in six 
months the figure hasnt increased 
these figures also suggested that the economy is beginning to 
weaken after a period of strong growth thereby easing some fears 
of inflation that have dogged the nations financial markets for 
months 
the federal reserve in an effort to slow the economy by curbing 
domestic demand has been pushing interest rates higher since late 
march and economists say the fed tightening may be beginning to 
take hold 
i think things are looking just fine inflationwise said 
michael k evans head of evans economics a washington consulting 
firm i think the fed deserves an a i think they tightened just 
enough to slow down the economy without sending it into a 
tailspin 
financial markets today showed little reaction to the economic 
news however on wall street the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks had moved less than a point higher by late 
morning in the bond market prices were little changed and the 
dollar held steady against foreign currencies

grain and soybean futures opened lower today on 
the chicago board of trade in a continuation of the technically 
based selloff that began late in thursdays session analysts said 
prices dropped sharply in the closing minutes thursday after 
wheat traders pushed prices for december and march delivery to new 
contract highs december wheat peaked at 432 a bushel and march 
wheat hit 436 a bushel 
having made new those highs wheat prices are likely to fall 15 
to 20 cents a bushel to levels near recent lows said jerry zusel 
manager of floor operations at the chicago board of trade for 
balfour maclaine corp 
i think were just in a big trading range right now he 
said weve been at the higher end of the range and now were 
going toward the lower end of range 
other crop futures have tended to follow the wheat market in 
recent weeks 
zusel said good prospects for rain this weekend in the midwest 
may spark some buying of corn and soybean futures on ideas that 
showers will slow the harvest of those crops but he said 
harvesting was barely underway so a delay at this point probably 
wouldnt have much impact on prices 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 419 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 1 cent higher with september at 280 a bushel 
oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with december at 270 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents lower with september at 
865 a bushel

a federal appeals court has ordered the 
detroit news and detroit free press to delay their partial merger 
which could have begun as early as this weekend as the judges 
consider whether the deal should be scrapped altogether 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
late thursday ordered a stay in an order by attorney general edwin 
meese iii allowing the newspapers to merge their business 
production and circulation departments under an exception to 
federal antitrust laws 
michigan citizens for an independent press an organization of 
advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers joint operating 
agreement had asked for the extension in a motion filed earlier in 
the day 
the court ordered the delay to gain time to study the complex 
case the court clerks office said 
the group last month successfully blocked the immediate merger 
of the newspapers business and production departments in a 
challenge to a decision by thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
allowing the joint operating agreement under the newspaper 
preservation act 
the temporary stay granted by the us district court in 
washington forced the newspapers to recall laidoff employees and 
quickly alter printing plans 
us district judge george revercomb on wednesday rejected the 
challenge and said he would allow the order staying the partial 
merger to expire at 715 pm on saturday 
the appeals courts order thursday means the combination will 
not proceed on that schedule 
the newspapers had not said how quickly then could have begun 
joint production under the agreement after expiration of the 
earlier stay 
free press publisher david lawrence this week said the 
newspapers would begin the operation as soon as they were legally 
cleared to do so 
the court issued its own order staying meeses decision rather 
than granting the opponents request for a stay thereby gaining 
time to study the case without seeming to accept the contentions of 
either side 
after the michigan citizens group made its request assistant 
attorney general john bolton filed an eightpage brief with the 
appeals court opposing any stay of the agreement 
the opponents of the merger have fallen far short of their 
burden of showing that the attorney general acted so mistakenly 
that his decision can be labeled irrational said boltons brief 
bill schultz an attorney for michigan citizens said after the 
appeal was filed that his clients could show a stay was appropriate 
because a lower court judge in granting the earlier stay had 
agreed that allowing the merger to proceed prior to a court ruling 
would produce irreparable injury and be contrary to the public 
interest 
opponents of the agreement argued that meese had ignored 
findings that the free press was not a failing newspaper and that 
financial losses by it and the news were caused by management 
decisions rather than being inherent to the marketplace 
revercomb rejected that contention saying that meese had 
reasonably found that the free press would have already failed were 
it not owned by a large corporate parent knightridder inc 
knightridder had no comment on the appeal said lee ann 
schlatter manager of corporate communications 
gannett also declined comment were simply waiting to see 
what the appeals court does said sheila gibbons public affairs 
manager the news referred inquires to gannett 
the general manager of the free press bob hall said today 
the stay that was issued is really an administrative stay and 
its only issued for the convenience of the court to take some time 
to look at the request for the stay 
the delay just gives the judges a couple of days to look at 
the filings and has no bearing on the merits of the case 
the merger of the newspapers business advertising circulation 
and production departments would result in layoffs of 600 to 800 
employees 
the free press had a daily circulation last year of 638720 
compared with the news 678720 according to the audit bureau of 
circulation on sundays the news held a slightly larger lead 
839319 to 724342

considering what they have to put up with you 
could hardly blame americans if they got down on themselves and 
their economy since it is full of gaps and crunches 
week after week they are reminded of wage crunches tax 
crunches savings crunches interest rate crunches and home 
mortgage crunches according to a popular magazine the ranks of 
middle management also are being crunched 
it is an economy that critics say is filled with gaps most 
glaring of course are the trade gap and the budget gap but there 
are also age gaps in corporations and a widening gap between stock 
and bond yields 
whenever the economy seems to gather strength it is whacked back 
by its custodians with talk of higher taxes or interest rates or 
with warnings of bad things to come sometimes they act too as 
when the federal reserve raises interest rates 
isnt a strong economy what everyone wants of course but not 
too strong says the fed because that might bring inflation a 
position that recently provoked economist howard ruff into wishing 
he were in another business 
said ruff if i were a political cartoonist i would depict 
fed chairman alan greenspan giving a smiling patient the 
economy a small shot of arsenic while explaining youre too 
healthy for your own good 
seldom is optimism offered by those sages who claim to see the 
future and even when it is it comes wrapped in dull brown paper 
and contains a warning that the contents should be considered 
dangerous 
think about this from an economisteducator although the 
outlook for the economy continues to erode and there has been a 
clear upward shift to raise prices there is no sign that we 
are poised to enter a recession 
considering all this it speaks for the resiliency of the us 
consumer that confidence snapped back in august after having been 
depressed in june and july 
that news comes from the conference board a nonprofit 
organization that regularly measures attitudes of thousands of 
households throughout the country the goal being to ascertain 
their buying intentions 
the latest survey revealed that a rising number of americans in 
august were more optimistic about current and future business 
conditions than they had been in the previous two months 
a greater percentage said that the economy would improve and 
that jobs would become more plentiful over the next six months the 
farm mood was found to be improving and households in general were 
impressed by the economys vigor 
the professional watchers of the economy however will not be 
impressed by such things instead they will view this more 
confident mood as a danger to be watched lest it explode into an 
inflationary buying boom 
there is little new in such interpretations the negative theme 
has been in for more than a year among those who think they 
understand how modern economies work 
but what the experts sometimes may tend to overlook is the

interco inc target of a 26 billion hostile 
takeover bid by cardinal acquisition corp said friday it was 
talking with commercial banks about a possible recapitalization of 
the company 
cardinal headed by brothers steven and mitchell rales of 
washington dc has offered to buy the st louisbased 
manufacturer and retailer of womans apparel footwear and 
furniture for 70 a share interco has rejected the bid as 
inadequate 
interco said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission that on tuesday it had entered into an agreement with 
certain commercial banks which were not identified about their 
potential commitment to provide the financing for recapitalization 
interco said the agreement involved the delivery of preliminary 
documentation for the recapitalization proposal 
interco said it had not received any financing commitments 
the company also said in its filing it was considering the sale 
or restructuring of its ethan allen furniture unit as well as the 
sale of its apparel manufacturing division and other assets 
a recapitalization or sale of intercos assets would be a 
defensive step to thwart the rales bid

eastern airlines pilots locked in a battle with 
management told financial analysts friday the ailing airline may 
have to be sold or merged with sister carrier continental airlines 
anywhere you look you can see the systematic destruction of 
eastern airlines said daniel vician vice chairman of the master 
executive council of the eastern pilots union this airline 
cannot be turned around by labor concessions alone 
vician said the union sees three possible options at this point 
negotiation of an acceptable contract agreement between the pilots 
and eastern management a merger between eastern and continental or 
a buyout of eastern by an outside entity 
miamibased eastern and houstonbased continental a nonunion 
carrier are both subsidiaries of giant texas air corp 
eastern continues to sustain heavy losses posting a net loss of 
898 million in the second quarter eastern employees have accused 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo of siphoning off cash in the form 
of management fees rents on planes and airport gates and 
commissions on fuel purchases from eastern into its parent company 
the pilots union and eastern management are scheduled to meet in 
contract negotiations by the end of the month while eastern 
continues to seek cuts in labor costs it has indicated it could 
seek to freeze the pilots wages and cut costs through attrition 
and longer flying hours 
the pilots may try to build fence agreements into the 
contract such as one allowing them to unionize continental pilots 
according to union sources 
the airline laid off 4000 employees early this month a federal 
judge in washington had ruled eastern could not lay off unionized 
personnel but the us court of appeals later dissolved the order 
saying the carrier would have to post a 47 million bond to cover 
a month of paychecks should the unions win their case 
members of the machinists union at eastern began voting friday 
on a contract that would cut pay for mechanics by as much as 20 
percent with even sharper cuts for lessskilled workers 
it is unusual for a union to advocate a merger but vician and 
farrell kupersmith an accountant at touche ross amp co who is 
working with the pilots told the analysts a merger between eastern 
and continental would remove the contentious issue of cash 
transfers out of eastern 
there is no good merger in the airline industry with 
responsibility to the employees vician told the associated press 
after the meeting it would not be our first choice 
as for another possible approach a takeover of eastern by the 
pilots with outside financial backing vician said his union has 
been advised that that is a futile effort

its picking up some steam said craig sloane precious metals 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
the main negative factor in the gold market is the improved 
inflation outlook analysts said gold historically holds its value 
during times of rising prices so demand for the metal typically 
rises with prospects for higher inflation 
recent credittightening moves by the federal reserve have 
slowed the growth of the economy and relieved inflationary 
pressures

support at 390 a troy ounce

bond prices drifted lower friday in sluggish 
trading pushing key interest rates back up to 9 percent again 
the treasurys closely watched 30year issue declined point 
or 125 for every 1000 in face value 
the bonds yield which moves inversely to its price and is 
often an indicator of interest rate trends edged up to 900 
percent from 899 percent late thursday it had stayed below 9 
percent for three days 
analysts said the market was stalled by conflicting sentiments 
this was slow slower slowest said jay goldinger a 
principal of capital insight inc an investment firm in beverly 
hills calif it was exactly a stalemate 
the decline occurred despite a new government report that 
suggested some economic sluggishness 
the commerce department said business inventories rose 03 
percent in july after a 08 percent rise in june while sales fell 
02 percent in july the first sales decline since january 
william v sullivan jr director of moneymarket research for 
dean witter reynolds inc said the slowing of inventory investment 
indicates the economy may be moderating and thats basically a 
friendly development for bonds 
but he said the bond market shrugged aside this report as well 
as other signs of economic moderation over the past few days 
including a decline in august retail sales and a drop in energy and 
commodity prices 
many investors are still concerned about the pace of economic 
growth sullivan said they think the trend in the economy is 
still upward 
the worry is that the economys growth will push inflation 
higher eroding the value of bonds and pressuring the federal 
reserve to take steps to slow growth and push interest rates higher 
other bond investors however believe inflationary pressures 
have eased goldinger noted 
weve got some crosscurrents here its a big tug of 
war he said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues were unchanged to 116 point lower intermediate 
maturities declined 116 point to 332 point and 20year issues 
lost 332 point according to figures provided by telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer slipped 078 to 114449 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile fell to 736 
percent as the discount declined 3 basis points to 714 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills slipped to 774 percent as the discount 
edged down 1 basis point to 736 percent yields on oneyear bills 
edged up to 798 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 
745 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted late in the day at 7 percent down from 8

the farm credit bank of omaha neb will get 
up to 110 million in federal aid the farm credit system 
assistance board announced friday 
eric p thor the boards chief executive officer said the 
assistance was approved after an extensive review of the banks 
current and projected financial situation and proposed credit 
managment plan 
the aid will help the bank regain financial viability and 
save between 150 million and 250 million over the next several 
years he said 
without assistance the bank may not be in a strong enough 
financial position to successfully carry out its plan for the 
future thor said the support provided under the law should 
make the difference

assistance by selling up to 110 million in preferred stock to the

corporation will fund that assistance through the sale of 15year 
bonds and the us treasury will pay interest on those bonds for 
the first five years 
thor said the law also requires the treasury and the farm credit 
system or fcs to each pay half of the interest on the bonds in 
the second five years the fcs will assume full responsibility in 
the final five years and the omaha bank must repay the assistance 
at the end of the 15year period 
the omaha federal land bank and the federal intermediate credit 
bank merged on july 6 forming the farm credit bank of omaha which 
provides comprehensive banking services to farmers and ranchers in 
iowa nebraska south dakota and wyoming

sundstrand corp has agreed to pay the 
government close to 100 million in a record defense fraud 
settlement involving alleged schemes to overbill the defense 
department for airplane parts according to business week magazine 
a story in the magazines sept 26 issue released thursday 
quoted unidentified sources it said were familiar with the case as 
saying the company would enter a guilty plea in the next few weeks 
as part of a sealed agreement in federal court in chicago 
business week said its sources also indicated sundstrand faces 
possible suspension by the pentagon which accounts for 42 percent 
of the companys 14 billion in annual sales 
furthermore several senior sundstrand executives could be 
indicted as soon as next month for their alleged roles in the 
scheme the magazine stated 
i have no idea what theyre going to print so there would be 
no way i could comment sundstrand spokesman claude vernam said 
when contacted by the associated press 
even after company officials have read the business week 
article vernam said he did not expect sundstrand to comment beyond 
what it has disclosed in its quarterly reports 
the aerospace contractor revealed in a 1987 financial filing 
with the government that it would face criminal charges resulting 
from two federal grand jury investigations into alleged overcharges 
sundstrand reported that the government was seeking repayment of 
135 million plus interest and 1029 million plus interest in two 
separate disputes over contract pricing 
sundstrand is based in rockford ill and operates a subsidiary 
in redmond wash near seattle that is part of its advanced 
technology group 
in its annual report to the securities and exchange commission 
earlier this year sundstrand acknowledged the government has 
advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal 
violations in rockford and seattle 
sundstrand which makes flight data equipment engine startup 
systems and other electronic equipment for commercial and military 
aircraft said in its sec filing that it was in the process of 
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions 
such settlements the company also noted in the filing could 
result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and 
penalties 
sundstrand began putting money in reserve two years ago to cover 
settlement and legal expenses related to the dispute the company 
added 76 million in the second quarter to the reserve which 
already held 502 million resulting in a 165 million net loss 
for the period

a federal judge saying a quick ruling would 
be almost shooting from the hip declined to make a decision 
friday on whether to allow the 25 billion merger of lucky and 
alpha beta to proceed 
after three hours of arguments by attorneys us district judge 
david kenyon asked for more data on the relevant market area 
affected by the proposed merger 
attorneys said they could supply the information by wednesday 
and kenyon said he would rule soon after that 
kenyon left in place a temporary restraining order which bars 
completion of the acquisition of lucky by american stores parent 
company of alpha beta 
california attorney general john van de kamp has filed suit to 
stop the merger he claims that transaction coupled with the recent 
merger of safeway and vons supermarkets will decrease competition 
and mean higher prices for california consumers 
deputy attorney general chester horne argued that the merger 
violates the clayton antitrust act and said that the us supreme 
court has never approved a merger between two such gigantic market 
chains 
he suggested the merger will virtually eliminate mom and pop 
grocery stores which will be unable to compete against the 
giants 
without the entry of signficant competititors there will be no 
competition in this state if this merger is allowed to go 
through horne said 
attorney frank rothman representing american stores cos the 
parent company of alpha beta said the consumer will benefit 
because alpha beta plans to adopt luckys lowprice structure 
when kenyon expressed skepticism about whether low prices would 
last rothman responded that if the chain raised prices everyone 
else in the marketplace would cut our heart out
