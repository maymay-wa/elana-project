senators came to bury bullfrog county 
not to praise it they voted to remove from the books the desert 
jurisdiction where no one lives and where the federal government 
wants to dump nuclear waste 
not that i loved bullfrog less but that i loved nevada 
more state sen thomas hickey said tuesday in a parody of 
shakespeares speech that marc antony delivered after julius caesar 
was slain by his closest confidant 
hickey was a key senate sponsor of the 1987 bill that created 
the 144squaremile county with no roads and a government seat in 
carson city 270 miles to the north residents included snakes 
lizards coyotes and kangaroos rats but no humans 
bullfrog county was formed to encompass yucca mountain the only 
area in the nation the federal department of energy is studying as 
the possible site for a highlevel nuclear waste repository 
the intent was to collect millions of dollars from the federal 
government through a property tax rate of 5 per 100 of assessed 
valuation the highest allowed under the nevada constitution 
a retired state supreme court justice ruled last year that 
bullfrog county was unconstitutional on more than two dozen 
grounds including the lack of a representative government because 
no people lived at the desert site 
although hickey mourned the countys death starting his eulogy 
with oh mighty bullfrog senate majority leader bill raggio 
led a group who said the county should stay on nevadas law books 
as a civics lesson 
raggio warned in the waning hours of the 1987 session that 
bullfrog county would falter in the courts he said tuesday that 
historians should be reminded of the states attempt to create 
special legislation to squeeze money out of the federal government 
and into state coffers 
i dont think we should let this go without learning a 
lesson raggio said 
raggio was one of the dissenters in tuesdays 155 vote that 
sent the measure to erase the bullfrog proposal from the books to 
the assembly for further consideration 
hickey said a bill would likely be introduced in the senate to 
establish a special emergency district around yucca mountain so 
local governments could collect grants instead of taxes for the 
proposed dump project as allowed by federal law 
nye county from which bullfrog was carved filed the lawsuit 
that sought to have bullfrog county declared unconstitutional 
under current plans the dump would house waste from nuclear 
reactors for 10000 years and would open early in the next century 
if the energy department determines yucca mountain is stable enough 
gov bob miller and most other state officials strongly oppose 
locating the dump in the state saying yucca mountain has a history 
of volcanic and seismic activity

in a case that caused a national uproar a 
court has given a twomonth suspended sentence to the captain of a 
syrian ship whose toxic cargo originated in italy and was rejected 
on two continents 
the genoa court handed down the sentence tuesday after 
convicting the captain of the zanoobia ahmed tabalo of syria of 
traveling without the proper permit 
tabalo said he took command of the ship after the 12000 barrels 
of toxic waste had been loaded and said he believed its manifest 
was accurate in listing the goods as normal chemical products the 
italian news agency ansa reported 
the vessel dubbed the ship of poison by the italian media 
docked in genoa in northern italy in may after crew members 
reported being sickened by fumes from the cargo the barrels were 
examined and the ship was subsequently seized by italian 
authorities 
the cargos odyssey began in february 1987 when it left the 
italian port of carrara on a maltese freighter for djibouti 
carrying waste from italian companies 
authorities in the african country refused the cargo and the 
ship later unloaded it in puerto cabello venezuela 
but the cargo began to leak and venezuelan officials ordered it 
out of the country it was put on a cypriot freighter which was 
refused entry by several ports until it reached syria 
eventually the syrians had the cargo reloaded onto the zanoobia 
and the ship went to italy 
the zanoobia was one of three vessels that returned to italy 
bearing a total of 2200 tons of unidentified waste from italian 
chemical companies that had been rejected in foreign ports 
the return of the three ships at about the same time prompted 
fear in many cities that they would be used as dumping grounds for 
the refuse

four carmelite nuns today entered 
their sixth month barricaded in the infirmary of their monastery 
pledging to remain there until the vaticans highest court hears 
their appeal 
the nuns began their protest oct 4 saying they were afraid of 
being evicted because of their opposition to the liberalization of 
the traditionally contemplative order through the introduction of 
such things as candy and television 
the vatican court the apostolic signatura should consider the 
appeal soon said tim manning spokesman for the roman catholic 
diocese of paterson the nuns would be allowed to remain in the 
infirmary until the court rules he said 
he declined to say what action the diocese would take if the 
court ruled against the nuns 
the nuns have no plans to leave said a close associate 
theyre not thinking of giving up because theres still that 
appeal to be heard said betty sutton a spokeswoman for the nuns

vows had expired were no longer carmelites and should leave two 
other nuns were told to find other monasteries and the oldest 
72yearold mother philomena was allowed to stay

the peace proposals prime minister yitzhak 
shamir was expected to outline for president bush focus on 
elections in the occupied territories to choose palestinians who 
would negotiate with israel on limited selfgovernment 
many prominent palestinians welcome the idea of balloting but 
argue that free elections cannot be held as long as israeli troops 
occupy the west bank and the gaza strip 
in interviews and through his aides shamir said he was willing 
to have palestinians choose mayors to speak for major population 
centers or political figures to represent the whole region 
the elected palestinians would then meet with israeli 
negotiators to work out a temporary solution for the 1 million 
residents of the west bank and the 650000 inhabitants of the gaza 
strip 
the most palestinians could expect from this process would be 
limited selfrule with israeli troops still stationed in the 
occupied lands but shamir has said troops could be pulled out of 
population centers once an autonomy scheme was agreed upon 
under shamirs proposals the final status of the west bank and 
gaza strip would be the subject of further negotiations after 
autonomy was implemented 
shamirs advisers also hint he is ready to release some 
palestinian prisoners and take other steps to reduce tension 
however they link any change to a truce in the palestinian 
uprising intefadeh in arabic in which 419 palestinians and 18 
israelis have died since december 1987 
the condition is that life in judea and samaria west bank 
must return to normal the intefadeh must end said yossi 
ahimeir a shamir spokesman the shamir ideas closely parallel the 
1978 usmediated camp davidgned by egypt and israel 
but rejected by the palestinians and jordan the major difference 
is that shamir proposes electing nefore autonomy is 
implemented instead of members of an autonomous council after 
selfgovernment is defined in t i believe that this will be the one big 
and important 
contribution that mr shamir is bringing to washington said an 
israeli official who described the proposal as a major change 
in the governments position 
shamir however rules out direct or indirect talks with the 
plo which meanted representatis 
intermediaries 
he gives palestinians little hope of seeing an end to occupation 
because he has rejected palestinian demands for statehood and 
refused to endorse the idea of returning any captured land to arab 
sovereignty 
in this the rightwing prime minister takes a harder line than 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and finance minister shimon peres 
the leaders of the leftofcenter labor party which shares power in 
the coalition government 
labor supports returning some of the captured land in exce 
for peace agreements 
municipal electionld twice in the west bank since 
israel captured the land from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
in the last balloting in 197 mayors nearly all 
of them supporters of the plo 
only six remain in office with most ofted or deposed by israel for 
nationalist activities 
in theaza strip elections were last held in 1946 under 
egyptian rule 
the main flaw in shamir unable to 
find palestinians willing to go along with the elections proposal 
but some palestinians have met secretly with the prime minister or 
openly with ilitary officials to discuss the 
saeb erakat a political sthe an najah 
university in the west bank city of nablus said that if as the 
plo has proposed israeli troops withdraw and turn over the 
occupied territory to un peacekeethen we will consider 
elections 
he said electing city officials would be meaningless if 
occupation prsisted 
will elected mayors be able to prevent arrests e 
deportation of palestinian leaders halt the confiscation of sure of schools 
we would just wind up electing people 
who have the authority to collect the garbage said erer the uprising 
against israeli occupation began a 
group of prominent palestinians in jerusalem in january 198ted a 14point 
list of demands that included a call for 
elections 
the idea was hotly debated among palest until bethlehem 
mayor elias frfire in the intefadeh or 
uprising in exchange for elections and the release of thousands of 
palestinian pris plo chairman yasser arafat responded by threatening to 
shoot 
anyone who propoed a truce and graffiti appeared on bethlehem 
walls threateninge support for the idea rapidly 
hanna siniora editor of tily al fajr and a 
proponent of the 14point list said there was deep suspiciont 
shamir was meeting with palesand talking about elections in 
fort to perpetuate the illusion that there are alternatives 
to the plo 
so far what we see from shas an attempt to repackage 
what efused earlier autonomy under camp david said 
siniora a leading moderate

prime minister noboru takeshita whose 
administration is under fire in a major bribery scandal received 
228000 from the firm at the center of the scandal through ticket 
sales for a fundraising party news reports said wednesday 
an aide to takeshita speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that recruit co the information services firm at the 
heart of the scandal had bought tickets to the fundraising party 
in may 1987 but said our office did not directly handle the 
party so we do not know the amount 
takeshita refused comment on the reports 
the news followed the takeshitas disclosure on friday that 
recruit spent 152000 on another of takeshitas fundraising 
parties in may 1987 at the time takeshita was secretary general 
of the governing liberal democratic party and the leading contender 
to the premiership 
reports by the major daily asahi shimbun and other local media 
wednesday said takeshita had received a total of at least 380000 
from recruit 
japanese politicians customarily use fundraising parties to 
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations and solicit 
funds from business leaders and other politicians and supporters 
large corporations often buy large blocks of party tickets but 
recruits ticket purchases were unusually large takeshita 
aknowledged last week that the 152000 worth of tickets recruit 
bought for his party was slightly exessive for one company 
there is no legal limit on the amount of money politicians can 
raise from such parties without violating the political donations 
restrictions law the parties are considered legal as long as the 
price of each ticket is within the range of common sense and the 
number of tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of what a 
company can possibly use an official at the home affairs 
ministry said on condition of anonymity 
recruit spent an estimated 685000 on tickets for fundraising 
parties for 14 politicians from 19861988 of which 380000 
reportedly went to takeshita 
executives of the firm under investigation for suspected 
bribery sold about 500000 shares in its real estate subsidiary 
recruit cosmos co to 159 influential people at cutrate prices 
before the companys stocks began overcounter trading recruit 
cosmos share price shot up after public trading began and buyers 
netted handsome profits 
opposition parties have demanded that takeshita resign to take 
responsibility for his administrations links to recruit 
without intent to ask for specific favors why should recruit 
give so much money to takeshita said shun ohide secretary 
general of the japan socialist party the largest opposition body 
on tuesday night socialist party chairwoman takako doi proposed 
a coalition government to replace takeshitas cabinet 
the takeshita cabinet is no longer entitled to run the 
government she told reporters the only alternative left for 
the government is to resign en masse and accept the peoples 
judgment 
doi said she would meet with other opposition party leaders 
friday to discuss ways to force takeshita to step down and to iron 
out details on a possible coalition 
the opposition has stalled legislative business but cannot 
legally force takeshita out the liberal democrats command 297 out 
of 512 seats in the lower house of parliament and 143 out of 252 
seats in the upper house 
recent opinion polls indicate public support for takeshita 
however has fallen to 9 percent the lowest level for any prime 
minister since world war ii ended in 1945 
three cabinet ministers have resigned because of their links to 
the recruit scandal and prosecutors have arrested 14 people 
including former senior public officials and corporate executives 
on suspicion of bribery and violations of securities laws 
at least 17 politicians including takeshita and former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone have been implicated in the scandal 
although none has been arrested prosecutors reportedly have begun 
questioning politicians and their aides

incumbent had 29896 votes to republican challenger bernard j

expect things to get better i certainly dont intend to sit back 
and take it easy 
the city has not had a republican mayor since 1949 schoemehl 
who got little competition from elking conducted a lowkey 
campaign relying on appearances at a few small gatherings and on 
upbeat television commercials

former gov evan mecham impeached and removed 
from office exactly a year ago said tuesday hell run again in 
1990 
i committed no impeachable offense the 64yearold 
republican said at an evening rally at a hotel ballroom 
the former auto dealer elected in 1986 on his fifth try for 
governor convicted by the senate on charges he misused funds and 
obstructed justice becoming the first governor impeached and 
removed from office since 1929 
however lawyers are uncertain whether the impeachment vote 
simply stripped mecham of office or barred him from ever again 
holding state office as well and many moderate republicans have 
threatened to bolt if mecham heads the ticket 
i want to send word out to everyone in arizona that i think we 
can have a kinder and gentler arizona mecham said i think the 
19 months between now and the general election of 1990 can be a 
time of spirited debate on the issues but not namecalling and not 
accusations without basis 
mecham said he held no bitterness toward his critics but 
considers himself to have been the object of more venemous 
namecalling than anyone in our state and possibly in america 
mecham has remained popular with a sizeable number of gop voters 
in a state where republicans have an edge in registration 
but former house speaker joe lane a republican defeated in the 
1988 primary after being targeted by mecham supporters said he was 
terribly distressed by mechams announcement therell be a 
terrible primary the democrats will be organized and well have a 
bloody primary and i just hate to see that lane said 
at the time of mechams removal the the senate stopped short of 
explicitly approving a lifetime ban on his holding state office 
attorney general bob corbin has been asked for an opinion on 
whether mecham can again hold office but he noted that whatever he 
comes up with can be challenged in court 
earlier tuesday mecham said he had filed papers with the senate 
asking the legislature to reconsider the votes by which it 
impeached and ousted him 
legislative leaders said they doubted lawmakers would grant 
mecham a new impeachment trial and did not know how they could 
consider the matter anyway because several incumbents had been 
defeated in a postimpeachment election 
the audience of about 400 tuesday gave a standing ovation to 
mecham and his wife florence when they arrived before mecham 
spoke the crowd was entertained by tap dancers and a bluegrass 
band and sang god bless america 
the maverick conservative came under fire immediately after his 
election for eliminating the states martin luther king jr 
holiday controversial appointments and statements that offended 
blacks jews asians and others also ate away at his popularity 
despite a notax stand that won support from many voters 
he was impeached by the republicancontrolled house on charges 
of misusing state money for his auto dealership trying to thwart a 
state investigation of a death threat and concealing a developers 
365000 campaign loan 
the republicancontrolled senate convicted him of misuse of 
money and obstruction it left the third charge to a superior court 
jury which acquitted mecham 
his removal put rose mofford arizonas democratic secretary of 
state into the governors office 
during the evening rally mecham attorney donald macpherson said 
that lawmakers failed to decide the issue according to the law 
and evidence he said he wasnt worried that the senate might 
refuse a new impeachment trial 
if we dont get relief there we have every intention of 
taking it to the highest court in arizona and if need be to the 
us supreme court he said as the crowd rose to its feet and 
applauded 
in papers filed with the senate lawyers for mecham claimed the 
legislature trampled on the rights of voters by ousting the 
governor under rules of proceedure that were not as stringent as 
those that apply in criminal trials 
john mawhinney a tucson republican and senate majority leader 
said he did not believe that thered be any way in the world 
lawmakers would change their minds 
we believe it was an appropriate fair constitutional 
exercise of both the house of representatives and the senate he 
said

excavators have uncovered another 15 statues 
of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside luxor temple that 
yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year 
the overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb 
of tutankhamun in 1922 which yielded enormous amounts of gold and 
other precious objects said sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian 
antiquities organization 
the tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about 
the art of the day tawfik said tuesday this find will answer 
many questions about many periods of history 
he said one of the new statues is unlike any ever found a 
42inchhigh white granite cobra probably representing mertsager 
the goddess of silence her job was to keep secret the location of 
royal tombs in the bonedry valleys of the kings and queens across 
the nile river opposite presentday luxor 450 miles south of cairo 
tawfik and other egyptian officials said workers trying to take 
the search deeper hit underground water at the 10foot level that 
makes digging more difficult 
water is more than 3 feet deep at the bottom of the pit 
endangering not only the excavation but a row of towering columns 
nearby tawfik said 
many egyptologists consider luxor temple built more than 3300 
years ago the most endangered monument in the antiquityrich luxor 
area it lies in a picturesque setting between the nile and the 
modern town of luxor and suffers greatly from rising water and 
other natural debilitations 
the new statues found in a sacred courtyard beneath the earlier 
finds cover a wide range of egyptian history and include 
depictions of some of egypts bestknown rulers and a pantheon of 
gods 
tawfik said the earliest appears to be an alabaster sphinx 
dating from the reign of tutankhamun the young pharaoh who died in 
1323 bc after a 10year reign the latest is a whnite 
cobra from the reign of tao ruled for 26 years and died in 
664 bc at a time when the pharaonic period was in its death 
throes 
he said some of theries are broken and lack the 
artistic excellence of the original five 
most of the new stere found last month officials said 
pieces of some statues were buried at diff 
phenomenon they could not explain 
on janound the first of the original five 
beautifully preserved statues from the new kingdom a golden age of 
wealth and power for egyptian kings the five dated from the reigns 
of amenhophis iii the builder of luxor temple who ruled from 1391 
to 1353 bc to haremhab a powerful military commander who died 
in 1307 bc 12 years after gaining the throne following 
tutankhamuns pnd the brief reign of the caretaker 
aya 
antiquities experts are debating why the statues ried 
when and by whom the answers may never be found 
we have to wait to find the answers because evee 
think we have the right information we have to change our mim different 
periods are found tawfik 
said now weve even found roman pottery in the exc the luxor temple 
cache doesnt appear to approach in number 
those statues discovered early th 
complex three miles away 
at karnak the cache contained thousands of statues of gods and 
individuals ans cache contains only 
royal and religious images and at least three unique statues 
tawfik sai 
statues in the latest find are of various materials and sizan alabaster 
statue of ramses ii its head missing stands on a is 30 inches high 
of the 15 the relic ins a 2foottall 
diorite head of the powerful god amun wearing atwo feather crown

deaf actress marlee matlin bristles when 
criticized for speaking on television saying she refuses to be 
put in a box 
matlin said in this weeks tv guide she expects to disturb some 
deaf people when she speaks in the upcoming cbs movie bridge to 
silence 
matlin said she faced a lot of pressure because she speaks in 
the movie instead of using only sign language 
just speaking in this picture even if i speak perfectly puts 
pressure on me because some people dont think i should be speaking 
at all she said 
deaf representatives were dismayed last year when matlin chose 
to speak while making an academy award presentation abc did not 
show the interpreter who was using sign language for deaf viewers 
even though the interpreter stood only a few feet away from the 
oscarwinning actress 
if i didnt begin speaking in public at the oscars and proving 
i can speak in films then my career goes nowhere matlin said 
if some people got infuriated with what i did thats their 
problem im not going to get put in a box as the deaf actress

senators criticized the auto industry and its 
regulators for failing to work for tighter fueleconomy standards 
that would make it easier for the nation to cope with events such 
as the alaska oil spill that affect the fuel supply 
the less the amount of gasoline consumed in this country the 
more able we are to respond to events said sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio and chairman of the senate energy regulation 
and conservation subcommittee during a hearing tuesday into the 
fueleconomy standards adopted to reduce petroleum usage 
the tanker exxon valdez last month ran aground in alaskas 
prince william sound spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil 
the spill endangered wildlife in the area and prompted a sharp 
increase in gasoline prices especially in california 
the national highway traffic safety administration since august 
has been considering where to set the corporate average fuel 
economy standard the gas mileage each automakers fleet of cars 
must attain for the 1990 model year 
nhtsas managing director howard smolkin told the subcommittee 
the present regulatory process required the agency to set the fue 
economy standard at between 265 mpg and 275 mpg the regulation 
for 1989 required the mix ofmaker to average 
265 mpg 
the agency could require a significantly higher fueleconomy 
standard only by beginning the rulemaking process anew smolkin 
said 
scrapping the present regulatory process in favor of a proposed 
rulening would be one of the factors we 
would cokin said 
legislation proposed by metzenbaum would tighten the 
fueleconomy standard to 34s per gallon by 2000 
nhtsaesentatives of the energy department and 
environmental protection agency agreed agencies would support 
greater fuel efficiencying refused to endorse 
tighter fueleconomy standards 
we seem to have an administration adrift on this issue just 
as the exxon valdez is adrift and i hope we dont go up on the 
sh said sen timothy wirth dcolo 
metzenbaum accused theakers of being too rigid in their 
opposition toeconomy standards saying the big three 
arent working with us but are working against us 
the automakers have argued ning the fueleconomy 
standards would cause theto reduce largecar production ider 
to bring their mix of sales within the guidelines the companies 
contend the buying publicwants larger cars and tightening the 
standard would drive them into the showrooms of foreign makers to 
buy the cars the us makers could not provide 
the source of our concern is not the desire to be adversarialannot 
go north and south at the same time said marine 
whitman general motors corp vice president 
the fueleconomy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline 
consumption at a time of rapidly rising oil prices 
the law set a goal of 275 mpg beginning in 1985 but the reagan 
administration loosened the requirement to 26 mpg in 1986 at the 
request of the automakers

the number of babies being born in the united 
states is bounding back from the low levels of recent years 
according to a new report that shows the increase occurring despite 
a decline in the number of women in the prime childbearing ages 
births totaled 39 million last year up 2 percent from the year 
before and the most in this country since 1964 the national center 
for health statistics reported tuesday 
at the same time the center said the nation set an alltime 
record for the number of deaths in a year marriages declined 
slightly and the number of divorces increased 
the statistical center a division of the department of health 
and human services said the 1988 birth rate was 159 per 1000 
people up from 157 a year earlier 
within the childbearing ages the number of women 1529 
declined while the number of women 3044 increased reported the 
center it noted that the ages 20 to 29 have traditionally been the 
prime years for american women to have children 
thus an increase in the overall number of births at the same 
time the most productive segment of the population is shrinking 
indicates a shift in the timing of births a phenomenon population 
experts have been expecting in recent years 
martin oconnell a fertility researcher at the census bureau 
commented increasing births among women in their 30s indicates 
an adjustment pattern in tlife cycle of women 
the nun in the 30 to 44 age group is increasing 
simply because so many were born duri post world war ii baby 
boom o explained in a telephone interview 
but th ratio of births between the youlder women is 
shifting he said that compensates for the declining number of 
er women 
women in their 20 averaging about 110 births per 
1000 women annually compared with about 70 for women in their0s he said 
twenty years ago he said the ratio was more thanin favor of the younger 
group 
agespecific birth rates for 1988 were not yet available 
bt federal reports show that in 178 per 
1000 women aged 20 to 24 and 1451 for those aged 25 t women 
aged 30 to 34 had a rate of 733 but by the ages of 35 39 it 
fell to 317 
by 19aged 20 to 24 was down to 1151 and 
it was 1129 for those 25 to 29 a significant decline over the 
years as women postponed marriage and childbearing in favor of 
higher educations and beginning careers oconnell explained 
for those aged 30 to 34 the rate was down also falling to 619 
whileen aged 35 to 39 were having 198 babies per 1000 
since 1e continued to see a decline 
with the rate falling to 1082 for those under 25 and 1092 at 25 
to 29 by 1986 the most recent year for which tistics 
were available 
but between 1980 and 1986 the rates rebounded for the older 
group a situation that appears to be continuing the0 to 34 and 243 at 
ages 35 to 39 
this delay is from a combination of factors oconnell said 
including delays in marriage that are resulting in a shift in the 
timing of childbearing for women 
the delay allows them to become more established in a career and 
potentially financially more sren 
researchers pointed out at the meeting of the population 
association of america last week 
this allows women to decide to have children sooner after 
marriage than they might if wed while younger and also gives them a 
sense of security in casehe marriage should fail researchers 
said 
deaths in 1988 ord representing an 
increase of 44000 from the year before the rising population and 
its increasing average age has led to record numbers of deaths in 
most recent years 
the 1988 death rate was 88 per 1000 people up from 87 a year 
earlier 
contributing to the increase in the death rate was the 
increasing proportion of older persons in the population and the 
influenza outbreak during the first four months of 1988 the 
center for health statistics reported 
the centers annual report also showed 24 million marriages in 
1988 down 1 percent from the year before and 12 million 
divorces a 2 percent increase

seven cuban human rights activists were arrested 
shortly before they planned to rally in support of reforms similar 
to those embraced by visiting soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev a dissident spokesman said 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
condemned the arrests saying they underlined the need for 
ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in cuba 
among those arrested on tuesday was samuel martinez lara leader 
of the prohuman rights party of cuba said elizardo sanchez a 
dissident activist 
martinez laras party and two other human rights groups had 
planned to gather at the soviet embassy on tuesday evening to ask 
gorbachev to pressure president fidel castro to adopt sovietstyle 
reforms 
gorbachev who was to leave for london today is popular among 
some cubans because of his greater tolerance for opposing views and 
his introduction of some capitalistic innovations 
castro on the other hand has been strongly committed to 
maintaining marxist orthodoxy and has rejected the concept of open 
debate 
sanchez said that among others taken into custody was roberto 
bahamonde who gained attention last month by seeking election to a 
seat on a municipal assembly by running as a dissident 
it is believed the first time a dissident has launched such a 
challenge in 30 years 
bahamonde lost the election against a proestablishment 
candidate but complained that he was not allowed to campaign on his 
platform which calls for a restoration of private enterprise 
the arrest of martinez lara was confirmed by a cuban foreign 
ministry spokesman hector argiles who said the dissident had been 
engaged in unauthorized activities 
sanchez said the families of the detainees have not been 
informed of their whereabouts they are being hidden he said

the number of refugees who have fled their 
native lands rose by 11 million last year to 144 million mostly 
because of civil wars in east africa and the war in afghanistan 
the us committee for refugees reported 
and this year the number arriving in the united states is 
expected to top 100000 for the first time since 1982 
another 14 million to 20 million people are refugees within 
their own countries 
but the numbers are approximate because in many places no 
careful figures are kept and there are many definitions of who is a 
refugee 
these are not numbers said roger p winter director of the 
committee in a statement on its report they are people each 
one of these 144 million represents an individual human tragedy 
the committee is a private group financed by foundations 
churches and contributions from individuals 
the biggest new groups described in its annual report made 
public this week are 
335000 who fled to ethiopia when a longsimmering revolt 
flared up last summer in somalia on the northeast tip of africa 
about 600000 people have been displaced within somalia a country 
bigger than france and with a population of about 8 million 
almost 250000 mozambicans who fled a 14yearold revolt 
against their communist government by the renamo guerrilla 
movement which has support in south africa the commitee says 115 
million mozambicans have now gone to other countries and 2 million 
of the countrys 15 million people have been violently uprooted 
within its borders 
150000 refugees from a civil war between nonmoslems and the 
islamic government of sudan they have moved eastward into 
ethiopia one worlds poorest countries bringing the total 
sudanese there to 350000 about 2 million peopleported 
to have lost their homes in sudan the y has 24 million 
inhabitants and more than twice the area of egypt its northern 
neighbor 
the largest number of refugees comes from afghion most are in pakistan 
which shelters the worlds 
biggest refugee population another 2 mill within 
their homeland 
palestinians 2p the second largest group 
ethiopia to which 700000 refugees have fled has seen about 21 
million of its own people flee abroad 
refugees differ widely most of the afghans have fled in the 
last eight or nine years many palestinians left more than 40 years 
ago when israel became a state ad their children and 
grandchildtill considered refugees 
the united nations high commissioner for refugeeserre 
hocke praised countries which have taken in refugees as 
safeguarding the unity of the family 
us tate james a baker iii told congress last 
month that he is planning to ask for another 100 miear 
for refugees in addition to the 412 millie 
but for the following year the bush administration has sought a cut 
in spending 
bakerwill complete a review of its refugee 
programs soon after may 1 
just before leaving office in january president reagan raised 
to 25000 the number of rgees from the soviet union and eastern 
europe titted into this country during the year that will 
end sept 30 that will leave 7000 fewer poss for people 
from vietnam but almost 40000 plwill still be available for 
them 
hocke writing in a specn of his agencys publication 
said the most natural solution for refugees is to 
send them home when conditions change enough so that they are 
welcome he called attention to those repatriated last year to 
ethiopia uganda and el salvador 
the us committee reported only about 280000 voluntary 
repatriati for the year tto uganda and 
burundi in southern africa

fred gadomski wants to make 
meteorology students as comfortable with television lights as they 
are with computer forecasting 
gadomski teaches penn state universitys introduction to 
television meteorology where seniors who who have weathered 
courses in topics such as atmospheric dynamics and calculus learn 
to mix show business with science 
its easier to make a meteorologist a good communicator than 
it is to teach meteorology to a tv personality said gadomski a 
meteorologist on public television in pennsylvania 
penn state has the largest meteorology department in the 
country it graudates one in four meteorologists and is one of only 
a few schools to teach tv to wouldbe weather forecasters 
gadomski and charles gudeman a senior producer at penn states 
public television station wpsxtv tell students in the course to 
befriend the camera speak in everyday terms and look as though 
theyng the time of their life doing it 
television stations will always choose personality ov 
expertise people tune in to see people they want information but 
they want it to come from a friend gudeman said 
syearold course do the weather the way the 
pros do live in a television studio without a teleprompter and 
with weather maps visible only on a monitor 
they also must field offthewall questions from gadomski who 
plays the anchorman in the mock broadcasts 
in a recent class these queries included wheer to open 
windows during tornadoes and how hail can become golze 
we figure theyll be able to handle a kindly anchor if theyre 
able to handle a malevolent one and its much more fun for me to 
be malevolent said gadomski 
students dont spend all their course time in front of the 
camera they also do writing exercises talk with people in the 
industry and learn about the equipment needed to set up a stations 
meteorology department 
meteorologists once a rarity on television now account for 
more than half the forecasters on tv according to sherlee barish 
an agent for onair news personnel 
but barbara frye director of talent placement for frank n 
magid andassociates a national consulting and research f 
marion iowa said stations in recent years have been shying away 
from meteorologists after a rush to hire from the late 1970s to 
mid1980s 
it used to be the most important qualification a person could 
have was being a meteorologist fryd now its 
personality its a person who can communicate a lot of 
meteorologists quite frankly cant 
gadomski said meteorologists have an advantage over the tv 
weathermen who rely on the nat weather service forecasts 
meteorologists can ickly analyze and report severe weather 
conditiecifically for a television stations coverage area 
he said

in cambodia by the end of june ending a 10year occupation a 
japanese news agency reported wednesday 
kyodo news service in a report from hanoi quoted reliable 
sources as saying vietnam had decided on a complete and 
unconditional withdrawal of all its troops from cambodia by june 30 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach was expected to 
issue a statement on the decision later wednesday kyodo said in 
the report monitored in tokyo 
simultaneous news conferences on the decision were scheduled 
wednesday in hanoi and phnom penh the cambodian capital 
vietnam previously has said it would withdraw its troops by 
1990 but would move the pullout up to september if a political 
settlement could be reached on the civil war an estimated 70000 
vietnamese troops are in cambodia 
the vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major 
resistance groups the communist khmer rouge of khieu samphan the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front of former 
cambodian prime minister son sann and followers of former 
cambodian head of state prince norodom sihanouk 
sihanouk who was deposed in 1970 heads the resistance 
coalition 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 drove out the radical 
khmer rouge regime that had defeated the usbacked government in 
the spring of 1975 and installed another communist administration 
during the khmer rouge regime it is estimated that about 2 
million of cambodias 8 million people died from khmer rouge 
executions famine and civil unrest 
their role in a postoccupation coalition government has been a 
major hurdle to a peace accord because their have the strongest 
fighting force in the resistance 
fears of the khmer rouge returning to power have grown recently 
as vietnam withdrew part of its troops from cambodia there have 
been at least six partial withdrawals since 1981 although foreign 
critics charged that in some cases fresh troops replaced those 
that withdrew

costa rican president oscar arias endorsing 
the bush administrations package of nearly 50 billion in 
nonmilitary aid for nicaraguan contra rebels wants cuba to follow 
suit and halt military aid to leftist rebels in el salvador 
after meeting tuesday with president bush vice president dan 
quayle and secretary of state james a baker iii arias said the 
socalled humanitarian aid was essential for integrating the 
contras back into nicaraguan society 
you cannot persuade the contras to go back to nicaragua if you 
have nothing to offer them he said theres no freedom 
theres no democracy they cannot integrate into political life 
and economic conditions are not the best 
arias who won the nobel peace prize two years ago for his 
central america peace plan calling for a halt of all outside 
military support for rebel groups in the region said soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev now has to persuade cuban president 
fidel castro to stop sending arms to salvadoran leftists 
ifupports sincerely the central american peace plan he 
has to persuade fidel castro not to ke 
guerrillas in el salvador arias said of gorbachev who is 
meeting with castro in havana this week 
we have learned that we must change bullets by ballots and we 
can only do this with the support of the cubans and the soviet 
union arias said 
gorbachev told the cuban national assembtuesday that the 
soviet union opposes the export of revolutioterrevolution referring 
to both cuban and us policy in 
latin america 
but he also said his country will continue supplying weaponry to 
nicaraguas leftist government as long as the united states 
continues to arm other central american countries 
and he called the bush administrations continued nonmilitary 
support for the contras worrisome 
developed with bipartisan support after eight years of bitter 
battles between congress and the former reagan administration over 
military aid for the contras the new package of humanitarian aid 
is intended to support the rebels until the nicaraguan elections 
next february 
now people here can talk with one single voice arias said 
of the united states 
he contrasted what he called lip service from the former 
reagan administration for his peace plan with officials in the new 
bush administration who are quite sincere and are doing what 
they are doing in good faith 
i breathe a new atmosphere a new environment because i have 
no doubts mr bush and the bush administration are going to 
sincerely support the guatemala accord the arias plan he said 
quayle said arias s bushs plan puts the ball in 
nicaraguan president daniel ortegas court to respond with 
democratic reforms 
ayle said 
arias told bush he still worries about how fair 
elections will be 
he stressed the need to afford ample time for voter 
registration and said the nicarans must allow establishment of 
a tv station that is not controlled by the sandinistas and as well 
as assuring access to the media by politicaes 
otherwise it will be very difficult to talk about free 
elections arias said 
an administration source said arias told bush that democratic 
nations should closely scrutinize plans the sandinistas are making 
for the elctoral process 
arias said heso had told castro that in vieushs 
emphasis on nonmilitary r the contras it was time for 
him if he supports our peace plan to stop supporting the 
guerrillas in el salvador i told fidel castro that it was time

gourmet food doesnt have to be dripping in 
calories and cholesterol to be sinfully delicious according to 
americas premier chefs who are catering more and more to 
healthconscious connoisseurs 
theres a whole move toward freshness said lawrence 
forgione chef proprietor of an american place in new york this 
is what people want they want to be informed they want to know 
what theyre eating 
i see it becoming lighter more natural agreed byron bardy 
manager of national accounts research and development for heinz 
usa you dont necessarily need a pound of butter to make a good 
sauce 
forgione and bardy are among seven top chefs who have been 
invited to dish out their best at a 1500aperson gourmet gala in 
october for childrens hospital of pittsburgh the worlds leading 
pediatric liver transplant center will launch its 1990 centennial 
celebration with the culinary extravaganza 
half the 100 dinner tickets already have been gobbled up solely 
through word of mouth interest is just as keen at other 
fundraising affairs that feature the creations of leading chefs 
how can you participate in fundraising and cook something 
that the average person doesnt want to eat anymore bardy asked 
i mean we all have to move ahead 
theyre getting bored with always eating meat and potatoes 
said jean banchet chef and owner of le francaiwheeling ill

begun putting sauces on the side rather than on the food 
another chef offering his services ospital 
jeanlouis palladin of jeanlouis at watergate in washington

if they are too heavy on the ch customers will 
never come baladin said

with what they should eat according to ferdinand metz president 
of the culinary institute of america 
inot just the responsibility of the chefs to wait and say 
well lets wait to e if they become more sophistica said 
metz who is baking the rt for the gala 
we have a responsibility to lead and im actually somewhat 
disappointed in the lack ofcorporate responsibility that i see on 
the part of some of the fastfood people 
education is the main ingredient to healthy eating and the new 
york institutes 22000 graduates are busy spreading the word 
according to metz 
the message will get around its an enormous 
undertaking but i think were making progress

for reducing their foreign debt 
we have an opportunity if we seize it to put the worst 
aspects of the debt crisis behind us world bank president barber 
conable said tuesday at the close of the banks spring meeting with 
the international monetary fund 
the sister organizations ended their twoday conference with an 
endorsement of the bush administrations new debt initiative which 
for the first time asks private banks to voluntarily forgive part 
of the third worlds 13 trillion debt 
elements of the plan could be put in practice by the time the 
leaders of the worlds economic democracies come together for their 
mmit scheduled for july in paris officials said 
a delay could be devastating in view ofated conable said 
throughout their meetings officials ound the world spoke 
repeatedly of social and political powder kegs that could be 
ignited as living standards inue to stagnate or deteriorate in 
debtburdened developing countries 
riots in venezuela in february that claimed 270 lives after the 
government institung program to placate the 
nations creditors were an alarm signal french finance 
minister pierre beregovoy told reporters 
bt chidzero zimbabwes finance minister and chairman of the 
world banelopment committee said it was clear to the 
finance officials that expectations have been raised people 
expect action expeditious action is required failure tt will 
spell disaster 
conable said the bank had created a task force that will start 
work by the end of this week with the imf on speeding 
implementation of the new debt relief progon among the bank imf debtor 
nations and commercial 
banks is needed to flesh out a feasible plan he said 
a senior us treasury official spea he not be 
name likely be the first country to 
qualify for debt relief mexico and venezuela have also been 
mentioned as earlfor assistance 
imf and world bank approval of the socalled brady plan named 
after treasury secretary nicrady was critical since the 
bush administration is counting on most of the fincing for the 
debt relief scheme to come from the two organizations 
basicaly the plan seeks to entice banthey have made to third world 
countries in return for 
assurances from the imf and world bank th paid

patients seeking a fountain of youth through 
an estimated 3 million cosmetic operations each year are sometimes 
getting more than they bargained for suffering and disfigurement 
a house panel investigating alleged unscrupulous practices by 
unqualified physicians was told tuesday by one woman that a tummy 
tuck severely damaged her heart and left her scarred for life 
another testified that liposurgery to remove the saddlebags 
from her thighs disfigured her leg because too much fat was sucked 
out and nearly drove her to suicide 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house small business 
subcommittee on regulation said cosmetic surgery remains a 
dangerously underregulated medical field which physicians can 
practice with no special licenses 
the subcommittee earlier issued a sixmonth study which found 
that 95 percent of cosmetic operations are performed in doctors 
offices where crucial emergency equipment is often lacking 
currently any medical school graduate with a state license can 
perform cosmetic surgery while nearly every state requires drivers 
to prove they have liability insurance doctors can practice 
cosmetic surgery without any insurance coverage 
various medical officials agreed tuesday there is room for the 
profession to toughen its own standards 
but richard t caleel president of the american academy of 
cosmetic surgery argued against any effort to narrow the practice 
to any particular group of specialists or to any particular 
facilities 
no group of health care providers has a monopoly on the 
provision of these services nor is any group completely free of 
individuals who abuse them he said 
however r barrett noone president of the american board of 
plastic surgery said other physicians have no business performing 
cosmetic surgery 
the plastic surgeon stands alone as the medical specialist 
best qualified to ensure the safety and satisfaction of patients 
noone declared 
joyce palso of santa ana calif said postoperative 
infections resulting from sloppy work of a cosmetic surgeon sent 
her into heart failure five times within a year 
but i want to tell you this she said the doctor who did 
the tummy tuck on me did the same procedurgistered nurse two months after 
he did me she died from the same 
complications and infections that i had so i am the lucky one

itself but instead it got worse she said she went to several 
other surgeons including one who told her three more operations 
costing 25000 would sther only a 5050 chance of 
recovery

bills unlike

democratic lawmakers say a measure they once 
characterized as urgently needed to end the eastern airlines strike 
is not necessary at all for now 
democrats pulled the legislation off the senate floor on 
tuesday arguing that the bill might impede efforts to purchase the 
troubled carrier and hinder bankruptcy court attempts to find a 
solution to the labor impasse 
the action came the same day that the associated press learned 
former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth would announce a 
new deal to buy eastern an earlier offer collapsed after jay a 
pritzker owner of the hyatt hotel chain reportedly came in with a 
higher offer 
the airlines striking unions which had originally sought 
passage of the bill asked senators to hold off action on the 
measure to allow potential purchasers a chance to work out a deal 
said senate labor committee chairman edward kennedy dmass and 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate aviation 
subcommittee 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine took to the 
senate floor to say that the measure was being withdrawn to give 
efforts to end the stalemate an unimpeded chance to work he 
said the measure might be returned to the floor in the future 
the bill would require president bush to appoint an emergency 
board that would recommend a solution to the monthold walkout 
bush and congressional republicans have opposed the measure 
saying the carriers management and unions should work out their 
dispute privately bush had threatened to veto the bill 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan noted democratic claims 
made last month just before the senates twoweek easter recess 
that the emergency board legislation was urgently needed 
no one can reasonably claim that the strike at eastern is a 
national emergency under any standard dole said 
one of the driving forces of the strike has been the antipathy 
union members have for frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
company texas air corp 
on march 9 five days after the walkout began eastern filed 
for protection from creditors under the federal bankruptcy code a 
sale of the airline would require the approval of new yorkbased 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland who is handling the 
reorganization and by a courtappointed panel representing 
creditors 
the house passed the measure with overwhelming support from 
majority democrats last month

president bush will propose legislation to bar 
discrimination against people carrying the aids virus if an ongoing 
review of state laws shows a federal statute is warranted an 
administration official says 
james allen acting director of the public health services 
national aids program office told a house panel on tuesday that a 
study of the status and effectiveness of state laws is being 
conducted by george washington university under a federal contract 
allen said the survey will be completed in a few months 
if it seems appropriate the administration will propose 
legislation he said in response to a question from rep henry a 
waxman dcalif 
waxman is chairman of the energy and commerce health 
subcommittee that called witnesses for the first overview of the 
status of the aids epidemic conducted since bush became president 
waxman had opened the hearing by complimenting bushs wife 
barbara for symbolic gestures toward aids patients but wondering 
whether bush would follow up on a campaign commitment to back 
federal antidiscrimination legislation 
the first lady has already moved us all with her visit to aids 
patients and her hugs for both babies and adults who are ill 
waxman said with one photo session she has probably done more to 
alleviate fear and to create compassion than could be done with a 
dozen studies or hearings 
he referred to a recent visit by barbara bush to an aids 
facility in washington where she was photographed holding an infant 
with aids and also embracing an adult with aids 
she should be congratulated and thanked for bringing us closer 
together at this time when we need to be close continued waxman 
but such feelings arent enough the president promised help and 
protection and we must begin to put that assistance together as 
budgets and laws 
allen said 88096 cases had been reported to the centers for 
disease control through the end of february there was a 45 percent 
increase in the number of reported cases during the most recent 
12month period when compared to the previous 12month period he 
said 
the white house aids commission and the independent institute of 
medicine have urged passage of a federal ban on discrimination 
against aids patients saying it is necessary to get people to be 
tested for aids who otherwise would not do so out of fear they 
would lose their jobs and be evicted from their homes if they test 
positive 
opponents say writing laws to apply specifically to people with 
aids would give them a protected status not extended to people with 
other fatal diseases

cactuses along the texasmexico border may 
actually be national guard troops camouflaged to gather 
drugtrafficking intelligence information for federal agencies 
congressional officials say 
a spokesman for the national guard in texas says he knows 
nothing about the proposed intelligencegathering efforts under a 
29 million appropriation from the pentagon 
but sen phil gramm a texas republican says the money will 
indeed be spent for air and ground surveillance by guard troops 
dispatched to the states 1000mile border with mexico 
gramm said the troops will attempt to infiltrate areas of 
suspected drug smuggling along the border and relay their findings 
to agencies including the border patrol us customs service and 
immigration and naturalization service 
gramm said the guard is not disclosing many details of the 
planned patrols which would be part of a drugtrafficking package 
by guard troops that also calls for aerial surveillance and helping 
customs with search and seizure of cargo crossing the border into 
texas 
a congressional source said the texas guard troops would use 
camouflage paint to look like a cactus bush and then infiltrate 
the border under cover of darkness as the guardsmen attempt to 
gather information on drugtrafficking patterns 
the 29 million in spending was approved last week by defense 
secretary dick cheney who also authorized plans by guardsmen in 11 
other states to attack drug smuggling 
gramm said the socalled longrange reconnaissance patrol 
program is a new program the national guard is not talking 
about 
however he said tuesday it would help federal agencies in the 
running war with drug smugglers along our border 
the american people clearly want the military more involved in 
our war on drugs gramm said in an interview it is not a 
substitute for law enforcement but it is a good complement it 
makes law enforcement more effective 
but lt col ed komandosky spokesman for the national guard in 
texas said he was not aware of any such foot or air patrols 
whatsoever under the 29 million effort 
the only money weve been allocated by the department of 
defense for drug interdiction is to run a cooperative program with 
the customs service komandosky said 
under that plan some 90 to 100 volunteer parttime guardsmen 
would be dispatched beginning thursday to four border points of 
entry and the port of houston to help customs inspectors search for 
illegal drug shipments 
komandosky said he was positive the money would not be 
financing the air or ground patrols unless gramm knows something 
i dont know and thats entirely possible that im not aware of 
any such animal 
gramm said the air surveillance is effective in locating 
clandestine landing strips used by drug smugglers and the search 
and seizure assistance provided by the guardsmen frees up customs 
workers to engage in more arrests

a dutch aids victim refused entry to the 
united states at the minneapolisst paul airport was kept out of 
the country because of a 1987 law passed by congress officials say 
for years immigration laws have required people who want to 
visit or move here to establish that they do not have any 
dangerous contagious diseases 
congress added acquired immune deficiency syndrome to that list 
of diseases in august 1987 and regulations preventing aids 
patients from entering the country became effective that december 
said joseph d cuddihy the immigration and naturalization 
services senior immigration examiner in the examinations branch in 
washington 
its not just the ins said greg leo of the ins this is 
something thats been a congressional matter 
cuddihy said tuesday that a person has to establish 
eligibility at the time of application for a visa overseas and 
each and every time he enters the united states 
immigration officials detained hans paul verhoef 31 of 
rotterdam the netherlands at the airport after us customs 
officials discovered the drug azt in his baggage sunday 
he then told immigration officials that he has aids and he was 
taken to the scott county jail outside the twin cities area where 
he was being held 
verhoef an aids prevenon worker in his country was en route 
to san francisco to participate as a delegate to the international 
caucus of the 7th national aids forum and the 11th national gay and 
gay health conference that begins wednesday 
ten to 15 othr aids victims previously have been turned away 
from this country and an unknown number have been denied visas 
their native country because they have the disy said 
visa applications specifically ask those who want t to the 
united states whether they have any of the prohibited diseases he 
said those applying for permanent visas must undercal 
examinations but unless there is any reason to believe tson is ill 
those who want simply temporary viaminations he said 
not all foreign visitors are asked about their health when they 
arrive in this country 
cuddihy assumed that verhoef was questioned about it 
only because he ts he planned to attend the aids 
conference in san francisco and the discovery of the container of 
azt 
the information provided by verhoef as well as thegage he 
had with him led to these particular tions in this particular 
case cuddihy said 
every person is not asked specifically about all of the 33 
grounds of exclusion and seven excludible diseases he said 
adding that the diseases include tuberculosis and several sexually 
transmitt 
if we tried to cover all the issues withyou can imagine what that 
would do to a place lik and lax 
he said referring to the airports in new york city and los 
angeles one of the grounds of exclusion is illiteracy but we 
never tell them to write their names 
cuddihy said he believrhoef did not indicate that he 
had aids when he applied for the visa in june 1988 for another 
visit 
we are not sure that he may or may not have had the hiv 
infectin at that time or he may not have been aware of what 
it implied he said the ins is not questioning whether verhoef 
lihe obtained the visa he said

israel is setting aside 5000 a month for 
convicted spy and former us navy intelligence expert jonathan j 
pollard as a nest egg for when he is released from prison 
according to a new book 
the israeli government feels a humanitarian or moral 
responsibility to pollard author wolf blitzer said in an 
interview tuesday night on abcs nightline show israel 
recognizes that it was forced to nail him in the panic that 
ensued after pollards arrest in 1985 
pollards father biochemist morris pollard of south bend ind 
said he was surprised to hear of the israeli payments his son who 
has been isolated from contact with the outside world at the 
federal penitentiary in marion ill also did not know about the 
israeli payments morris pollard said 
in an earlier interview with the associated press blitzer a 
correspondent for the jerusalem post predicted that pollard will 
be deported to israel if he is paroled at the end of 1995 
pollard 34 is serving a life sentence for selling israel 
thousands of secrets and the prosecutor who handled the case has 
said he doubts that pollard will ever see the light of day but 
he is technically eligible for parole after 10 years 
in his book terrorism of lies blitzer sets out to show 
that at least one or two of israels senior leaders probably 
knew that a senior intelligence operative named rafi eitan was 
running a spy in washington 
they are simply too experienced in these kinds of matters not 
to have known or suspected blitzer wrote 
among those leaders were thenprime minister shimon peres and 
defense minister yitzhak rabin both with broad intelligence 
experience and then foreign minister yitzhak shamir who was once 
a senior operative of the mossad spy agency 
a copy of the book was made available tuesday on the eve of an 
official visit by shamir now israels prime minister to 
washington the book is to be published next month by harper amp row 
pollards arrest here in november 1985 put a strain on 
usisraeli relations and israel has maintained er since that 
its use of him was an unauthorized rogue operation 
but even if they suspected that a spy was in place in 
washington they almost certainly did not know his name was pollard 
or any other specific details of the operation blitzer wrote 
blitzer who has been covering the case since the day pollard 
shthe israeli embassy with his wife asking for asylum 
said an isnvestigator into the affair compared eitans 
decision to keep his bosses in the dark to the reagan 
administrats irancontra affair 
the book surmises that eitan and other pollard handlers 
apparently assumed arroglessly that they would 
not get caught 
blitzer said in an interview that the book is based on thousands 
of documents s with pollard in jail and 
dozens of interviews with his family and friends 
some parts will anger israel others will probably anger t 
united states and some will probably anger pollard blitzerto be fair 
in a chapter titled the coverup code name siren blitzer 
writes that israels governmt scrambled to disavow knowledgehe espionage 
and give the appearance of full cooperation with 
american investigators without cooperating to the full extent 
he cites a decision to keep from the americannd role 
of israeli air force col aviem sella who recruited polard in 
1984 and was subsequently indicted here the highlevel decision 
to cover up sellas role was understandable but stupid blitzer 
 
to make sure the americanvestigation team that went to israel 
would not learn about sella or ask to interview him israeli 
authorities spirited him outuntry to west germany 
blitzer te they falsely dated his passport several days earlier 
to make it appear he lft before the te 
blitzer 
west germany was selected because its customs officials do not 
routinely stamp entry dates into visiting israeli passports 
blitzer said 
the author also said that former us defense secretary casper had 
told us district court judge aubrey robinson in a 
clasemo that pollard had sold israel 
documents thatould fill a small room 
among them blitzer said were us satellite photographs of the 
palestine liberat organizations headquarters in building in october 1985 
a month before pollards 
arrest killing 60 people

hours after an intense firefight the 
only clues that life around this northern border village had been 
disturbed were the hundreds of expended rifle shells lying on a 
sandy road shining in the sun 
police and black nationalist guerrillas waged a fierce battle 
for several hours monday night and early tuesday along parts of the 
25mile road that connects ombalantu to tsandi police said 
but in the daylight local residents casually rode their 
bicycles past the shells casings carried on with herding their 
goats and drank beer in the local shops 
the residents say they have grown accustomed to the fighting 
after 23 years of war between the south africanled security forces 
and the guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization 
like many people in the region the villagers are swapo 
supporters their loyalties are undoubtedly strengthened by the 
fact that swapo leader sam nujoma comes from a nearby village 
the residents said they heard shooting and saw flares until 3 
am tuesday and were worried renewed battles could catch their 
village in the crossfire 
ombalantu has a police base a few shops some small farms and 
not much else the harsh hot land is flat and sandy covered with 
low scrub bushes 
he numerous shell casings from rifles used by the territorial 
police force gave some hints as to the intensitof the fighting 
it showed that the police stayed on the road for several miles 
firing into the bush at guerrillas 
police capt jumbo de villiers said his men many of whom are 
members of the himba tribe have spent the last four days tracking 
guerrillas in the bush 
swapo guerrillas he best track disguisers in the 
world said de villiers but himba are the best trackers 
according to de villiers a sixmonth ceasefire was broken 
saturday morn when nine policemen tracking suspected cattle 
thieves were ambushed by swapo guerrillas 
the guerrillas with small armand grenades killed three of 
the policemen de more than a dozen swapo fighters 
were killed he added 
sen the police have staged their own surprises de 
villiers sai police trackers on monday came across 40 guerrillas 
bathing nesmall dam he said 
he did not give details of the fighting saying only that a 
contact was made

the agriculture departments decision to hold 
public hearings this summer on a plan to reduce the number of 
federal inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup hot dogs 
and other meat and poultry products has qualified approval from 
both industry and consumer groups 
the proposal was announced last november to carry out a 1986 law 
that would be tougher on inspections of the most troublesome 
processing plants but ease up on those with good records 
one of the goals is to take advantage of computers and other 
technology that could replace daybyday surveillance by federal 
inspectors 
periodic reviews would be held at the plants with good records 
and these operations would be expected to maintain a high level of 
selfpolicing in order to retain usda approval 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said tuesday the agency will 
postpone final decisions on some of the most controversial parts of 
its improved processing inspection plan until after the 
hearings 
but crawford said a final decision on certain criteria or 
standards for implementing the riskbased system will be made 
in the near future 
there are more than 7000 meat and poultry plants in the united 
states including about 6300 that turn out products such as hot 
dogs beef stew chicken soup luncheon meats and scores of other 
items only the processing plants would be covered by the 
streamlined inspection system it would not apply to slaughter 
plants which would remain under continuous federal inspection 
officials have estimated that the number of usda inspectors at 
the processing plants would be reduced by half by retirements and 
resignations the program would rely increasingly on good 
plants policing themselves 
crawford said his agency fsis will maintain the inspection 
work force at its current strength for the time being 
manly molpus president of the industrysupported american meat 
institute said the decision was a step in the right direction 
but that his organization and fsis are still far apart in our 
views of how improved processing inspection should be implemented 
molpus said the announcement did not provide a clear fix on 
how the agency should proceed and that we assume everything is on 
the table for discussion over the next several months 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of a house subcommittee on 
human resources and intergovernmental relations said that a 
subcommittee hearing on the streamlined inspection program will 
proceed as scheduled tuesday 
weiss in a statement said the usdas announcement recognized 
that this proposal is seriously flawed and that the department 
cannot justify reducing the frequency of inspections at this 
time 
tom devine legal director for the government accountability 
project which was joined by the consumer nutrition institute in 
opposing the usda proposal called the departments announcement 
a tentative victory for common sense 
devine in a telephone interview added it means we can begin 
the real public debate on how to change the inspection program 
without a fait accompli once they cut the numbers of inspectors in 
half most of the options are gone except an honor system 
devine said the usda announcement also raises the stakes for 
the weiss hearing next week 
it means we dont have to wait for fsis to schedule hearings 
this summer to begin the public debate he said

the chairman of a house committee is 
threatening to push for federal regulation of the supplemental 
health insurance industry on grounds the states are doing an 
inadequate job of protecting the elderly from exploitation 
preliminary reports from the general accounting office 
indicate that many of the largest commercial insurers continue to 
bilk elderly citizens by offering unlawful and unconscionably low 
returns on premium payments rep john d dingell dmich wrote 
to the national association of insurance commissioners on tuesday 
this finding suggests the need for immediate action and raises 
serious doubts about the effectiveness of the present regulatory 
structure said dingell head of the committee on energy and 
commerce 
socalled medigap policies are sold by private insurance 
companies to supplement the coverage 32 million americans have 
under medicare the federal health program for the elderly and 
disabled like other insurance it historically has been regulated 
by the states 
but dingells letter to david gates president of the 
washingtonbased national association of insurance commissioners 
suggested that might not remain a permanent arrangement 
gates the nevada state insurance commissioner was traveling 
when the letter was made public in advance of being made 
available to the association and could not be reached for comment 
we will respond to mr dingells letter when we receive a 
copy said kevin cronin the organizations washington counsel 
dingell said the energy and commerce oversight and 
investigations subcommittee which he also chairs has scheduled a 
hearing april 26 to further explore these issues in some detail 
and to reveal the complete findings of our investigation 
dingell closed his letter by informing gates that he intends to 
introduce legislation aimed at strengthening federal standards to 
assure that all medicap policies are vigorously regulated 
irrespective of how or where they are sold to require that 
insurers meet reasonable loss ratios or return windfalls to policy 
holders and to combat sales abuses by offering appropriate 
deterrents to those who insist on selling duplicative policies 
he said the gao survey found that the majority of companies 
many with tens of millions of dollars in premiums were found to 
return less than 60 percent of premiums collected 
these windfall profits earned at the expense of the elderly 
are particularly harmful given the rising health care expenses that 
so many elderly people face dingell wrote 
the overhead cost of medicare is about 3 percent meaning 97 
cents of every dollar handled by the program goes to actual patient 
benefits

congress will determine whether testing for 
aflatoxin in corn should be expanded and technology for detecting 
the naturally occuring carcinogen be improved says a kansas 
congressman 
at a hearing tuesday chaired by rep dan glickman witnesses 
said corn that is being exported is checked for aflatoxin but the 
federal government does not test grain that stays in the united 
states aflatoxin is produced by molds that proliferate during 
drought 
federal grain inspection service administrator w kirk miller 
said 75 percent or 91 million metric tons of the corn exported 
this year has been tested and none had more than the 20 parts per 
billion considered safe for human consumption 
as for the domestic market miller said commercial corn buyers 
do their own testing 
our industry considers aflatoxin to be a serious matter and 
places a great deal of emphasis on keeping it out of the food and 
feed supply lyle kuhlmann president of byron elevator co in 
byron minn told the subcommittee 
kuhlmann said grain elevator operators risk having their entire 
elevator seized and condemned by state and federal officials if 
they mix corn containing aflatoxin at levels above legal limits 
with uncontaminated corn 
but glickman said after the hearing that congress would decide 
whether regulations should be strengthened he said he was 
concerned about corn grown by farmers who feed it to their milk 
cows or beef cattle without ever testing it for the carcinogen 
scientists testifying before the panel had differing views on 
the dangers of aflatoxin 
leonard stoloff who retired from the food and drug 
administration in 1982 after researching the substance for 19 
years said he did not believe it caused cancer in humans though 
there was evidence that it could cause some liver damage 
steven tannenbaum chemistry professor at the massachusetts 
institute of technology disagreed with stoloff but said consumers 
would be in danger of getting cancer only through a lifetime of 
exposure to corn contaminated with excessive amounts of aflatoxin 
a single bad year will not have the effect of having people 
drop in the streets he said 
aflatoxin has been linked to liver cancer in laboratory rats it 
is produced by two types of mold that abound on corn when there is 
a drought 
it was discovered in 1962 and can be detected in corn through 
relatively simple testing but requires skilled technicians and 
special equipment the results of certain tests take several weeks 
since the drought of 1988 the worst in 50 years aflatoxin has 
been found in corn grown in isolated areas of iowa and illinois 
miller told the subcommittee that other major corn producing states 
like minnesota nebraska and ohio plus other parts of iowa and 
illinois were free of the problem

teamsters leader william j mccarthy says he 
has never had dealings with organized crime figures and told 
congress he knew of no current members of the unions governing 
board with mob ties 
if i get the facts if i know whats going on i will move 
mccarthy said tuesday in promising to root out any corruption that 
came to his attention its not anywhere that i know of he 
said when asked whether the current international union leadership 
was under mob influence 
mccarthy testified at a senate permanent subcommittee on 
investigations hearing to review the recent settlement of a 
racketeering suit against the teamsters part of a larger committee 
look at government efforts to battle union corruption 
the suit sought the ouster of the teamsters entire 18member 
governing board alleging the leadership was rife with mob 
corruption but the settlement allowed all current members of the 
board to keep their jobs 
benito romano us attorney for manhattan defended the 
settlement as the quickest way to reform the union telling the 
hearing the agreement included election reforms that would end a 
sick joke system under which teamsters leaders are now chosen 
mccarthy under questioning denied an account by his immediate 
predecessor jackie presser who told the fbi that mccarthy said he 
would have to get approval from mafia leaders before seeking the 
unions no 2 post in 1984 
thats not so mccarthy said before lashing out at presser 
and another former teamsters president roy williams 
both were mixed up with la cosa nostra by their own 
admissions i didnt care for either one of them he said 
mccarthy said it was presser who in 1984 suggested mccarthy 
would have to meet with raymond ls patriarca the reputed new 
england crime boss if he wanted to be appointed secretary 
treasurer of the union 
i said no way mccarthy said i didnt talk to him nor 
would i 
patriarca died in 1984 and according to law enforcement 
officials was suceeded by his son raymond junior patriarca 
mccarthy said he never has met or spoken to the younger patriarca 
and gave the same answer when asked if he ever had met or spoken to 
a number of other reputed mob figures 
mccarthy said the only pervasive mob corruption he was aware of 
was in the teamsters central states division from which both 
presser and williams rose through the unions ranks 
asked about an account that quoted him calling presser a stool 
pigeon mccarthy said it could be yes sir i call him a 
crooked stool pigeon he lies thats why i gave him that name 
as part of the settlement the union agreed to hold open 
elections by secret ballots and to appoint three monitors with 
broad powers to oversee union elections and management 
although the settlement reached last month took effect 
immediately the teamsters agreed to submit pertinent portions of it 
to their next convention for ratification a step designed to 
prevent future challenges to the legality of amending the unions 
constitution through a court agreement 
mccarthy denied assertions made by a dissident teamsters group 
that during regional meetings last week he boasted that the union

billion according to the chief united nations food official

assistance the new york times reported today they are angola 
bangladesh ethiopia haiti jamaica laos lebanon mozambique

conventional mortgage interest rates rose in 
march to their highest level since just before the 1987 stock 
market crash the government says 
the federal home loan bank board the regulator of savings 
institutions said tuesday the national average for conventional 
singlefamily loans jumped to 1136 percent in early march up from 
1111 percent in early february 
it was the highest rate since early october 1987 when the 
average hit 1142 percent just before the stock market crash 
interest rates began falling after the crash as the federal reserve 
board pumped money into the economy to guard against a recession 
the bank board said rates for the most popular type of oneyear 
adjustablerate mortgages those with caps on how high the rate can 
increase also rose last month to 975 percent up from 96 percent 
in early february 
it was the highest arm rate since march 1986 when the average 
was 984 percent the bank board said 
the fed for a year now has been tightening credit and pushing 
interest rates upward in an effort to restrain economic growth to 
hold down inflation those efforts intensified in february after 
the government reported there were sharp price increases at both 
the wholesale and retail levels during january 
the increases in the early march rates reflected the general 
tightening in credit markets during february said james barth 
chief economist for the bank board 
the percentage of mortgages closed with adjustable rates 
declined to 55 percent in early march down from 57 percent in 
february the board reported 
a separate weekly report released friday by the federal home 
loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac showed interest rates 
remained high throughout march 
it said fixedrate home mortgages were averaging 1119 percent 
last week down slightly from a rate of 1122 percent during the 
previous week on oneyear adjustable rate mortgages lenders were 
asking an average initial rate of 931 percent last week up from 
93 percent the previous week 
the freddie mac averages are lower than the bank boards because 
they do not include addon fees known as points which are paid by 
borrowers

already owns the sources said

two civil rights activists and a lawyer were 
found in contempt for releasing an fbi memo discrediting a witness 
before the house committee on unamerican activities in 1956 
i really hate to do this but its such a clear case i cannot 
ignore it us district judge a wallace tashima said monday 
the ruling stems from the case of frank wilkinson a civil 
rights activist and one of the last americans to go to prison for 
contempt of congress during the mccarthy era for refusing to answer 
questions posed by the committee 
in february wilkinson filed a petition in federal court in 
atlanta asking that his conviction be overturned he cited the fbi 
memo 
by releasing the memo tashima ruled wilkinson and two others 
violated a 1984 court order that protected many of the 132000 
documents involved in wilkinsons 30year battle with the fbi 
in addition to wilkinson paul hoffman legal director of the 
southern california american civil liberties union and attorney 
douglas mirell were found in civil contempt of a court order 
they were ordered to pay attorney fees to the justice 
department which sought the ruling and must accept responsibility 
if the subject of the fbi memo sues for invasion of privacy 
the fbi memo stated that the 1956 testimony of anita edith 
schneider who branded wilkinson a communist was unreliable 
because she exhibited emotional instability the previous year 
wilkinson director emeritus of the national committee against 
repressive legislation was convicted in 1958 of contempt of 
congress for refusing to testify before the committee and was 
imprisoned for nine months 
hoffman said he misunderstood the 1984 order he argued during 
the contempt proceedings that ms schneider was a public figure 
in the 1940s and 50s the house committee on unamerican 
activities sought to find communists in the government military 
and elsewhere but fell into disrepute amid rising questions of the 
constitutionality of its methods

theater for the april 9 and 13 productions of verdis luisa 
miller when the 132yearold academy of music was closed on

the state is suing the us labor department and 
its job corps program charging the federal agency with illegally 
requiring aids tests for applicants 
in a complaint filed tuesday in us district court state 
attorney general james shannon accused the agency of violating 
federal law by requiring job corps applicants to be tested for aids 
antibodies and using positive test results to keep young people out 
of a residential job corps program 
shannon was joined in the lawsuit by a woman identified as 
jane doe who was described as a massachusetts resident who was 
removed from a job corps program on the basis of a positive aids 
antibody test she is represented by the disability law center and 
by the gay and lesbian advocates and defenders 
the federal government did not reply immediately in court to 
shannons complaint paul williams a spokesman for the labor 
department in washington said the agency would not comment on 
pending litigation 
the complaint alleges at least six massachusetts residents have 
been excluded from job corps residential programs the state 
charges that the job corps policy discriminates against people who 
have or are perceived as having a disability in violation of 
federal laws protecting the handicapped from discrimination 
shannon also charged that the policy violates the administrative 
procedure act because it was adopted without public notice or 
hearings and that it violates privacy rights 
this policy has a devastating impact on the lives of many 
youths who are trying to better themselves it is tragic that the 
job corps is abandoning the young people it is intended to help 
shannon said 
the job corps a nationwide program within the labor department 
provides education and training to youths between ages 16 and 24 
who need special assistance in preparing for work because of 
disruptive home lives or cultural deprivation 
about 700 young men and women are enrolled in the two 
residential job corps programs in massachusetts in north grafton 
and in chicopee 
according to the complaint jane doe is a 20yearold high 
school dropout who replied to a job corps tv advertisement last 
august she applied to the grafton center for training in 
wordprocessing and was accepted 
on aug 30 doe enrolled in the program the next day she 
underwent a medical exam that included a test for exposure to aids 
without any advance counseling about the test or its significance 
on sept 12 she was summoned from class and told that she had 
tested positive shannon said she was immediately dismissed from 
the program with virtually no meaningful counseling or 
support he said 
aides to shannon said the job corps made minor changes in its 
aids testing policy after a similar lawsuit was filed last year in 
federal court in washington dc 
shortly after the bush administration took office in january 
shannon said job corps officials used an internal memorandum to 
revise the policy still requiring testing but evaluating results 
on a casebycase basis

one year after he was removed from office for 
misusing funds and obstructing justice former gov evan mecham 
vowed to run again in 1990 and lead a kinder and gentler 
arizona 
mecham predicted at a rally tuesday night he would regain the 
governors office on monday he filed papers asking the 
legislature to reconsider the votes by which it impeached and 
ousted him 
i committed no impeachable offense the maverick republican 
told an enthusiastic crowd of about 400 supporters 
legislative leaders said they doubted lawmakers would grant 
mecham a new impeachment trial and did not know how they could even 
consider it because several incumbents were defeated in novembers 
elections 
the 64yearold former auto dealer has remained popular with a 
sizable number of gop voters in a state where republicans have an 
edge in registration but he generated controversy in office even 
before his impeachment 
mecham was elected in 1986 on his fifth try for governor and 
immediately came under fire for eliminating the states martin 
luther king jr holiday controversial appointments and statements 
that offended blacks jews asians and others also ate away at his 
popularity 
several prominent republicans have urged him not to run again 
former house speaker joe lane one of the proimpeachment 
lawmakers ousted in novembers elections said he was terribly 
distressed by mechams announcement 
therell be a terrible primary he said democrats will be 
organized and well have a bloody primary and i just hate to see 
that 
democratic gov rose mofford the former secretary of state who 
took over after mechams ouster said she wasnt surprised by his 
promise to run 
i will match my record with his any time mofford said i 
will not stand by and let him or anyone else turn the clock back 
socially culturally economically or any other way 
mecham was impeached by the house on feb 5 1988 on charges 
that he misused state money for his auto dealership tried to 
thwart a state attorney generals investigation of a death threat 
and concealed a 365000 campaign loan 
on april 4 1988 the senate convicted him of misusing funds by 
a vote of 219 and of obstruction by 264 the senate deferred the 
third charge to superior court where he was acquitted 
both chambers of the legislature were controlled by the gop 
mecham and his wife florence arrived to a standing ovation 
from the crowd at the rally he criticized mrs mofford saying she 
had raised taxes and abandoned his antidrug antipornography and 
costcutting efforts 
i want to send word out to everyone in arizona that i think we 
can have a kinder and gentler arizona said mecham echoing 
george bushs presidential campaign cry 
i think the 19 months between now and the general election of 
1990 can be a time of spirited debate on the issues but not 
namecalling and not accusations without basis 
lawyers are uncertain whether the impeachment process simply 
stripped mecham of his office or also permanently barred him from 
any state office republican state attorney general bob corbin has 
been asked for an advisory opinion but noted that whatever he says 
can be challenged in court 
if the legislature doesnt review the impeachment we have 
every intention of taking it to the highest court in arizona and 
if need be to the us supreme court mecham attorney donald 
macpherson told the rally bringing the crowd to its feet

the eighth victim of a bridge collapse 
was pulled from the rainswollen hatchie river after a specially 
trained dog led searchers to a submerged station wagon 
authorities said they dont believe anyone else died but would 
continue to search the waters where an 84foot section of the 
twolane bridge collapsed saturday night five vehicles including 
a tractortrailer rig toppled into the river 
we have not had anymore missing person reports that have been 
confirmed so we feel like thats all but we want to be sure 
said fire chief jerry craig 
transportation secretary samuel skinner was to inspect the 
bridge today along with sen jim sasser dtenn and rep john 
tanner dtenn 
the cause of the bridge collapse has not been determined but 
officials said high water for the past couple of months may have 
undercut one of the bridge supports the 55yearold bridge carries 
the northbound lanes of us highway 51 over the hatchie river 
about 50 miles north of memphis 
seven bodies were recovered saturday and sunday but the eighth 
was not found until tuesday when divers located the station wagon 
partly buried in the riverbank under 15 feet of water the spot had 
been picked out on monday by a dog trained to smell bodies buried 
in rubble or under water 
the latest victim was identified as adrian jones 26 of nearby 
ripley he was known to have been driving on the highway about the 
time of the collapse and his relatives had kept a riverside vigil 
through much of the search 
after the station wagon was hauled out workers used a crane to 
begin removing huge chunks of concrete lying on the other vehicles 
three 28foot sections of highway weighing 75 to 100 tons each 
plunged into the river when the bridge gave way 
the bridge passed a state inspection in 1987 a companion 
twolane southbound bridge was closed and inspected after the 
collapse and authorities said it would probably reopen as a 
twoway bridge thursday

its a good deal all the way through said clyde ritter 73 
of rural osage iowa they say it saved my life 
ritter had gone into a diabetic coma one morning in august at 
his home five miles northwest of osage 
the towns are you ok computer at police headquarters 
alerted authorities that ritter failed to answer a second call and 
a deputy sheriff was sent to the home he found ritter comatose and 
summoned an ambulance 
i guess i credit the system for saving at least one life 
said osage police officer michael dekruif weve had tremendous 
success with it 
besides ritters rescue the system has alerted osage police to 
an elderly man whose hands were caught in a window trapping him 
inside his own home and to three elderly people who had fallen in 
their homes and needed police to help them 
i havent seen anything like it said retha jefferson a 
police department desk officer in belhaven nc its just that 
officers respond to calls all the time of neighbors not seeing 
their neighbors for two or three days and then its too late 
jefferson who manually calls about 45 elderly people each day 
to check on them said belhaven is raising 7000 to buy a system 
the 41yearold johnson said he developed the program about a 
year ago for osage more or less as a public service while he 
was living in nearby austin minn johnson had video stores in 
austin and osage and was considered a computer guru by friends 
members of the police department had heard of a computer dialing 
system in carthage mo and they wanted johnson to improve on it 
i foolishly told the city ill write it for you johnson 
said it took me 14 months 
thanks to publicity in law enforcement journals the project has 
blossomed into a fulltime business for johnson a former army and 
national guard officer 
only osage charles city iowa and sutherlin ore are on line 
with the system but inquiries and purchase orders have been 
pouring in from all over 
we had a call from scotland yard on it said robert okeefe 
the only other officer in johnsons homebased company northland 
innovations 
the whole thing has caught me off guard johnson said 
maybe im achieving the american dream by accident but thats 
ok 
johnson a twotime university of minnesota dropout who has 
lived in brazil germany and the bronx started to teach himself 
about computers in 1982 when he was bedridden for six months with a 
back injury 
he said are you ok programs are flexible and easy to 
operate the service is free to the residents where a system is 
based 
participation is voluntary but police departments emphasize the 
importance of avoiding false alarms participants are asked to be 
in their homes and off the telephone at the same time each day to 
answer the call they are required to report in advance when they 
will not be home so the information can be stored in the computer 
in time to avert a call 
my goal for are you ok is to see one in every city in the 
us johnson said

a scientist found cancerfighting fatty 
chemicals in cheese and grilled ground beef but says its no 
excuse for people to go stuff themselves on cheeseburgers 
people should be reassured to know there are things in food 
that prevent cancer said microbiologist michael pariza who 
conducted the research as director of the university of wisconsins 
food safety research institute 
but saturated fats and cholesterol also found in beef and cheese 
have been linked previously to heart disease and some cancers 
so were certainly not suggesting that people go out and chow 
down on cheese and hamburgers pariza said tuesday during the 
american cancer societys science writers seminar 
he said fears of cancercausing substances in food were 
aggravated by recent reports of alar in apples and aflatoxin in 
grain as well as a 1986 lawrence livermore national laboratory 
study that found welldone fried and broiled hamburgers contain 
chemicals that cause cancer and mutations in rodents 
pariza said his findings show that in many foods there are 
good substances that may counteract the effect of bad substances 
thats why its a good idea to eat a balanced diet 
his study found varying amounts of the cancerinhibiting fatty 
acids called cla or conjugated linoleic acids in hamburger and 
natural and processed cheeses highest levels were in cheese whiz 
sandwich spread followed by grilled hamburger 
pariza worried about public reaction to his study said that 
two men whose wives are dying of cancer called him and wanted to 
know if their wives should eat more cheese whiz he told them no 
american heart association spokesman howard lewis also expressed 
concern people might overinterpret the research by eating too much 
cheese and meat 
to prevent heart disease the group recommends a balanced diet 
of fresh fruit and vegetables and foods low in cholesterol and 
saturated fat those include lowfat cheeses and lean meat trimmed 
of excess fat lewis said by phone from dallas 
if you eat a highfiber lowfat diet the health benefits far 
outweigh the benefits of any cla you can get through eating a lot 
of beef and cheese said dr vincent devita jr former national 
cancer institute director 
pariza said the wisconsin milk marketing board paid about 
onethird of his laboratorys costs but only for the last two 
years of the 10year research effort the cancer institute provided 
most of the funds he said 
dr john laszlo the cancer societys senior vice president 
defended the quality of parizas research he said it raises the 
possibility that cla someday might be given to people to help 
prevent cancer pariza emphasized much more research is needed to 
learn if that would work 
parizas discovery that cla in hamburger can inhibit cancer 
illustrates what an oversimplification it is to make 
pronouncements about diet and cancer laszlo added 
at the time of the 1986 report that hamburger contains chemicals 
that cause cancer in mice scientists said the risk to humans was 
unknown but as a precaution they recommended against cooking meat 
welldone 
parizas early studies also found carcinogens in cooked meat 
but a few years ago he found a crude extract from grilled hamburger 
that was able to inhibit skin cancer in mice exposed to a potent 
cancercausing chemical 
in his latest research he purified and identified cla in 
extracts of cheeses and grilled hamburger 
one group of mice was given cla and a second group received none 
of the substance all the mice were later fed a strong doses of a 
cancercausing chemical 
this was repeated weekly for four weeks and the mice were 
killed after 20 weeks mice that received cla and the carcinogen 
averaged two tumors in the forestomach compared with five tumors 
in mice that got only the carcinogen 
cla has been known for 50 years and occurs naturally in human 
blood and mothers milk and in most animal products pariza said 
adding that his research revealed its cancerfighting properties 
he theorizes cla inhibits cancer by blocking damage to 
chromosomes or basic hereditary information in all cells caused 
by chemicals called oxygen free radicals 
previous research found cancerinhibiting chemicals in carrots 
broccoli brussels sprouts cauliflower beans nuts and certain 
other foods

richard m daley has legendary shoes to fill but 
says he will stride into city hall on his own two feet 
flush with victory tuesday and preparing to occupy the mayors 
office held 21 years by his father the late richard j daley he 
said throughout this campaign ive been asked about my father 
and what i learned from him he taught me to love this city 
he taught me that public service is not just a job he 
continued public service is a high calling 
throughout a political career that had its beginnings nearly 30 
years ago the daley name made many of his achievements possible 
diminished others and left him forever open to the charge that his 
vision extends only as far as his fathers shadow 
both my father and mayor harold washington loved this city 
and both were strong mayors daley said but people running for 
mayor should stand on their own two feet 
he lived at home until he was 30 and now at age 46 still 
lives only a few blocks from the bungalow where he grew up in the 
workingclass bridgeport neighborhood he looks walks talks and 
occasionally misspeaks in a way that makes it obvious he is an heir 
of the last of the bigcity bosses 
and that is what scares his critics most during the campaign 
black rival timothy evans labeled daley a pharoah and said his 
election would revive the oncevaunted political machine his father 
built on patronage and used to control city hall 
we will likely return to plantation politics said lu 
palmer a black activist and radio personality 
daley who friends and colleagues say began to emerge from his 
fathers shadow after the elder daleys death in 1976 is sensitive 
to the charge 
the people of chicago want to move forward not back he 
said they want a government that is fair and open and 
representative of every community and so do i 
but he does not entirely shy away from his legacy 
i think the best lesson my father taught me had nothing to do 
with politics or government he said tuesday night as supporters 
roared it had to do with my family and i want to thank my 
family for their support in bad times and in good times 
and daley recalled that he and wife maggie never needed 
support more than when the family lost kevin the third of their 
four children to the crippling disease spina bifida at age 2 
after he spoke daley hoisted his 5yearold daughter 
elizabeth to his shoulder as his wife daughter nora 15 and son 
patrick 13 beamed 
the eldest of seven children richard m daley cut his political 
teeth working as an 18yearold page for the illinois delegation to 
the 1960 democratic national convention 
he graduated law school in 1968 and his father rewarded him with 
a job as an assistant city attorney after he passed the bar exam on 
his third try he handily won a seat in the 1969 illinois 
constitutional convention 
in 1972 a machine democrat was pulled from the illinois senate 
to make room for young daley 
he was criticized by some colleagues early on as his fathers 
eyes and ears and he helped block reformist legislation 
but he later forged cautious alliances with the same reformers 
who often had opposed his father 
as a result when he ran for the first of his three terms as 
cook county states attorney in 1980 democrats slated alderman 
edward burke to run against him the younger daley clobbered burke 
then twice won reelection 
the combination of an old name and a new face proved a winner 
again tuesday 
it shows americans love sequels said eugene kennedy a 
loyola university professor and author of himself a biography 
of the elder daley

new yorks highest court has cleared the way 
to try billions of dollars in lawsuits over the antimiscarriage 
drug des and a lawyer said a long legal fight was just beginning 
we have a long ways to go said new york city attorney paul 
rheingold who represents several women who claim they were harmed 
by the drug in their mothers womb but at least the ways been 
cleared for the 500 women whove filed suits to have their day in 
court 
the court of appeals on tuesday unanimously upheld the states 
toxic tort law under which the women filed their lawsuits the 
court also ruled that all companies that made des for use by 
pregnant women should be liable for a percentage of any damage 
awards won by new yorkers even companies that never marketed 
their pills in the state 
the ruling written by chief judge sol wachtler drew praise 
from women who claim they were harmed by the des their mothers took 
between the late 1940s and early 1970s 
but jay mayesh a lawyer for upjohn one of the major drug 
manufacturers involved in the suits cautioned that the justices 
addressed only procedural issues 
they do not address the fundamental question of whether des 
caused any of the health problems the plaintiffs claim it did that 
issue remains very hotly contested he said 
mayesh said drug company attorneys from their experiences in 
other state courts have become very good at showing that des may 
not be responsible for the maladies blamed on it 
the drug has been cited for allegedly causing a range of serious 
health problems in the offspring of women who took it including 
cancer miscarriages and sterility 
in virtually every case victims were barred from suing because 
their health problems didnt appear until years after the statute 
of limitations had expired 
the toxic tort statute opened a oneyear period for people to 
file suits for damages they claim were caused by exposure to one of 
five substances including diethylstilbestrol or des the other 
substances named in the law are asbestos tungstencarbide 
chlordane and polyvinylchloride 
more than 500 des suits seeking some 3 billion in damages were 
filed between july 1986 and july 1987 under the statute 
in wachtlers ruling the court of appeals rejected contentions 
made by drug companies that the toxic tort statute violated their 
constitutional rights to due process and equal protection the 
companies had claimed the law unfairly singled out just five 
substances 
a stickier legal question for the court apparently was how to 
determine which drug companies were responsible for damages and how 
much they should pay 
the court decided unanimously that a market share theory 
similar to one first formulated by californias top court would be 
adopted in new york for apportioning damages from the des 
litigation 
that means drug companies will be liable for the percentage of 
damages in new york court cases corresponding to the percentage of 
the national des market they controlled while manufacturing the 
drug

the colombian government has accused the defense 
department of using the fight against drugs as a ruse for 
installing a radar system on an island to monitor activities in 
nicarauga a newspaper reported today 
the defense departments insistence on placing the radar on 
colombias san andres island in the caribbean rather that on its 
southern border has hurt attempts to curtail drug operations in 
that country an aide to sen john f kerry dmass told the 
boston globe 
richard mccall kerrys foreign affairs aide said colombia 
proposed putting the radar near its border with brazil to monitor 
flights coming into the country from bolivia ecuador and brazil 
major sources for the raw materials and chemicals used to process 
cocaine in colombia 
pentagon officials told the colombian government they wanted the 
radar on san andres to monitor the export of the finished product 
the colombians countered that radar there would be of little help 
since planes could take many different routes from colombia the 
newspaper said 
the only utility for that radar was to monitor nicaragua 
mccall said 
san andres is 200 miles off the nicaraugan coast but some 500 
miles from colombia 
the newspaper said a senate foreign relations subcommittee was 
scheduled to take up the radar location issue today 
the globe reported that a defense department spokesman maj 
michael stepp said tuesday night that the pentagon had signed an 
agreement in february to place radar on san andres and on 
colombias northern coast 
but the colombian embassy in washington insisted no agreement 
exists and negotiations over the radars placement is continuing

the company at the center of a stock scandal that 
has shaken the government to its core contributed more than 
380000 to fundraising parties for prime minister noboru 
takeshita news reports said today 
takeshita had disclosed last friday that recruit co spent 
152700 on a fundraising party for him in may 1987 when he was a 
leading contender for leadership of the governing liberal 
democratic party and the prime ministers post 
the nationwide newspaper asahi shimbun and other newspapers 
reported today that takeshita received another 229000 from 
recruit at another fundraising party that month 
asked by reporters about the reports takeshita said i cant 
comment on the matter because i do not have detailed information 
it is difficult to confirm it quickly 
an aide to takeshita speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that recruit had bought tickets to the second party but 
said our office did not directly handle the party so we do not 
know the amount 
recruit an information services conglomerate sold 
bargainpriced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150 
influential politicians bureaucrats and businessmen who profited 
handsomely when public trading in the stocks began 
so far 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on 
bribery or securities law violation charges in connection with the 
deals three cabinet ministers have resigned because of links to 
the scandal 
the leaders of four major opposition parties planned to meet 
friday in kyoto in western japan to discuss forming a coalition 
government in hopes takeshita could be forced to step down 
meanwhile lowerlevel opposition meetings were discussing strategy 
the takeshita cabinet is no longer entitled to run the 
government japan socialist party chairwoman takako doi told 
reporters tuesday the only alternative left for the government 
is to resign en masse and accept the peoples judgment 
takeshita has refused to resign despite public opinion polls 
showing approval ratings as low as 9 percent for his government he 
has vowed instead to reform politics and regain public trust 
japanese politicians customarily use fundraising parties to 
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations and solicit 
funds from business leaders and supporters 
large corporations often buy large blocks of party tickets but 
takeshita acknowledged last week that the 152700 purchase by 
recruit disclosed then was slightly excessive for one company 
there is no legal limit on the amount of money politicians can 
raise from such parties the parties are considered legal as long 
as the price of each ticket is within the range of common sense and 
the number of tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of 
what a company can possibly use said an official at the home 
affairs ministry speaking on condition of anonymity 
the opposition has stalled legislative business but cannot force 
takeshita out the liberal democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in 
parliaments lower house and 143 of the 252 in the upper house 
at least 17 politicians including takeshita and former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone have been implicated in the scandal 
although none has been arrested 
prosecutors reportedly have begun questioning politicians and 
their aides

that dashed gary harts presidential hopes has found that just like 
politics the lecture circuit makes strange bedfellows 
i never would have guessed that i would sleep in the same bed 
that gary hart slept in jim mcgee told an audience at west 
virginia universitys mountainlair student union tuesday 
the school invited the former miami herald reporter to speak

prosecutors said today they will file 
charges against a man who was arrested in december and questioned 
about the 1986 slaying of prime minister olof palme 
after four months of investigation the prosecutors said they 
believe they have compiled enough circumstantial evidence to 
convict christer pettersson 42 in the shooting of palme in 
downtown stockholm however they did not say what charges would be 
filed against pettersson 
assistant prosecutor axel morath asked the stockholm district 
court for 14 more days to prepare the charges it was not clear 
when the trial would begin 
palme was gunned down on feb 28 1986 and his wife lisbet was 
grazed by a second bullet the assailant escaped down a dark alley 
palme was a controversial fourterm prime minister and champion 
of third world liberation movements and an international 
disarmament activist 
the prosecutors said in a statement today that the evidence 
against the suspect has been strengthened during the time he has 
been detained the communique said the evidence is judged to be 
so strong that the prosecutors have decided charges should be filed 
and the case should be tested in court 
more time is needed to conclude the investigation the 
statement said 
swedish newspapers say pettersson has a long criminal record and 
a history of violent behavior accompanied by drug and alcohol 
abuse investigators reportedly believe he acted alone but have not 
disclosed any motive

the government has begun contempt of court 
proceedings against three newspapers for printing excerpts of 
spycatcher the bestselling book by former british 
intelligence officer peter wright 
in hearings that began tuesday in the high court government 
attorney john laws described the 74yearold wright as a 
disgraced and discredited former member of the british security 
services who owed britain a lifelong duty of confidentiality 
wright now retired lives in australia 
laws accused the independent the sunday times and the 
nowdefunct news on sunday of committing a grave contempt of 
court for publishing the excerpts in 1987 
temporary injunctions granted by the high court at the request 
of the government in 1987 had banned british newspapers from 
publishing excerpts from the book but no longer are enforced 
if found to have been in contempt of court the newspapers can 
be fined or at worst their editors jailed the extent of the 
fine or jail term is at the discretion of the judge 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has failed to 
suppress the book in three years of court fights in london 
australia hong kong and elsewhere 
the government unsuccessfully argued that wright once a senior 
officer with britains counterespionage agency mi5 violated a 
pledge by british intelligence officers never to reveal details of 
their secret work 
spycatcher published in 40 countries including the united 
states became a best seller despite government attempts to quash 
its publication 
british authorities made no attempt to stop the book being 
brought into britain but temporary injunctions banned british news 
media from publishing extracts readily available in newspapers 
abroad 
after several court hearings the law lords britains highest 
court last october rejected the governments request to make the 
interim injunctions permanent 
the law lords charged wright with violating his secrecy oath but 
lifted the temporary injunctions saying any damage to british 
security already had been caused by the books publication abroad 
nevertheless spycatcher effectively has been banned in britain 
as publishers will not publish it for fear of being prosecuted 
under the official secrets act 
in a statement tuesday the independent editor andreas whittam 
smith said he decided it was in the public interest to publish 
wrights allegations of treason in mi5 
spycatcher alleges the late mi5 chief sir roger hollis was a 
soviet agent a claim the government says never was substantiated 
the book also claims mi5 officers eavesdropped on foreign 
embassies bungled operations stole documents plotted to 
assassinate egyptian president gamal abdel nasser and plotted to 
destabilize harold wilsons labor party government

attorneys are seeking the release of a 
man whom state officials now agree didnt get a fair trial when he 
was convicted in the poisoning deaths of his seven children 
james j richardson 53 was sentenced to die in the electric 
chair after his 1968 trial his sentence was commuted to life in 
prison after the us supreme court struck down the death penalty 
in 1972 
last fall newspaper reports claimed that prosecutors withheld 
evidence from defense attorneys richardsons advocates say 
prosecutors framed him and suggest desoto county officials 
protected a more likely suspect the childrens babysitter 
after months of investigation this year a special prosecutor 
appointed by gov bob martinez confirmed evidence was withheld and 
attorney general bob butterworth concluded richardson received an 
unfair trial 
chief justice raymond ehrlich of the florida supreme court said 
he intends to appoint a special judge to reconsider richardsons 
conviction 
in the meantime richardsons attorney ellis rubin said 
tuesday that he has asked that richardson be released from prison 
and he predicted richardson could be out this week 
a clemency hearing had been scheduled for thursday but the 
governor postponed it after his special prosecutor concluded 
evidence was withheld 
he butterworth thinks theres an injustice hes going to 
want to see that guy out yesterday said jim york the attorney 
generals chief deputy the constitution doesnt require that 
every trial be perfect but it sure requires that it be fair 
richardson is serving his sentence at the tomoka correctional 
institution near daytona beach he is eligible for parole in 1993 
once an illiterate and indigent migrant worker richardson 
educated himself while behind bars and earned the respect of 
corrections officials by compiling an immaculate disciplinary 
record 
he was convicted of only one count of firstdegree murder for 
the death of his eldest child 8yearold stepdaughter betty jean 
bryant she and her six siblings the youngest 2 years old died 
oct 2526 1967 
on oct 25 they had eaten a lunch of rice beans hogshead 
cheese and grits that was laced with the pesticide parathion 
the food had been prepared ahead of time and served at noontime 
by their neighbor betsy reese while richardson and his wife 
annie mae richardson were miles away picking oranges 
among questions now raised about the prosecution was the 
contention that richardson had purchased life insurance policies 
covering the children 
jurors werent told that although richardson intended to buy the 
policies he hadnt made the first premium payment and the policies 
hadnt taken effect when the children were killed 
in 1970 attorney mark lane published a book called arcadia 
in which he concluded richardson had been railroaded but nothing 
came of it the family lived in a arcadia about 35 miles east of 
sarasota 
then last fall rubin and lane contended the nowsenile baby 
sitter confessed to the killings 
a spokesman for frank schaub who prosecuted richardson 
contends there was no wrongdoing and that if retried today 
richardson would be convicted 
i dont agree that any evidence was withheld from the 
defense said the spokesman sarasota attorney larry byrd 
schaub has filed a multimilliondollar lawsuit against rubin and 
lane charging that they defamed him by suggesting last fall that 
he should be tried on an attempted murder charge because richardson 
once faced death in the electric chair

vietnam announced today it will 
withdraw all its troops from cambodia by sept 30 ending a 10year 
occupation and conflict with resistance forces 
vietnam previously had said it would withdraw its troops 
estimated at 70000 by 1990 and would be out by september only if 
a political settlement were reached 
todays announcement made simultaneously at news conferences in 
phnom penh hanoi and laos gave no indication conditions were 
attached to the september pullout 
it appeared aimed at removing a major obstacle to peace talks 
it could also enhance vietnams efforts to improve relations with 
its noncommunist neighbors in southeast asia who have been 
involved in a major effort to remove vietnamese forces from 
cambodia and restore peace to the country 
however cambodia would reserve the right to ask for foreign 
assistance if antigovernment guerrillas threatened the 
vietnamesebacked administration 
vietnam will withdraw from kampuchea cambodia all of her 
forces by the end of september 1989 said a statement read to 
reporters by cambodian prime minister hun sen 
he gave no timetable for the pullout 
from now until september time is very short he said 
therefore the problem of withdrawal by phase or territory is not 
of any importance now what is important is that there will be no 
more vietnamese troops 
the total withdrawal of vietnamese forces and the cessation of 
all foreign interference and all military aid will put an end to 
the civil war and stimulate the kampuchean parties to settle the 
internal aspects of the kampuchean question before september 1989 
on the basis of national reconciliation hun sen said 
he said he would meet with prince norodom sihanouk leader of 
the threemember cambodian resistance alliance in jakarta 
indonesia on may 2 in a new effort to resolve the problem of 
kampuchea 
but he rejected the princes demand the vietnamesebacked 
government be dissolved prior to a general election only the 
kampuchean people have the right to dismantle he said the 
other side has nothing and they want everything 
in a statement released by sihanouks bangkok office the prince 
said the withdrawal should be monitored by the united nations and 
not be controlled by countries chosen unilaterally by vietnam 
he said china would end its support for the resistance when 
the united nations has verified the reality of this withdrawal 
which has been barely credible so far 
hun sens statement said canada poland indonesia and india 
were invited to jointly monitor the pullout in coordination with a 
representative of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
japans kyodo news service reported that foreign minister nguyen 
co thach of vietnam confirmed the pullout during a hanoi news 
conference 
in bangkok thai foreign minister siddhi savestila told 
reporters he was informed of the vietnamese decision today during a 
meeting with hanois ambassador in thailand le mai 
siddhi said the vietnamese envoy urged all other countries to 
refrain from supporting resistance groups seeking to topple the hun 
sen government 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and ousted the 
government of the communist khmer rouge under which an estimated 
onefourth of the countrys 8 million people died from famine and 
execution 
as of august vietnamese had about 140000 troops in cambodia 
but vietnam began withdrawing troops last year and an estimated 
70000 remain 
siddhi said the vietnamese ambassador told him there were 50000 
troops left in cambodia 
fear that the khmer rouge the strongest force in a resistance 
coalition might return to power has been a major hurdle in 
negotiations on a postoccupation coalition government for cambodia 
the resistance is led by prince sihanouk the former cambodian 
ruler it includes the noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front 
officials of the vietnameseinstalled cambodian government had 
urged an earlier withdrawal target provided neighboring thailand 
denied the guerrillas sanctuary and other countries stopped arming 
the resistance groups 
thailand denies providing sanctuary to the guerrillas but armed 
groups move in and out of cambodia from refugee camps along the 
border china arms the guerrillas while the soviets support 
vietnamese forces

one of president bushs first nominees for the 
judicial bench is coming under heavy fire on capitol hill with 
sen alan cranston urging his defeat over membership in a san 
francisco club that excludes women 
i urge that the nomination of vaughn walker not be approved 
cranston said tuesday in a letter to senate judiciary chairman 
joseph biden ddel 
cranstons action represented a sharp setback for walker a san 
francisco attorney since negative recommendations from homestate 
senators have in some cases proven fatal to candidates for the 
federal judiciary 
there was no certainty however that cranstons recommendation 
would wreck the chances of walker a reagan judicial pick whose 
nomination was still pending when congress adjourned last fall 
walker was among five reagan judicial nominees who were stranded 
when lawmakers adjourned and whose names have now been resubmitted 
to the senate by bush for confirmation he was nominated to us 
district court in san francisco 
cranston took aim at walkers membership in san franciscos 
olympic club which until recently barred blacks from membership 
and still excludes women one of its best known members was supreme 
court justice anthony kennedy but he resigned a month before his 
1987 confirmation hearings 
cranston said kennedys stand stood in stark contrast to 
walkers attitude toward the club walker himself was not reached 
for comment his office said he was busy in court 
i have reached the conclusion that his actions with respect to 
his membership in a discriminatory club are disqualifying 
cranston said 
learning of cranstons action an aide to californias other 
senator pete wilson rcalif long a champion of walkers cause 
said the attorney had resigned from the club a month ago 
he said he wanted to enact reforms internally and if he were 
unsuccessful in gaining the changes he wanted then he would resign 
from the club press secretary bill livingston said 
cranston press secretary murray flander retorted that nobody 
on the judiciary committee has been told that and even if true it 
wouldnt change alans mind because he was just too slow 
in his letter cranston said walkers persistent refusal to 
terminate his membership in this club and his testimony regarding 
this issue demonstrate an attitude and an insensitivity which 
is unacceptable for a member of the federal judiciary 
he cited canon 2 of the american bar association code of 
judicial conduct which holds that it is inappropriate for a 
judge to hold membership in any organization that practices 
invidious discrimination on the basis of race sex religion or 
national origin 
the senator quoted walker testimony june 13 before the judiciary 
committee that in the past there had been no formal exclusion of 
blacks or indeed any other racial minorities 
he said this was contradicted by an aug 8 letter to the 
judiciary committee in which george riley a special assistant to 
the san francisco city attorney said the clubs bylaws 
restricted membership to only white male citizens of the united 
states of good moral character integrity and reputation the 
policy was challenged in 1967 by community groups and the club 
dropped the ban against minorities a year later 
cranston said walker told the panel the club had made 
substantial change in regard to this policy when according to 
riley the club had announced that it had admitted two black men 
into its membership of more than 4700 members 
the judiciary committee received a june 30 press release issued 
by the club describing certain procedures as designed to avoid 
coverage under a san francisco ordinance barring discrimination 
cranston said 
he quoted the press release as saying the club acted to defend 
the fundamental rights of its members against the strong arm of 
political oppression 
such action cranston said was wholly inconsistent with mr 
walkers characterization of an organization voluntarily moving 
toward compliance with basic civil rights principles the senator 
also criticized a statement that a vote to drop a bar against women 
members was very close when in fact it was 1540 to 2082

the armed forces radio restricted broadcasts of 
a newly released israeli pop song about the palestinian uprising 
saying the subject is sensitive an army official said today 
the song the flood is behind us written and sung by nurit 
galron implies that israelis in coastal tel aviv show indifference 
toward arab suffering in the 16month rebellion in the occupied 
territories 
the military station played the song several times before 
station commander nahman shai ordered that it be played only with 
his consent two israeli dailies hadashot and maariv said 
it is an unusual step but we are a military framework and 
some consider this sensitive because it discusses the uprising 
said an official in shais office who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
hadashot said shai criticized the song as a glorification of 
the subject with lines that are hard to accept 
part of the songs lyrics are 
there is a country of stones and firebombs 
and there is a tel aviv on fire with nightclubs and lewdness 
there is a country of rebels where the wounded are being 
bandaged 
and there is a tel aviv that makes merry with food and drink 
no dont tell me about a little girl who lost an eye 
it only makes me feel bad 
i dont feel like hearing about people oppressed or tortured 
i dont care what is happening in the territories 
we will make love and live our lives tel aviv is life 
last year israeli radio stations restricted broadcast of 
another protest song about israels handling of the uprising called 
shooting and crying by rock star cy hyman 
the uprising which began dec 8 1987 has claimed the lives of 
419 palestinians in the territories as well as 18 israelis

change in china is not simply a matter of saying a few empty 
words

president bush is weighing the possibility of 
asking congress to approve a 25 percent pay raise for federal 
judges a senior administration official said today 
this official discussing bushs options on grounds he not be 
named publicly also said however that no final decision memo 
has reached the presidents desk 
bush had said last week that he intends to make very specific 
proposals on pay increases for top federal officials even though 
congress two months ago rejected a proposal that would have given 
lawmakers a 50 percent pay raise this proposal advanced by the 
commission on legislative executive and judicial salaries also 
would have included substantial hikes for the judiciary and 
approximately 7000 top executives 
the bush administration official said today that among other 
options still under consideration at the white house is a series of 
pay hikes for certain categories of federal officials rather than 
a single acrosstheboard raise for these officials 
the washington post initially reported in its wednesday editions 
that bush would propose a 25 per pay hike for the judges most 
federal judges now make 89500 per year the same salary as 
members of congress and top federal officials 
one administration source said that bush had not yet settled on 
a figure but another official noted that a commission studying 
public service jobs in the federal government had recommended a 25 
percent pay raise and that that figure was the one being focused 
on by the white house the commission headed by former federal 
reserve chairman paul volcker made its report public late last 
month 
bushs plan is expected to be announced next week white house 
officials have said and presidential advisers were said today to 
be discussing which federal officials to peg for raises in addition 
to the federal judges 
the president also is preparing a package of ethics legislation 
and the administration hasnt decided whether to tie the two issues 
together 
the 50 percent hike was voted down by congress in february after 
a rising tide of public opposition to the pay hike

a black police officer has filed a lawsuit 
against three fellow officers and the city of oakland saying the 
officers hit him with their car and beat him before recognizing him 
as an undercover colleague 
derrick norfleet then 25 and a police officer for two years 
said he had just finished making an undercover drug purchase in 
july when he was chased hit by a patrol car and kicked and beaten 
while he lay face down the beating stopped only after he rolled 
over and the officers saw his face he said 
mr norfleet appears to have been assaulted for no other 
reason than that he appeared to be just another black person who 
may or may not have committed some criminal offense said his 
lawyer john burris 
he said the officers who attacked his client were two whites and 
an asian 
police chief george hart and city lawyers did not return 
telephone calls about the case the city denied norfleets 
administrative claim for damages in december 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court seeks at 
least 500000 in damages against the city for emotional distress 
and another 1 million in punitive damages against the three 
officers it comes a day after criminal charges were filed against 
two long beach police officers in an incident in which a black 
police officer posing as a motorist was shoved through a window 
norfleets lawsuit said he was on an assignment to buy drugs 
undercover and provide information to uniformed officers who would 
arrest the sellers he said he had made his purchase at a home and 
was walking through a park when he realized he was being pursued by 
a car occupied by the uniformed officers 
thinking a simulated arrest was about to take place 
norfleet first started to run away but then stopped and stood with 
his hands in the air and his back to the car the lawsuit said 
he said the car sped up and hit him from behind sending him 
over the hood and onto the ground as he lay face down he said 
three officers got out and struck him with their fists feet and a 
flashlight he then rolled over and the three on the same 
narcotics assignment as norfleet recognized him the lawsuit said 
even if he had been a criminal no conduct that he engaged in 
was provocative or aggressive burris said 
burris said norfleet suffered mainly bumps and bruises and was 
on disability leave for a short period before returning to the 
police force where he still works the most serious effects were 
psychological the lawyer said the result of a horrible 
nightmarish experience which he has relived often 
the suit accuses the three officers of a racially motivated 
misuse of government power it says the city and its police 
department had an informal custom or policy of condoning and 
encouraging the use of excessive force and the infliction of 
summary corporal punishment against black citizens

a lawyer who observed the inquest into the 
shooting of three unarmed ira members in gibraltar last year says 
the inquiry was flawed fell short of international legal standards 
and raised doubt about the legality of the killings 
the inquest raised serious doubt as to whether uk law on the 
use of force meets international standards hilary kitchin wrote 
in her report released today it urged another inquiry into the 
march 6 1988 deaths of mairead farrell daniel mccann and sean 
savage who were shot in gibraltar by british antiterrorist 
operatives 
the government alleged they were plotting a car bombing in the 
british colony on the southern tip of spain and the irish 
republican army acknowledged the three were on an active 
service mission 
it was later revealed contrary to initial government accounts 
that the three were unarmed and that no car bomb was found 
amnesty international and other human rights groups then called 
for an independent inquiry into whether lethal force was necessary 
the 19day inquest in september ruled 92 the killings were 
lawful 
ms kitchin sent to the inquest as an observer by britains 
national council for civil liberties and the new yorkbased 
international league for human rights said the hearing left some 
questions unanswered she called for a judicial inquiry with wider 
powers than the gibraltar coroners 
the government had no comment on ms kitchins report 
reiterating that it stood by the initial verdict 
ms kitchen said coroner felix pizzarello should have questioned 
witnesses more fully and that the government lawyer responsible 
for representing the public interest was in fact representing 
parties with a definite interest in the outcome 
it noted there were contradictory reports of spanishbritish 
cooperation in tracking the trios movements before they entered 
gibraltar 
british authorities told the inquest there was no such 
surveillance 
it is a matter of serious concern that the contradictory 
spanish accounts were excluded from consideration at the 
inquest ms kitchin wrote 
she said no testimony was taken from witnesses who might have 
shed light on a controversial description of a man shooting savage 
and then pumping bullets into him as he lay on the ground 
kenneth asquez a gibraltar bank clerk gave that account to a 
television crew but retracted it at the inquest with an 
unsatisfactory explanation the report said 
normal police procedures were forgotten at the scene of the 
shootings ms kitchin wrote spent cartridges werent marked 
the bodies werent photographed where they lay and the 
postmortems were flawed her report said 
the coroner failed to use his power to disqualify jurors who 
might be biased through being employed by or related to members of 
the armed forces the lawyer wrote 
the coroner also misdirected the jury into thinking its only 
choice was between ruling the killings lawful or unlawful she 
said and the jury may have felt under pressure to reach a 
speedy verdict when it was told less than six hours after 
retiring that time was running out

a nurse who thought she was a millionaire for 
five seconds before the california lottery reduced her fortune to 
10000 has won her 3 million back and then some 
a superior court jury ruled tuesday that doris barnett was 
entitled to the larger payoff plus 400000 in damages 
deputy attorney general norman peek representing the state 
lottery said the verdict probably would be appealed 
ms barnett won the right to appear on california lotterys big 
spin on dec 30 1985 in the contest players spin a wheel watch 
a ball bounce around and fall into a slot labeled with a sum of 
money the lowest amount that can be won is 10000 
when ms barnett spun the wheel the ball fell into the 3 
million hole and show host geoff edwards proclaimed her a 
multimilliondollar winner 
then the ball slipped out of the hole and into a 10000 slot 
the lottery awarded ms barnett the lesser amount contending the 
ball failed to stay in the 3 million slot for five seconds as 
required under lottery law 
in closing arguments last week ms barnetts attorney lawrence 
sperber argued that the fivesecond rule was superseded when 
edwards declared her a winner 
if theyre not going to wait five seconds then they cant 
come into this courtroom today and say to you that she had to wait 
five seconds he asked 
peek argued that edwards was mistaken when he made the early 
announcement he said ms barnett was aware of the fivesecond rule 
she agreed when she bought her ticket to abide by the rules 
all of them he said i think ms barnett is asking for you to 
make an exception for her 
it feels so wonderful ms barnett 54 said after the 
verdict was announced im going to take care of my mother and 
take care of my children i want to send my kids to school to get 
them some of the opportunities i didnt have

mikhail s gorbachev responding to 
longstanding us concerns about moscows intentions in latin 
america says the kremlin will refrain from putting military bases 
or nuclear weapons in the region 
with president fidel castro sitting nearby the soviet leader 
said in a speech to the national assembly on tuesday that moscow 
supports the creation of a zone of peace in latin america and 
an end to all outside military aid to the region 
gorbachevs comments were made during his first diplomatic trip 
to latin america and seemed directed largely at washington whose 
hemispheric policy for years has been based on concerns about 
soviet influence in the region 
tens of thousands of cubans lined the streets this morning to 
bid farewell to gorbachev as he headed for the airport for a trip 
to london 
about 700 buses were mobilized for the occasion and many people 
waited more than three hours for a final glimpse of the soviet 
leader workers were given time off to take part in the departure 
activities 
gorbachev left at midmorning following a hectic day tuesday 
highlighted by his late afternoon speech 
it was a day for sightseeing by gorbachev at local points of 
interest and also a day in which dissident sources reported the 
arrest of seven people who had planned to lead a progorbachev 
demonstration at the soviet embassy 
the planned demonstration canceled after the arrests intended 
to seek gorbachevs support for liberalizing moves in cuba similar 
to the ones he is carrying out in the soviet union 
castro introduced gorbachev to the national assembly delivering 
a fiery 50minute address in which he blasted us policies across 
the board particularly washingtons support for anticommunist 
insurgencies 
he criticized western reporters for saying gorbachevs reforms 
have produced a rift between the two 
castro pointed out that the two countries have immense cultural 
economic and historical differences and it is only natural that 
they would follow different ideological paths 
still castro has indicated in the past that he was troubled 
that gorbachev would embrace some aspects of capitalism as part of 
his sweeping policy shifts 
at a news conference after his speech gorbachev also dismissed 
as inventions western media portrayals of him and castro 
almost as enemies 
as proof of the durability of the sovietcuban alliance 
gorbachev and castro signed a 25year treaty of friendship and 
cooperation on tuesday 
gorbachev did lend credence in his speech to widely reported 
soviet unhappiness with cuban use of soviet economic aid estimated 
at 5 billion annually economic ties between the countries he 
said should be made more dynamic more efficient and mutually 
productive 
he called for stricter accountablity and more discipline to 
ensure timely and proper compliance with obligations mutually 
assumed the remarks were interpreted as soviet displeasure over 
protracted delays in development projects to which moscow has 
contributed 
on hemispheric issues gorbachev insisted that his country has 
limited ambitions the soviet union he said does not seek for 
itself political strategic or military advantage in the western 
hemisphere 
we consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be an 
arena for eastwest confrontation 
he said the soviet union favors strengthening the existing 
nonnuclear status of latin america and proposed establishing a 
zone of peace in the region 
gorbachev said his country does not have any intention of 
having in latin america naval air or missile bases or to place 
there nuclear or other weapons of mass extermination a clear 
allusion to the kremlins placing of nuclear missiles in cuba in 
1962 that were withdrawn under us pressure 
the soviet leader said both his country and cuba oppose the 
export of revolution or counterrevolution and all forms of foreign 
interference in the affairs of sovereign nations 
but he said soviet military aid to nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government would continue as long as us military 
assistance to other central american countries continues 
according to us estimates the soviets shipped more than 500 
million in military equipment last year to the sandinistas 
the bush and reagan administrations have shown no interest in 
gorbachevs appeal for a ban on all military aid to central 
america calling it unbalanced 
for its part washington has sent about 35 billion in aid this 
decade to el salvadors government which is fighting a leftist 
insurgency as well as supported the contra rebels in their fight 
against the sandinstas 
gorbachevs criticism of the united states was far more muted 
than castros 
when an american reporter invited gorbachev to attack the bush 
administrations military spending policies as indicating a lack of 
interest in arms control gorbachev ticked off the long list of 
disarmament negotiations under way leaving the impression that he 
had faith in american goodwill 
castro in contrast assailed us policies on third world debt 
afghanistan and cuba itself among other issues

propaganda afghanistans request that the un security council 
hold an emergency meeting to discuss the afghan war 
in a letter requesting the meeting afghanistan alleged that 
pakistani support for moslem guerrillas threatened to create a 
serious regional conflict 
a pakistan foreign ministry official speaking on condition of

government allegations that it has troops fighting alongside the 
guerrillas

trying to draw the 15nation security council into what is now an 
internal conflict 
pakistans official news agency app said pakistans un 
ambassador s shah nawaz told security council chief aleksander 
belongov of the soviet union the situation does not warrant a 
council meeting because it poses no threat to regional peace and 
security it is an internal matter for the afghans to settle 
themselves he was quoted as saying 
also today afghanistan announced it was putting two pakistani 
nationals on trial for allegedly spying official afghan media said 
the two were captured inside afghanistan more than three weeks ago

reporters in kabul both men confessed an espionage conviction

the house ethics committee resumed 
deliberations today in the case of speaker jim wright 
concentrating on whether wright improperly accepted gifts from a 
business partner and whether he evaded limits on outside income 
through sales of a book he published according to sources 
the committee is considering whether benefits wright received 
from fort worth developer george mallick roughly valued in the 
range of 100000 amount to unreported gifts intended to buy 
influence over legislation affecting the savings and loan industry 
a key to that question as the panel resumed closeddoor 
discussions after a twoweek easter break was whether mallick had 
a direct interest in legislation dealing with sampls when he paid the 
benefits to wright and his wife betty 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said he expected the 
panel could reach some conclusion on the wright case next week 
were making progress and im satisfied with our progress 
dixon said 
a democratic house source confirmed today that the panel already 
has decided to drop three of the six counts against wright brought 
last june when the investigation began 
those include wrights intervention with federal banking 
regulators on behalf of troubled savings and loans his 
intercession with government officials on behalf of a texas oil and 
gas company and his use of a governmentpaid staff aide to compile 
parts of a book 
remaining before the panel are charges that wright used bulk 
sales of the book reflections of a public man to evade limits 
on outside income from speaking fees and the issues arising out of 
wrights dealings with mallick 
mallick wright and their wives were partners in a small 
investment corporation mallightco from 1979 until last year 
during that time mallick gave wright the use of a fort worth 
condominium for only a nominal fee the use of a 1979 cadillac and 
until 1984 paid wrights wife betty 18000 a year in salary for 
parttime investment advice 
sources familiar with the investigation have said the panels 
outside counsel richard phelan has been highly skeptical of the 
benefits that went from mallick to wright and doubted whether mrs 
wright had done any substantial work in return for her salary 
it was unclear whether the ethics committee six democrats and 
six republicans agrees with phelans assessment 
the standard that is to be applied to the wrightmallick 
relationship is obviously one that has to be discussed dixon 
said 
further complicating the situation is a 22 million loan made 
in 1985 to mallicks sons stephen and michael and cosigned by 
their father to develop a small shopping center 
the loan first reported on tuesday by the wall street journal 
has since been foreclosed and the mallicks are being sued for 1 
million in losses suffered by the lender interwest savings 
association which later was taken over by regulators mallick 
testified in a deposition in the case last may that he knew the 
loan was going bad early in 1986 and blamed the problem in part on 
pressure on sampls by federal regulators 
many of the institutions were under the supervision of the 
regulators mallick said in the deposition they werent able 
to be flexible with their borrowers in order to maneuver and work 
things out 
mallick organized a meeting later in 1986 at which area 
developers and lenders complained to wright about the 
heavyhandedness of regulators and he prepared a report on the 
subject at wrights request 
at the time wright was lobbying savings industry regulators on 
behalf of some texas institutions and later approached house 
colleagues to argue for requiring that regulators be more lenient 
with troubled sampls 
wright has maintained he is innocent of the charges against him 
since the probe was opened last june and strongly denied on 
tuesday that mallick has ever asked him for favors 
he has never asked me for any official assistance in any way 
shape or form wright said he said that many other texas 
lawmakers of both parties had favored the same legislation because 
of their states depressed economy 
but in recent weeks wright has made his denials less 
categorical admitting he may have made mistakes in judgment and 
on tuesday wright spokesman mark johnson added a new refinement 
saying if there were any rules violations they were technical 
and unintentional 
on tuesday some ethics committee members took new depositions 
from mallick and from richard swann chairman of the pioneer 
savings bank in orlando fla questioning in those sessions focused 
on an investment mallick and wright made in winderwood a 
housing development undertaken by swann and others beginning in 
1985 wright made roughly 50000 on the deal 
were finetuning what we already knew said committee 
member john t myers rind 
the ethics committee has been investigating wrights finances 
since last june and has spent some 1 million on phelans work

despite the striking election defeat of many top 
communists soviet voters chose party members for 88 percent of the 
parliament seats that have been filled so far the communist party 
daily pravda reported today 
about 80 percent of candidates running in the soviet unions 
first multicandidate elections in seven decades were communist 
party members they were running for the countrys new 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies 
pravda citing official results released tuesday said voters in 
one out of every eight soviet parliamentary districts on march 26 
refused to elect anyone even though they had a choice of only one 
or two candidates 
that means that in 195 of the 1500 geographical districts 
across the country and in three others in which less than 50 
percent of the electorate voted new campaigns will start for a 
second election to be held may 14 
the official news agency tass said runoff elections will be held 
in 76 other districts on sunday for seats in which the vote was so 
split among three or more candidates that no one received a 
majority 
party officials and partydominated bodies selected the 
remaining 750 members to the new congress which will choose a new 
supreme soviet the policymaking body 
across the country 898 percent of the voters took part in the 
election orlov told tass adding 
that high degree of activity gladdens us more than the 
notorious 999 percent participation which we were proud of 
earlier in this election there was no race for percentage of 
participation the previous mandatory measures practiced previously 
were fully excluded 
the soviet union in the past proclaimed an almost total 
participation in elections as proof of citizens satisfaction even 
though voters were not offered a choice

city officials today put up an 
antifascist memorial in front of the house where adolf hitler was 
born the installation came just two weeks before the 100th 
anniversary of his birth 
mayor gerhard skiba ordered the block made from granite 
quarried at a former nazi death camp to be put on public property 
outside the house which is now a school for retarded children 
city spokesman johann dax said the memorial is to help to 
express the opinion of the city of braunau as a rebuttal to the 
often onesided sensational reporting on this city 
he said it was put up without ceremony or incidents 
dax said he has no knowledge of nazi demonstrations planned for 
april 20 hitlers 100th birthday but police were said to be 
taking every possible precaution to avoid disturbances 
they approved an april 20 antifascist demonstration by 
university students but all other rallies are banned 
occasional clashes between neonazi activists and police have 
broken out near the hitler house and the idea to place a plaque 
was prompted by officials desire to improve the citys image 
city officials have long been worried by the flow of tourists 
getting photographed in front of the house 
the memorial is made of granite from the quarry of the 
mauthausen concentration camp where tens of thousands of jews 
gypsies and others died under the nazi dictator it measures 46 by

a 14yearold soviet chess whiz who defected last 
week in new york is the victim of exploitation by his moneyhungry 
father a soviet chess official was quoted today as saying 
gata kamsky is destined to become a robot for earning dollars 
and his father has consciously agreed to that alexander roshal 
editor of the soviet chess journal 64chess review told the 
newspaper sovietsky sport 
a friend of the kamsky family chess champion lev alburt said 
in new york last week that the boy defected with his father because 
he wanted the freedom to make choices about his chess career and 
his personal future alburt is a soviet grand master who defected 
10 years ago 
roshal maintained that the kamsky family had been very well 
treated by the soviet chess establishment and it called their 
defection a case of the blackest ingratitude 
roshal told sovietsky sport that kamsky had played in five 
masters tournaments over the last year placing average or lower in 
all of them he defected during the new york open tournament at 
which he was the youngest member of the soviet delegation 
roshal accused kamskys father rustem of pressuring his son so 
heavily that the boys performance suffered 
acting as coach and manager of his son he demanded results 
from gata whatever the cost without stopping short of beating him 
according to many accounts roshal was quoted as saying 
asked if he thought kamsky had turned from a caring daddy 
into a greedy exploiter roshal said it looks that way 
gata kamsky has been called the soviet unions leading young 
chess player world champion garry kasparov and other experts have 
predicted kamsky will reach the highest echelons of chess play 
other top soviet chess players who defected include former world 
championship finalist victor korchnoi who now plays for 
switzerland and international master igor ivanov now canadas 
secondranked player

carlsbad nm currentargus on the alaska oil spill 
with 10 million gallons of crude oil threatening wildlife and 
fouling the pristine beauty of alaskas prince william sound the 
oil industrys repeated assurances that it can protect the 
environment assume a particularly hollow ring 
in washington the repercussions of the oil spill will be felt 
for months as environmentalists fight to keep oil developers 
out of the arctic national wildlife refuge 
president bush favors exploratory drilling in the refuge if 
it can be done without harming the environment 
it is estimated that the coastal strip could produce as much as 
32 billion barrels of oil and keep the alaska pipeline working at 
full spate long after the north slope oilfields have been exhausted 
if congress is to approve such development however the oil 
industry must demonstrate renewed dedication to legitimate 
environmental concerns

el paso texas heraldpost on drug testing for transportation 
personnel 
the coast guard says that capt joseph hazelwood skipper of the 
illfated exxon valdez which spilled some 262000 barrels of oil 
into alaskas prince william sound had a blood test morethan 10 
hours after his supertanker ran aground and showed a bloodalcohol 
level far higher than allowed for ship operators 
that fact alone should silence american civil liberties union 
zealots and organized labor leaders who vociferously oppose random 
drug testing of personnel engaged in transportation 
the way to weed out drug and alcohol abusers from sensitive 
airline shipping rail bus and trucking jobs is to test them 
before and not only after they cause terrible accidents

of providing american secrets to the israelis according to a 
report in this weeks newsweek magazine israel is putting 5000 a 
month in an israeli bank account for pollard who is serving a life 
sentence in an illinois federal prison the scenario is that 
pollard eventually will be deported to israel where the money will 
be waiting for him

mcpherson kan sentinel on the bush administrations slow 
start 
in office less than three months the bush administration has 
been criticized for getting off to a slow start 
in part of course that may be attributed to the time required 
for presidential appointments in the face of a congress that seems 
intent on casting aspersion on the administration by innuendo 
even without that however it appears the only person in charge 
of any policymaking is secretary of state james baker 
that leaves a huge void in matters relating to the domestic 
economy which is perhaps this countrys most pressing need 
the reagan administration was successful because it had its 
policies clearly defined 
the bush administration needs to do the same before all of the 
bureaucrats have taken firm control it should make its first 
priority domestic policy

the orange county calif register on raising federal salaries 
read our lips no pay raise for congressmen and government 
bosses so americans resoundingly insisted last month 
radio talk shows lit up the airwaves with attacks on the 
proposal by a presidential commission to raise pay 51 
percent 
even though congress had rigged the system so the raise would 
become automatic public rage forced the members to rescind it 
but last week another panel the national commision on public 
service called for the same thing a 50 percent pay raise for our 
allegedly impoverished servants in washington 
presumably one might pay the current bureaucrats more to attract 
better people to the job in the future 
but as the failed nomination of john tower as defense secretary 
shows people are willing to go to absurd lengths to get these 
lowpaying jobs

the duluth minn newstribune on raising federal salaries 
it might have some sugar coating this time around but the 
new pay proposal for members of congress us judges and other 
top federal officials has a strange familiarity to it 
last week the national commission on public service a private 
body looking into federal pay recommended to president bush that 
top officials judges and congress get a pay raise nearly as large 
as the one congress killed in february 
this one would be spoonfed to the public by giving the 
honorables 25 percent the first year and the rest in early 1991 
it is better than the earlier version because if adopted 
intact it would forbid senators and representatives from accepting 
honoraria for speechifying a means many use to swell their 
current income well into the sixfigure category 
president bush is pondering the new recommendations he should 
ponder for a long time and then come up with a pay plan more in 
line with prudent spending how about a couple of 10 percent jumps 
still greater than most americans got last year and then 
another look

the daily journal elizabeth nj on polling places closing 
time 
broadcast networks relied on exit polling to project winners in 
states where the polls were still open at the time of the broadcast 
such projections kept people away from polls because they were 
being told how their candidate fared before they had a chance to 
exercise their own voting franchise 
legislation would set the national poll closing time at 9 
pm eastern standard time 
there is a competing bill that would mandate the closing of 
polls at 7 pm on the west coast 8 pm in the rockies 9 pm in 
the central states and 10 pm on the east coast 
with either measure the impetus to establish a national closing 
time for polls in presidental years now exists it should be

legacy 
it seems almost incredible that 10 years have flown by since the 
accident at three mile island 
it seems incredible too that this one misfortune bred more by 
gross negligence on the part of the operators than by any inherent 
design faults in the nuclear power plant there should have stopped 
an entire industry dead in its tracks 
historians one day will look back on the incident at three mile 
island and shake their heads in wonder at americas reaction to it 
perhaps then if we are lucky scientists will have harnessed a 
new form of energy clean efficient and safe solar cells nuclear 
fusion or things undreamed of today 
if we are not lucky those who survive may live in a dark and 
desolate world where the sea rolls 40 fathoms deep over 
oncelovely coastal cities and the sun dull red burns in a 
yellow birdless sky

years senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine long has

given these political imperatives it is obvious that this is 
the year an acid rain bill is going to pass congress although coal 
industry officials remain unconvinced that there is any real need 
for such legislation 
proposed legislation which has aroused substantial support has 
resulted from an unlikely coalition rich trumka president of the 
united mine workers and sen mitchell 
their bill calls for having electricity consumers pay a small 
fee of about 75 cents a month to help defray industrys cost of 
installing new scrubbers in order to meet a goal of reducing the

the natchez miss democrat on private school tuition tax 
credits 
president bush took the correct position when he came down on 
the side of public education and said he does not support the idea 
of tuition tax credits for parents of children in private schools 
bushs statement runs counter to the general position taken 
during the reagan administration 
the president is correct in stating that people have the right 
to choose to send their children to a private or parochial school 
however the public school system must be kept strong for the 
good of the entire community it must have the resources to do that 
job 
if those resources were diluted by tuition tax credits for 
parents of private school students it would make an uphill battle 
even more difficult

an aids patient who sued his doctor for 
negligence reached a sixfigure settlement with him today shortly 
before a jury returned with a verdict in favor of the physician 
robert taylor 36 of norfolk had sued dr duane g wombolt a 
kidney specialist alleging that the doctor failed to tell him that 
he had tested positive for antibodies to the aids virus and had 
given him medication that hastened the onset of the fatal disease 
after a weeklong trial a circuit court jury began deliberating 
late tuesday before jurors returned with a verdict this morning 
lawyers reached a settlement that both sides said was in six 
figures 
judge john winston told jurors that a settlement had been 
reached and did not let them announce their verdict 
we had decided for the defendant dr wombolt said one 
juror who asked not to be identified all the facts in the case 
pointed to the fact that he was absolutely reasonable in everything 
he did 
i feel a little cheated in a way said john heilig an 
attorney for wombolt on learning that the verdict would have been 
in his clients favor 
im elated taylor said when asked about the settlement 
taylor who is thin and has facial lesions caused by aids said he 
plans to use the money to travel and for charitable causes 
including perhaps an aids hospice 
heilig said he and wombolt agreed to settle because they were 
concerned that the jury might be hung 
heilig said wombolt admitted to no wrongdoing in his treatment 
of taylor 
he did nothing wrong heilig said 
taylor a former waiter testified last week that he asked 
wombolt in december 1986 whether he might have aids and the doctor 
told him he had no symptoms of the disease 
wombolt said a hospital that tested taylor for aids never told 
him what the test showed so he assumed the test was negative 
taylors physician dr john f warner testified that taylors 
kidneys are functioning close to normal but he will probably die of 
aids within a year

his claim of insanity 
william bryan cruse 61 was convicted on all 32 counts related 
to the april 23 1987 shootings at two palm bay shopping centers 
including charges of firstdegree murder attempted murder and 
kidnapping 
sentencing was set for april 17 the state is seeking the death 
penalty cruse pleaded innocent by reason of temporary insanity 
prosecutors had contended cruse acted out of anger over 
delusions that people in the shopping centers considered him 
homosexual 
final arguments depicted cruse as a madman who should be 
institutionalized or as a calculating killer who deserves to be 
executed 
after shooting at everything that moved outside a publix 
supermarket and later at the winndixie across the street the 
gunman shot up the front windows of the winndixie and stormed in 
shooting wildly as dozens of customers ran out the back 
cruse held a hostage seven hours before releasing her unharmed 
cruse later told police in a videotaped interview that he was 
drunk and crazy during the rampage 
cruse has a history of mental instability and bizarre actions 
dating to the 1970s in his hometown of lexington ky according to 
psychiatrists and defense witnesses he came to florida in 1985 
most of the experts agreed that he has a mental illness 
paranoid schizophrenia but that by itself is not enough to 
constitute legal insanity

bush presented a crystal apple to mrs bicouvaris who on 
tuesday was named national teacher of the year by the council of 
chief state school officers encyclopaedia britannica inc and good 
housekeeping magazine 
earlier she told reporters she intended to thank bush for his 
leadership on education issues 
however she also said that if bush sought her advice she would 
ask him to follow with the action needed to make education truly 
a priority i would like him to put the emphasis on education as 
an investment and not as an expense 
bushs education package already has drawn a mixed reaction on 
capitol hill since administration officials have repeatedly 
declined to say whether they consider the money new spending or if 
the new programs must be offset by other cuts 
in addition an administration document released earlier this 
week recommended 185 million in cuts in the education department 
some lawmakers and lobbyists have complained that bushs 
proposals are frills that would be funded at the expense of proven 
fundamental programs that have not kept pace with inflation 
the bush bills chief sponsors are sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
and rep bill goodling rpa

the government today freed more than 430 
palestinian prisoners as a moslem holiday gesture that also 
coincided with prime minister yitzhak shamirs talks with us 
leaders in washington 
according to army figures 224 detainees were bused to the gaza 
strip and 210 were sent to the west bank 
about two dozen of the detainees knelt on the ground and uttered 
prayers of thanks before being embraced by friends and relatives a 
witness in gaza city said one detainee said he was 12 years old 
israeli authorities said the releases were a gesture on the eve 
of the islamic holy month of ramadan which starts friday 
we wanted by this gesture to deliver a message to the 
palestinians in the territories that we bear in mind your holy 
days defense minister yitzhak rabin told reporters hopefully 
they understand that we would like to see tranquility restored and 
we can do it on the one hand by force on the other hand by 
gestures 
also today soldiers shot and wounded two palestinians in the 
occupied lands arab reports said the army confirmed one wounding 
that of a 13yearold in a stonethrowing clash near the balata 
refugee camp in the west bank 
arab reports also said a 14yearold in gaza city was shot and 
hospitalized in serious condition 
israeli news reports noted that the prisoner releases came as 
shamir headed to washington where he was expected to come under 
pressure from american leaders to take steps that would ease 
tensions in the west bank and gaza strip 
the haaretz newspaper said the decision for the gesture was 
timed so that the prisoners would be freed before shamir met 
president bush 
the prisoners freed were among about 10000 palestinians 
believed held in connection with the nearly 16month uprising 
which has killed at least 419 palestinians and 18 israelis 
those released had either been charged with stonethrowing 
assaults on israelis or were detained without trial as alleged 
inciters of disturbances 
in addition to the releases gazas military governor brig 
gen arieh ramot announced tuesday he had ordered the army to stay 
away from schools and mosques because i know how sensitive 
ramadan is for moslems and we have no intention of killing or 
wounding anyone in the strip 
ramadan the most important holiday for moslems marks the 
period when the prophet mohammed began receiving the koran or 
moslem holy book from god 
more than 80 percent of the 17 million palestinians in the west 
bank and gaza strip are moslems 
other measures taken by the israelis included lifting curfews 
that confined tens of thousands of palestinians to their homes in 
villages and refugee camps 
but five refugee camps in gaza remained under curfew among them 
jabaliya whose more than 50000 residents have been kept indoors 
now for eight consecutive days jabaliya is the camp where the 
uprising started 
the army announced today meanwhile that an israeli naval 
patrol stopped two lebanese boats on their way to cyprus on tuesday 
and detained some palestinian guerrillas who were on board 
bringing them to israel 
the crew and other passengers were allowed to continue their 
trip an army spokesman said he declined to elaborate

the two aides secretary of state james a 
baker iii sent to moscow to inspect the us embassy in the soviet 
capital have recommended that part of the chancery be salvaged a 
bush administration official said wednesday 
their recommendation is to dismantle the top floors which are 
believed to be riddled with eavesdropping devices and to replace 
them with bugfree floors or an adjoining annex said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the inspection was conducted two weeks ago by nicholas m salgo 
a former us ambassador to hungary and ivan selin who is to be 
undersecretary of state for management 
they told baker on their return that refurbishing the building 
or even constructing an annex would be cheaper than razing the 
chancery and starting over the estimated cost of tearing down and 
rebuilding is 500 million 
the official said baker would take into consideration the views 
of key members of congress rep neal smith diowa chairman of a 
house appropriations subcommittee last month opposed spending the 
500 million others on capitol hill are inclined to agree with the 
conclusion last year of a washington area engineering firm that 
starting over was the only way to make the chancery secure 
a trade group headed by dwayne o andreas chairman of archer 
daniels midland co offered to buy the building for use as 
business offices 
andreas is cochairman of the usussr trade and economic 
council which promotes trade between the two superpowers he made 
the offer on behalf of a consortium of us companies which would 
use the building as a moscow headquarters 
the soviets would have to approve any sale because the building 
was intended for use as a new embassy built under a 1972 agreement 
between the two countries 
a study done for the reagan administration by former defense 
secretary james r schlesinger recommended last year that the top 
three floors be dismantled and rebuilt while an annex also was put 
up next to the chancery 
in 1987 anne armstrong who was head of thenpresident reagans 
foreign intelligence advisory board called for the use of existing 
technology and development of new methods to clear the chancery of 
eavesdropping devices 
reagan last october concluded the building should be razed and 
rebuilt but that decision is under review by the bush 
administration and baker has not decided whether to approve the 
recommendations of salgo and selin the us official said

former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth 
has made a new pitch for strikebound eastern airlines that could 
win the battle for the nations seventhlargest carrier airline 
industry and baseball sources said 
ueberroth traveled from his california home to new york on 
tuesday night and expected an agreement would be announced today 
barring another lastminute curveball from texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo the sources said 
mary jane barry head of the eastern flight attendants union in 
miami said ueberroth notified her by telephone today that there 
would be a potential sale of the airline possibly today 
ron cole a spokesman in miami for the air line pilots 
association said were still clearly optimistic that there will 
be a solution to our problem 
robin matell an eastern spokesman in miami said tuesday night 
i wouldnt have any comment on a report like that 
terms of the agreement werent known and sources familiar with 
the deal said they were worried that lorenzo might try to change 
the terms at the last minute 
the offer was believed to be less than the 464 million that 
ueberroths group had offered and then withdrew last week the deal 
reportedly would not include easterns prized northeast shuttle 
as with anything that has happened here in the last three 
years its not soup until its served said capt john knudson 
another pilots union spokesman 
eastern has been largely grounded since its machinists union 
struck march 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in 
support the airline filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 
march 9 as its cash dwindled 
ueberroth began negotiations with lorenzo about three weeks ago 
and had been told to expect approval of a sale when the texas air 
board met last week sources said 
but at the last minute lorenzo told the ueberroth group there 
was a higher offer sources said that offer came from hyatt hotel 
chain owner jay a pritzker and was worth about 500 million 
ueberroth withdrew regarding pritzkers entry as merely an 
attempt by lorenzo to raise the price according to baseball 
sources the former commissioners representatives returned to new 
york on tuesday and continued negotiations sources said 
sources close to ueberroth had said monday he was preparing a 
new lower bid because eastern agreed friday to sell the shuttle to 
new york developer donald j trump for 365 million 
under ueberroths first offer he and j thomas talbot a former 
airline executive from california would have owned 30 percent of 
the airline easterns unions would have received another 30 
percent in exchange for wage and workrule concessions the 
remaining 40 percent would have been held by new investors 
any sale of eastern acquired by texas air in 1986 for about 
600 million would have to be approved by a committee representing 
its unsecured creditors and by us bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
the creditors committee which includes representatives of 
easterns machinists and pilots unions and nonunion employees met 
tuesday in manhattan to discuss easterns future 
also tuesday congressional democrats pulled off the senate 
floor legislation that would force president bush to appoint an 
emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout 
the lawmakers attributed their reversal to a desire to give 
potential buyers a chance to acquire eastern and to allow the 
bankruptcy court to find a way to end the walkout

switzerland is proposing a giant tower of ice as 
its pavilion for the 1992 worlds fair ensuring visitors will keep 
cool beneath sevilles blistering sun 
the design for the 100foot tower submitted by architect 
vincent mangeat won first prize among 91 entries 
if approved the tower will be built by pouring water into a 
mold and freezing it it would be protected from direct sunlight by 
a giant triangular shade summer temperatures in southern spain 
average more than 85 degrees 
mangeat sayd the energy required to keep the tower frozen during 
the sixmonth fair is no more than the energy consumed by a 
conventional pavilion 
and the ice pavilion wont have to be dismantled once the fair 
is over organizers will simply pull the refrigeration system plug 
and let the tower melt away

the worlds biggest iceberg a 
chunk of ice the size of hong kong is drifting about 1 miles a 
day in antarcticas ross sea and has begun forming a winter 
coat a scientist said wednesday 
the iceberg codenamed b9 measures 95 miles in length 
the biggest iceberg ever reliably measured said conservation 
department official harry keys 
fresh ice was forming around it with the approach of winter in 
the southern hemisphere he said 
the iceberg poses no danger to shipping and is located about 300 
miles northeast of the us mcmurdo research station where up to 
700 people live during the antarctic summer he said it broke off 
from the ross ice shelf 18 months ago and is drifting in a circle 
also it is moving too slowly to affect shipping and since it 
is recorded on weather charts mariners know exactly where it it 
keys said 
although slowly melting it could take three years before the 
massive slab of ice reaches the open sea and starts to 
disintegrate he said 
sooner or later it will get into a current and move toward the 
open sea keys said its certainly not going to go away 
tomorrow we knew from the start it would be around for a while 
keys said the dimensions of b9 roughly correspond to the size 
of hong kong a british colony off the coast of china that is 
inhabited by 5 million people 
keys said b9 broke away from the ice ross shelf in october 1987 
and had drifted more than 680 miles since then providing 
scientists with information about antarctic sea currents around the 
frozen southern continent

reknowned filmmaker andrzej wajda often 
at odds with the government and at times forbidden to show his 
works has been approved as artistic director of a prestigious 
official warsaw theater 
wajdas nomination put forth by the theaters actors was 
approved tuesday by authorities as the economically pressed 
government tries to build an atmosphere of reform 
we now find ourselves in the most difficult situation since 
1945 he said our audiences are so tired from everyday life 
that they cannot think of art 
his films have chronicled resistance fighters during world war 
ii the dehumanization of stalinism and the birth of the 
independent trade union solidarity deeply rooted in poland wajda 
has continued to work here rather than leave as have other 
cultural figures seeking greater artistic freedom 
wajda said the government retains its influence in the arts by 
its control over the economy 
wajda who leads the culture commission of the citizens 
committee an opposition shadow government formed by solidarity 
leader lech walesa saw his awardwinning film on the union man 
of iron return to a warsaw theater in february for the first 
time since its premiere before the 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
wajdas appointment at teatr powszechny he replaces the late 
zygmunt hubner who offered him the first opportunity to move from 
film to theater in 1956 comes as other banned cultural and 
political figures are allowed to surface in official settings 
wajda who presided at a forum on independent culture last 
weekend emphasized that there is only good and bad art and it 
can be independent or not but we would not like to make 
differences betweeen official culture and nonofficial culture 
teatr powszechny established in 1944 was the first theater to 
open in postwar warsaw wajda directed the first play at the 
theater in 1975 when it reopened after five years of renovations 
the theater created a stir in february when it presented a play 
by vaclav havel the jailed czechoslovak writer polish prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski attended the opening 
it is our duty to support artists and their freedom as we are 
part of this group of people who try to create art involved in 
reality wajda said 
although best known for his movies wajda said film is an art 
that exists today and can disappear tomorrow if there is a new 
technique found whereas theater will live eternally people 
will always come to listen to others conversing in an intelligent 
way 
wajda said theater should be less dependent on the moment than 
cinema theater is not here to give us immediate answers to 
questions it responds to more general problems 
the director said he is preparing a documentary on the massacre 
of more than 4000 polish army officers including his father at 
katyn in the soviet union in 1940 
although official histories in poland and the soviet union have 
blamed the nazis for the massacre a polishsoviet review under way 
could lead to the conclusion widely held in the west that soviet 
secret police actually committed the atrocity 
the director said he started the documentary last year and may 
visit katyn with families of victims later this month 
wajda said he is concerned by the tendency to blame katyn and 
many other repressions on stalinism i do not see any 
guarantee that this will not come back he said

the woman known as jane roe in the landmark 
supreme court ruling legalizing abortion has gone into hiding 
indefinitely after three shotgun blasts were fired at her home and 
car her roommate said 
shes real emotional right now connie gonzales norma 
mccorveys roommate said tuesday she cries and cries we just 
want to stop her crying 
fbi agents and the dallas police department were conducting 
separate investigations into the 445 am shootings tuesday at ms 
mccorveys home 
weve got no leads no suspects said sgt ron ellison 
there were three shots fired from a 410gauge shotgun 
the gunfire damaged windows in ms mccorveys car and two 
windows in her home he said 
it knocked the glass out of the back of the vehicle and i 
believe it shattered one of the windows in the living room and 
another in the front door ellison said 
ms mccorvey was the plaintiff in roe vs wade which resulted 
in the 1973 us supreme court decision and has been organizing a 
prochoice jane roe foundation 
she told police she believes the shots were intended for her 
because she plans to attend a weekend march and rally in washington 
sponsored by the national organization for women to support 
legalized abortion 
ms gonzales told the dallas morning news that ms mccorvey was 
not available for comment and that the two were going into hiding 
indefinitely while their house remained under surveillance 
there are some sick people out there ms gonzales told the 
newspaper 
bill price president of the greater dallas right to life 
commission said he will be totally surprised if investigators 
find a link between the shooting incident and ms mccorveys stance 
on abortion 
certainly i hope it didnt have anything to do with that 
price said i dont know what else she may be involved in but 
this would be the worst possible way in which to try and protest 
and stop abortion 
in recent years ms mccorveys home and car have been egged 
she has found baby clothes scattered in her yard and she has 
received hate mail but ms gonzales said ms mccorvey never before 
felt personally threatened and ellison said she did not tell police 
about any previous incidents 
its frightening for norma that after all these years she is 
now willing to come out and be public about her role in the 
prochoice movement and she has to now deal with this said janie 
bush president of the texas abortion rights action league

lech walesa and a government minister 
today concluded a historic pact to legalize the independent 
solidarity trade union after a sevenyear ban and to hold polands 
first free elections since world war ii 
the solidarity leader representing the opposition and the 
interior minister gen czeszlaw kiszczak endorsed hundreds of 
pages of agreements hammered out during intensive talks on polands 
political and economic reforms 
they approved the pact as the 57 participants in the 2monthold 
negotiations known as the roundtable talks gathered for one last 
time at the council of ministers palace 
there is no freedom without solidarity walesa said at the 
beginning of a brief speech explaining why the opposition had 
approved the agreements 
i think that the roundtable talks can become the beginning of 
the road to democracy and a free poland and hence we look with 
boldness and hope into the future he said 
when walesa was asked earlier today when he thought solidarity 
would be legalized he replied i think immediately after 
signing 
kiszczak opened the meeting with a speech lauding the talks that 
brought together all sides of the nations splintered political 
spectrum 
this documentation is a social contract he said we 
declare the will to fulfill honestly the agreement we symbolically 
conclude today 
he called the debates a first extremely significant step 
and said the talks can be a priceless element in the 
accomplishment of our work 
the meeting was preceded by separate signings of agreements on 
economic political and trade union reforms by the opposition and 
government officials 
after the speeches by walesa and kiszczak a break was called in 
the meeting the two men endorsed the agreements verbally it was 
not clear whether they would sign a general statement of agreement 
as well 
as early as this morning it was not clear if solidarity intended 
to sign the accords especially after a dispute with the officially 
backed opzz trade unions over the formula adopted for compensating 
workers for inflation as part of the economic agreement 
but walesa told the national executive commission of solidarity 
during a closeddoor threehour meeting that the union had 
achieved its main goal in the talks legalization and it could 
better fight for further economic and political reforms after it is 
registered and organized 
the executive commission authorized walesa to sign the 
agreements clearing the final hurdle to the lateafternoon 
roundtable meeting with kiszcak 
the government agreed in august to hold the talks in return for 
an end to a series of crippling strikes 
the negotiators agreed to amend the present trade union law to 
allow legalization of solidarity registration of farmers rural 
solidarity and the reinstatement of workers fired for solidarity 
activities after the december 1981 crackdown that quashed the trade 
union movement 
on tuesday negotiators agreed to a plan that would bring the 
opposition into the sejm the onehouse parliament as a minority 
party under the plan a freely elected senate and a powerful 
presidency would be established 
walesa said the union did not get everything it wanted in the 
agreement but said other issues could be addressed later when we 
are a legal union 
solidarity became the first legal independent union movement in 
the soviet bloc when it was chartered in the fall of 1980 during 
nationwide strikes it was suspended in the 1981 military crackdown 
and later outlawed 
a parliamentary spokesman confirmed that the present onehouse 
parliament would meet friday to enact the accords 
under the agreement the opposition would join in elections in 
june that would guarantee the communist party and its allies 65 
percent of the sejms 460 seats that ratio will apply only this 
year later elections will be more democratic 
a presidency and a senate of about 100 members would be created 
the senate would be elected freely and probably would be controlled 
by the opposition the senate would advise the sejm and exercise 
veto powers over its bills 
the president would be elected this year by the sejm and senate 
for a sixyear term the nations leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
the communist party chief would be expected to win the 
presidential election

a south korean dissident clergyman said wednesday 
he believes his secret visit to north korea for talks with 
president kim il sung on reunification was a success 
the rev moon ikhwan an adviser to south koreas main 
dissident united national democratic movement arrived in tokyo on 
wednesday following an unauthorized nineday visit to north korea 
via japan and china 
he said he plans to go back to seoul before april 14 south 
korea says the 71yearold princetoneducated protestant minister 
will be arrested for violating national security laws by serving 
north korean interests 
i was not afraid of being arrested before but i really hope 
such an unfortunate development will not occur this time moon 
said 
he has been arrested and imprisoned several times since the 
mid1970s for antigovernment activity 
north korea has warned that moons arrest would rupture an 
ongoing dialogue between seoul and the communist government in 
pyongyang 
moon said he had four meetings totaling nearly 10 hours with kim 
to exchange frank and a wide range of views 
i told him it would be a shame and tragedy if the division of 
korea is prolonged more than half a century and he agreed that we 
all should exert allout efforts to reunify the country at least 
before the 50th year of the territorial split moon said 
korea was divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 and the 
two nations fought a war 195053 
the nations are involved in a variety of contacts ranging from a 
possible nonaggression pact to trade sports and cultural 
exchanges some talks have stalled because north korean protests 
over recently concluded ussouth korean military exercises 
i would say it was a success in that i have just initiated a 
move to discuss problems related to reunification on the peoples 
level moon said however he said he met only with communist 
leaders and 18 of his relatives living in north korea 
he said he hoped seoul would understand contacts between the 
general public in the divided halves are as important as those 
between government delegates 
many south koreans who hold kim responsible for the korean war 
expressed anger at televised scenes of moon hugging kim 
moon was the first prominent south korean dissident living in 
south korea to visit north korea secretly and meet with kim since 
the war hardened enmity a joint statement issued in pyongyang 
described moons visit as an inspiring dynamism for our nation 
that could help in clearing away the longstanding mistrust and 
hostility between the north and the south

the peace corps will dispatch its first 
volunteers to china this summer a group of 20 people to teach 
english in southwestern chinas sichuan province 
the peace corps is extremely excited about having people in 
china said kathleen corey the american volunteer groups 
training director for china were really happy to become a part 
of opening the doors of china 
china will become the 65th nation and the first socialist 
country with a peace corps program 
winston lord us ambassador to china and ge shouqin 
secretary general of the china education association for 
international exchanges exchanged letters wednesday on the peace 
corps program 
ms corey said the first group will arrive in august following 
an 11week training program in washington they are to teach 
english at three teacher training colleges a medical college and 
an animal husbandry college in the provincial capital of chengdu 
mianyang and two other sichuan cities 
she said the chinese will decide after a year whether to 
continue with the pilot program but the volunteers are expected to 
stay for the ordinary twoyear term nobody thinks this isnt 
going to work she said 
we definitely hope for expansion into other provinces and into 
other technical fields she said 
ms corey said many americans some who speak chinese have 
applied for the china program and they will be very selective in 
choosing the first volunteers 
she said one challenge will be for the volunteers to convince 
their chinese hosts that they dont want to be set apart as 
guests they dont want to be behind walls 
she said that during a recent threeweek tour of sichuan she 
explained to the colleges receiving volunteers that one objective 
of peace corps volunteers is to become part of the community they 
are working in 
since opening to the outside world 10 years ago china has 
recruited what it calls foreign experts to help in its 
modernization drive 
most of the estimated 20000 foreigners in china while 
receiving salaries well below what they could earn in their own 
countries are provided with living quarters far better than those 
of the average chinese and tend to be isolated from their chinese 
colleagues 
the peace corps which has about 5500 overseas volunteers has 
been sending american teachers technicians professionals and 
community workers to foreign cities and villages since 1961

a house subcommittee on wednesday approved a 
bill that would write into law a fairness doctrine requiring 
broadcasters to air opposing sides of controversial issues 
the house energy and commerce telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee on a voice vote sent the bill to the full energy and 
commerce committee after amending the measure to assure 
broadcasters that violation of the fairness doctrine would not be a 
criminal act 
in further attempt to respond to broadcaster concerns the 
amendment as proposed by subcommittee chairman edward j markey 
dmass also said the fairness doctrine only requires more 
speech and has no chilling effect on broadcasters 
rep matthew rinaldo of new jersey the subcommittees ranking 
republican said the fairness doctrine is not the unblinking eye 
of government on broadcasters but is only a mild means of 
assuring they provide adequate coverage of important issues 
the bill titled the fairness in broadcasting act of 1989 was 
introduced in january by rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the full committee cosponsors included markey and a number of 
republicans and is widely expected to pass the house 
dingells committee was expected to take up the bill quickly 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate commerce 
science and transportation communications subcommittee has 
introduced a companion fairness doctrine bill in the senate 
the federal communications commission repealed its 40yearold 
fairness doctrine in 1987 a federal appeals court in february 
ruled that the fcc had the statutory authority to do so but the 
court did not rule on the issue of the doctrines constitutionality 
if congress writes the doctrine into law a supreme court test 
is likely 
president bush said while campaigning last year that he would 
veto any fairness doctrine bill as president reagan did in june 
1987 after it was passed by congress 
the house passed a fairness doctrine bill again last year but 
it did not come to a vote in the senate 
the fcc in august 1987 struck down two parts of the doctrine 
the first part required broadcasters to provide coverage of 
vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community 
served by the licensees the second said broadcasters must 
provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of 
contrasting viewpoints on such issues 
the commission left intact a provision that broadcasters must 
give coverage to ballot issues 
in wednesdays discussion of the amendment markey noted 
testimony before the subcommittee earlier this year in which 
fairness doctrine proponents said their survey of television 
stations showed station managers often were not aware of the ballot 
obligation

people who smoke while they work typically burn up 
an extra 100 calories a day a discovery that helps explain why 
most put on weight when they give up cigarettes researchers report 
experts long have suspected that smoking boosts the bodys 
metabolism but the new research shows that this effect is 
significantly greater if people smoke while they are busy instead 
of only when resting 
the finding also helps explain while some people put on more 
weight than others when they stop smoking 
if people tend to smoke only while they are on coffee breaks 
or while relaxing at home watching tv they wont gain as much 
weight when they quit said dr kenneth a perkins those who 
smoke while active are likely to be thinner to begin with because 
of their smoking so they risk putting on more when they stop 
researchers long have wondered why people usually gain a few 
pounds when they quit cigarettes studies have shown people often 
eat more food especially sugar after quitting but there also was 
evidence that they burn fewer calories 
the new research based on measurements of the effects of 
nicotine suggests that the drugs effect on the bodys metabolism 
the rate at which it uses up calories is significantly more 
important than experts had suspected 
the research conducted by perkins and colleagues at the 
university of pittsburgh school of medicine was published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine 
in an accompanying editorial dr nancy a rigotti of harvard 
said the team made an important contribution to understanding 
the way smoking affects metabolism 
until our cultural obsession with slenderness abates she 
wrote we must pay more attention to the way weight gain impedes 
efforts to stop smoking if we are to continue the progress of the 
past quarter century toward a smokefree society 
smokers on average weigh five to 10 pounds less than 
nonsmokers and they usually put on this much weight after they 
give up cigarettes 
studies by perkins and others suggest that smokers are thinner 
because nicotine somehow makes their bodies burn more calories 
until now this effect has been studied only when people are 
completely inactive and the impact of nicotine appeared to be 
slight raising the metabolism about 5 percent 
however perkins noted that people often smoke while working 
walking and moving about so he studied the effects of nicotine 
during light exercise to more closely mirror real life 
he found that nicotine during exercise boosted metabolism about 
12 percent he calculated that someone who smokes steadily through 
the day will burn up an extra 100 calories about twothirds of 
them while active and the remainder while resting 
the loss of 100 calories a day could add up to about 10 pounds 
of lost weight a year 
however perkins said the news is not all bad for people 
thinking about quitting because they can make up for their slower 
metabolic rates by getting some extra exercise 
all you would need to do is walk about a mile extra a day to 
counter that he said thats not as hard as it sounds 
he said people should also remember that gaining a few pounds 
after giving up cigarettes is harmless while continuing to smoke 
is a major health hazard

the oregon court of appeals on wednesday 
ruled that cowboy boots are dangerous weapons at least under some 
circumstances 
the decision upheld the firstdegree robbery conviction of todd 
bell in a case from multnomah county 
bell knocked a woman to the ground and kicked her in the chest 
while taking her purse the court said he was charged with 
firstdegree robbery on grounds the cowboy boots he wore were 
dangerous weapons 
clearly cowboy boots with pointed toes and threeinch heels 
are capable of causing injuries that bare feet or say tennis 
shoes are not the appeals court said 
and the court said the circumstances of an objects use rather 
than its design make it a dangerous weapon 
although cowboy boots are not dangerous weapons per se 
defendant converted them into dangerous weapons when he used 
them to kick a resisting robbery victim in the upper body while she 
was lying on the ground the court said

prosecutors said wednesday they have 
assembled enough evidence to try a suspect arrested in december in 
the fatal shooting of prime minister olof palme in 1986 
discarding the conspiracy theories police pursued for years the 
prosecutors will press charges against christer pettersson 
pettersson 42 has a previous manslaughter conviction a long 
record of petty crime a history of mental disturbance and of drug 
and alcohol abuse he has denied he shot palme 
assistant state prosecutor axel morath said he expected to file 
charges within a month he did not say exactly what the charge 
would be 
the evidence against the suspect has been strengthened during 
the time he has been detained morath said the evidence is 
judged to be so strong that the prosecutors have decided charges 
should be filed and the case should be tested in court 
under swedish jurisprudence prosecutors should be virtually 
certain of a conviction before trying a case 
palme was shot feb 28 1986 while walking home from a movie 
with his wife he was a controversial figure at home and abroad a 
committed socialist and a champion of third world liberation 
movements 
the killing stunned sweden where no political leader had been 
slain for 200 years 
morath said he would ask the stockholm district court to order 
petterssons detention for another 14 days to complete the 
investigation and then will turn the file over to the defense to 
prepare its case 
it was not clear when the trial would begin 
investigators reportedly believe pettersson acted alone but 
they have not disclosed any motive 
authorities found no murder weapon but morath said the case 
strengthened after several accounts from witnesses of the slaying 
as far as we can tell he pettersson has no alibi morath 
said 
pettersson had been questioned within weeks of the shooting but 
was investigated again after police received a tip that he had lied 
about his whereabouts on the night of the shooting 
petterssons arrest on dec 14 came as a surprise after a 
threeyear manhunt that focused on theories of international 
conspiracies 
pettersson was most recently arrested in august and fined by a 
court for assault and the theft of 7 in beef he was convicted of 
1970 of stabbing a stranger after a street brawl just a few yards 
from where palme was shot 16 years later he was released from 
detention after seven months under psychiatric care 
the strain of failure in solving the murder exposed swedish 
authorities to brutal criticism from the public and parliament 
justice minister anna gretaleijon was forced to resign in june 
after disclosures that she supported a private probe of the killing 
the secret investigation came to light when the group led by 
book publisher ebbe carlsson tried to smuggle illegal wiretapping 
equipment across the border

more than 6 million couples and individuals 
are expected to take an automatic fourmonth extension in the time 
to file their 1988 tax returns the internal revenue service said 
wednesday 
the number is about 9 percent over the 57 million who were 
granted the extension last year 
the extension is approved for a taxpayer who files a form 4868 
by the midnight april 17 deadline for filing tax returns because 
of the patriots day holiday the deadline is april 18 for residents 
of new england and most areas of new york who file returns to 
andover mass 
however getting an additional four months time to file a 
return does not delay the time for payment of taxes owed form 4868 
must be accompanied by a check for taxes due an underpayment will 
lead to an interest charge and perhaps a penalty 
there was a time when taxpayers could get an automatic twomonth 
extension of filing time simply by arranging to be out of the 
united states or puerto rico on deadline day widespread abuse led 
the irs to end that provision 
now the twomonth delay is available only for taxpayers who 
live and have their business location outside the united states or 
puerto rico and for military personnel outside those areas 
the irs said 581 million returns had been received through 
march 31 compared with 58 million at the same time a year ago the 
irs has processed almost 481 million or 22 percent more than the 
47 million during the period last year 
refunds totaling 305 billion have been certified for 373 
million returns up from the 298 billion and 362 million last 
year the average refund this year is 819 down from 825 a year 
ago 
about 109 million returns are expected to be filed this year

the white house today hailed the accord 
reached between the communist government of poland and the 
solidarity movement calling it a great day for the polish people 
and for freedom 
press secretary marlin fitzwater told a news briefing that 
president bush who visited poland in september 1987 as vice 
president was very pleased by the accords that have started 
poland on this new path toward reconcilation 
fitzwater said that americans several years ago lit candles 
in hopes that darkness and oppression in the warsaw pact nation 
would someday be lifted 
this is a great day for the polish people and for freedom 
the spokesman said the discussions have been long and arduous 
we welcome the round table accords and see them as a historic step 
which will take poland far from totalitarianism 
fitzwater said the bush administration was following 
developments in poland closely in consultation with us allies 
and with members of congress 
fitzwater also said the united states was disappointed that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev did not go further in a 
speech he gave to the cuban national assembly tuesday in which the 
kremlin leader spoke out against the export of revolution 
we listened carefully to what president gorbachev had to 
say the spokesman said while his words about not exporting 
revolution are welcome they are not matched by deeds which would 
give his words credence 
today we call on the soviets to call off their 
halfbilliondollar aid to nicaragua fitzwater said 
responding to longstanding us concerns about moscows 
intentions in latin america gorbachev said the kremlin would 
refrain from putting military bases or nuclear weapons in the 
region 
with president fidel castro sitting nearby the soviet leader 
said moscow supports the creation of a zone of peace in latin 
america and an end to all outside military aid to the region 
fitzwater said the us bipartisan plan for humanitarian aid to 
the nicaraguan contras has the support of the central american 
democracies it is time for the soviet union to support us in this 
plan 
he said the soviets should demonstrate through their behavior 
that they are adhering to this principle and they should pressure 
their client states and the revolutionary groups they support to do 
the same 
we trust that the soviets will follow these words with 
concrete action the press secretary said but he also said that 
gorbachev could have proposed a cutoff of military supplies to 
all irregular forces in the region this would have suggested a new 
thinking in central america

chinese troops turned out in force at beijings 
central square on wednesday and chinese sources said one man was 
taken away as he tried to commemorate the anniversary of an 
important demonstration 
about 250 students at chinas foremost university meanwhile 
defied a school prohibition and met to discuss political change 
chinese sources said hundreds of chinese soldiers filled 
tiananmen square early wednesday morning to prevent against any 
demonstrations to commemorate the april 5 1976 protest that 
signaled the end of the cultural revolution 
soldiers from the peoples liberation army sealed off about 
threefourths of the huge square including the monument to 
revolutionary martyrs and the mausoleum of mao tsetung 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said troops 
detained the man when he tried to enter the sealedoff area to 
commemorate the 1976 demonstration held just after the death of 
premier zhou enlai 
thousands of people took part in the demonstration which marked 
the end of the ultraleftist cultural revolution the protest 
crushed by police became a rallying cry for political activists 
one source said the man was detained because he was handing out 
pamphlets critical of the current regime another said he was 
detained because he tried to walk in the restricted area 
at beijing university about 250 students gathered to defy what 
they said was a school prohibition on political meetings 
students said that in recent weeks university and city 
government authorities have been stopping the meetings of the 
democracy salon a student group organized to discuss current 
social issues 
on wednesday li shuxian wife of chinas most famous dissident 
fang lizhi addressed the students and urged them to pursue 
democratic change 
student activists also called on classmates to convince the 
school to allow the democratic salon to continue the reaction 
although supportive was tame 
some students said they were afraid they would be denied access 
to good jobs if they supported the movement others said they 
thought calls for freedom of speech and association were hopeless 
in china 
i feel a kind of formless pressure on me that keeps me from 
speaking out said one bespectacled student in a worn mao suit 
we all do many of us dont know what to do we want to speak out 
but we are afraid of all the people here listening 
students said the crowd contained many plainclothes police 
throughout the meeting men hovered around taking photographs 
the openair meeting began near a statue of miguel cervantes 
author of don quixote as the crowd swelled to about 250 it 
moved to pavilion a few yards away 
the meeting came two days after a wallposter appeared at 
beijing university urging the university to stop interfering in the 
salon the poster signed by more than 60 students said democratic 
change in china is not simply a matter of saying a few empty 
words 
a school official said the university permitted students to take 
part in activities as long as they were healthy and good for the 
students but school spokesman yan huajiang said if the 
university believed the activities were unhealthy the school 
would stop them 
history major wang dan an author of the poster said the 
purpose of the group was to enliven thought 
the most recent interference occurred march 29 when city 
officials stopped a professor from another school from addressing 
the salon he said 
li teaches physics at beijing university in 1987 she was 
elected to the lowestlevel peoples congress in the district that 
contains the university 
fang her 52yearold husband is popular among students and 
intellectuals because of his view that chinas efforts to develop 
its economy wont succeed unless it becomes more democratic 
an increasing number of chinese intellectuals have been calling 
for political change since january intellectuals have written 
four open letters calling for the release of political prisoners 
and democratic change 
but government officials have ruled out an amnesty and 
softpedaled any talk of democratic change china also maintains it 
has no political prisoners

the state department on wednesday praised 
vietnams announcement that it would pull out of cambodia by sept 
30 saying such a step would restore peace there 
although we have not yet seen complete details of the 
vietnamese statement we do believe that if the withdrawal is 
carried out it would be a positive development said richard 
boucher a department spokesman 
the united states has long called for an expeditious 
withdrawal of all vietnamese troops as a key component of the 
cambodian settlement he said 
clearly a total and verifiable withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops from cambodia would contribute to the process of returning 
peace and stability to that wartorn nation he said 
vietnam previously had said it would withdraw its troops 
estimated at 70000 by 1990 and would be out by september only if 
a political settlement has been reached 
wednesdays announcement gave no indication that any conditions 
were attached to the september pullout

rising prices are forcing young couples to 
delay one part of the american dream owning their own home even 
as the number of available houses is growing more than twice as 
fast as the population the census bureau said wednesday 
over the decade that began in 1975 median prices for a first 
home rose 125 percent from 27100 to 61000 in 1985 while the 
average income of married couples renting their home and aged 25 
to 29 rose only 80 percent from 12300 to 22200 the bureau 
reported 
the result census housing analyst f john devaney said is that 
couples who used to move from renting to owning in their 20s are 
now largely delaying the transition into their 30s or later because 
they can no longer qualify for mortgages on the homes they want 
in 1975 threefourths of married couples aged 25 to 35 qualified 
for an 80 percent mortgage a figure that fell to less than half by 
1985 the study found 
over the same period the nations housing stock grew by 26 
percent while the us population rose by just 11 percent the 
census bureau reported in its new analysis housing in america 
198586 
helping absorb the growing number of available homes are the 
trend toward secondhome ownership and a shrinkage in average 
household size from 294 in 1975 to 269 a decade later 
divorce and separation up sharply in recent years have turned 
one household into two devaney observed one in 10 homeowner 
units is a woman living alone he said 
in addition many elderly widows continue to maintain their 
homes at the same time increasing numbers of young people are 
postponing marriage 
the census bureau report was released just a day after the 
federal home loan bank board reported that conventional mortgage 
interest rates rose in march to their highest level since just 
before the 1987 stock market crash 
the board said the national average for conventional 
singlefamily loans jumped to 1136 percent in early march up from 
1111 percent in early february 
while renters are facing steeper obstacles to owning their first 
home the report said that people who already own a house are more 
able to buy a second home 
the bureau reported that vacant housing rose from 25 
million units in 1940 to 115 million in 1985 meaning the united 
states has more unused housing than the entire housing stock of 
canada 
but that category includes some 54 million homes that are 
seasonal or recreational residences the report said 
this is an indication of general economic wellbeing and we 
support a tremendous amount of this housing it is a big change in 
recent years especially looking back to the 1950s devaney 
observed 
while the report did not include figures for seasonal and 
recreational housing in earlier years the 54 million seasonal and 
recreational homes counted among the vacant in 1985 is 
significantly higher than the total of 32 million vacant houses in 
1950 
other findings from the new analysis 
the median monthly housing costs for all americans averaged 
355 in 1985 compared to 311 for blacks and 357 for hispanics 
the proportions of income spent for housing were 28 percent for 
renters 21 percent for owners of mortgaged homes and 13 percent 
for folks with homes that were not mortgaged 
the average size of new homes built in 1986 was 1825 square 
feet up 300 square feet from 20 years earlier 
the median age of housing in 1985 was 23 years

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
presented today to secretary of state james a baker iii some 
ways to solve problems in the middle east and baker said he was 
encouraged 
although details were not immediately disclosed shamir had said 
last week in israel he would propose that palestinian arabs hold 
elections to choose leaders for negotiations over the west bank and 
gaza 
i feel we have started a very serious discussion shamir 
said after the twohour meeting at the state department 
baker called it a very productive useful friendly 
discussion he said shamir had made some suggestions that were 
very encouraging 
on his arrival shamir pledged to work with the united states in 
a search for new peace openings we are among friends he said 
in an arrival statement shamir said he hoped his visit would 
open vistas to peace while he works with us officials in 
mutual understanding and respect 
his aim in the election proposal is to find leaders other than 
from the palestine liberation organization to negotiate some form 
of selfrule for the 17 million arabs in the territories 
the 73yearold prime minister steadfastly refuses to negotiate 
with the palestine liberation organization and told a conference 
of jewishamerican organization leaders that sitting with the plo 
will bring disaster 
while shamir has withheld many of the details until he sees 
secretary of state james a baker iii today and president bush on 
thursday he apparently intends to hold the elections only after 
the 15month uprising subsides 
the bush administration is seeking a more immediate change in 
the situation and yet a us official briefing reporters tuesday 
at the white house on the visit said we want to listen to what 
prime minister shamir has to say how the peace process can be moved 
forward but i dont want to prejudge what in fact he is going to 
tell the president 
shamir follows close on the heels of egyptian president hosni 
mubarak who said toward the end of his washington visit on tuesday 
that he saw no way to stop the violence in the territories lost by 
the arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
the uprising has cost the lives of 418 palestinian arabs and 18 
israelis 
if anybody could stop it we would be very pleased mubarak 
said but how 
the egyptian leader made no public demands on the united states 
or israel he said he was simply trying to find out whats the 
best way to achieve peace through negotiations 
mubarak who has insisted that israel deal with the plo 
withheld judgment on shamirs proposal he said the criterion 
should be whether an election would help advance the peace process 
the egyptian leader was warmly received by the bush 
administration bush took him to baltimore on monday to see the 
orioles and the boston red sox play in the opening game of the 
american league season 
shamir will be entertained with a series of luncheons and 
dinners but there was no event scheduled to match the friendly 
spectacle of mubarak and bush sitting sidebyside at the ball game 
the us official who gave the briefing tuesday praised israel 
as a staunch us ally but he also said there would be candid 
giveandtake with shamir which is a diplomatic way of 
suggesting disagreement 
the us official who insisted on anonymity called the 
situation on the west bank untenable but declined to say whether 
the bush administration held the plo accountable 
i am not going to get into the causes of the intifada and who 
is in control he said using the arabic word for the uprising 
the palestinian insurgency which shamir and other israeli 
officials say was inspired and is maintained by the plo began in 
december 1987 and has had the effect of enhancing us interest in 
the situation on the west bank and in gaza 
mubarak in response to a question told reporters neither 
you nor anybody else would be able to stop the intifada let us 
be realistic and practical we all hope that we could reach peace 
and avoid losing lives and spending money for killing and 
bloodshed 
in a statement timed to shamirs visit 200 american jews 
challenged the prime minister and urged him to open negotiations 
with the plo 
many american jews loyal supporters of israel do not support 
the suppression of the palestinian people and the continued 
occupation of the west bank and gaza the statement said you 
do not have a blank check from american jewry to continue these 
policies 
the statement was released in oakland calif by tikkun a 
bimonthly magazine that concentrates on political and cultural 
issues of special interest to american jews the signers included 
the comedian and writer woody allen novelist philip roth 
playwright arthur miller and civil rights lawyer joseph rauh 
begin negotiations with the plo the statement said not 
only has the us begun to talk with them but recent polls indicate 
that 58 percent of american jews would support direct negotiations 
with plo leaders if you are serious about seeking peace you must 
be prepared to talk directly with your enemies and you cannot 
expect to pick their representatives for them

after 65 years of lying in state the body of 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin is in no immediate danger of 
rotting away the communist party newspaper pravda reported 
wednesday 
the preservation of lenins body is guaranteed for an extended 
period of time said sergei s debov head of the laboratory 
overseeing the body 
the body lies beneath glass in a special marbleandgranite 
mausoleum on red square five days a week visitors are hustled 
past the body in a dimly lighted room where no photographs are 
allowed 
there has long been speculation that the technology did not 
exist when lenin died in 1924 to preserve him and that the body is 
a wax dummy 
in the pravda interview debov confirmed that at first soviet 
scientists did not think they could preserve the body of the 
revered leader 
more than two months after lenin died and had been temporarily 
embalmed a team of scientists descended into the thenwooden 
mausoleum to figure out how to answer mass demand for longterm 
preservation debov said 
they considered a refrigeration system but decided on 
anatomicalbiochemical methods instead pravda said without 
elaboration 
however debov did say the fight against decomposition was so 
intense at first that scientists had to work around the clock in 
a struggle to preserve literally every square millimeter of skin 
against putrefaction 
the preservation process was further complicated when its head 
boris zbarsky was arrested during josef stalins repressions in 
1952 debov said he was released after stalin died the next year 
the preservation process requires daily vigilant observation 
and is examined by a government commission every four or five 
years debov said the commissions report last year noted the body 
was in good condition he said but nothing on our planet is 
eternal 
lenins wife nadezhda krupskaya was against having lenin 
embalmed but she was overruled by the communist party leadership

a centuryold clock in this 
quintessential new england town has pitted oldtimers fond of its 
hourly chiming against a pair of newcomers who say the clamor is 
taking a toll on their sleep 
the couple sued to silence the town clock at night and that is 
the talk of the main street barbershop just a stones throw from 
the first congregational church steeple that holds the clock said 
barber giles desmond 
any time anything happens that might undermine the towns 
history people get very how shall i say hostile said 
selectman george g zgrodnik jr what do you think people in 
england would do if they turned off big ben 
this confrontation of yuppies vs yankees has caused the 
greatest bustle in the pretty little town since an old school was 
demolished a decade ago to make way for a modern one said zgrodnik 
feelings run deep in this 319yearold farming community where 
settlers once battled indians and asparagus has overtaken tobacco 
as the chief cash crop zgrodnik said some of the 3200 townspeople 
still arent talking to the official they suspect of arranging the 
schoolhouse demolition 
richard and pamela carnall moved into this community of strong 
traditions in august and unsuspectingly bought a 19thcentury house 
50 yards from the 1870 white clapboard church 
the town clock was broken and silent until after they moved in 
mrs carnall said they endured the chimes when they first 
resumed because they assumed the bell was tolling only for holidays 
when the chiming continued the couple offered to install a 
timer to shut the bell off at night selectmen declined the offer 
saying the timer could jam the works of the delicate clock 
the carnalls say in their lawsuit that the bell has turned them 
into crabby insomniacs making them irritable frustrated angry 
humorless and combative they claim it booms into their bedroom 
at 75 decibels louder than a vacuum cleaner 
i told my husband when it started this is not normal this 
ringing around the clock mrs carnall 29 a marketing 
consultant said wednesday 
she and her 34yearold husband a cable tv salesman grew up in 
nearby towns and were drawn to hatfield for its traditional values 
but were driven to sue out of desperation she said 
we just lost sleep night after night we had no choice she 
said 
she said she has received support from some townspeople 
including one particularly sympathetic note it really meant a 
lot coming from an air traffic controller she said 
on the other side of the issue a petition in desmonds 
barbershop says the bell has been signaling farmers children and 
other residents of the hours longer than anyone remembers 
at least 200 signatures were gathered in the day before a march 
24 hearing on a preliminary injunction that would have shut off the 
bell at night until a trial could be held a judge denied the 
injunction saying the carnalls hadnt proved irreparable harm 
neighbors tell the carnalls they will eventually get used to the 
bell as other families have in the 60 years since the house was 
moved to the spot from a quartermile down the street 
other townsfolk say the selectmen have their backs up about the 
recent influx of newcomers like the carnalls and overreacted to the 
request to quiet the bell at night 
im surprised at the intensity of feeling a few people have 
for that bell at one two three oclock in the morning said the 
carnalls attorney w michael ryan who also lives in town the 
general population of hatfield thinks this is comical

the bush administration said today it was 
expanding a recently imposed ban on the importation of 
semiautomatic assault weapons 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that president 
bush accepted a treasury department recommendation that the ban be 
widened effective immediately 
the action expands the ban to cover all imports of the 
highpowered rapidfire weapons fitzwater said 
the previous ban announced in early march only covered about 
80 percent of imports he said 
fitzwater said the initial ban on such weapons including the 
ak47 assault rifle was aimed at fostering a climate in which 
reasonable and wellintended people could work out a thoughtful 
solution to the proliferation of such weapons 
he said the department was imposing a ban on an additional 24 
types of guns to review their suitability for sporting purposes 
among other things he said the administration wants to make 
sure that no foreign manufacturer suffered a needless weakening of 
its competitive position in the export market and so therefore the 
ban was expanded 
the president believes that by working closely with law 
enforcement groups sportsmen concerned citizen groups and 
congress we can resolve these problems fitzwater said 
treasurys bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms announced the 
initial ban on march 14 on the import of the ak47s and certain 
similar weapons but said the action could be reversible 
it said the move was necessary to head off an imminent flood of 
the assault weapons into the united states 
bush earlier had asked federal drug coordinator william bennett 
to recommend what should be done about the increasing flow of the 
weapons calls for such a ban had been prompted by scores of 
drugrelated shootings and the recent slaying of five california 
schoolchildren 
fitzwater said the new action was not guided so much by growing 
public opinion against such weapons as by a desire to make sure 
that one company did not gain a competitive advantage over another 
through the import ban 
this is an effort to equalize that matter he said 
the spokesman conceded that todays action still would not 
affect the production and distribution of domestically made assault 
rifles 
there is some unfairness in that those weapons are still being 
produced unfortunately it is not something we can do anything 
about he said 
to do anything about domestically manufactured weapons would 
require a change in the law fitzwater said 
he said that the 90day review of the entire subject ordered by 
bush on march 15 is progressing

the fired captain of the oil tanker exxon 
valdez surrendered this morning to face charges of being drunk when 
his vessel ran aground and a judge set his bail 20 times higher 
than prosecutors had sought 
these misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been 
equaled at least in this country judge kenneth rohl said as 
joseph hazelwood was arraigned as a fugitive 
hes got to think about that we have a manmade destruction 
that has not been equaled probably since hiroshima 
rohl set the bail at 500000 cash district attorney patrick 
henry had said he would recommend bail of 25000 
we are treating this case like any other fugitive warrant 
case he said 
hazelwood who had been sought since sunday on a fugitive 
warrant turned himself in about 845 am 
hazelwood who wore a tie and had shaven off his thick beard 
was accompanied by three attorneys who had been negotiating with 
authorities for two days to arrange the surrender 
hazelwood faces three misdemeanor charges in alaska stemming 
from the march 24 grounding of the exxon valdez which spilled more 
than 101 million gallons of oil into prince william sound 
hazelwood 42 a resident of the long island community of 
huntington apparently flew to new york from anchorage alaska 
last week 
prosecutors said hazelwood would be asked if he wants to waive 
extradition proceedings if he agreed and bail was set he would be 
sent back to alaska to face the charges there 
hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the 
influence of alcohol reckless endangerment and negligent discharge 
of oil the charges carry combined maximum penalties of 2 years in 
prison and a 10000 fine 
fbi officials in washington say they also are investigating 
whether hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the 
clean water act which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants 
into navigable waters 
hazelwood was fired by exxon last thursday after the national 
transportation safety board said tests taken about nine hours after 
the disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol 
hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had 
his license suspended three times his mother told the associated 
press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that exxon was 
aware of his drinking problem 
hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker ran aground a 
third mate who was not certified to pilot the vessel was in command 
exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and 
now requires crews to be aboard ship where drinking is prohibited 
four hours before sailing

the most part area fishermen fish processors and businessmen such 
as tour boat operators seeking unspecified damages and 
environmental restoration from exxon usa and other defendants 
a lawsuit filed by attorney melvin belli however goes beyond 
actual damages and asks the court to assess at least 1 billion to 
punish or make an example of the defendants the san francisco 
attorney said he also has turned to the courts to tap a 100 
million cleanup fund established as part of the federal 
authorization for the transalaska oil pipeline 
belli known for his litigation of disasters said tuesday about 
100 plaintiffs had joined in a classaction lawsuit and he expected 
many more weve been deluged he said 
other lawsuits include a classaction complaint filed in federal 
court in california charging that the spill led to higher prices 
at the gas pump for drivers in that state

valdez on march 24 had flowed through the 800mile pipeline from 
prudhoe bay to valdez about 240000 barrels of crude oil spilled 
into the resourcerich sound killing wildlife and bringing the 
cancellation of at least three fish harvests 
claims in the lawsuits include negligence stemming partly from 
capt joseph hazelwoods absence from the vessels bridge at the 
time of the crash tests conducted about nine hours after the 
accident showed hazelwood was intoxicated 
alyeska pipeline service cos response immediately after the 
spill also is presented as a basis for damages the company is a 
consortium of oil companies

mccarron an anchorage lawyer whose office has filed four lawsuits 
including one on behalf of cordova district fishermen united and 
prince william sound aquaculture corp 
it could last for quite awhile

the judge in oliver norths trial on wednesday 
blocked the former white house aide from using videotaped 
congressional testimony from john poindexter which north says would 
show his boss authorized his actions 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said the threehour 
selection of tape north lawyers want to show at his trial 
distorts the record of the 30 hours of testimony poindexter 
gave congress in 1987 
the case is winding down now and the motion just filed comes 
too late gesell stated in a fourpage order 
the prosecution would have to examine all of poindexters 
testimony in preparing a rebuttal and gesell said the editing 
of 30 hours of testimony cannot be evaluated in the short time 
given to the independent counsel 
norths lawyers had argued that excluding the videotape would be 
unconstitutional but gesell said the constitutional claim is 
misplaced the judge said north seeks no material that if 
excluded would arguably deprive him of his due process rights 
it was the second setback for north in less than a week last 
friday gesell quashed norths subpoena for former president reagan 
to appear at the trial the judge ruled the defense had failed to 
supply any proof that reagan had authorized north to engage in 
illegal conduct 
in his testimony to congress poindexter said i did not 
authorize north to make false statements in an august 1986 
meeting with the house intelligence committee but poindexter added 
dont misunderstand me i thought that colonel north would 
withhold information there was no doubt about that in my mind 
north is accused of obstructing congress in connection with the 
aug 6 1986 meeting he is alleged to have said he had only 
casual contact with his courier to the contras robert owen and 
hadnt seen another contra supporter gen john singlaub in 20 
months owen testified earlier in the trial that he had nearly 100 
meetings with north while singlaub testified he met on several 
occasions in 1986 with north 
asked during the congressional hearings whether he thought it 
was proper for extensive document destruction to have taken place 
on nov 21 1986 as the attorney general launched a factfinding 
inquiry on the iran initiative poindexter responded 
i dont have any problem with it these are working 
documents in the staff offices 
north is accused of obstructing the attorney generals inquiry 
by destroying altering concealing and smuggling documents out of 
the national security council offices 
poindexter has asserted through his lawyer that if called to 
testify he would invoke his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and refuse to answer questions 
poindexter a codefendant in the irancontra affair is to be 
tried separately later this year he is charged with conspiracy 
theft of government property obstruction of congress and making 
false statements to a congressional committee 
north said in a motion last friday that portions of poindexters 
prior testimony are critical to the defense particularly on the 
issue of official knowledge and authorization of lt col norths 
activities 
however gesell said there can be no dispute that the 
videotape is hearsay and that it may be admitted as evidence only 
under a narrow exception given to former testimony 
federal court rules say that the party against whom the 
testimony is offered in this instance the government must have 
had an opportunity to question the testimony 
gesell stated that the independent counsel is not the 
congress congressional examination was shaped in part by the 
demands of television and electoral politics rathby the 
rules of evidence and the norms of a fair adversary proceeding

biologists trucked 13 caribou into the 
wilderness to regenerate the native herd of the reindeerlike 
animals that vanished from the woods of northern maine 80 years ago 
five animals doped up on tranquilizers were driven in trucks 
100 miles north of here wednesday to a threeacre enclosure in a 
state park where they will be kept several weeks before their final 
release 
eight other caribou were taken to the park earlier in the week 
the beasts were to have been accompanied by a 2yearold stag 
named eu truckmore whom scientists expect to become a dominant 
male in the herd 
but the tranquilizer did not have an effect on the big stag and 
he was left behind out of concern he would disturb the other 
caribou during the ride said margaret nagle a spokeswoman for the 
university of maine in orono 
she said biologists will decide later this week whether to 
transfer the stag to baxter state park with the other caribou 
maines native caribou herd disappeared by 1908 officials tried 
in 1963 to reintroduce a herd but the venture was considered a 
failure because the animals disappeared 
the caribou being released in the latest attempt which were 
born to a herd rounded up in newfoundland in 1986 are 
nonmigratory

the sovietcuban alliance seems reasonably intact 
after the visit of president mikhail s gorbachev but the two 
countries so different in so many ways still give the 
impression of an international odd couple 
for nations that were barely aware of each others existence 30 
years ago the soviet union and cuba have come a long way no 
overseas ally of the soviets has been more durable than cuba 
they are improbable partners temperamentally and 
geographically distant sometimes seemingly from different planets 
but a common ideology and shared hostility for the united states 
cemented the relationship in ways few would have thought possible 
to this day cuba soaks up more than half the soviet foreign aid 
program while lending itself to soviet strategic purposes as an 
example cuba has routinely dispatched soldiers to bolster remote 
but ideologically congenial regimes troubled by unrest 
for almost two decades even the most persistent analysts were 
unable to detect more than minor chinks in the moscowhavana axis 
with the ascendancy of gorbachev however sharp differences 
began to emerge and it was against this background that his 
ilyushin62 jetliner touched down here sunday night 
in a variety of ways castro had indicated deep reservations 
about gorbachevs policies his accommodating attitude toward the 
united states his lessthanresolute backing for prosoviet 
regimes in such places as afghanistan and cambodia his willingness 
to borrow some capitalistic practices his eagerness to allow 
public debate on key issues 
castro made no secret of his disdain for some of those reforms 
but during gorbachevs visit the cuban leader sought to be the 
perfect host effusively praising the visitor while dismissing 
western accounts of a rift 
sovietcuban friendship and cooperation castro said in a speech 
tuesday has does and will exist and and will increase 
gorbachev was less forthcoming on this point but told a news 
conference tuesday there was no truth to western reports that he 
said treated the two almost as enemies 
there was some hint of gorbachevs widely advertised 
dissatisfaction with the way cuba has used soviet aid 
he told the cuban national assembly the immediate task is 
stricter accountability and more discipline on joint projects 
that was an elegant way of saying look fidel weve poured 
hundreds of millions of pesos into extravagant projects begun over 
a decade ago and the return on the investment thus far has been 
nonexistent 
castro is not one to play the role of sycophant even to a 
patron as generous as gorbachev in contrast to the measured way 
the kremlin leader discussed soviet relations with the united 
states castro made a bitter attack on us policies while 
gorbachev sat impassively nearby 
in corrosive terms he criticized us support for 
anticommunist insurgencies and the american refusal to give third 
world countries more of a break on their huge foreign debt 
polemical diatribes are part of castros repertoire but not 
gorbachevs while castro sees himself as the guardian of socialist 
purity gorbachev has emerged as a noapologies defender of 
pragamtism 
it appears castro has decided he can coexist with what gorbachev 
describes as the new thinking in moscow distasteful as the 
cuban may find it 
he has backed away from criticizing gorbachevs policies in 
recent months perhaps sensing that what unites the two countries 
is far more powerful than what divides them 
cuba gets roughly 5 billion in aid from the soviets annually 
and the kremlin remains castros best insurance against a us 
attempt to eradicate communism in cuba moscow almost certainly 
would extract a heavy price from the united states in such a case 
gorbachev benefits from his alliance with castro who is after 
all a hero to the worlds dispossessed and has given moscow 
irreplaceable facilities for electronic spy activities against us 
military and space installations along the east coast 
the two countries may not seem meant for each other but to 
castro the relationship is more than an ephemeral infatuation 
our gratitude toward the soviet leadership led brilliantly by 
comrade gorbachev will be eternal he said tuesday

democrats were celebrating two more election 
victories wednesday but some of their heartiest cheers were 
prompted by the partys clean triumph in its latest confrontation 
with jesse jackson 
democrat glen browder was a landslide winner in the race for an 
open house seat in alabama tuesday his triumph coming exactly a 
week after jill long upset republican hopes of holding dan quayles 
old house seat in indiana 
browder easily beat republican john rice who had labeled the 
democrat a liberal a liar and a wimp browder will succeed the 
late democratic rep bill nichols 
but the race that held the attention of democrats was for mayor 
of chicago where richard m daley scored a solid victory over a 
black independent backed by jackson 
that was a contest where all the winners and losers werent on 
the ballot 
a clear winner was ronald h brown the new national democratic 
party chairman 
also picking up some points for likely use in 1992 was sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee who risked involvement in the snake 
pit of chicago politics by campaigning for daley 
jackson backed independent candidate timothy evans and shared 
his loss 
people are quick to say jackson failed here in chicago the 
twotime presidential candidate said but its not the winning or 
losing 
but in politics it often is the winning or losing or at least 
how people deal with triumph or defeat 
jackson quickly shifted to talk of building bridges but he left 
the burden on daley 
for democrats whove long been irritated by jacksons freelance 
manner of operating the chicago race offered hope that his 
influence was diminishing 
james ruvolo ohio democratic party chairman and head of the 
association of democratic state chairs speculated that jackson 
could lose support within the party because of his support of evans 
that might prove wishful thinking but other democrats also were 
assessing the impact of the mayoral race held on jacksons home 
turf 
jesses traveling extensively without portfolio politically 
said one democrat who insisted on anonymity 
yolanda caraway who was a top aide to jackson in his campaign 
for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination said he has 
heard from quite a few people who are urging him to run for mayor 
of washington dc a city troubled by a wave of drugrelated 
murders 
im very much for it said ms caraway 
the only office jackson has ever sought is president and some of 
his supporters believe he could strengthen his standing by winning 
another office 
brown clearly gained strength from the chicago contest and 
accomplished it without appearing too eager to provoke a 
confrontation with jackson 
a black lawyer brown was convention manager for jackson when 
the democrats met last summer in atlanta his tie to jackson was an 
argument used against him when he sought the party chairmanship 
when daley defeated incumbent mayor eugene sawyer for the 
democratic nomination brown quickly endorsed the nominee a step 
that brought an angry outcry from some blacks including rep gus 
savage who was backing evans 
despite denunciations from savage brown twice appeared in 
chicago to support daley 
jackson made it easier for the chairman by not making an issue 
of browns support for daley 
both the party chairman and the mayorelect were quick to issue 
unity appeals 
i pledge my help in bringing democrats together said brown 
daley whose father was chicagos mayor for 21 years succeeds a 
black incumbent and he pledged to bring top professional people 
black and white and hispanic and asian into city hall 
the victories of long and browder in the two house races this 
spring puts greater pressure on the republicans to hold the seat 
vacated by dick cheney of wyoming when he became secretary of 
defense 
cheney won the house seat in 1978 and it was considered solidly 
republican but the gop has no assurance of holding it in the 
special election scheduled for april 26 
democrat john vinich nearly upset republican sen malcolm wallop 
last november and is considered far better known than his gop 
opponent craig thomas 
asked about the republican prospects in wyoming john buckley 
spokesman for the house gop campaign committee said theyre 
tough theyre tough

at least 21 cubans who support the reforms of 
president mikhail s gorbachev have been arrested a leading 
dissident said wednesday the day the soviet leader left cuba 
most of those arrested had planned to take part in a 
progorbachev demonstration at the soviet embassy on tuesday night 
said elizardo sanchez a local human rights activist 
government spokesman have confirmed that some arrests were 
carried out starting tuesday morning but have not given precise 
figures 
among those arrested was samuel martinez lara leader of the 
prohuman rights party he was the principal organizer of the 
demonstration which was canceled 
there was a heavy police presence tuesday night outside the 
embassy where gorbachev attended a reception 
several people who were monitoring developments in the area were 
taken into custody sanchez and other witnesses said 
the demonstration was to have been aimed at seeking gorbachevs 
support for a liberalizing reform program in cuba similar to the 
one gorbachev has carried out in the soviet union 
sanchez who heads the cuban commission for human rights and 
national reconciliation said scores of others may also have been 
arrested but he could confirm only 21 
sanchez interviewed on cbs this morning said he was 
doubtful gorbachevs reforms had rubbed off on cuban leader fidel 
castro 
i did not have a great deal of hope he said we never 
expected miracles to result from this visit we trust more in what 
we cubans can do for ourselves

representatives of four major religions told a 
forum on in vitro fertilization wednesday they opposed test tube 
babies when donated sperm or ovum were used but would accept the 
technique under some circumstances 
addressing a forum on ethical aspects of the technique a roman 
catholic delegate said the vatican opposed in vitro fertilization 
jewish moslem and buddhist clerics said the practice could be 
sanctioned within defined limits 
all four religious groups however strongly opposed to carrying 
out experiments on human embryos as well as using sperm ovum or 
embryos donated by third parties for implantation in infertile 
women 
the mere fact that parents and doctors can play around with an 
embryo is very very dangerous sheikh t tabari a moslem 
cleric told doctors from 42 countries at the conference why 
approach even the boundaries of such dangers 
dr joseph schenker chief gynecologist at jerusalems hadassah 
hospital said religious opposition to sperm donation was reflected 
in its ban in 20 of the 59 countries practicing in vitro 
fertilization 
he said nations in the moslemdominated arab world and roman 
catholicdominated south america were among those banning the 
donations 
schenker said donation of female ovum was only practiced in 10 
countries among them the united states and australia 
tohru kotaki a professor of buddhism from japan said that 
while his religion tolerated test tube fertilization it opposed 
sperm ovum and embryo donation because they could lead to gene 
manipulation paid donorship and prejudice against any offspring 
produced 
we human beings dont have the wisdom to avoid these 
pitfalls kotaki said my standpoint is very conservative stop 
the donation of sperm and ovum 
rabbi shlomo goren a former israeli chief rabbi said judaism 
opposed sperm donation but exceptions could be made if the 
identity of the donor was made known 
the donor will always remain the father of the child as far as 
religious law is concerned goren said he said that among the 
reasons for jewish opposition to donorship was that it raised 
problems of identity including the possibility of incest between 
people who did not realize they were related 
dr rudolf klimek a polish gynecologist who represented the 
roman catholic point of view stated the vaticans opposition 
the vatican is against in vitro fertilization as a means of 
reproduction but accepts all babies born of the procedure 
klimek said he was working toward a technique for fertilizing 
eggs inside a womans body by taking the procedure from in vitro 
to in vivo we bring back the dignity he said 
doctors at the conference called on the clerics to demonstrate 
more tolerance toward couples faced with infertility 
people who come to us want a baby most of them are very 
religious said dr jean cohen of paris why dont you come to 
our clinics look at our research and make an effort to understand 
us

overall spending by state governments will 
exceed revenues in both fiscal 1989 and 1990 while emergency 
reserves will decline next year to their lowest level since the 
recession early in the decade the national governors association 
reported wednesday 
officials noted that the shift to deficit spending comes in the 
face of a healthy economy and expressed concern that a new 
downturn coupled with recent requirements for more state spending 
on health care education and prisons would make matters worse 
for now the majority of states remain on fair to good financial 
footing with much of the current stress centered in the northeast 
despite low unemployment and robust growth in personal income in 
that region of 10 states forced to trim their original 1989 
budgets half were in the northeast new york and massachusetts 
together accounted for 815 million of the 115 billion in overall 
cuts 
the governors association said 24 states are considering tax 
increases for 1990 with about half of those looking at boosts in 
personal income and business taxes increases in cigarette taxes 
ranging from 35 cents to 18 cents per pack have been proposed in 
10 states eleven governors are seeking to raise fuel taxes nine 
states are considering alcohol tax increases 
all states except vermont are barred by their constitutions or 
laws from deficit spending but many are increasingly dipping into 
past surpluses their socalled rainyday accounts to make up 
for revenue shortfalls 
the governors semiannual fiscal survey showed that overall 
the states ended fiscal 1988 with 98 billion in reserve but that 
total will drop to 9 billion in 1989 and 81 billion in 1990 
more alarming the amount available for fiscal emergencies will 
fall to 3 percent of total budgeted spending next year as 
expenditures continue to rise well below the 5 percent benchmark 
eyed required by wall street for superior bond ratings 
the projected 1990 reserve figure would be the lowest since the 
15 percent logged in the major recession year of 1983 and 
compares with 42 percent for fiscal 1988 and 35 percent for 1989 
the governors report compiled jointly with the national 
association of state budget officers asked if total reserves 
decline when the national economy is strong what will happen with 
the national economy weakens 
raymond c scheppach executive director of the governors 
association said federal spending constraints coupled with new 
laws requiring greater state spending on catastrophic health care 
and nursing homes both components of the medicaid program are 
at the root of the squeeze he also cited needs for more state 
spending on education and new corrections costs arising from 
longer prison terms and prison overcrowding 
he said the state governments are clearly at risk if there is 
an economic slowdown 
the report said the states will spend a total of 2553 billion 
against revenues of 2534 billion in 1989 with projections for 
expenditures of 2715 billion against revenues of 2682 billion 
in 1990 by contrast the states ended fiscal 1988 with a 68 
billion surplus 
state spending increased 7 percent in 1988 went up 8 percent 
this year and will climb at a pace of 64 percent next year the 
report said when measured against inflation real state spending 
increased 29 percent in 1988 and again this year and will go up 
at a slower 13 percent pace next year

the soviet union has sold libya from 12 to 15 
highperformance fighterbombers capable of striking longrange 
targets in the middle east and posing a potential threat to egypt 
and possibly israel bush administration officials said wednesday 
without confirming the transaction the state department sharply 
criticized libya and indirectly the soviet union 
the sale of any kind of sophisticated weaponry to libya would 
be a dangerous thing given libyan leader moammar gadhafis past 
behavor spokesman richard boucher said 
and he said if the soviets made such a deal we would be 
concerned 
because the transaction was uncovered through us intelligence 
administration officials publicly would neither deny nor confirm 
reports of it but privately officials speaking on the condition 
of anonymity said the soviets had begun delivery of the supersonic 
su24 fencers 
one official found even more disturbing soviet assistance to 
libya in lengthening the range of sovietbuild refueling planes he 
said that could pose a danger to egypt long at odds with libya 
and possibly with israel whose existence is hotly challenged by 
gadhafi 
we have long been concerned with gadhafis erratic and 
dangerous behavior boucher said libya continues to act in an 
unacceptable fashion particularly in its support for terrorism and 
international subversion 
he said the united states had talked to the soviets about arms 
sales in the region with soviet bombers libya could threaten all 
of its neighbors boucher said 
the su24 fencers which can fly within an 800mile radius 
without refueling were broken into pieces crated in large boxes 
and delivered to the libyans aboard soviet transport planes 
pentagon sources said 
the fencers whose cost was not known are likely to be based in 
eastern libya egypt is directly east of the north african country

people of northern namibia say heavy 
fighting between guerrillas and south africanled troops has left 
them confused and disappointed with the united nations but they 
remain loyal to the guerrillas 
many residents believed the un forces would be activated april 
1 and monitor a peaceful transition to independence for the 
mineralrich territory south africa has ruled for 74 years 
but at least 200 people have been killed since fighting erupted 
saturday according to south african officials who say most 
casualties belonged to the guerrilla southwest africa peoples 
organization the guerrillas say about 50 of those killed were 
civilians 
we are disappointed in the situation but we dont know who to 
blame said gabriel nekongo 38 who teaches near oshakati 
south africa says swapo sent 1400 guerrillas into the territory 
from bases in southern angola in a deliberate attempt to sabotage 
the peace process a un investigation found swapo fighters 
launched a major incursion into northern namibia according to 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
swapo which gets most of its military support from east bloc 
nations says the heavily armed guerrillas had been in the 
territory some time and acted only in selfdefense after south 
africanled security forces attacked them 
residents are not sure what to believe most have little 
education and rely largely on word of mouth newspapers are not 
readily available and the territorys television and radio stations 
are controlled by the south african government which most 
namibians regard with suspicion 
swapo draws most support from northern namibians who comprise 
about half the nations 13 million people residents say they 
still are loyal to the movement and doubt the organization 
intentionally would disrupt the independence process 
one rumor circulating is that the south africans dressed up 
prisoners and forced them to stage mock battles others say 
security forces have crossed into angola in pursuit of swapo 
guerrillas 
residents also say they have been disillusioned by the inability 
of the un peacekeeping troops to control events although 4650 
soldiers have been authorized for the namibia operation less than 
300 are in the northern war zone of this countr larger than the 
state of new mexico 
they will have to prove their credibility before we can trust 
them again said fobie jacobs who works at the human rights 
center in oshakati the un should send more troops to the 
north they should never have implemented independence without at 
least half of untag here he said of the un transition 
assistance group 
the few un troops present are often seen in the company of the 
security forces further undermining their credibility in the minds 
of many namibians 
a un soldier stands watch at the gate to oshakatis white 
township which includes military and police bases and a 
residential area reserved for whites 
a few un peacekeepers have been seen driving around oshakati 
but they maintain a low profile 
they come to the bottle liquor store then leave said one 
black businessman i guess they cannot talk to us i guess they 
have to be impartial

the bush administration on wednesday welcomed 
the polish accord recognizing the solidarity trade union movement 
suggesting the historic step will warm relations between 
washington and warsaw 
this is a great day for the polish people and for freedom 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
he said the united states was weighing a variety of economic 
moves aimed at encouraging the movement toward freedom in eastern 
europe 
fitzwater spoke soon after the communist government in warsaw 
signed a pact recognizing lech walesas trade union movement and 
clearing the way for the first free elections in postwar poland 
fitzwater said the united states hopes the agreement will 
eventually take poland far from totalitarianism and towards a 
better political and economic future 
fitzwater said bush administration officials are following the 
developments in poland closely and are consulting with congress and 
our friends and allies on this issue 
he noted that as vice president bush had traveled to poland in 
september 1987 visiting with both walesa and gen wojciech 
jaruzelski the communist party chief and that bush at the time 
urged dialogue and reconciliation to bring about economic growth 
and political freedom 
the president today is very pleased by the accords that have 
started poland on this new path of reconciliation fitzwater said 
a thaw in uspolish relations since early 1987 has led to the 
lifting of some sanctions washington imposed on the warsaw 
government after its military quashed the solidarity free trade 
union movement in december 1981 
asked whether the united states was willing to expand trade and 
commerce with poland in view of the latest accord fitzwater said 
we feel very confident about the process that is under way in 
poland 
he said that bush has talked of the american interest in 
promoting economic change and reform in that country and in 
fostering reconciliation now that we have these accords we are 
considering issues or moves that might be taken which would in 
various ways foster economic development and help move that 
process forward 
asked what steps were under consideration fitzwater said i 
dont have a timetable but we are looking at various actions 
that could be taken and hopefully within the nottoodistant 
future well have something to announce

a twin attack by minnesotas twin cities 
on plastic food packaging advanced wednesday with st paul 
embracing a tough prohibition that the industry is considered 
likely to challenge in court 
the city councils public works committee voted unanimously to 
approve an ordinance identical to one enacted friday across the 
mississippi river in minneapolis since the committee is made up of 
all seven council members its vote left little doubt how the 
council will vote on the issue on april 27 
the real theme behind all of this is to send a message to the 
industry that we can no longer continue to produce nonrecyclable 
food packaging said councilman bob long who wrote the ordinance 
and shared it with minneapolis we cannot afford it 
environmentally and we cannot afford it economically 
advocates say plastics take up too much space and do not 
decompose in landfills and cant safely be incinerated either 
but a plastics industry group whose 11 company members have 
committed 1 million a year toward addressing those concerns says 
the twin cities ordinances are unnecessary 
its not like we need to receive a message said roger 
bernstein whose washingtonbased council for solid waste solutions 
was formed in october 1988 
i think the twin cities are looking at more of a quick fix 
that gives them the appearance of having done something rather than 
working with the industry for a solution 
in testimony before the council dave locey of the minnesota 
soft drink association said you are giving no guidance to these 
people who manufacture the packaging as to what is environmentally 
safe 
he also argued that the ordinance is discriminatory in singling 
out plastic food packaging to regulate 
philip byrne an assistant city attorney responded that 
legislation doesnt have to address all aspects of a problem to be 
constitutional 
i have been assuming right from day one that there will be 
litigation on this ordinance he said 
the ordinances would prohibit grocery stores and restaurants 
primarily fastfood outlets from selling food wrapped in plastics 
that cant be recycled arent biodegradable or arent returnable 
among the items banned would be foam egg cartons and trays in 
meat packages plastic products shipped into the state such as 
ketchup bottles and peanut butter jars grocery bags drinking 
cups serving trays and plates 
the ordinances which would take effect july 1 1990 expand on 
less stringent laws adopted in new yorks suffolk county berkeley 
calif and portland ore long said 
suffolk county and berkeley dont include plastics shipped in 
portland only bans plastic foam he said 
in the twin cities exceptions would be made for packages that 
have no substitute such as microwave dinner trays and for plastic 
soda bottles and milk jugs provided the cities include them in 
curbside recycling programs 
the cities health commissioners would be empowered to make 
other exceptions for example if acceptable packaging would put a 
company at a clear economic disadvantage 
industry officials said they were trying to determine which 
products would be affected 
were still taking stock literally said joel hoiland 
president of the minnesota grocers association 
i would call it an administrative nightmare said raymond 
peterson of the amoco foam products co in chippewa falls wis 
the grocers group is turning its attention to a recycling bill 
pending in the state senate that would preempt local ordinances 
hoiland said 
john ruston of the nonprofit environmental defense fund in new 
york said that the local ordinances are a largely symbolic way of 
addressing a national environmental problem 
still he said i think it will cause some plastic packaging 
companies to realize they can hold a marketing advantage if there 
are products packaged in environmentally beneficial containers

a moscow official trounced in multiplecandidate 
elections acknowledged he and other party and government officials 
lost because voters are unhappy that economic reforms have not 
improved their lives 
moscow party second secretary yuri prokofiev said in an 
interview published wednesday that he lost his bid for a seat in a 
new parliament because voters blamed him for urban problems and the 
failure of national economic reforms to improve their standard of 
living 
my rivals did not have to answer any questions about the 
situation in the country the city the district i got such 
questions by the dozen he told the weekly moscow news 
prokofiev said he had been in his job for just a halfyear and 
that much of the criticism of the slow implementation of president 
mikhail s gorbachevs program of perestroika or overhaul of 
soviet society was unjustly leveled at him 
perestroika has been continuing already four years the 
moscow official said people want to see real changes there are 
some in thinking in culture in foreign policy and in that the 
people awoke to active political life 
but if youre speaking about economics then no radical 
changes have occurred yet people more than anything react to 
changes in their standard of living so i can understand their 
critical mood 
gorbachev said last week that party and government leaders lost 
in the march 26 elections because people were fed up with 
mismanagement he said the losers had been restructuring slowly 
and not expanding ties with workers 
the elections brought humiliating rejection for many top party 
officials in moscow leningrad kiev and elsewhere including some 
who were running unopposed candidates had to receive approval from 
more than 50 percent of the voters to win 
prokofiev won just 135 percent of the vote in the elections to 
the new 2250member congress of peoples deputies his opponent

the government on wednesday announced 
new measures to cut the number of poles who enter west germany on 
tourist visas illegally to work or sell goods 
they are also expected to reduce the number of poles applying 
for political asylum each year said government spokesman friedhelm 
ost 
under the measures polish citizens who apply for tourist visas 
will be required to carry the equivalent of 27 for each day of 
their visit those without the required money will be turned back 
at the border ost said 
he said west german authorities would be more stringent in 
granting visa requests and would deny visas to poles previously 
involved in illegal activities in west germany 
he said the new measures were aimed at discouraging poles from 
visiting west germany soley to earn hard currency 
west germany is the favored destination of thousands of poles 
who sell goods that they buy cheaply in poland or offer their labor 
at rates that undercut those of germans 
some poles say they earn in just three months in west germany 
what they would earn in a year in poland 
but the new restrictions were not meant to discourage poles from 
visiting or moving to west germany ost said 
juergen chrobog spokesman for the west german foreign ministry 
said he did not know how many poles worked illegally in west 
germany but estimated the number as tens of thousands 
according to government figures in 1988 29000 poles who 
entered west germany with a tourist visa later applied for 
political asylum only 26 percent of those applications were 
approved

first lady barbara bush kicking off a 
national campaign to end child abuse said wednesday that even 
small things can make a difference in preventing abuse 
sometimes its as simple as being a good neighbor listening 
to a young mother talk over a cup of coffee or even better 
offering to take the children for an hour or two she said 
addressing a news conference kicking off the sixth annual 
national child abuse prevention month the first lady said that 
its not enough to just feel and when we hear of a child whos 
been seriously injured or even killed to be sad thats not 
enough then its too late 
the time to get involved is before the blow lands 
she urged that if we know of a problem we should reach out 
to the parent and suggest they get help and if we know of a child 
who is at serious risk we must not be afraid to get involved even 
if that means picking up the phone and calling the authorities 
mrs bush led off a list of celebrity speakers including cheryl 
ladd efrem zimbalist jr edward woodward carol lawrence norm 
crosby and jack scalia who said he spoke as an adult survivor 
of abuse 
scalia said he suffered emotional and verbal abuse but he said 
it was just as devastating and carried some of the same 
consequences as physical abuse including drug and alcohol 
addiction 
scalia a former montreal expos baseball pitcher and 
international model turned actor who is now a regular on 
dallas said he kicked both alcohol and drugs but said the 
scars of his abuse remain 
my biggest phobia in life is what am i going to do if somebody 
ever loves me and what am i going to do when i have to love 
somebody else how do i do that scalia his eyes glistening with 
tears said to the hushed audience 
verbal assaults on children are the focus of a major new media 
campaign being coordinated by the advertising council a nonprofit 
organization established by the advertising industry to create 
public service ads addressing key issues 
the theme of the campaign is words can hit a child as hard as 
a fist said molly hudson senior vice president of lintas usa 
which is developing the print and video campaign 
a nationwide survey by the national committee for the prevention 
of child abuse estimated that more than 22 million child abuse 
reports were filed in 1988 an increase of 3 percent over the 
number reported in 1987 also last year more than 1200 children 
died as the result of maltreatment about 5 percent more than the 
previous year 
childhelp a national nonprofit organization involved in the 
treatment prevention and research of child abuse said its 
nationwide hotline 18004achild received 175000 calls last 
year up 18 percent from 1987

states would be encouraged to send counselors 
out into inner city neighborhoods and rural backwoods and set up 
onestop shopping centers for poor pregnant women in search of 
health care under federal legislation introduced wednesday 
the package is intended to complement recent expansions in 
medicaid eligibility which make free health care available for 
pregnant women with incomes up to 85 percent above official poverty 
lines 
while that additional coverage should go a long way toward 
raising the united states from 19th place among the worlds 
industrialized nations in infant mortality sen bill bradley 
dnj said the information barrier is another major hindrance 
if women are not aware the benefits are available or dont know 
how to get them he said then the programs dont do much good 
japan led the world with an infant mortality rate of 52 deaths 
per 1000 births in 1986 the last year full figures were 
available the united states was 19th with 104 deaths per 1000 
births 
bradley was among several senators and house members present at 
a news conference who serve double duty as members of the national 
commission to prevent infant mortality 
former sen lawton chiles of florida chairman of the 
commission said the legislation envisions setting aside 100 
million for distribution to states for starting outreach programs 
setting up telephone hot lines and generally trying to see that 
every pregnant woman gets the prenatal care to which she is 
entitled 
the commissions death before life report issued last august 
said 40000 infants die during the first year of life in the united 
states each year who could be saved with proper care 
while acknowledging the outreach programs would cost money 
chiles cited an institute of medicine report last year what 
concluded 3 is saved for every 1 spent on prenatal health care 
its not only the 40000 babies who die each year its the 
385000 who live but have serious handicaps said lynda robb a 
commission member 
bradley added that while the financial benefits to investing in 
prenatal care are real and documented there are more important 
considerations 
not only does this go to efficiency but to who we are as a 
people said bradley

soviets soon will get their first chance to read 
the secret speech that nikita s khrushchev gave 33 years ago 
condemning josef stalins bloody years in power 
soviet tv in its evening news broadcast vremya said a full 
text of the speech is contained in the april edition of news of the 
communist party central committee 
for years prominent soviets have called for the publication of 
khrushchevs speech at the 20th communist party congress on feb 
25 1956 three years after stalins death 
the text was leaked almost immediately to the west and some 
soviets learned about it from summaries read at party meetings at 
the time but for the soviet public at large the details of the 
speech have been a mystery 
in the speech on the cult of personality and its 
consequences khrushchev accused stalin of seriously damaging 
soviet society by purging the party he said stalin had used 
torture arrests and fabricated charges 
he did not tell the whole story of stalins crimes however 
omitting reference to stalins war against the peasants and 
ignoring khrushchevs own participation in the reign of terror 
khrushchev freed many people imprisoned under stalin and pulled 
back from other repressive measures but the destalinization 
stopped after khrushchev left office in 1964 president mikhail s 
gorbachev has resumed it and discussion of stalins repressions is 
now widespread 
the news of the communist party central committee is the same 
publication that in february printed another famous secret speech 
that of former moscow party boss boris n yeltsin in that speech 
delivered at a central committee meeting in october 1987 yeltsin 
said gorbachev was being glorified and that the soviet people had 
gained virtually nothing from the soviet leaders reforms 
the monthly says it has a circulation of 650000 but vremya 
said subscriptions were being expanded

in electrical transformers their production has been banned in 
canada

a jury on wednesday convicted a former 
librarian of all charges that he shot and killed six people and 
wounded 10 others in a rampage at two shopping centers in 1987 
william bryan cruse jr 61 stood with bowed head and crossed 
arms as circuit judge john antoon read off the 32 guilty verdicts 
there was no reaction or comment from the frail bearded defendant 
the jury deliberated 10 hours over two days before finding 
cruse guilty of six counts of firstdegree murder 22 counts of 
attempted firstdegree murder two counts of attempted 
seconddegree murder one count of kidnapping and one count of 
false imprisonment 
were happy that the jury rejected the insanity defense and 
found it was an act of coldblooded murder said state attorney 
norm wolfinger 
the sentencing phase of the trial in which jurors recommend a 
nonbinding verdict of death or a life sentence begins april 17 
just a week before the second anniversary of the rampage at two 
palm bay shopping centers 
it would be up to cruse to decide whether to appeal said public 
defender jr russo whose office represented the defendant 
ive said all along i wanted him found guilty that i wanted 
him executed and that i wanted to pull the switch said vi 
johnson mother of gerald johnson one of two police officers among 
the six people killed 
her 27yearold son lay wounded on the pavement next to his 
patrol car in the winndixie supermarket parking lot when cruse 
approached with his highpowered rifle and fired three more bullets 
into him 
the prosecution argued this was only one example rebutting 
defense contentions that the gunman was insane and didnt know what 
he was doing 
the defense argued that cruse had been mentally ill for years 
and was acting under delusions that everyone considered him 
homosexual psychiatrists on both sides of the issue agreed on his 
mental illness but disagreed sharply on the issue of legal insanity 
under florida law 
in addition to mental illness this requires a finding that the 
defendant not know what he was doing or the consequences and that 
he did not know it was wrong 
the shootout started when cruse drove up to the publix store 
after an afternoon of drinking beer he began firing from his car 
and almost immediately killed nobil alhameli 25 and altawakuly 
18 kuwaitis attending a local college as they emerged from a 
store 
cruse then drove across the street into sabal palm square got 
out of his car shot johnson and officer ronald grogan 28 and 
fired dozens of other shots as motorists and pedestrians fled and 
sought cover 
he killed 67yearold ruth green as she sat in her car he shot 
out the front windows of the winndixie store stormed in 
sporadically firing his semiautomatic ruger mini14 and sending 
dozens of shoppers fleeing out the back the sixth victim lester 
watson 51 was killed at that time 
cruse then found two store employees hiding in a restroom and 
forced them out he released one but held the other hostage for 
about seven hours at about 2 am he released her and police 
fired tear gas to force him out 
cruse has a history of mental instability and bizarre actions 
daing to the 1970s in his hometown of lexington ky according to 
psychiatrists and defense witnesses he came to florida in 1985 
his main trial lawyer marlene alva called cruse a madman a 
crazy person someone who went berserk 
wolfinger agreed cruse was mentally ill however thats not 
enough to find him legally insane he said we will seek the 
death penalty

that led to a 470 million settlement for victims of the bhopal gas 
leak 
the press trust of india news agency said a fivejudge panel 
asked the government to file an affidavit within three weeks 
disclosing all documents negotiations and people involved in the 
negotiations 
the panel headed by chief justice rs pathak said it was 
passing the order to ascertain whether the feb 14 settlement was 
reasonable pti said 
several opposition politicians and newspapers have termed the 
settlement inadequate the government originally sued union carbide 
for 3 billion in connection with the 1984 gas leak in bhopal 
more than 3000 people died and at least 20000 were injured 
when deadly methyl isocynate gas leaked dec 3 1984 from a 
pesticide plant run by the indian subsidiary of union carbide 
under a special law passed in parliament the government became 
the sole representative of more than 500000 people who claimed to 
be bhopal victims

petitions in the court 
a fivejudge panel of the court wednesday heard arguments by 
attorney raj kumar garg on one of the petitions

two lawmakers charged wednesday that the 
federal government hid the possibility of a major oil spill on the 
west coast and they called on president bush to cancel further oil 
leasing off california 
california democrats sen alan cranston and rep mel levine 
blamed the reagan administration for what they called a coverup 
and asked bush to review the oil leasing program 
the federal government refused to plan for a worstcase spill 
scenario in alaska and the result is one of the nations worst 
environmental disasters levine said now we learn that 
government tried to deliberately cover up information about spills 
in california 
levine released internal memoranda from officials of reagans 
interior department about the proposed lease sale in northern 
california in which warnings from the fish and wildlife service 
were dismissed by the minerals management service both agencies 
are under the jurisdiction of then secretary donald hodel a reagan 
appointee 
the material released today demonstrates the serious risks of 
spills the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology and other 
environmental damage from lease sale 91 in california and that 
the reagan administration tried to cover up that information 
said levine 
a spokesman for interior secretary manuel lujan asked for 
comment said the new interior secretary has made it clear he would 
not condone development unless it is environmentally prudent 
lujan is chairing a task force appointed by president bush to 
review the three california lease sales including lease sale 91 
scheduled for 1990 it will have its first meeting april 12 no 
action will be taken on the lease sales until the task force makes 
its report 
the task force might find that the lease sales should be 
stopped said the spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity 
levine said warnings from the fish and wildlife service about 
offshore drilling risks in california were deleted from the final 
draft of a minerals management service report last year 
he released a memo from steven griles then assistant interior 
secretary in charge of offshore development which said the fish 
and wildlife comments could prove very damaging to this lease 
sale 
several california newspapers last spring published stories 
about the disagreement between fish and wildlife and the minerals 
management at the time the interior department said the comments 
were being deleted because they were irrelevant and contained 
comments or opinions not supported by facts 
among the deletions levine said were warnings that tanker 
traffic is at high risk operating in rough seas current technology 
cannot effectively clean up a spill containment equipment is not 
deployable in severe weather and in calm weather it is only partly 
effective 
levine also released a memo from the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and one from the san francisco office of 
the environmental protection agency which said minerals management 
was playing down the environmental risks of an oil spill 
richard sanderson director of the office of federal activities 
for epa in washington disputed levines contention that epa 
headquarters tried to water down environmental concerns about oil 
leasing 
he said that the epa had strong environmental objections to 
lease sale 91 and gave it a rating so poor that it was nearly a 
veto 
as for the relationship between the california lease sales and 
what should have been known about the potential of a disaster in 
valdez sanderson said that was 20 years ago 
he said more is known now about the effects of oil spills then 
when the environmental impact statements were made giving the 
goahead for oil transportation out of prince william sound

reduce the impact of inflation now running at about 60 pecent 
annually solidarity and the government agreed that wages would be 
compensated at the rate of 80 percent of the inflation rate unless 
the payments would bankrupt the employer 
the government had originally opposed indexation saying it 
would fuel inflation the official trade union opzz raised an 
objection that the costofliving compensation should be 100 
percent not 80 percent and paid in a lump sum to workers rather 
than a percentage of their pay

including a daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one 
program a week on national tv and radio with a solidarity

sovereign control of an allotted block of tv and radio time

scandinavian airlines were put on a 
security alert after arab terrorists threatened to hijack a jet or 
attack an airport in the region an airline official said wednesday 
scandinavian airlines system received the threat tuesday 
through swedish security police said sas spokeswoman carina 
sandefjord 
its apparently a general threat against planes and airports 
in all scandinavian countries she said 
sas is owned by the governments of sweden norway and denmark 
but the threat also could apply to the several domestic airlines in 
the region she said 
the threat was made by an arab terrorist group she said 
declining to say which group was involved 
ms sandefjord said sas was not told whether the threat was 
delivered directly to swedish police or came from a foreign 
intelligence service 
three months ago sas received bomb threats against planes 
subsidiary airlines and hotels that sparked a worldwide security 
alert and delayed schedules for two weeks 
security was stepped up at all scandinavian international 
airports after the latest warning but since we dont know when 
or where the attack is supposed to take place it makes it very 
difficult ms sandefjord said 
on tuesday the us government said it would force airlines to 
take stricter antiterrorism measures in the wake of the december 
bombing of pan am flight 103 new security measures included the 
installation of devices to detect plastic explosives and stricter 
compliance with aviation and security warnings

communist vietnams announcement wednesday that it will withdraw 
all troops from cambodia by sept 30 appears to be a major first 
step toward diplomatic relations with the united states after more 
than 40 years of estrangement 
but a historic exchange of ambassadors between washington and 
hanoi still appears a way off 
a verifiable withdrawal of the estimated 70000 vietnamese 
troops in cambodia and compliance with other us demands including 
the restoration of peace and an elected government in a neutral 
nonaligned cambodia would remove major obstacles to us 
recognition 
diplomatic relations between the united states and vietnam would 
probably bring american aid which hanoi needs badly to catch up 
economically and technically with the rest of the world 
diplomatic recognition could expedite humanitarian concerns 
these include a quicker accounting of as many as possible of the 
2383 americans listed as missing in action and more rapid 
immigration to the united states of 10000 to 16000 amerasians 
children of american fathers and vietnamese mothers born during the 
war between 1963 and 1975 
ending the us trade embargo could open the way for american 
investment in vietnam including oil exploration and improve 
vietnams trade imbalance the country now imports three times more 
than what it exports 
realizing it cannot survive with 25 percent unemployment and 
high inflation vietnam appears to be emerging as more open and 
conciliatory it is opening its doors and its harbors even 
courting capitalism and welcoming american visitors back more than 
ever before 
vietnamese officials seem to think that the withdrawal of their 
troops from cambodia after 10 years will accommodate the united 
states and save vietnams failing economy vietnam has been 
ostracized and isolated from western aid because of its occupation 
of cambodia 
as the us has repeatedly said that they will normalize 
relations with vietnam after we withdraw all our forces from 
cambodia were now waiting to see if they keep their promise 
said ha huy thong a spokesman for vietnams permanent mission to 
the united nations 
thats not exactly what we said declared ken bailes a 
spokesman for the state departments office of vietnam laos and 
cambodia affairs 
we do believe that if the withdrawal is carried out it would 
be a positive development the state department said in a 
statement 
the us position is that it is prepared to move ahead with 
normalization of relations with vietnam once there is an acceptable 
settlement in cambodia of which the withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops is only one component 
we believe any agreement which fails to address cambodias 
future in a comprehensive manner would not be sustainable said 
bailes important differences remain particularly on the 
formation of an interim government pending elections 
as part of a comprehensive accord the united states has 
proposed safeguards against the return of the communist khmer 
rouge under whose reign an estimated 2 million cambodians 
onefourth of the countrys population were executed or died of 
famine 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousting the khmer 
rouge and installing a government headed by prime minister hun sen 
vietnamese troops have kept hun sen in power by beating back a 
coalition of cambodian resistance forces led by prince norodom 
sihanouk the coalition consists of two noncommunist factions and 
the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge backed by china is by far the strongest of the 
three factions 
the united states believes that in any acceptable settlement 
sihanouk a former cambodian leader during the american war must 
head the interim government preceding elections this is another 
stumbling block in usvietnamese relations 
hun sen opposes the demand that his government be set aside in 
favor of an interim government he and sihanouk are scheduled to 
meet in jakarta indonesia on may 2 in efforts to reach an 
agreement

to defraud federal tax collectors and conspiring to deliberately

headquarters in 1987 to cap an investigation by the virginia 
attorney generals office into allegations that larouche supporters 
secured loans under false pretenses 
the trial of other defendants has been moved to roanoke 
officials said 
some of ms aschers fellow defendants and several former 
members of the larouche organization testified for the prosecution 
describing the groups fundraising methods the money paid for 
larouche publications his leesburg safe house and television 
commercials during his presidential bids 
during the trial ms ascher testified she was aware of some 
problems with repaying loans she said however there was never 
a policy against repaying the loans 
ms ascher who left a teaching position at the medical college 
of virginia in richmond in 1980 to join the larouche organization 
was a victim of poor recordkeeping her attorney contended during 
the trial

for distribution to schools and other domestic programs in 
addition the department soon will begin buying canned luncheon 
meat including pork he said

a couple want an appellate court to 
reconsider a decision they say could keep them from getting to know 
a girl they believe is their daughter lost in a hospital baby swap 
a decade ago 
ernest and regina twigg of langhorne pa asked the 2nd 
district court of appeal in lakeland on tuesday to reconsider a 
ruling last month ordering them to suspend their quest unless they 
prove it wont hurt the 10yearold sarasota girl they suspect is 
their natural daughter 
before a judge orders genetic testing of kimberly mays the girl 
the twiggs believe is their daughter the twiggs must be specific 
about what kind of relationship they want with the girl and must 
prove their search wont harm her a threejudge panel said last 
month 
the ruling backed robert mays a sarasota roofing contractor who 
said his daughter kimberly might suffer emotional harm if forced to 
undergo a genetic test that could threaten her sense of security 
the twiggs believe their newborn daughter was swapped 10 years 
ago at a wauchula hospital for the child of mays and his late wife 
barbara 
the child raised by the twiggs named arlena died of congenital 
heart disease in 1988 tests showed arlena was not related to 
either ernest or regina twigg 
the twiggs later asked a sarasota circuit judge to determine 
whether kimberly is their child mays has resisted efforts to test 
kimberly saying he will not jeopardize his custody of the daughter 
he has raised and loved 
john blakely the twiggs attorney asked to make oral arguments 
before the appellate court for review by all 12 judges or for the 
court to refer the key questions to the florida supreme court 
at the heart of the case is whose interests the court should 
consider 
the appellate judges said the childs welfare supersedes the 
rights of the parents blakely disagrees saying the ruling 
overlooks the twiggs constitutional right to custody of a natural 
child 
after the twiggs declare what sort of relationship they seek 
with kimberly the appellate panel said a circuit judge would have 
to determine if she would be hurt by such a relationship before 
allowing a genetic test 
mays attorney arthur ginsburg could not be reached wednesday 
his assistant judy lee said he had not read the court documents 
and wouldnt comment until he did

a courtappointed translator said 
wednesday one voice in a dramatic conversation recorded between a 
hijacked twa jetliner and beirut airport likely is that of 
confessed air pirate mohammed ali hamadi 
the frankfurt court also heard wednesday that the lebanese 
shiite moslem terrorist was 21 years old at the time of the 1985 
hijacking and a document he produced claiming he is several years 
younger is forged the ruling will affect sentencing 
hamadi is charged with murder and piracy us navy diver robert 
stethem was murdered and 39 americans were held hostage 17 days 
during the ordeal 
on wednesday the court played a tape recording made after the 
hijacked airliner which was flying from athens to rome landed at 
beirut airport on june 14 1985 
the tape recorded the crews pleas to land at beirut with one 
saying he a hijacker has two hand grenades we must land at 
beirut no alternative 
it includes sounds of the crew being beaten and a shout of 
help 
later after the plane landed and the hijackers demands for 
fuel were not quickly met a crewman shouts they are threatening 
to kill the passengers they are beating the passengers we want 
the fuel now immediately 
at one point an excited voice tells the tower in arabic our 
grenade is armed our weapons are ready if something doesnt 
happen in 1 minutes i will throw out the first corpse 
the following day stethem was shot and his body was thrown onto 
the airport tarmac hamadi says stethem was killed by his 
accomplice hassan ezzedine who is a fugitive 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger asked translator chesar magdi 
for her opinion of the arabic voice on the tape obtained from the 
british broadcasting corp 
mrs magdi is considered an expert on hamadis speech pattern 
she told the court she felt hamadi had not spoken on another tape 
produced by the fbi 
she described that voice as deeper than hamadis and said the 
arabic dialect used for the word minute did not match hamadis 
however she said the hijackers voice on the bbc tape is more 
the lighter voice the use of the word minute i mentioned earlier 
also matches the bearded hamadi sat quietly showing no reaction 
also wednesday mueckenberger said lebanese officials confirmed 
that a verification document listing hamadis birthday as july 15 
1968 is forged hamadi is being tried by a juvenile court because 
of conflicting claims with court records showing he was born june 
13 1964 under west german law hamadis maturity at the time of 
the hijacking could affect his sentence

president bush is seriously considering 
proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges a senior 
administration official said wednesday 
discussing bushs thinking on the condition he not be named 
publicly the official also said that the presidential pay raise 
recommendation could come in conjunction with an ethics bill to be 
sent to capitol hill next week 
but this official also said that no finaldecision memo has 
yet reached bushs desk for the presidents consideration 
last week bush said he would make very specific proposals 
on pay increases for top federal officials even though congress 
two months ago rejected a proposal that would have given lawmakers 
a 50 percent pay raise 
that proposal advanced by the commission on legislative 
executive and judicial salaries would have included hikes for 
federal judges and approximately 7000 top executives 
the bush administration official said wednesday that among 
other options still under consideration at the white house was a 
series of pay hikes for certain categories of federal officials 
rather than an acrosstheboard raise 
the washington post reported in its wednesday editions that bush 
would propose a 25 per pay hike for the judges most federal judges 
now make 89500 per year the same salary as members of congress 
and top federal officials 
an administration source said that bush had not yet settled on a 
figure but another official noted that a commission studying 
federal jobs had recommended a 25 percent pay raise and that that 
figure was the one being focused on by the white house the 
commission headed by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker 
made its report public late last month 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine a former 
federal judge himself said wednesday that it was premature to 
speculate on what is not yet a recommendation 
mitchell said no one had talked to him from the 
administration about a pay raise for federal judges 
as for separating congress from the pay raises mitchell said 
there appears to be a widespread feeling that delinking salaries 
would make it more difficult for members of congress ever to get 
increases in pay

about 50 protesters shouting nazis 
out crashed a rally led by a former nazi ss soldier on wednesday 
night and were thrown out by participants 
witnesses said fistfights broke out between some demonstrators 
and participants acting as security guards in the crowded community 
center in the bonn suburb of bad godesberg 
about 1200 members of the ultrarightist republican party and 
their supporters gathered at the hall for the first national rally 
held by the party 
outside about 700 people protested in a driving rain 
demonstrators threw eggs at helmeted riot police and shoving 
matches broke out between some protesters and republican supporters 
several hundred police officers some with attack dogs manned 
barricades in the area 
activists who say the republican party harbors antisemitic and 
neonazi sentiments had vowed to disrupt the rally and about 50 
demonstrators sneaked in using phony invitations 
when party leader franz schoenhuber began to deliver his speech 
the infiltrators began shouting nazis out 
most of the protesters were thrown out but some who were quiet 
during the initial outbreak remained five of them leaped up and 
blasted air horns when schoenhuber began explaining his service as 
a nazi ss soldier during world war ii 
this is a neofascist party and must be stopped said klaus 
drosten one of those evicted from the hall we find it 
frightening that this party is becoming a rallying point for 
nationalist zealots 
schoenhuber 66 told his supporters i am not a nazi i am a 
german patriot 
he also predicted that the republicans would become a prominent 
political party 
next year we will be thousands and in three years we will be 
hundreds of thousands i promise you that in 1990 we republicans 
will be the thirdstrongest party in the federal republic he 
said 
the party now has 13000 members 70 percent of them under 30 
years old schoenhuber said 
leftwing organizations accuse the republicans of being 
neofascist and hostile toward the millions of foreign workers and 
immigrants living in west germany 
the party surprised many when it won 75 percent of the vote in 
berlin elections in january with a campaign that called for halting 
the influx of foreigners seeking asylum some fear the foreigners 
are taking jobs and housing from native west germans 
more than 200000 immigrants of german descent arrived in west 
germany last year from the soviet union poland and other east 
european nations more than 50000 other foreign workers won 
political asylum 
we are of the opinion that the country can no longer bear the 
economic costs of allowing guest workers from turkey to seek asylum 
here schoenhuber said at the rally 
he said his position was grounded in economics not racism 
he also disclosed he was earlier married to an american and 
that his 29yearold daughter susanne schoenhuberbaer lives and 
works in washington 
schoenhuber said he was never a member of the nazi party and 
dismissed his service as a ss soldier as the freely taken 
decision of an 18yearold attracted by uniforms and adventure

four political parties planned wednesday to form a 
coalition shadow government they hope will govern if a major 
stockprofiteering scandal forces prime minister noboru takeshita 
to resign 
party leaders planned an opposition summit for friday as 
takeshita suffered another blow news reports that the company at 
the scandals center contributed 381700 to fundraising parties 
for him in may 1987 
despite public opinion polls showing his popularity as low as 9 
percent takeshita refuses to resign instead he vows to make 
reforms and regain public trust 
the proposed opposition coalition excludes the japan communist 
party which has differences with most other parties prospective 
coalition partners also differ over such issues as usjapan 
security arrangements the two koreas and atomic power plants 
their leaders however propose setting those aside to work for 
takeshitas downfall 
they plan to meet friday in kyoto western japan to discuss 
strategy against takeshitas liberal democratic party which holds 
297 of the 512 seats in the parliaments lower house and 143 of 
the 252 in the upper house 
takako doi chairman of the largest opposition japan socialist 
party told reporters tuesday the only alternative left for the 
government is to resign en masse and accept the peoples judgment 
at elections 
others in the proposed coalition are komeito or clean 
government party the democratic socialist party and the united 
social democratic party 
takeshita disclosed friday that recruit co spent 152700 on a 
fundraising party for him in may 1987 when he was a leading 
contender for prime minister 
the nationwide newspaper asahi shimbun and others reported 
wednesday that takeshita received another 229000 from recruit at 
another fundraising party that month 
takeshita refused to comment i do not have detailed 
information he told reporters 
but one of his aides speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed recruit had bought tickets to the second party though he 
did not know how many 
recruit an information services conglomerate sold 
bargainpriced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150 
influential politicians bureaucrats and businessmen who profited 
handsomely when public trading began 
so far 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on 
charges of bribery or violating securities laws in the deals three 
cabinet ministers linked to the scandal have resigned 
japanese politicians customarily use fundraising parties to 
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations large 
corporations buy large blocks of party tickets but takeshita 
acknowledged last week that recruits purchases were slightly 
excessive 
such parties are considered legal as long as the price of each 
ticket is within the range of common sense and the number of 
tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of what a company 
can possibly use a home affairs official said on condition of 
anonymity 
with his ties with recruit coming into light bit by bit 
takeshitas already faltering leadership is deteriorating 
rapidly asahi shimbun said in a wednesday editorial 
at least 17 politicians including former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone have been implicated in the scandal none has 
been arrested but prosecutors still are questioning politicians 
and their aides

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
wednesday he was encouraged by suggestions by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir for settling the arabisraeli dispute and 
hoped they would form a basis for advancing peace in the middle 
east 
while us and israeli officials would not say what baker and 
shamir had discussed the prime minister said last week he would 
propose holding elections among palestinian arabs under isareli 
control to select their leaders for talks with his government 
avi pazner the prime ministers media adviser said shamir and 
baker had decided not to say anything not to reveal anything 
about shamirs proposals pazner did say that a joint group of 
israeli and us officials had beeb convened to discuss the 
suggestions in advance of shamirs meeting thursday with president 
bush 
meanwhile egyptian president hosni mubarak in an interview 
with cable news network said shamirs proposal for elections 
without the participation of the palestine liberation organization 
if carried through will be a grave mistake it will not solve 
the problem 
baker after his twohour meeting with shamir called their talk 
very productive useful and very friendly 
for his part shamir said he had offered some ways to solve 
problems in the mideast and remarked 
i feel we have started a very serious discussion our 
conversation was very friendly 
there were widespread expectations before shamirs meeting with 
baker that the bush administration would talk a tough stance toward 
israel a senior us official briefing reporters at the white 
house on tuesday under rules of anonymity prediced a candid 
discussion the diplomatic way of predicting disagreements 
but pazner told reporters afterward i didnt see any 
hardening of position 
shamir said last week he would propose elections among the 14 
million palestinian arabs who live under israeli control on the 
west bank and in gaza with the aim of picking leaders to negotiate 
with israel over the palestinians future 
israel has controlled the west bank and gaza since its lightning 
victory over egypt jordan and syria in the 1967 sixday war on 
monday bush called on israel to end what he said was its 
occupation as part of an overall settlement with the arabs 
since december 1987 when the palestinians launched a concerted 
campaign to challenge israel the territories have been shrouded by 
violence in which 419 palestinians and 18 israelis have died 
shamir has ruled out negotiating with the palestine liberation 
organization which he holds responsible for that violence and for 
an unceasing campaign of terrorism against israel 
he told a conference of jewishamerican organization leaders 
that sitting with the plo would bring disaster 
instead he has sought to revive the 1978 camp david agreements 
promise of a transitional period of autonomy for the palestinians 
and then negotiations for an overall settlement 
the prime minister has made some suggestions baker said 
we are going to continue our discussion with the objective of 
moving the peace process forward if its possible to do so they 
were very encouraging hopefully they will form the basis under 
which we can move the peace process forward 
shamir followed mubarak to washington the egyptian leader said 
toward the end of his visit on tuesday that he saw no way to stop 
the violence in the territories 
if anybody could stop it we would be very pleased mubarak 
said asking but how 
baker suggested last month that israel might have to talk to the 
plo with which the united states opened its first talks in 
december 
mubarak in the cnn interview said he would like bush to 
explain to shamir that a mideast peace conference would lead to 
direct arabisrael peace talks 
such a conference would not have the power to dictate to either 
the israelis or the arabs or veto their decisions and shamir 
knows this mubarak said 
direct negotiations will be coming by hook or by crook through 
this international conference he said 
shamir is reluctant to enter a peace conference in which the 
soviet union might play a prominent role he is concerned the 
soviets would be inclined to favor the arabs

legislation to stem the crass 
commercialization of childrens television was introduced in the 
house and senate on wednesday to the applause of public groups 
trying to reduce the amount of cereal toy and candy advertising on 
the programs 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said he was cosponsoring the 
senate measure on behalf of his six grandchildren and all the 
nations youngsters 
he said broadcasters have failed to meet their obligations to 
children and it was necessary therefore for congress to 
intervene since the federal communications commission repealed ad 
restrictions on childrens television in 1984 
the fccs handsoff approach has created an environment where 
broadcasters have focused not on childrens developmental needs but 
on crass commercialism cash cash and more cash metzenbaum 
said 
the bill sponsored by metzenbaum and sen frank lautenberg 
dnj in the senate would limit ads on childrens shows to 10 
minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays 
effective next year 
it also would require the fcc to consider how well a broadcaster 
has been committed to the educational and informational needs of 
children in its overall programming 
the house and senate bills are virtually identical to 
legislation passed by congress last year but vetoed by 
thenpresident reagan 
rep edward markey dmass said the bills were adopted in 
cooperation with the three major television networks the national 
association of broadcasters and the association of independent 
television stations 
this legislation is needed to ensure that broadcasters treat 
children as consumers of information and new ideas not just 
consumers of candy cereal and toys markey said 
markey is chairman of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee which will hold 
hearings on the bill thursday 
the bill was introduced in the house by reps john bryant 
dtexas matthew rinaldo rnj and terry bruce dill and had 
14 cosponsors 
the legislation has wide support from psychiatric health and 
educational groups and has been a 20year aim of peggy charren of 
action for childrens television in boston 
charren who introduced each lawmaker at the news conference 
said the bill would impose on broadcasters the three rs of 
television restriction requirement and reporting 
she said it was a costeffective way to provide information 
and education to young audiences without raising taxes without 
raising the deficit

the veterans affairs department doesnt intend 
to close any of its hospitals but may change some of their 
assignments the head of the newest cabinet department said 
wednesday 
all 172 veterans hospitals cannot be allpurpose entities 
secretary edward derwinski said in answering questions after a 
luncheon speech at the national press club 
logically there has to be a degree of specialization 
veterans hospitals already have scores of agreements for using 
military hospitals and vice versa and derwinski said he hopes to 
expand those he did not directly answer when asked what he thought 
of merging the veterans and military hospital systems 
we have if anything a shortage of facilities derwinski 
said he and other officials have said they expect that as the 
nations 27 million veterans age many will retire to the sunbelt 
putting pressure on veterans facilities in those states 
we have no intention whatsoever of closing any veterans 
medical facilities derwinski said in addition to the hospitals 
the department operates 226 outpatient clinics and dozens of other 
installations 
derwinski served 24 years in the house as a republican from the 
chicago suburbs he told his audience that he well recognized that 
all members of congress must try to protect the federal 
installations in their districts and were going to cooperate 
with them 
to demonstrate that this must not be a parochial issue let me 
cite the example of chicago my own home base there are four va 
medical centers in the chicago area three of them within 12 miles 
of one another he said in a passage in his prepared text that he 
did not deliver 
our ability to provide quality care to veterans in the future 
with some degree of geographic equity depends on a serious review 
of the costs of duplication and other problems posed by overlapping 
services the text continued 
on other subjects derwinski said 
he will appoint a totally balanced objective group to try 
to reach consensus and advise him within 90 days on what to do 
about agent orange the departments predecessor agency the 
veterans administration maintained there was no evidence that 
soldiers exposed to the herbicide in vietnam suffered adverse 
health effects many veterans advocates say they did 
reporters should investigate what were doing you help me 
shake up the system and make it work better by reporting problems 
veterans organizations are not really a powerful lobby but 
are among the rare lobbies that have no opposing lobbies nobody 
in his right mind is against veterans

australias most wanted man an 
apparent fugitive from west germany sought here for the theft of 
33 million in cash was captured wednesday after a twoweek 
manhunt that stretched across the outback 
john friedrich was caught outside a gasoline station near perth 
the capital of western australia state after driving 1850 miles 
across the continent in a used station wagon purchased for 11750 
in cash 
police said friedrich who had shaved off his distinctive beard 
offered no resistance there was no word about the missing millions 
friedrich became the target of a nationwide hunt after he 
vanished from melbourne on march 21 leaving the countrys largest 
civilian search and rescue company 180 million in debt and near 
collapse 
he became chief executive of the nonprofit national safety 
council of australia in 1986 and transformed it from a oneaircraft 
operation into a fleet reaching into the south pacific 
employees described friedrich as charismatic and a real 
charmer and newspapers said he duped financial institutions here 
and abroad into lending him millions of dollars based on false 
invoices for equipment that was supposed to serve as collateral 
the case caused a sensation in australia with news media 
alleging friedrich had links the cia or other foreign intelligence 
organizations flew espionage flights across the outback and 
dabbled in arms and drugs trafficking 
authorities caught up with him after a tipoff that his vehicle 
was abandoned north of perth on monday 
police said they were not sure that friedrich was even his real 
name or whether he was an australian citizen or an illegal 
immigrant 
a west german newspaper said friedrich appeared to be a 
friedrich hohenberger who apparently faked his own death in 1974 
after defrauding a west german construction firm of 200000 
friedrichs wife shirley had pleaded tearfully on national 
television for her husband to come home to the children and clear 
up this mess 
prime minister bob hawke called media claims of intelligence 
involvement fanciful defense minister kim beazley rejected 
suggestions friedrich used his operation to infiltrate sensitive 
intelligencegathering bases jointly operated with the united 
states as well as australian military installations 
the national safety council of australia based in victoria 
state had a fleet of about 32 aircraft and employed a staff of 450 
last year friedrich was awarded the nations highest honor the 
order of australia

the super collider is virtually devoid of 
support in the scientific community a pennsylvania republican 
told congress wednesday during a hearing to review the selection 
process that awarded the 46 billion particle accelerator to texas 
the real question is not how it is now where not when it is 
if it will be built rep don ritter said after the house 
committee hearing the real issue is are we going to commit 10 
billion 
ritter said he has found a decided lack of interest within 
the engineering and scientific community and even hostility 
toward the proposed spending of what he estimates as 10 billion 
over the next decade on the highenergy physics project 
the energy department estimates construction costs at 46 
billion 
ritter said scientists outside the highenergy physics community 
were never involved in congress decision to pursue construction of 
the collider which backers hope will help science better 
understand the fundamental nature of matter 
this program is virtually devoid of support from the 
scientific and engineering community ritter told the house 
science space and technology committee 
rep ralph hall a texas democrat and member of the committee 
said he agrees there is some opposition to the project in the 
scientific community as well as support 
its hard for me to believe theres quote no support at any 
level of science hall said i think there is some support for 
it but its correct to say theres some opposition 
the subcommittee on energy research and development was 
scheduled to decide thursday whether to authorize construction of 
the project but officials say the real battle in congress will be 
over the level of financing and what is essential to begin actually 
building the 53mile underground tunnel on farmland south of dallas

the former threeterm mayor ousted the 
incumbent threeterm mayor in an mayoral election that observers 
said wednesday was dominated by image rather than substance 
paul soglin a former antiwar demonstrator who was mayor from 
1973 to 1979 garnered almost 57 percent of tuesdays vote in 
defeating threeterm incumbent joseph sensenbrenner 
joe carried a lot of image baggage of joe the bumbler 
city council president ron trachtenberg a sensenbrenner supporter 
said wednesday in trying to form consensus quietly he was seen 
as a wimp which he shouldnt be seen as 
soglin also brings political baggage to the mayors office said 
local politician rick berg it remains to be seen whether this is 
the same old paul soglin or a new paul soglin he said 
soglin whose legacy as an antiwar protester in the 1960s 
helped put him in the mayors office during his previous three 
terms recaptured his old job by running as a fiscal conservative 
although he still describes himself as a political liberal 
i think i got greater support among conservatives because they 
felt i could handle budget issues better better than before and 
better than sensenbrenner soglin said 
with all 66 wards counted in the college city of 175000 
residents soglin had won with 34537 votes to 26280 votes for 
sensenbrenner 
meanwhile state elections officials said a recount was probable 
after close results on a constitutional amendment regarding 
property tax relief 
the unofficial result was 404758 against the referendum and 
404403 in favor of it 
the amendment would change the state constitution to allow 
selective property tax relief its complicated longwinded wording 
made the measure especially difficult for voters to understand

a strike called by sinhalese 
extremists to commemorate a rebellion 18 years ago brought activity 
to a halt nationwide wednesday and three people were killed the 
military said 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said the government planned to 
offer a ceasefire to the extremists who belong to the marxist 
peoples liberaton front he said the offer probably would be made 
next wednesday 
bombs exploded in colombo and other towns and an army officer 
was killed when he tried to defuse a bomb in the town of 
ambalantota 90 miles south of colombo said the military 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said the extremists shot two people in the central district 
of kandy but did not give further details 
three police officers were injured in a blast in the town of 
panadura 10 miles south of the capital explosions also were 
reported in a colombo suburb 
the leftist sinhalese militants have been waging their latest 
antigovernment rebellion since 1987 
they called the strike to commemorate the april 5 1971 
uprising against the government as many as 20000 people were 
believed to have died before the rebellion was crushed 
the government then outlawed the peoples liberation front but 
it regrouped in 1986 
wednesdays strike call was a virtual rejection of earlier peace 
proposals by president ranasinghe premadasa who has offered the 
sinhalese militants unconditional amnesty seats in parliament and 
money for their weapons if they end the fighting 
residents in southern sri lanka the sinhalese heartland said 
the strike had crippled daily life 
there is heavy patrolling by troops and police but everything 
is at a standstill said a trader in galle 70 miles south of 
colombo shops banks offices and businesses never opened and 
even the small tea kiosks put up shutters 
the trader contacted by telephone spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
most of the shops businesses and government offices in colombo 
were closed and heavily armed troops and police patrolled the 
streets 
an associated press photographer and two other cameramen were 
detained by police when they tried to take pictures of soldiers 
breaking into closed shops in the town of kalutara 25 miles south 
of colombo they were released after two hours in custody 
the militants began their current campaign against the 
government to thwart a peace accord aimed at ending fighting by 
tamil rebels the sinhalese say the accord would give too many 
concessions to the minority community 
the predominantly hindu tamils comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people but they are a majority in the northern 
province sinhalese buddhists make up 75 percent of the population 
and control the government and the military 
tamil militants want an independent homeland in the islands 
north and east they began fighting in 1983 claiming the sinhalese 
have discriminated against them in jobs and education 
premadasa also has offered his peace proposals to the tamil 
rebels but they have not yet responded 
more than 12500 people in the island nation in the indian ocean 
have been killed in the tamil insurrection and the sinhalese 
backlash

here are excerpts of remarks by lech 
walesa founder of solidarity and interior minister czeslaw 
kiszczak at the conclusion wednesday of negotiation between the 
government and opposition as translated by the associated press 
walesa there is no freedom without solidarity this is truth 
with which we came to the round table 
in the speech that i delivered at the opening of the talks i 
said that our country was ruined and it was hard for working people 
to live i said it was not dwarfs who were to blame for it but the 
system which we did not choose for ourselves 
at the round table we met with people of this system and we 
became convinced that they are aware of that fact by starting 
talks with us by allowing our uncensored remarks on television 
they gave proof of readiness for a radical change of the system 
nine weeks of talks about the most important problems of our 
fatherland made us realize that in the situation where we are now 
there cannot be any talk about trading between sides but only 
about the great concern that everybody who feels responsible for 
poland carries 
as a nation we are either able to build by peaceful means a 
poland independent sovereign safe through equal alliances or we 
will drown in the chaos of demagogy and as a result of a civil 
war in which there will be no winners 
this way together we discuss the repair of the peoples 
republic but i also have to say that for those i am addressing 
now and on whose behalf i am speaking freedom goes together with 
bread 
we are changing political structures in order to have my gdansk 
shipyard and thousands of factories steel works and mines with 
it live a life for the good of the country that the worker or 
farmer member of the intelligentsia or a pensioner can live in 
dignity and without poverty which humiliates through fear 
we want a normal life and reforms have to serve this purpose 
kiszczak we came a long distance to the round table we covered 
a difficult road thus one should value the agreement achieved 
a truly common work has been accomplished common is the 
achievement and satisfaction resulting from it it would be bad if 
speculations appeared about who has won and how much and who has 
lost and how much 
there is only one winner the nation our fatherland even at 
the most difficult moments of the debates we were accompanied by 
the hopes of polish society 
a part of the divergencies remained but there is nothing 
strange in that differences exist and they will appear in the 
future such is the nature of society 
however the feeling of joint responsibility for the course of 
events should lead to moderating them the essence is to create 
effective instruments to overcome discrepancies not keeping them 
secret or remaining silent about them 
the round table was the first extremely significant step toward 
this this is why the dialogue can turn out to be a priceless 
element in the accomplishments of our work

a suburban virginia congressman citing the 
drugrelated crime in the district of columbia and the homicides 
associated with it introduced legislation wednesday to give the 
federal government control of the citys public safety system 
rep stan parris rva said mayor marion s barry jr and 
other city officials have not found creative and effective ways of 
dealing with the citys crime problem 
what we are experiencing here is as much a crisis of 
leadership and resources as it is a crisis of death and social 
destruction parris said at a news conference i think this is 
the only approach to a situation that has literally resulted in a 
criminal justice breakdown 
parris bill would authorize president bush to appoint a 
national capital public safety administrator who would have 
authority over the citys police and fire departments its 
emergency ambulance service and its prison and court systems 
the legislation comes amid a wave of crime and violence that has 
thrust washingtons drug problem into the international limelight 
through wednesday 130 people had been killed in the city 
compared with 86 at the same time last year in 1988 a record 372 
persons were killed and police blame drugs particularly crack 
cocaine for more than 60 percent of those killings 
meanwhile sen pete domenici rnm said during a senate 
committee hearing on the district of columbia that he is very 
pleased with the city police departments efforts to close a crack 
house located near the catholic school where the senators son 
teaches 
they are doing everything they possibly can to close down the 
crack house said ari fleischer a spokesman for domenici its 
to say that sen domenici is very pleased with the police reaction 
and were confident the matter will be resolved 
while the parris bill does not call for more federal money for 
the citys antidrug efforts it requests more federal personnel be 
brought into the citys drug war 
the bill directs attorney general dick thornburgh to authorize 
federal marshals in maryland and virginia to work on city antidrug 
efforts and requests federal officials to appoint more judges to 
the dc superior court in order to handle the flow of drug cases 
the only authorization of federal money in the bill would be for 
additional jail space but only if the prison is constructed within 
the city

the un food and agriculture organization says 15 
developing countries require exceptional or emergency 
assistance to make up for serious food shortages 
in a confidential report obtained by the associated press 
wednesday the romebased agency listed the countries as angola 
bangladesh ethiopia haiti jamaica laos lebanon mozambique 
nicaragua peru sierra leone somalia sri lanka sudan and 
vietnam 
it said these nations suffered an exceptional shortfall in 
food supplies due to crop failures natural disasters interruption 
of imports disruption of distribution or other factors 
the report also listed 11 countries with unfavorable crop 
prospects this year algeria angola argentina lesotho morocco 
mozambique nicaragua peru sri lanka tunisia and zimbabwe 
fao directorgeneral edouard saouma said poor countries will be 
hard hit this year by an overall increase of more than 5 billion 
in the purchase price of food imports the figure is projected to 
reach 176 billion up from 123 billion last year 
the increases will further worsen the balance of payments 
position of many of the lowincome food deficit countries saouma 
said in a speech monday to the faos committee on world food 
security which is meeting this week in rome 
he said many developing countries will also be hurt by a 
significant decrease in food aid shipments partly due to 
inadequate contributions to the international emergency food 
reserve shipments this year are estimated at 97 million tons 
about onefourth less than last year he said 
saouma said world production of staple foods fell below 
consumption in 1988 for the second straight year mainly due to 
drought in the united states and canada 
as a result world grain stocks have dropped to 16 percent of 
annual consumption requirements the lowest ratio since the world 
food crisis of the early 1970s 
fao had estimated that grain output in 1989 would need to 
increase by 200 million tons or 12 percent to rebuild stocks to

1986 
it said in a dispatch monitored in london that the allegations 
were made by the radio of the zionist enemy a term it uses 
for israel and the cbs network in the united states 
the libyan people is well aware of the significance and 
goal of such lies and allegations jana said 
we are used to hearing such lies every time the american and 
western intelligence services as well as the zionist mossad start 
to draw up a new plot aimed at carrying out a hostile attack to 
divert the worlds attention from their despicable intentions 
we in the great jamahiriyah libya denounce terrorism in 
every shape and form from stateorganized terrorism to the 
hijacking of planes and the unjustified kidnapping and killing of 
innocent people

what the reagan administration described as a reprisal for libyas 
involvement in terrorist actions against americans

a settlement was reached during the trial of 
a product liability lawsuit brought against gd searle amp co by a 
woman who claimed the companys cu7 intrauterine contraceptive 
device left her infertile 
terms of the settlement reached tuesday during the 
twomonthlong us district court trial were not disclosed judge 
mariana pfaelzer sealed the agreement with a confidentiality order 
searle spokeswoman kay bruno said wednesday in chicago 
laura f mccarthy a former los angeles resident who lives in 
butte mont was among about 800 women who have sued the 
pharmaceutical firm over its cu7 copper iud she claimed it made 
her infertile 
about 330 of the cases have been disposed in favor of searle 
and some 420 cases are still active bruno said the settlement in 
mccarthys case was reached before closing arguments were made to 
the jury 
roger brosnahan mccarthys attorney said the confidentiality 
order was made at searles request 
as far as the case is concerned we destroyed their foundation 
of defense for this product i think its a clear turning point 
in the litigation said brosnahan whose firm is handling 150 to 
200 lawsuits against searle over the cu7 device 
he declined to directly characterize mccarthys reaction to the 
settlement 
mccarthys lawsuit first came to trial under senior us 
district judge irving hill in january but hill declared a 
mistrial saying rough tactics and delaying measures by attorneys 
on both sides were threatening his health 
although most of the cases thus far have favored searle the 
company was ordered last year to pay a minnesota woman 875 
million in damages 
brosnahan said the next cu7 case for his firm was scheduled for 
may 15 in st paul minn 
were going to keep pounding on their doors and bringing them 
before juries until everybody recognizes how bad this product is 
and how bad searles conduct was he said 
searle said it stopped selling the cu7 in the united states in 
january 1986 because it could not get insurance due to the many 
lawsuits approval of the device from the us food and drug 
administration remains in effect

opponents of the partial merger of the detroit 
news and detroit free press on wednesday asked the supreme court to 
consider blocking the business combination 
the advocacy groups public citizen and michigan citizens for an 
independent press in their petition said the case raises legal 
issues important to the survival of newspaper competition and 
constitutional issues touching on relations between the executive 
and judicial branches and so merited review by the highest court 
the opponents had made their petition public last week 
the court was unlikely to act on the petition before the middle 
of may 
the news owned by gannett co inc and the free press owned 
by knightridder inc applied for an antitrust exemption in 1986 
under the newspaper preservation act 
the agreement would allow the newspapers to combine business 
production and circulation operations while retaining separate news 
and editorial departments with the owners splitting profits or

the liberal party which traditionally endorses 
democrats for new york state and city offices is reportedly 
backing republican rudolph giuliani for mayor 
giuliani the former us attorney in manhattan needs the 
liberal endorsement if he is to run a successful campaign in a city 
where democrats outnumber republicans about 5to1 
giuliani has not yet announced whether he will run but is 
generally expected to do so 
city comptroller harrison j goldin who had also sought the 
liberal nod in his quest to succeed mayor edward i koch said 
tuesday that liberal party vice chairman ray harding had told him 
of the partys planned endorsement of giuliani 
harding and russ schriefer giulianis campaign manager 
declined to confirm goldins information harding said the party 
would announce its choice for mayor at a future date after a 
meeting of its policy committee 
koch a democrat has unofficially said he is seeking a fourth 
term the liberal party has never endorsed koch in his previous 
three runs for mayor 
the last republican to get the liberal nod for mayor was john v 
lindsay who won reelection in 1969 on the liberal party line after 
he lost the republican primary 
by endorsing giuliani the liberal party risks incurring the ire 
of gov mario cuomo who could get the small party knocked off the 
ballot a political party must receive 50000 votes in a 
gubernatorial election to guarantee a permanent slot on the ballot 
for the next four years 
if cuomo a democrat runs for a third term as governor and 
decides he does not want to belong to a club that would endorse a 
republican he could reject the liberal endorsement 
however in response to giulianis reported endorsement cuomos 
spokesman gary fryer said the governor is content to let the 
people of new york city decide who the mayor should be

republican gov guy hunt denied on 
wednesday that a landslide loss by a gop candidate for a vacant 
alabama congressional seat is a bad omen for republicans seeking 
gains in the south in 1990 
but alabama democrats said the victory of secretary of state 
glen browder in the 3rd congressional district race amounts to a 
revival for state democrats 
the news of the death of the democratic party was premature in 
alabama said us rep ronnie flippo a democrat from florence 
at a news conference in washington 
it shows the republicans arent taking over alabama said 
us sen richard shelby dala who joined flippo at the news 
conference 
browder 46 a former political science professor at 
jacksonville state university defeated republican john rice 37 a 
state senator from opelika by nearly a 21 margin 
complete unofficial returns from tuesdays election showed 
browder with 47229 votes or 65 percent to rices 25008 or 35 
percent browder won all 13 counties including rices home county 
of lee and hometown of opelika 
just last november president bush got 60 percent of the vote in 
the east alabama district carrying 11 of the 13 counties 
the seat became vacant with the death in december of rep bill 
nichols a democrat who held the district for 22 years without an 
incumbent in the seat which covers a rural and mostly white 
conservative district national republican strategists looked for a 
possible offyear gain to set the stage for a raid on dixie in 1990 
browder with more money and backing from organized labor 
battered rice in television ads depicting the republican a hand 
grenade who favored cutting federal aid to the elderly in half 
rice attempted to brand browder as a taxandspend liberal out of 
tune with the district 
rice who called browder a wimp and a liar during the 
campaign blamed the loss on a lack of money to counter the 
television assault browder played down the campaign namecalling 
after his victory saying his goal is to bring people together 
to work for the district 
hunt who campaigned for rice said each candidate is viewed 
individually by voters and the loss tuesday does not dim republican 
chances to make major gains in alabama and elsewhere in 1990 
hunt who in 1986 became the first republican elected governor 
of alabama this century also said he feels he remains popular in 
the east alabama district 
hunt also gained the advantage of being able to name a 
republican to succeed browder as secretary of state he said 
wednesday he has just begun to consider the matter

solidarity leader lech walesa sealed a 
historic deal with the government wednesday to restore the 
independent trade union after a sevenyear ban and give poland its 
first democratic elections since world war ii 
walesa representing the opposition and gen czeszlaw kiszczak 
the interior minister representing polands communist government 
approved the package that emerged from two months of negotiations 
on political and economic reforms as the 57 participants in the 
talks gathered for a final time at the round table in the 
council of ministers palace 
there is no freedom without solidarity walesa said at the 
beginning of a 10minute address to the table in which he explained 
why the opposition had approved the agreements 
he credited authorities with having shown readiness for a 
radical change of the system 
but he said that behind the nice words of communist 
authorities for the past 45 years there was dishonesty and 
violence and solidarity had aimed for substantial settlements 
that could be implemented right away 
he declared the opposition had achieved the necessary 
minimum by regaining the legal status lost after martial law was 
imposed in december 1981 
i think that the roundtable talks can become the beginning of 
the road to democracy and a free poland and hence we look with 
boldness and hope into the future he said 
kiszczak lauded the talks that brought together different sides 
of polands political spectrum 
in washington the white house called the accord a great day 
for the polish people and for freedom press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said president bush was very pleased by the accords 
that have started poland on this new path toward reconcilation 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who banned solidarity in 
1981 argued strongly for its restoration at a communist party 
plenum in january saying it would be the culmination of his policy 
of national reconciliation 
the government acknowledging it needed greater public support 
to take the painful steps of reviving the economy offered the 
talks to solidarity last year to help end a series of strikes 
jaruzelski did not participate directly in the talks or attend 
the ceremony but he has said he would not rule out a meeting with 
walesa 
this comprehensive documentation is a social contract 
kiszczak said we declare the will to fulfill honestly the 
agreement that we symbolically conclude today 
he called the debates a first extremely significant step 
dialogue can turn out to be a priceless element in the 
accomplishment of our work he said 
the meeting was preceded by separate signings of the three main 
agreements on economic political and trade union reforms by 
the opposition and government heads of the working groups that 
negotiated them 
at the end of the formal meeting a communique was issued in the 
names of walesa and kiszczak that said the participants of the 
round table consider the mission of the round table finished 
it said participants agreed to the negotiating teams decisions 
and would cooperate to put them into practice an arbitration 
commission will be named to oversee the implementation and settle 
any conflicts the statement said 
the government agreed to restore legal status to solidarity the 
farmers union rural solidarity and the independent students 
association all had been banned in the martiallaw crackdown 
in exchange the solidarityled opposition agreed to participate 
in june elections to the 460seat sejm or parliament that 
guarantee the communist party and its allies a 65 percent majority 
but a new 100member senate to be created would be the first 
fully democratically chosen legislative chamber in the east bloc 
anyone who collected 3000 signatures could get on the ballot and 
all the seats would be openly contested 
a presidency would also be created to be elected by the sejm 
and the senate 
the president would be elected this year for a sixyear term by 
the sejm and the senate the post is expected to go to jaruzelski 
a sejm spokesman confirmed the parliament will meet friday to 
enact the agreements into law 
after the speeches by walesa and kiszczak a 15minute break was 
called in the meeting but the break stretched to nearly three 
hours in what a tv source said was an apparent dispute over whether 
alfred miodowicz the opzz official union chief could speak out of 
turn 
state tv filled the time with chamber music videotapes until the 
round table reconvened and a senior solidarity negotiator announced 
that miodowicz could speak because the talks were too important to 
be delayed by procedure 
those who claim a mandate for representing society are 
surprised sometimes that we have a different opinion said 
miodowicz 
solidarity has accused miodowicz of threatening to break up the 
talks with newly militant stands taken as opzz is faced with losing 
its trade union monopoly and probably a large share of its 
membership 
as early as wednesday morning it was not clear if solidarity 
intended to sign the accords especially after a dispute with the 
opzz over the formula adopted for compensating workers for 
inflation as part of the economic agreement 
the opzz claims the formula to index pay to inflation does not 
do enough to protect workers from price rises 
but walesa told the national executive commission of solidarity 
the union had achieved its main goal legalization and it could 
better fight for further reforms after it is registered and 
organized 
the commission then authorized walesa to sign the agreements 
monday will see the beginning of polands first open 
competitive election campaign since communists consolidated power 
after world war ii

the philadelphia zoo will get a new occupant 
april 29 and zoo visitors will vote on whether the creature is a 
beauty or a beast 
big pig an african warthog will appear through labor day 
during his stay visitors can fill out ballots to help decide 
whether big pig is cuteugly or just plain ugly 
zoo spokeswoman arlene kut said the zoos warthog election 
central will tabulate votes and a telephone line has been set up 
to dispense the latest warthog news 
warthogs are a rarity in the united states they were banned 
because of quarantine restrictions until recently big pig was born 
at the moscow zoo in 1986 and was kept at the los angeles zoo 
before his trip to philadelphia ms kut said the cincinnati and 
los angeles zoos also have warthogs 
big pig weighs about 250 pounds somewhat larger than average 
and is fed food pellets carrots apples and grapes he is also 
fond of alfalfa in the wild warthogs eat short grasses bark 
roots and occasionally fruit ms kut said 
warthogs members of the pig family are native to subsaharan 
africa and inhabit savannah woodlands and grasslands although they 
would rather run than fight they do use their large upper tusks to 
defend themselves against predators and can be dangerous when 
cornered 
warthogs use their sense of smell to identify one another since 
their eyesight is poor their hearing is acute their warts are 
large bumps of skin that are prominent in males these bumps may be 
used to help deflect blows inflicted by the tusks of other male 
warthogs during territorial battles

president bush who campaigned on a promise to 
be the education president on wednesday sent congress a 441 
million education package designed to reward and promote school 
improvements 
were going to take action action to make excellence in 
education not just a rallying cry but a classroom reality bush 
said at a rose garden ceremony outside the white house 
his excellence in education act based in part on campaign 
pledges would reward outstanding schools teachers and science 
scholars encourage districts to create magnet schools with special 
curriculums push states to develop new ways to certify teachers 
help drugridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of 
historically black colleges 
these education initiatives dont constitute a cureall a 
quick fix bush said he added later that i dont have to tell 
you about the current federal budget situation money is tight and 
we wish that more funds were available to spend on all levels of 
education 
administration officials said wednesday that the money they are 
seeking for the initiatives would be in addition to the 219 
billion in spending authority already proposed for the education 
department 
previously there had been some question as to whether cuts would 
be sought to offset the bush proposals 
but education secretary lauro cavazos said at a briefing that 
funds for the initiatives do not come from other programs in the 
department of education he said i dont know where the money 
will come from but thats another issue these are new dollars 
some educators and politicians expressed concern that even at 
223 billion for fiscal 1990 the departmental increase from 1989 
will not match inflation and districts will have to cut back on 
basic programs for students who are disadvantaged handicapped or 
limited in their english proficiency 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committe contended the bush package has no future on 
capitol hill since the president is attempting to strip programs 
long supported by congress to pay for new initiatives of 
questionable value but other members of congress said chances of 
passage were much better 
cavazos said his department needs to encourage constructive 
local activity which he said the bush plan is designed to do i 
see these proposals as part of a state reform movement overall 
he said 
the proposals were praised by democrats as well as republicans 
who attended the announcement 
democratic maryland gov donald schaefer said bush is 
highlighting some of the most important education issues 
drugfree schools flexible programs and a pressing need for more 
scientists he said to me its a new era as far as education is 
concerned 
republican new jersey gov tom kean said the bush plan avoids 
the past mistake of pouring money into failing schools were 
recognizing schools for excellence so they can do even better 
as a shining light to schools that havent done as well 
the bills chief senate sponsor republican nancy kassebaum of 
kansas said prospects of passage are very good its a 
package one could hardly be against sen claiborne pell dri 
chairman of the senate education subcommittee called the package 
an excellent initiative and said its chances are pretty 
good 
ken melley chief lobbyist for the 19million member national 
education association said the teacher union is disappointed in 
the bush proposal 
the fact is if the education budget were to just enjoy the 
costofliving increase that they give the defense budget we would 
have had another 900 million he said were half a billion 
dollars short of what weve had in terms of inflation they 
havent taken any of the provedly successful programs and enhanced 
them theres very little commitment to existing programs 
specifically the bush proposal for fiscal 1990 includes 
250 million in merit grants to schools that cut dropout rates 
ease drug problems raise test scores or show excellence in other 
ways 
100 million for magnet schools of excellence designed to 
encourage open enrollment and parental choice of schools an 
existing 114 million magnet school program to achieve 
desegregation would remain separate 
25 million for grants to urban schools that have the most 
serious drug problems the plain fact is kids cant suceed in the 
classroom if theres drug dealing in the corridors bush said 
25 million for federal grants to help states create alternate 
ways to certify teachers and administrators as a way of attracting 
professionals from other fields into the schools not all people 
who can teach are teachers by training bush said 
10 million in matching grants to historically black colleges 
and universities to help them enrich their endowments 
76 million for grants to outstanding teachers 
5 million for scholarships to graduating high school students 
who have excelled in mathematics or science 
18 million for three initiatives that do not require 
legislative action 13 million to expand and evaluate local 
education innovations 2 million for the education of homeless 
children and youth and 3 million for a literacy program for 
homeless adults 
bush announced his plan after presenting a crystal apple to mary 
bicouvaris the national teacher of the year her secret is using 
the real world as her classroom bush said of the bethel high 
school government teacher from hampton va she epitomizes 
excellence in education

lets move shouted historian adam 
michnik and a band of top solidarity activists trooped out of the 
hotel bar where they met wednesday before heading to a government 
palace to conclude an agreement to legalize the banned union 
movement 
solidarity leader lech walesa led the animated group down a busy 
street to the main palace gate where police stopped them and told 
them to join spectators standing across the street 
walesa simply laughed and strode right into the palace 
inside the solidarity representatives quickly sank into 
burgundycushioned chairs around the large round table and waited 
for the government delegation to appear 
the government and solidarity sides eyed each other warily until 
the grim delegates of the official trade union opzz marched through 
a maze of camera cables they had delayed the opening by 10 minutes 
the solidarity side listened politely as interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak read his speech there was no applause when he 
finished 
but michnik and others smiled broadly when walesa opened his 
speech with the familiar saying there is no freedom without 
solidarity 
security was lax a group of specially invited solidarity 
supporters chatted in the wings or pressed up against the backs of 
security guards to get a glimpse of the proceedings 
several western reporters were allowed to quietly watch some of 
the proceedings from corner seats 
even before they returned to the ornate halls at the council of 
ministers palace in central warsaw where they had negotiated with 
authorities for the past nine weeks the solidarity delegation 
sensed victory 
we have a chance we will have to see if we can use it said 
jacek kuron a leading political theorist who has fought communist 
authorities for more than a quarter of a century 
its good its really good what else can i say said 
zbigniew bujak who managed to escape capture during the december 
1981 martiallaw crackdown and led underground solidarity until his 
arrest in 1986 
each of the delegates to the talks autographed a small cardboard 
sign lettered with the familiar redandwhite solidarity logo in 
the bar of the hotel europejski which had served as the union 
press office during the talks 
while some members of the solidarity delegation drank wine and 
ate hors doeuvres with authorities at a reception at a government 
palace walesa quietly ordered dinner in the nearly empty dining 
room of the nearby europejski hotel 
i am exhausted and i dont like eating standing he said as 
he and krzysztof pusz his longtime aide dined on a platter of 
cold cuts sliced bread and tea with lemon 
when asked why such a modest dinner on such an important night 
walesa deadpanned the country is in crisis 
he declined to make any substantive comment on the outcome of 
the talks but said he would be ready in the morning for a 
scheduled news conference 
some solidarity leaders seemed acutely aware that much remains 
to be done before the political and economic reforms on which the 
union has staked its reputation bear fruit 
the fight has just begun said alojzy pietrzyk a solidarity 
leader from southern city of jastrzebie where a wave of strikes by 
angry coal miners last august prompted authorities to propose the 
roundtable talks 
i thought it would be a bigger success even though we got 
more than we hoped for said grzegorz stawski another jastrzebie 
miner the battle has just begun 
but i sure would like my wife to have seen this he said

the oil spill that has blackened 
much of the rich ecosystem of prince william sound has drawn an 
army of scientists who say a lethal combination of weather 
topography and chemistry have conspired against the environment 
this spill is unique said jacqui michel a national 
oceanographic and atmospheric administration scientist helping to 
coordinate research efforts its in a restricted inland bay 
weve had this pool of oil sitting on top of the water for days 
in addition the cold water and rough waves have trapped 
chemicals that normally would evaporate from spilled crude oil 
the microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the 
basis of the marine ecosystem are especially sensitive to such 
toxins and hydrocarbons even in tiny doses can kill salmon fry 
starting to emerge from streams and hatcheries around the sound 
every day its getting a little worse said otter rescue 
specialist chris donohoe you clean a beach up the tide changes 
and the oil comes right back 
nearly 400 scientists are sampling water collecting dead 
animals and monitoring beaches in an attempt to quantify what 
happens when 10 million gallons of crude oil gushes into a pristine 
marine environment 
the placid sound protected from the stormy gulf of alaska by 
mountainous barrier islands supports an abundance of wildlife 
but islands that keep stormy seas out can also keep oil in some 
tendrils of oil have been pushed by currents out into the gulf but 
much of the 2600squaremile slick has stayed in the sound 
birds soaked in oil lose their buoyancy and their insulation 
against the chilly water when they desperately preen themselves 
they ingest toxins 
whales seals and sea lions have been seen swimming through the 
oil and appear to be staying healthy 
but while most marine mammals depend on a thick fat layer for 
insulation sea otters keep warm by trapping air in their dense 
soft fur and they must keep that fur clean to survive 
at least 40 dead sea otters have been found and an additional 40 
or so have been captured after coming ashore to try to warm up and 
wash themselves 
we see them up on the snow rubbing snow on themselves trying 
to get the oil off said rescuer elwin johnston its 
pathetic 
oily bird carcasses are tempting but toxic meals for scavenging 
bald eagles bears mink and land otters 
when the tide recedes a glistening black sheen is left on the 
intertidal zone between high and low tide marks suffocating kelp 
and eel grass 
hardy intertidal creatures have adapted to survive long dry 
spells but they cannot handle prolonged exposure to oil mussels 
for example close their shells tightly when they sense toxins in 
the water 
they can close down for four or five days but then they have 
to open if the oils still there they die said steve 
zimmerman a biologist with the national marine fisheries service 
field crews studying some of the 800 miles of shoreline fouled 
so far have found many intertidal organisms in advanced stages of 
distress some are losing their grip on the rocks and being washed 
away 
i dont think well see completely bare rocks but a lot of 
animals will die and there will be less for other animals to feed 
on zimmerman said 
perhaps the greatest ecological danger of the prince william 
sound oil spill is the invisible toxins that dissolve into the 
water scientists said 
crude oil contains toxic and carcinogenic hydrocarbons such as 
benzene toluene and xylene usually these compounds evaporate 
within 48 hours of an oil spill 
but the cold water of prince william sound slowed evaporation 
and high wind three days after the accident whipped much of the 
slick into a frothy mix of oil water and air that may have helped 
trap those volatiles 
in addition the prudhoe bay crude oil that spilled has 
unusually high levels of heavier hydrocarbons such as naphthalene 
a more persistent toxin such hydrocarbons can stick around for 
years sinking into sediments 
eventually all the oil will go away michel said but it 
may be a long time

house speaker jim wright under investigation 
by a house ethics committee acknowledged wednesday that he sold 
504 copies of his book reflections of a public man to a texas 
university instead of accepting a 3000 speaking fee that would 
have violated the chambers rules 
wrights income from the book sales about 1600 would not 
have been subject to house limitations but the speaker defended 
his actions to reporters as he commented publicly on the 
arrangement for the first time 
i dont think theres anything wrong with that wright said 
at the time in october 1984 wright already was bumping against 
the maximum amount he could accept in speaking fees for the year 
under house rules in addition the fee offered by the school 
southwest texas state university was 1000 more than the rules 
permit per speech 
wrights bulk sales of the book and whether he used them to 
evade house limits on outside income from speaking and writing 
fees have become a focus of attention by the house ethics 
committee which is looking into the speakers finances 
the panel resumed its closeddoor deliberations wednesday after 
a twoweek easter break and committee chairman rep julian dixon 
dcalif said he expected some conclusion would be reached in the 
case next week 
dixon also said the committee was asking the house to add 
600000 to its budget for this year in part to cover growing 
costs of the wright probe were basically out of money dixon 
said 
wright said he had been invited by bob hardesty the university 
president to present the fall lecture in the schools lyndon b 
johnson lecture series 
he said he had not asked for an honorarium for the speech and 
was surprised when a check arrived at his office when an aide 
suggested that the speaker sell the school 3000 worth of books 
he agreed to do so 
i said if he wants to buy some books thatll be fine 
wright dtexas told reporters at his daily news conference i 
dont think theres anything wrong with that 
wright then sent 504 copies of the book to the school said 
university spokeswoman pat murdock that would have yielded wright 
income of about 1650 which he could then accept because book 
royalties do not fall under the 30 percentofsalary limit that 
applies to speaking fees 
wright had neared that limit 24630 for the majority leaders 
job he then held in june of that year according to his financial 
disclosure form 
in addition to the issue of evading income ceilings the ethics 
panel also was deliberating whether the speaker should have 
reported as gifts a series of benefits he received from a business 
partner fort worth developer george mallick whether mallick had 
a direct interest in legislation which would have made any 
gift over 100 improper and whether in working for forbearance 
language in a bill dealing with savings and loan institutions 
wright improperly used influence on behalf of a business partner 
while acknowledging those areas of inquiry ethics committee 
members said there may be other potential rules violations as 
well but declined to cite specific rules 
as the committee went into the home stretch in its 
deliberations wrights allies were preparing their defense they 
expressed relief that the ethics panel has set aside three of the 
original six charges against the speaker 
according to a source sympathetic to wright the three concern 
wrights intervention with federal banking regulators on behalf of 
troubled savings and loans his intercession with government 
officials on behalf of a texas oil and gas company and his use of 
a governmentpaid staff aide to compile parts of a book 
but wrights opponents said even if some charges are dropped 
the remaining issues are serious enough to cause the speaker severe 
political damage

portauprince haiti ap the government declared a state of 
emergency put troops on maximum alert and censored the news media 
wednesday after soldiers revolted and demanded the ouster of 
haitian leader lt gen prosper avril 
it was the second mutiny within the 7000man army since sunday 
when avril narrowly escaped an attempt to overthrow his 6monthold 
government but diplomatic sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said avril remained in control 
under the state of emergency an immediate curfew was put into 
effect in portauprince and its suburbs between 7 pm and 6 am 
no gunfire was heard and there was no indication of 
insurrection within the ranks of the navy air force police or 
rural army commands 
our impresssion is that it is not an attempted coup but 
rather an internal army dispute said one western diplomat 
its a standoff another diplomat said i think theyre 
just staring each other down he said referring to the rebels 
and loyalist troops 
a government communique said the state of emergency was 
necessary because certain politicians in haiti and abroad are 
trying in every way to divide the armed forces of haiti and incite 
disorder and violence 
rumors have been circulating widely that the weeks rebellion 
was organized and funded by former henchmen of the ousted duvalier 
dictatorship exiled in the neighboring dominican republic 
avrils presidential guard stationed two antiaircraft guns 
four armored personnel carriers and three wheeled cannons inside 
the compound of the national palace 
across the champdemars plaza about 300 supporters gathered 
outside the dessalines barracks where the rebellion broke out 
smoldering barricades temporarily blocked nearby streets 
radio reports said rebels seized control of several buildings 
including the telecommunications company the staterun central 
bank the ministry of education and the state bureau of statistics 
shops in downtown portauprince closed early pedestrians and 
motorists fled leaving the capitals normally congested streets 
nearly deserted at midday 
workers abandoned haitis international airport forcing 
airlines to cancel flights which had resumed tuesday for the first 
time since the abortive coup 
a statement by army general headquarters read over staterun 
television wednesday afternoon ordered all soldiers to report 
immediately to their command posts 
the government also issued a statement declaring a state of 
emergency and telling television radio and newspapers they could 
only disseminate information authorized and signed by the 
military government 
local radio stations appeared to be ignoring the order 
continuing regular newscasts the government made no immediate 
effort to interfere with foreign news organizations 
the government order was issued after dissident soldiers from 
the feared dessalines army unit went on the radio to demand avrils 
ouster blaming the haitian leader for the deaths of four rebel 
soldiers 
their announcement over independent radio metropole created 
confusion in the capital which had been returning to normal after 
the deportation of those accused of leading the uprising over the 
weekend 
three noncommissioned officers and a captain from the dessalines 
barracks the most repressive unit in the army appeared at radio 
metropole to issue the statement avril is responsible for the 
deaths of the leopards he must go said an unidentified soldier 
he was referring to the killing of four mutinous soldiers from 
the leopards battallion during a skirmish monday with soldiers of 
the presidential guard 
the protest came one day after avril deported the leopards 
commander lt col himmler rebu 38 and two other officers 
identified by the government as leaders of the coup attempt col 
philippe biamby 36 and col leonce qualo 35 he also reportedly 
fired six highranking officers 
the three deported officers arrived in miami with their families 
wednesday and applied for asylum us immigration officials said 
they were being held temporarily at immigration facilities in 
miami the officials said 
the leopards a crack 400man commando unit had ended their 
revolt tuesday after their commander was deported but radio 
antilles an independent station quoted soldiers within the unit 
as saying wednesday they were prepared to join the dessalines 
rebels 
it was not immediately known how many soldiers from the 700man 
dessalines barracks were involved in the protest 
wednesday afternoon about 50 soldiers met reporters at the 
barracks to clarify their demands according to radio reports they 
demanded that avril resign and hand over power to the president of 
the supreme court of appeals and that the government fully restore 
the suspended 1987 constitution avril has partially restored the 
constitution as part of his program of democratic reform 
the rebels also demanded equal pay and rights afforded members 
of avrils 1000man presidential guard and legal protection 
against arbritrary dismissals 
several officers have been discharged or transferred in a 
crackdown by avril on corruption and drugtrafficking within the 
army the united states has made the drug crackdown a condition for 
the resumption of 70 million in annual us aid that was suspended 
after thugs killed 34 voters in november 1987 thwarting the 
countrys first free elections in more than three decades 
until wednesday the dessalines soldiers had maintained a 
neutral position in the aftermath of sundays attempt to overthrow 
avrils 6monthold government 
avril 50 was brought to power last sept 11 by noncommissioned 
officers who wanted to end statesponsored violence and ousted lt

the senate voted wednesday to authorize bounty 
payments of up to 250000 for informants who help prosecutors root 
out multimillion dollar contracting fraud against the federal 
government 
the bill went to the house on a 8216 vote as senators rejected 
an argument that the rewards would encourage americans to spy on 
each other and avoid their duty to report crimes solely out of 
patriotism without getting paid 
the attorney general would have sole discretion to grant the 
rewards from justice department funds but he could seek 
courtordered reimbursement later from criminal fines levied 
against convicted violators 
federal employees who furnish information in the performance of 
official duties could not receive a reward nor could those who 
themselves violated the 1988 major fraud act which imposed stiff 
penalties for contract fraud 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio chief sponsor of the bill 
said 250000 is not a large amount of money when youre talking 
about multimillion dollar fraud 
we are dealing with a serious problem and have to do 
everything we can before tax dollars are lost and people are 
injured with better information we can nip contract fraud in the 
bud he said 
sen dale bumpers dark in emotional arguments said the bill 
would encourage the type of neighboragainstneighbor spying that 
occurred in nazi germany and in communist countries but his 
amendment to wipe out the proposed rewards was tabled by a vote of 
5543 
i find the provision so repugnant so repulsive so demeaning 
that were giving up on america by paying people to do their 
civic duty bumpers argued before the vote 
are we caving in and saying there arent enough patriots in 
this country to do their job so we have to pay them he 
asked how much do we have to bribe informants 
to be eligible for the money the informant must give his 
information to his employer before contacting authorities unless 
there is a valid reason not to do so the whistleblower also could 
not collect if the information was previously disclosed unless the 
informant was the original source of the information

the government claimed wednesday the 
united states is increasing its military presence in honduras 
despite what nicaragua described as international support for 
demilitarizing central america 
the accusation was made in a communique published on the front 
page of barricada the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista 
party 
nicaraguan indian leaders in neighboring honduras said thousands 
of indian exiles would to return home to vote in nicaraguas 1990 
presidential election 
also on barricadas front page was a dispatch from havana 
quoting soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev as reaffirming 
solidarity with nicaragua 
it said gorbachev who ended a fourday visit cuba on wednesday 
soon might visit nicaragua which depends on the soviet bloc for 
economic and military aid 
in the communique the sandinistas said it is worrisome and 
abusive of international law that the united states government 
insists on disarming nicaragua and denying it necessary means 
for its defense while that same government continues 
systematically placing its troops in the region 
the bush administration has said regional peace efforts would be 
advanced it the soviets cut their military ties with nicaragua 
gorbachev said tuesday the superpowers should renounce military 
intervention in latin america but promised military aid to 
nicaragua as long as the united states arms other central american 
nations 
president daniel ortegas government based its accusation about 
us military activity on proposed amendments to an agreement on 
joint ushonduran military maneuvers 
honduran legislators are considering amendments that would 
extend tax and customs privileges to us military personnel on 
maneuvers 
the sandinista communique described the amendments as a protocol 
with grave implications for peace in central america and a 
lamentable step irreconcilable with the efforts now 
developing to reach a durable and just peace in the region 
honduras also has served as a refuge training ground and 
staging base for nicaraguan rebels supported by the united states 
us and honduran forces have conducted joint maneuvers for years 
in tegucigalpa capital of honduras a spokesman for indian 
leaders steadman fagoth muller and brooklyn rivera told the 
associated press up to 20000 refugees might return to nicaragua 
before the presidential election scheduled for feb 25 1990 
kendy medina said fagoth muller and rivera former rebel 
leaders would join nicaraguas political opposition 
we plan to leave honduras over the next nine months to take 
advantage of the political opening in nicaragua medina said 
we are convinced we must fight in our own country and with our 
own civilized arms 
tens of thousands of miskito rama and sumo indians began 
leaving their tribal homelands along the caribbean coast in 1981 
after the sandinistas tried to assert authority over the remote 
area and said it would move the indians to relocation camps

six tugboats took up the 
slack on tow lines wednesday and slowly but surely hauled the 
oilspilling tanker exxon valdez from a reef that had held it solid 
for 12 days 
the tanker that had spewed more than 10 million gallons of crude 
oil into prince william sound then had to evade thousands of 
icebergs some as big as houses that dotted the sea 
were not going to move fast said gary gorski exxons 
salvage coordinator were trying to work our way around these 
little dorky bits out here 
icebergs calving from the nearby columbia glacier often clog the 
tanker lanes in spring and summer 
the tanker was towed at 3 mph for a 10hour trip to an already 
oilfouled bay on secluded naked island where temporary repairs 
will be made 
two skimmers and boats pulling two containment booms trailed the 
tanker mopping up a sheen of oil 
were just thrilled it appears to have been pulled off so 
smoothly said exxon shipping co spokesman tom cirigliano 
the 987foot tanker the secondnewest and one of the two 
largest vessels in exxons 19tanker fleet ran aground march 24 on 
bligh reef a wellcharted and marked navigational hazard 25 miles 
south of valdez the port at the southern end of the trans alaska 
pipeline 
the reef tore holes in eight of the tankers 13 oil tanks and 
two of its four ballast tanks 
for 12 days while the ship was hard aground water rose and fell 
inside the ruptured tanks with the fluctuating tides 
tanker capt bill wallace gave the order wednesday morning to 
seal off vents in those tanks and an inert gas was pumped in under 
pressure to force out some of the water inert gas usually 
nitrogen is used to produce an oxygenfree environment and ensure 
that petroleum fumes in the tanks cant ignite

the firing of shotgun blasts at the home of a 
woman known as jane roe in the landmark court case legalizing 
abortion is emblematic of a dangerously intensifying battle on the 
issue activists on both sides say 
norma mccorvey the plaintiff in roe vs wade plans to stay in 
hiding until she leaves for a national prochoice rally in 
washington on sunday said a spokeswoman for the texas abortion 
rights action league in austin 
shes fine everythings ok but she doesnt want to talk to 
anybody for the next 48 hours phyllis dunham the leagues 
executive director said wednesday she says shes just as fired 
up as ever about going to the rally this has done nothing to shake 
her enthusiasm for the effort 
cindy eby of the dallas chapter of the national organization for 
women said ms mccorvey will attend the march and possibly address 
the crowd which is expected to include more than 250000 
prochoice activists 
ms mccorveys identity was shielded with a pseudonym in the 
dallas case that resulted in the 1973 us supreme court ruling on 
abortion but she publicly acknowledged her role last year and has 
been organizing a prochoice jane roe foundation 
police said windows in ms mccorveys home and car were 
shattered at about 445 am tuesday by a three blasts of a 
410gauge shotgun 
weve got no leads no suspects said police sgt ron 
ellison 
while police said they had no information to link the shooting 
to ms mccorveys prochoice activism people on both sides of the 
abortion issue said they feared more violence at weekend rallies 
held to support or protest nows march for womens equalitywomens 
lives in washington 
i think when you send shotgun blasts through someones window 
that just shows the kinds of desperate tactics and control tactics 
that people who want to see abortion outlawed for all time will 
stoop to ms dunham said it is and always has been a 
heavyhanded oppressive movement 
antiabortion activists said they have no idea who was behind 
the shooting and that they too fear such acts 
it certainly raises concerns said bill price president of 
the greater dallas right to life commission weve had things 
happen windows shot out obscene phone calls at home those kinds 
of things increase after things like this it just puts both sides 
on edge 
i think people are kind of edgy about this court case 
anyway price said referring to the supreme courts decision to 
hear a case that could alter the roe vs wade decision this kind 
of adds fuel to the fire that isnt needed 
violence by antiabortion activists is increasing and comes 
from their frustration to get any legislative or judicial 
changes said patricia ireland nows executive vice president in 
washington 
karen ashmore president of nows north dallas chapter said a 
prochoice leader who works at an abortion clinic had her car 
stolen there twice in the last two weeks 
thats not coincidence thats blatant ms ashmore said 
were going to take our white gloves off and start getting 
angry

mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo 
and seven associates were convicted wednesday on firstdegree 
murder charges in the 1985 slaying of another gangster and could 
face the electric chair 
jurors deliberated about three hours before returning the 
verdict on all counts in the slaying of frank frankie flowers 
dalfonso in july 1985 
the jury will begin consideration thursday on whether the 
defendants should face death in the electric chair no other mafia 
member in the nation organized crime investigators say has ever 
been sentenced to death 
scarfo 60 is considered head of organized crime in the 
philadelphiasouth jersey area even though hes been in jail for 
nearly two years serving a 14year sentence in a 1 million 
extortion he also faces over 40 years more for a federal 
racketeering conviction that included nine murders 
the key to the prosecution case was the testimony of two 
gangster informants who said scarfo gave the order to kill 
dalfonso late in the winter of 1985 dalfonso was shot to death 
nearly six months later on a south philadelphia street near his 
home 
defense lawyers said the witnesses thomas delgiorno and eugene 
milano were liars who had made deals to save their own lives both 
had admitted participating in the dalfonso conspiracy 
assistant district attorney charles grant called the defendants 
brigands of death and a pack of wolves and praised the 
informants courage 
milano who had been one of the defendants in the case decided 
to plead guilty to thirddegree murder thus avoiding the 
possibility of execution and agreed to testify against the others 
including his younger brother nicholas or nicky whip 
the defense which put on no witnesses argued prosecutors 
failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt 
scarfos lawyer robert simone said in a plea for acquittal 
that there were no fingerprints on the guns police found after the 
shooting no witnesses who could identify any of the defendants as 
the killers 
he blasted delgiorno as a witness who violated almost every 
commandment that moses brought down from the mountain and milano 
for testifying against his own brother 
this case is full of lies and imagination simone said 
grant however said the only way to convict mob members was to 
use informants and denounced the defense allegations that 
delgiorno and milano were vicious vermin ravenous wolves 
we have the pack of wolves and the leader of the pack in this 
room for the cowardly kill of dalfonso grant said 
besides scarfo and the younger milano the others convicted were 
joseph ligambi 48 and philip narducci 26 identified as the 
shooters frances faffy iannarella 32 accused of supplying 
the two murder guns salvatore chucki merlino 47 and his 
brother lawrence yogi merlino 32 and frank windows

mainstream republicans were on the defensive 
wednesday after former gov evan mechams announcement that he will 
try for a second term as governor despite being impeached and 
ousted part way through his first one 
state senate president robert usdane meanwhile rejected 
mechams call for a new impeachment trial clearing the way for 
mecham to take his case to court 
one republican state rep jim hartdegen wore a black armband 
to the house floor wednesday in mourning for the republican party 
the death was last night hartdegen said the burial will 
be in november 1990 
mecham told a cheering rally tuesday night that he would win the 
gop primary in 1990 and would beat his replacement democratic gov 
rose mofford in the general election 
i committed no impeachable offense said mecham a former 
auto dealer elected in 1986 on his fifth try for governor 
well get about 60 percent in the general he predicted 
mrs mofford who automatically replaced mecham because she had 
been elected as secretary of state in 1986 said she wasnt 
surprised at mechams announcement 
i will match my record with his any time she said i will 
not stand by and let him or anyone else turn the clock back 
socially culturally economically or any other way 
editorial writers and prominent republicans had urged mecham not 
to run 
therell be a terrible primary said former republican house 
speaker joe lane one of the proimpeachment lawmakers ousted by 
mecham supporters in last falls elections democrats will be 
organized and well have a bloody primary and i just hate to see 
that 
former us sen barry goldwater predicted mechams defeat and 
the arizona republic which has feuded with mecham for years said 
in an editorial wednesday that mechams strength among gop party 
workers would not translate into voter support 
taking over the arizona republican party is one thing the 
newspaper said in reference to rightwing resolutions that mecham 
backers forced through at last januarys state meeting winning 
an election for governor after having been impeached is something 
else again 
the mesa tribune in an editorial titled hes back said the 
gop already staggering stumbling straining for balance has 
been knocked on its tail and can be expected to tear itself 
apart in the months to come 
mecham insisted that there would be no bloodbath 
i want to send word out to everyone in arizona that i think we 
can have a kinder and gentler arizona he told a crowd of more 
than 400 at a hotel ballroom i think the 19 months between now 
and the general election of 1990 can be a time of spirited debate 
on the issues but not namecalling and not accusations without 
basis 
mecham said he held no bitterness toward his critics but added 
i do believe that ive been the object of more venemous 
namecalling than anyone in our state and possibly in america 
the maverick conservative now 64 was impeached by the 
republicancontrolled house on feb 5 1988 and charged with 
obstructing justice misusing state money and concealing a campaign 
loan 
the republicancontrolled senate convicted him on the 
obstruction and money charges it left the third allegation to a 
maricopa county superior court jury for consideration as a criminal 
case and jurors there acquitted mecham 
mecham won election in 1986 with about 40 percent of the vote in 
a threeway race 
controversial appointments actions and statements that offended 
blacks jews orientals and others ate away at his popularity 
despite a notax stand that won him support from many voters

vietnam said wednesday it will 
withdraw from cambodia by sept 30 nearly 11 years after an 
invasion that ended the brutal khmer rouge regime and started a 
civil war 
vietnam had said previously it would remove its remaining 
soldiers estimated at up to 70000 by september only if a 
political settlement was reached but would be out by 1990 in any 
case 
wednesdays announcement issued as a joint statement in phnom 
penh hanoi and vientiane capital of laos did not indicate any 
conditions were attached 
laos with its provietnamese government was included because 
the statement was intended to show regional unity and solidarity 
the statement said an international commission including canada 
poland indonesia and india was welcome to supervise the 
withdrawal and called for an end to outside military aid 
vietnam will withdraw from kampuchea cambodia all of her 
forces by the end of september 1989 said the statement read to 
reporters by hun sen premier of the government vietnam installed 
in phnom penh after the invasion 
vietnamese withdrawal and the end of outside aid will put an 
end to the civil war and stimulate the kampuchean parties to settle 
the internal aspects of the kampuchean question before september 
1989 on the basis of national reconciliation said the statement 
also released by vietnams official news agency 
if foreign countries continue aiding resistance groups the 
government in phnom penh reserves the right to call on other 
countries to give assistance to the kampuchean people to defend 
themselves the statement said 
in the statement the three indochinese countries recommended 
revival of an international controls and supervision commission 
established by the 1954 geneva agreement on cambodia 
they said the original commission members india poland and 
canada should be joined by foreign minister ali alatas of 
indonesia who presided over recent cambodian talks and a 
representative of the un secretarygeneral 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher 
praised the announcement and said that if the withdrawal is 
carried out it would be a positive development 
ha huy thong a spokesman for vietnams permanent mission to the 
united nations said as the us has repeatedly said that they 
will normalize relations with vietnam after we withdraw all our 
forces from cambodia were now waiting to see if they keep their 
promise 
hun sen said in phnom penh that he and prince norodom sihanouk 
would meet may 2 in jakarta indonesia on a political settlement 
but rejected sihanouks demand that his government be dissolved 
before elections 
sihanouk once ruled cambodia and now leads the alliance of three 
guerrilla armies which includes the communist khmer rouge 
in beijing sihanouk said the withdrawal must be supervised by 
the united nations and not by the countries chosen unilaterally 
by vietnam 
he said china would end its support of the resistance only on 
the day when the united nations will have seen the reality of the 
withdrawal 
a spokeswoman in paris for the khmer peoples national 
liberation front a member of sihanouks coalition called the 
vietnamese announcement a farce 
complete withdrawal from cambodia would remove a major obstacle 
to improvement of vietnams relations with noncommunist nations of 
southeast asia with which it hopes to expand trade and political 
cooperations 
the way also would be eased for normalization of chinesesoviet 
relations china supports the resistance the soviet union backs 
vietnam 
hun sen dismissed suggestions from reporters that vietnam was 
moving up the withdrawal date because of soviet pressure before the 
visit to beijing next month by president mikhail s gorbachev 
vietnam invaded in december 1978 and ousted the khmer rouge 
under whose rule an estimated onefourth of cambodias 8 million 
people had died from famine and execution since the indochina war

force in the resistance coalition has been a major problems in

immigration officials refused wednesday 
to free from prison a dutch visitor who says he has aids saying 
that allowing him to attend a forum on the disease might endanger 
the health of others 
parole is an extreme item that would be used only in extreme 
circumstances said tom schiltgen district director of the 
immigration and naturalization service explaining his rejection of 
the request from hans paul verhoef 
however schiltgen said a decision is likely thursday on 
verhoefs request for a waiver from immigration laws denying united 
states entry to individuals with dangerous contagious disease 
schiltgen said that to grant a waiver the ins must verify that 
verhoefs disease does not pose a health threat and that the us 
government would not incur expenses for verhoefs care 
verhoef wants to attend a conference on aids in san francisco 
verhoef was taken into custody at minneapolisst paul 
international airport sunday by customs officials who discovered 
the aids drug azt in his baggage and then questioned him about the 
disease verhoef 31 of rotterdam an aids prevention worker in 
his country told immigration officials he has acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome and was en route to the aids conference 
you cant get aids from seeing me or giving me a hand or 
something verhoef said you have to do other things which im 
not intending to do so i dont think theres any danger of me 
spreading the disease 
his detention prompted denunciations from aids activists but 
immigration officials said they were just following the law 
we are holding mr verhoef as an excludable alien because he 
has a dangerous and contagious disease schiltgen said 
schiltgen said tests would be conducted to verify verhoef has 
the disease before authorities proceed with the case the tests 
should be completed within a few days he said 
for years immigration laws have required people who want to 
enter the united states to establish they have no dangerous 
contagious diseases congress added aids to that list of diseases 
in 1987 
verhoefs incarceration provoked protests at the state capitol 
in st paul and criticism of the inss handling of the case from 
sister mary madonna ashton the state health commissioner 
there was no need to treat mr verhoef in this fashion while 
the legal issues surrounding his case were resolved said ashton 
having this disease is not a crime and treating it has though it 
were can serve no useful purpose

south africa called wednesday for black 
nationalist guerrillas to surrender or face more attacks in the 
5dayold battle that has left at least 200 people dead 
the leader of the southwest africa peoples organization said 
his guerrilla fighters had no intention of leaving the south 
africancontrolled territory a newspaper reported 
a confidential un report obtained by the associated press 
indicated that un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
approved of allowing the south african troops off their bases 
before the fighting 
the united states said it had offered an aircraft to the united 
nations to airlift a battalion of about 850 finnish soldiers to 
namibia 
the un has accepted the offer we are working out the 
details with the un and cannot say when the un troops will 
arrive the state department said in a statement un and 
finnish officials confirmed the statement but declined to elaborate 
angolas news agency reported from luanda that swapo had 
presented a peace plan to un officials but no details were 
released 
swapo must surrender lay down their arms hoist a white flag 
then nothing will happen to them foreign affairs minister pik 
botha said in a shortwave radio broadcast beamed throughout namibia 
if the guerrillas turn themselves in to police then they will 
be safely taken back to bases in angola botha said on 
governmentrun radio south africa 
the fighting between south africanled police and swapo 
guerrillas began saturday the day a unsupervised independence 
plan began in namibia 
the battles continued for a fifth straight day wednesday and 
territorial authorities said 179 guerrillas 21 members of the 
security forces and an undetermined number of civilians have been 
killed in the most intense combat of the 23year war 
south africa claims that about 1400 guerrillas have crossed 
into namibia since saturday in violation of an agreement that calls 
for combatants on both sides to be confined to bases 
under the un plan guerrillas were to remain at their bases in 
angola at least 100 miles north of namibias border until midmay 
some un and other officials have suggested that swapo field 
commanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested 
to namibia as of april 1 and set up bases there 
the swapo leader sam nujoma claims the guerrillas have been in 
namibia for some time and that the security forces instigated the 
fighting 
the star of johannesburg reporting from harare zimbabwe 
quoted nujoma as saying his forces would not withdraw to angola 
if you read the un resolution carefully it does not say 
guerrilla forces who were found in namibia on april 1 should be 
driven out to be confined in angola nujoma was quoted as 
saying 
swapo secretarygeneral andimba toivo in an interview with the 
ap at the united nations in new york said our forces are not 
going to be withdrawn they will remain in namibia which is our 
country 
south africa has threatened to scrap plans for granting 
independence to the territory unless the united nations takes 
strong steps to resolve the crisis 
louis pienaar the south africanappointed administratorgeneral 
of namibia said if the guerrillas did not surrender by saturday 
police will pursue them with all the means at their disposal 
if guerrillas were seen heading north toward angola they will 
not be pursued aggressively pienaar added 
cedric thornberry a senior official of the un peacekeeping 
contingent in namibia said efforts to establish a truce are 
being advanced with critical urgency because we are now facing a 
deteriorating situation in the north 
he said the united nations was giving active consideration 
to advancing the arrival of the rest of its planned 4650member 
military monitoring force only 921 members of the force are now in 
namibia the remaining troops including those from finland are to 
arrive by the end of the month 
the united nations has declined to state publicly how and why 
south african troops engaged the guerrillas and who gave the order 
un officials say that is confidential information 
toivo said perez de cuellar denied in a meeting on tuesday night 
that un officials had authorized the move 
a copy of a confidential report perez de cuellar issued monday 
night in new york however cites reports of a mass incursion by 
swapo and says 
in all these circumstances and upon the urgent and joint 
recommendation of my special representative and the peacekeeping 
force commander i authorized them the un officials to accept a 
strictly limited and temporary suspension of the requirement for 
some units of the south african military to be confined to base 
swapo which gets most of its military assistance from the east 
bloc has battled south african rule since 1966 and has been 
favored to win the most votes in preindependence elections planned 
for november under the un plan 
however botha in a letter to perez de cuellar said tuesday 
that unless active and effective measures are taken within the 
next few hours the whole peace process in namibia is in danger 
of collapse 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed an accord calling for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban soldiers who have helped marxist angola 
battle usbacked rebels 
namibia which has 13 million people is roughly the size of 
france and west germany combined the predominantly black 
population includes about 75000 whites

egyptian president hosni mubarak said wednesday 
that israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir is closing all the 
doors to peace in the middle east by opposing an international 
peace conference on the region and refusing to give up occupied 
land 
in a speech to a foreign policy group in manhattan however 
mubarak sounded a more optimistic note about achieving an end to 
the turmoil in the west bank and gaza than he did in statements 
tuesday in washington 
it has been suggested that the situation there is not ripe for 
a solution nothing can be further from the truth he told 400 
guests at a luncheon held by the foreign policy association at the 
waldorfastoria hotel 
in the past few years several factors converge in the favor 
of prompt settlement of the conflict the palestinian movement has 
raised the olive branch higher than ever and accepted all the 
requirements for peace 
on tuesday he said of the violence in the occupied territories 
if anybody could stop it we would be very pleased but how 
mubarak stopped in new york on his way back to cairo after 
meeting with president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii in washington bush said the two leaders agreed that israel 
should end its occupation of arab lands and called for a properly 
structured international middle east peace conference 
the egyptian president complimented bush at the luncheon 
calling him a very knowledgeable man he knows the whole 
story of the middle east from beginning to end 
shamir followed mubarak to washington where he met with baker 
wednesday and will have a session with bush thursday the israeli 
prime minister has said an international conference would lead to 
other countries ganging up on israel and forcing it to yield land 
which shamirs rightwing likud bloc maintains is an inextricable 
part of israel 
in response to a written question at the luncheon mubarak said 
he thought it would be ill advised for him to consider a trip to 
israel after recent statements made by shamir denouncing the idea 
of an international conference or trading land for peace 
please tell me after that if you were in my shoes could 
you go there have coffee and turn back and tell the public 
opinion of egypt that mr shamir loved me mubarak asked

shells blasted street markets and a 
hospital wednesday killing at least 22 people in another of the 
fierce christianmoslem artillery duels that have kept residents in 
bomb shelters for a month 
the arab league appealed for a ceasefire and the shooting 
stopped at the appointed hour of midnight at least temporarily 
although the christian military commander had not agreed to the 
truce 
however a christian radio reported six shells falling in 
different locations in the christian area in the first hour after 
midnight and a prosyrian moslem radio reported one shell hit the 
moslem area 
police gave the death toll and said 70 people were wounded it 
was the fifth day moslem and christian residential areas have been 
bombarded without letup 
at least 159 people have been killed and 576 wounded since the 
battle began march 8 between gen michel aouns christian army 
units and an alliance of druse militiamen and syrian troops 
nearly all the casualties have been civilians it is the worst 
fighting since 1985 in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
sheik sabah ahmed sabah kuwaits foreign minister and head of 
an arab league mediation team called for the truce after meeting 
in damascus syria with lebanese moslem leaders 
we appeal to all the warring parties to observe a ceasefire 
as of midnight he said sabah urged belligerents to end attacks 
on ports and airports and to permit opening of crossing points 
between moslem west beirut and the christian eastern sector 
acting premier salim hoss endorsed the ceasefire 
i urge all sides to comply with the proposed truce out of 
mercy for the battered population said hoss who heads the 
moslem cabinet in what has been a dual government since a political 
crisis arose in september 
jibran kourieh spokesman for hafez assad did not say whether 
the syrian president endorsed the ceasefire but said he supported 
the committees work 
president assad stressed the necessity that all cooperate to 
save lebanon from the difficult circumstances it is going through 
so it becomes united and cooperates with the arab nation 
kourieh said 
aoun who leads the christian cabinet in addition to commanding 
the 20000 christian army troopers rejected any truce that does 
not name the syrian army as his main adversary 
there is only one power on the other side that can cease or 
unleash fire he said in an interview broadcast on christian 
stations in beirut it is the syrian army and any lebanese cover 
for the syrian army is unacceptable 
if syria accepts a ceasefire he said then i will accept 
he said he would negotiate whatever arrangements syria needs to 
ensure its military and political security but the syrian army 
must go we shall settle for nothing less 
assad has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league and has become the countrys main 
power broker aoun calls the syrians an occupation army and has 
vowed to drive them out 
in an interview published earlier the londonbased newspaper 
mideast mirror quoted aoun as saying he was willing to lift a 
blockade of illegal militiarun ports if the ports were not used 
for narcotics or arms traffic 
the fighting began march 8 two days after aouns forces closed 
the ports which deprive the government of an estimated 100 
million of duties and other revenue 
syrian troops in turn blockaded the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north and east of beirut where 1 million christians live 
with the aid of maj gen sami khatib who leads lebanons 22000 
moslem soldiers khatibs men are poorly equipped and have stayed 
out of the fighting 
a police spokesman said most of the casualties wednesday were in 
moslem west beirut where shells fired by aouns gunners hit three 
vegetable markets and the barbir hospital one of the moslem 
sectors four major medical centers 
he said the murr tower an unfinished 40story skyscraper syrian 
troops use as a base for snipers and artillery spotters took 
several direct hits from 155mm howitzers 
syrian soldiers were seen evacuating casualties from the tower 
firing automatic rifles into the air to clear the way for emergency 
vehicles there was no word on casualties from headquarters of the 
12000 syrian soldiers stationed in beirut 
foreign minister roland dumas of france the ruling power in 
lebanon until independence in 1943 called lebanon a community in 
peril and said his government was sending two ships loaded with 
food and medical supplies 
jeanfrancois deniau vice president of the french national 
assemblys foreign affairs committee arrived in beirut for 
meetings with leaders of both sides 
more than 700 lebanese who fled the fighting got off the ferry 
baroness on wednesday in larnaca cyprus capt george papadimatos 
said the ferry waits outside the lebanese christian port of jounieh 
all day then slips in without lights after dark to load passengers

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arrived 
wednesday night from cuba for a 40hour visit that will mix hard 
talk on human rights with traditional british pageantry 
flying from the sweltering caribbean into freezing british rain 
at heathrow airport gorbachev and his wife raisa got a 
redcarpet welcome with a royal military band prime minister 
margaret thatcher welcomed them with a warm smile on the tarmac 
after the plane touched down at 11 pm 
after the soviet national anthem was played gorbachev and mrs 
thatcher walked briskly under a pink umbrella past the honor guard 
of the royal air force natural massage gorbachev joked of the 
rain 
gorbachev and mrs thatcher made no statement before driving 
together to the soviet embassy residence in london to chat over 
coffee mrs gorbachev rode with mrs thatchers husband denis 
thatcher aides said the two leaders accompanied by their 
foreign ministers toasted each other at the soviet ambassadors 
residence the atmosphere was very good they were very pleased 
to see each other said the aide who spoke on condition he was 
not identified 
but they also got down to business discussing afghanistan and 
southern africa british officials said on the feb 15 withdrawal 
of soviet troops from afghanistan mrs thatcher told gorbachev he 
had fulfilled his promise before the world to depart 
about 100 people campaigning for jewish refuseniks demonstrated 
peacefully at an entrance to kensington palace gardens where the 
soviet embassy is housed gorbachev and mrs thatcher arrived at 
another entrance 
gorbachevs visit which includes a lunch with queen elizabeth 
ii at windsor castle is a major step in gorbachevs overtures to 
western europe but while britain is laying on the sort of lavish 
reception it used to reserve for its special allies there were 
signs of official anxiety that the gorbachev charm is working too 
well 
thursday was set aside for 2 hours of talks at mrs thatchers 
10 downing st residence followed by a wreathlaying ceremony at 
westminster abbey a visit to a hightech factory outside london 
and a downing street banquet 
officials say anglosoviet relations have never been better 
since world war ii and mrs thatcher interviewed on soviet tv 
wednesday had warm words for gorbachev she recalled a previous 
meeting at which she felt as though gorbachev was trying to point 
a giant searchlight into the future 
i had a deep instinct that it was the beginning of a quite new 
relationship she said he had this great vision it really 
has far more in common with the system we have worked toward over 
the years and which has given us our prosperity and our freedom 
but the thatcher government is also issuing pointed reminders 
about soviet human rights abuses and military might and charges 
that kgb agents are still spying and the kremlin is still too 
secretive about its chemical weapons 
a fullpage advertisement signed by 212 of the 650 members of 
the house of commons appeared in wednesday editions of the times of 
london urging britain to boycott a human rights conference in 
moscow in 1991 unless gorbachev measures up to a checklist 
freedom to emigrate freedom of religious and cultural 
expression freedom from discrimination freedom of all prisoners 
of conscience freedom of speech freedom to monitor these basic 
rights said the list 
nevertheless opinion polls in europe suggest gorbachevs charm 
offensive is getting results 
a market opinion and research international poll in wednesdays 
times showed that only 17 percent of britons consider the soviet 
union a threat compared with 42 percent in 1981 
only 35 percent of the 2025 people questioned believed the 
kremlin wants to extend its power over other countries down from 
70 percent in 1981 
mrs thatcher first met gorbachev in 1984 when he was the no 
2 and declared i like mr gorbachev we can do business 
together 
since then gorbachev appears to have forged a warm relationship 
with the doctrinaire anticommunist once dubbed the iron lady 
by the kremlin 
she visited moscow in 1987 and gorbachev was to have come to 
london in december but canceled the trip because of the armenian 
earthquake 
soviet officials have been on british radio and tv all week 
talking about gorbachevs reforms and the dawn of a new era in 
eastwest relations 
the gorbachevs will have lunch friday with the queen arriving 
at windsor castle in a procession of carriages and cavalry escorts 
the elite coldstream guards will serve as guard of honor 
beforehand gorbachev will give a major speech in the splendid 
setting of londons ancient guildhall seat of city government for 
1000 years 
mrs gorbachev will go sightseeing with education secretary 
kenneth baker taking in landmarks such as st pauls cathedral and 
tower bridge

a judge set bail on wednesday at 20 times 
the amount that prosecutors sought for the fired captain of the 
exxon valdez the ship that caused the nations worst oil spill 
a pale shaken and sweating joseph hazelwood whose lawyer had 
sought 5000 cash bail was led from the courtroom in handcuffs 
after judge kenneth rohl set bail at 1 million bond or 500000 
cash 
these misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been 
equaled at least in this country rohl said hes got to think 
about that we have a manmade destruction that has not been 
equaled probably since hiroshima 
the us atom bombing of hiroshima in 1945 killed or injured 
nearly 130000 people and leveled 90 percent of the japanese city 
a judge in alaska had set bail for hazelwood at 50000 
the size of bail shocked both prosecutors and defense attorneys 
we cant take out our wrath on one individual said suffolk 
county district attorney patrick henry its oversimplification 
to settle on one individual 
michael chalos an attorney for hazelwood said it was tough 
for our client to hear especially after the district attorney had 
recommended 25000 bail it was very harsh we thought 
hazelwood was arraigned in suffolk county court on a fugitive 
warrant and granted 30 days to prepare for a hearing on his 
extradition to alaska 
authorities there have charged him with three misdemeanors 
operating a ship while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil he faces 2 years in prison 
a 1 million bond can be secured with as little as 10 percent 
collateral in cash officials said 
rohl said that even though hazelwood faces only misdemeanors 
we are not talking about someone breaking someones windshield 
we are talking about a global catastrophe 
hazelwood allegedly admitted drinking before the tanker ran 
aground and caused the 101 milliongallon oil spill as such he 
is the architect of an american tragedy prosecutor philip 
castellano jr told the judge he recommended bail be set at 
25000 
another attorney for hazelwood thomas russo had sought 5000 
bail on the grounds his client was not a fugitive and not a 
criminal 
it was unclear how quickly the captain might make bail 
a million dollars is a lot of money chalos said 
the exxon valdez hit a reef in prince william sound on march 24 
and hazelwood apparently left anchorage the next night on a flight 
for new york the 42yearold seaman is a resident of the long 
island community of huntington

eastern airlines only to see the agreement with texas air corp 
chairman frank lorenzo hit snags at the last minute

ueberroth who returned to new york late tuesday night from his 
california home began negotiations with lorenzo at 730 am est 
wednesday and continued them until around 8 pm the source told 
the associated press that negotiations would resume thursday

they dont have a deal the source said theres still 
negotiations and sticking points its not done 
sources close to texas air however said ueberroth himself 
raised minor sticking points that kept the deal from being 
consummated 
the deal appeared to be closed wednesday afternoon when a new

announcement 
texas air spokesman art kent in houston said the company 
declined comment on the negotiations 
the deal had appeared to be completed wednesday afternoon when 
a new york public relations firm that works with lorenzo was told 
to rent a hotel room for a 7 pm news conference to announce it 
at 635 pm the public relations firm was told there would be no 
announcement 
separately the us bankruptcy court appointed washington 
attorney david shapiro as examiner in the eastern bankruptcy 
reorganization case 
shapiro 60 a partner in the firm dickstein shapiro amp morin 
was recommended by us trustee harry jones and appointed by us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
lifland recently ordered the appointment of an examiner whose 
unusually broad powers would include a mandate to mediate the 
bitter labor dispute at eastern and get the airline flying again 
union and airline sources had indicated late tuesday night and 
throughout wednesday that a sale to the ueberroth group was 
virtually certain eastern booked a meeting room for 7 pm 
wednesday at a manhattan hotel in anticipation of a possible deal 
but later told arriving reporters there was no announcement 
bruce zirinsky a bankruptcy attorney representing eastern said 
an accord on the sale of the carrier was likely imminent he 
didnt name the suitor but sources have said it was the ueberroth 
group which made and later withdrew a 464 million offer for 
eastern last week 
zirinsky told lifland who is overseeing easterns chapter 11 
reorganization and must approve any sale arrangement that serious 
negotiations on a sale of eastern continued wednesday 
eastern has been and continues to be involved in very serious 
negotiations with a third party regarding the possible acquisition 
of eastern airlines zirinsky told the judge at an afternoon 
bankruptcy hearing 
asked when agreement was likely he said it was a matter of 
days if not sooner

creditors of the airline on tuesday requested postponement of an 
examiner appointment for at least 24 hours lifland then ordered 
jones to explain in a wednesday hearing why the appointment should 
be deferred 
zirinsky declined to tell reporters after the hearing whether 
easterns parent texas air corp was negotiating with the ueberroth 
group 
but mary jane barry head of the eastern flight attendants union 
in miami said ueberroth notified her by telephone wednesday that 
there would be a potential sale of the airline possibly today 
eastern has been virtually grounded since its machinists union 
struck march 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in 
support the airline filed for protection from creditors in us 
bankruptcy court march 9 texas air chairman frank lorenzo has been 
trying to sell the carrier for weeks 
in a separate court action lifland approved an agreement 
between attorneys for eastern and the machinists union governing 
areas where peaceful picketing would be allowed at new yorks 
laguardia airport and at logan international airport in boston 
eastern had asked the judge to restrain union picketing on eastern 
property 
ueberroths group made a 464 million offer for eastern last 
week and then withdrew the bid after being told by texas air that 
it had been topped by another suitor identified by sources close 
to the situation as billionaire hotel executive jay a pritzker 
under the terms of ueberroths first offer he and thomas 
talbot a former airline executive from california would have 
owned 30 percent of the airline easterns unions would have 
received another 30 percent in exchange for wage and workrule 
concessions the remaining 40 percent would have been held by new 
investors 
the offer called for 200 million to be paid in cash and the 
rest in securities to be sold by the groups investment bankers

slipping bits of religion into countries that 
oppose it used to be high adventure but it has mellowed says a 
practitioner still he adds many barriers remain 
the rev robert k hawley director of open doors usa says 
that while some of the suspense and drama of its operations have 
waned the organization continues tackling the stiffest restraints 
on faith 
we go to the most restricted of restricted countries 
seeking to bolster religious life he said in an interview we do 
it officially if we can if we cant we do it unofficially 
we always obey the government unless its contrary to the 
gospel 
he heads the us branch of an interdenominational 
international organization with an 11 million annual budget a 
staff of 250 headquarters in the netherlands and operations in 30 
countries 
the us branch with offices in santa ana calif has a staff 
of 36 along with hundreds of volunteers spending time in aided 
areas hawley 40 is a texasborn baptist clergymen who previously 
led california congregations 
the organization was founded in 1955 by a dutch reformed 
minister brother andrews its president with the objective of 
supplying bibles and other religious materials in areas of 
religious oppression 
his widely sold book gods smuggler put a picturesque 
stamp on the organization the undercover activities secret 
missions and meetings clandestine rendezvous and some of that 
aura lingers though tamer now 
this kind of ministry has matured he said the world 
generally has recognized religious restrictions as a human rights 
issue 
however code names still are given to various undertakings 
such as project philip by which western volunteers now are 
providing theological training in homes in sovietbloc countries to 
equip ministers 
hawley said 1800 students now are involved and 250 have become 
pastors 
he said circumventing regulations still is necessary in some 
cases even in the thawing communism of china although bibles now 
printed there go to registered church members he said house 
christians are left out 
to buy a bible you usually have to show you are a member of a 
registered church he said in this category are about nine 
million protestants and catholics but an estimated 50 million 
others worship in homes 
in trying to handcarry bibles to the house christians last 
year he said a batch of 200 in his bags were confiscated by 
customs agents who cited a law forbidding entry of outside 
religious material 
when they say theyre open now its only what they define as 
open he said we have about 500 couriers going into china 
every year many get caught but many dont we call it a miracle 
of god 
he said chinese contacts are alerted in advance with meeting 
places arranged to begin the distribution process rejecting 
criticism by some church officials that such smuggling worsens 
conditions for believers he said 
they encourage it they encourage us he said we as a 
ministry never take materials into a country unless specifically 
requested by christians there our job is not to jeopardize but 
help them 
nevertheless he said the situation has eased in most communist 
areas and much work that once was done covertly now is carried on 
in the open with official approval 
he has just returned from a twoweek trip to the soviet union 
and said he is cautiously optimistic about its expanding 
religious vitality there is more freedom he said 
his organization now has a governmentapproved project under way 
to ship a million new testaments with psalms to russian orthodox 
christians this year the first batch of 100000 delivered while he 
was there 
he said various groups including the united bible societies 
have shipped more than a million bibles to the soviet in the last 
two years with official permission 
more than 400 new churches opened there last year and l000 more 
are expected to be opened this year bringing the total to more 
than 15000 he said he said prospects are that two russian 
orthodox prelates will be made members of the supreme soviet 
limited in the past to the communist party 
he said that just as stalin in 1942 eased antireligious 
measures in order to mobilize christian support for the war with 
nazism the present communist regime realizes church people are 
essential to reviving the soviet economy 
the church is the soviets largest labor union for 
revitalizing the economy hawley said adding that church 
membership there exceeds 70 million 
he said that for the first time the church has been 
recognized by the government as a valuable and viable insitution 
for the moral training and character of society 
however he added until there are bibles in soviet schools 
bookstores and the church the society is not free when it was 
noted that us public schools shun bible courses because of 
churchstate separation he said that doesnt make it right

theres a busy reception room at the capitol 
named for former senate majority leader mike mansfield but his own 
visits are rare and by invitation only 
ive seen too many retired senators go back too often said 
mansfield now 86 an elder statesman with two portfolios he 
served 16 years as the leader of the senate democratic majority 
then 11 as the us ambassador to japan no one ever has served 
longer in either role 
mansfield retired as ambassador at the end of last year 
returned to washington and went back to work he now is a 
consultant to the investment banking firm goldman sachs amp co on 
matters involving japan and other nations of east asia 
it involves no lobbying said the former senator from 
montana accentuating the negative mansfield said he provides 
information and advice on political economic and strategic matters 
in the far east his specialty as historian politician and 
diplomat for more than 50 years 
he says it is a perfect assignment because he is doing what hed 
be doing anyhow maintaining his contacts and continuing his 
research on the region that has been his specialty since he first 
saw east asia as a marine in the 1920s 
looking at the senate he left a dozen years ago mansfield sees 
all too many lobbyists too much pressure to raise funds for 
increasingly costly campaigns too many staff members the number 
of congressional staffers has nearly tripled since his leadership 
days 
mansfield was elected to the house from montana in 1942 and to 
the senate in 1952 he became majority leader in 1961 and retired 
from the senate in 1977 
he said he left because a senator had to wear so many hats deal 
with so many issues and pressures theyre under far greater 
pressure now he said in an interview and their privacy is a 
fading memory 
he also sees the senate of 1989 as a more contentious place 
recalling a time of greater comradeship transcending political 
differences it seems to have dissipated and that i think is 
tragic he said 
the former majority leader said he seldom visits his old haunts 
because the welcome mat is thin and properly so he said the first 
time a retired senator comes back his former colleagues are 
delighted the second time they are polite the third time they 
wonder what the hell youre doing there 
mansfield said one thing he liked about serving as ambassador 
was that the issues were better defined than for a senator and 
fewer in number he said the major ones on his agenda in tokyo were 
mutual defense and trade mansfield said defense relations are in 
sound shape now but trade remains a difficult issue 
its one on which he differs with some of his democratic 
successors in congress mansfield warns at every opportunity 
against protectionist trade measures saying they would be 
counterproductive in the long term 
that message was constant during his time as ambassador an era 
when japanese exports soared along with the us trade deficit 
mansfield insists that us trade with japan should be based upon 
free enterprise tenets and that the better competitor should get 
the business 
mansfield advocates a free trade treaty with japan to open the 
markets of each nation to the other neither washington nor tokyo 
is moving for such an accord but mansfield keeps at it in his new 
role 
bits and pieces trade policies can lead to retaliation if 
carried too far he said protectionism is not the answer it 
might mean more jobs in the short term but in the long run it 
would cost jobs fuel inflation and risk trade retaliation 
mansfield said 
as ambassador mansfield sometimes was criticized on grounds he 
was too accommodating toward the japanese on trade questions but 
his warnings against protectionism were addressed to both sides he 
told the japanese that they would heighten the risk of retaliatory 
protectionist measures unless they opened their own markets and 
pulled down trade barriers 
mansfield says that japan has moved in that direction 
were becoming more interlocked and integrated he said 
youve got a lot of american investment in japan youre going to 
have a lot more

a scathing portrait of the late cary grant has 
hit bookstores under the title the lonely heart 
the books name is taken from one of the actors 72 feature 
films none but the lonely heart but another grant movie might 
provide a more appropriate title the awful truth 
written by charles higham author of biographies on marlon 
brando and katharine hepburn and roy moseley who has written 
about merle oberon and rex harrison the lonely heart talks 
about the stars numerous homosexual affairs stormy marraiges and 
battles on film sets with directors and fellow actors 
the book alleges that grant whose real name was archibald 
leach was born out of wedlock to a jewish woman secretly acted as 
an agent for several hollywood stars and worked for british 
intelligence during world war ii the lonely heart also repeats 
the story of his admitted use of lsd 
even the books index provides unflattering coverage a quick 
check under grant cary lists headings for the following as 
liar his nose stinginess showing his age and 
faked suicide attempt under the heading homosexuality the 
book urges readers to see also bisexuality of 
grant whose movies include his girl friday to catch a 
thief north by northwest and gunga din died in 1986 at 
the age of 82 
despite the trashing grant receives the authors do praise his 
acting skills and present many fond reminiscences from old friends 
cary grant despite his many very human failings did his best to 
be a good and decent man the authors conclude in a preface 
it really is not a muckraking book higham said in an 
interview nor is it a fan book i try to balance everything i 
see my biographies of stars as a continuing social history told 
through biography i suppose people will look back on this age and 
say what were they like who were these people 
moseley and higham draw on interviews with several dozen people 
for the lonely heart including hepburn who costarred with 
grant in four films marlene dietrich and virginia cherrill the 
actors first wife 
grants life is shown beginning with his birth in bristol 
england in 1904 up to the very last hours before his fatal stroke 
higham who met grant on several occasions says he was 
fascinated by the differences between the stars public and private 
behavior i had been raised where people who were gracious and 
polite really were gracious and polite they didnt have two 
personalities the londonborn author said i think the 
contrast between the violence and tension in private and the utter 
charm with a reporter that made me realize many celebrities had 
enormous conflicts even schizophrenia 
grants conflicts seem to have begun at birth his father elias 
leach was a suit presser who had several girlfriends the lonely 
heart reports that although both elias leach and his wife elsie 
were gentiles they had the infant circumcised a traditional 
jewish custom grant would later make generous donations to israel 
in honor of his dead jewish mother 
the young archibald leach quickly displayed exceptional athletic 
ability and was just in his midteens when he joined the pender 
troupe a traveling company of acrobats in the early 1930s leach 
headed for hollywood where he had a contract with paramount 
pictures and quickly was renamed cary grant the first name 
derived from cary lockwood a character he played in a stage show 
the last name was chosen by studio publicists 
rumors of grants homosexual relationships surfaced quickly 
higham recalled a conversation he had in the 60s with dietrich 
who starred in blonde venus one of grants first films 
one night we were at dinner and i asked her about blonde 
venus and whether she had had any offscreen relationship with 
cary grant she responded oh no that was out of the question 
becuase he was homosexual it was simply a given it was 
understood to be the case 
in 1932 grant met cherrill an actress who portrayed the blind 
girl in charlie chaplins classic city lights and married her 
in 1934 by all accounts they were an unhappy couple with grant 
given to furious temper tantrums and even physical violence they 
were divorced the following year grant would marry four more 
times and had one child jennifer with the actress dyan cannon 
his fourth wife 
by 1937 grants work in topper and the awful truth had 
made him one of hollywoods most popular leading men his good 
looks lilting english accent and quick wit were the perfect 
ingredients for light romantic comedies grant would go on to 
appear opposite some of the worlds most beautiful actresses 
including grace kelly ingrid bergman and sophia loren he was 
still a major boxoffice draw when he retired in 1966 
but while his screen image was carefree and charming higham and 
moseley write that he was privately tormented by conflicting sexual 
desires and insecurity over his success 
on the screen there is no one more relaxed more dapper 
seeminginly more cool higham said yet this was achieved at 
considerably more cost it interests me that some people would 
rather not know this 
according to higham and moseley grant secretly went into 
business in the mid30s with an old friend frank vincent along 
with film agent harry edington they operated a firm whose 
clientele included dietrich and rita hayworth 
i think one of the most surprising things was that he was a 
hollywood agent higham said he was picking up a percentage of 
a percentage frank vincent had become a very powerful agent he 
was running around getting people deals 
higham said curiosity was his main reason for doing the book 
i got to know him on a very superficial social level the 
author said i found him very interesting but very aloof i hoped 
the book would be a solution to a mystery i saw him as a puzzling 
mystery around whom many others flew

psychiatrists rarely examine their patients 
religion objectively tending to assume it only indicates problems 
a new study says but it finds the negative assumptions dont hold 
up when tested 
patients with major depresssion and anxiety disorders 
contained the lowest percentage of believers in god the study 
saysat the very least we can say that depresssion is not 
correlated with greater religiousness 
the researchers urge more evenhanded studies in this area 
citing evidence of the importance of religion to most people and 
pointing out that psychiatry generally has not considered the 
religious factor 
that aspect has been largely ignored says psychiatrist 
jerome kroll of the university of minnesota but things are 
beginning to change not to a great degree but slowly 
kroll and an associate psychiatrist william sheehan recently 
completed a study pointing up the relative disregard of religion by 
mental health specialists compared to patients and people generally 
weve been overlooking an important factor kroll said in a 
telephone interview a lot of our patients believe in god and are 
interested in the church but they arent even asked about it 
its often a source of strength and help to them 
in the american journal of psychiatry kroll and sheehan cite 
surveys finding that 95 percent of the general public profess 
belief in god compared to 55 percent of psychiatrists and 43 
percent of psychologists 
the two also cite a 1986 review that found only 59 or 25 
percent of 2348 psychiatric articles included religion in their 
quantitative data about cases the report adds 
belief in god and in the teachings of the bible the sense of 
an afterlife and social and personal involvement within a church 
community are relevant dimensions of our patients lives that 
certainly deserve more consideration than the psychiatric 
profession has customarily provided 
kroll said that while psychiatrists generally have ignored 
religion as a relevant factor in their patients condition they 
often have automatically blamed it for excessive guilt 
in psychiatry it has long been thought and believed that 
religion brings out unhealthy aspects in people and contributed to 
depression and other mental illness he said our indications 
is that this is not so 
he and sheehan in their study examined religious beliefs 
practices and involvement of 52 psychiatric patients at the 
university of minnesota hospital and clinic 
their rate of belief in major tenets of faith was found to be 
high but patients with major depression and anxiety disorders 
contained the lowest percentage of believers in god the report 
says 
this is contrary to expectations that depressive patients 
feel excessive guilt and blameworthiness and that anger and 
guilt underlies depression the report says 
our depressed patients along with the patients with anxiety 
disorder were the least religiously oriented disagnostic group 
the report says while all those with disorders not associated with 
guilt believed in god 
kroll in the interview noted the sampling was limited but 
added 
often guilt is thought to be religiously inspired this 
indicates that is not so religion has been held to be the culprit 
by some psychiatrists but there is no evidence of it 
were saying its not so 
were saying that the role of guilt in depression is 
overemphasized and is not borne out by the facts the thinking has 
been that anger and guilt underlie depression but when you look 
for the guilt its not there 
kroll 52 is jewish and while sheehan about 30 is roman 
catholic kroll said that psychiatry developed its antagonism to 
religion under the freudian influences of the 1940s and l950s 
traditionally psychiatrists and psychologists have not paid 
much attention to the religious part of life he said they 
hardly ever mentioned it 
but he said attitudes began changing in the 1970s not much on 
the east coast but more so elsewhere as indicated by increasing 
pastoral counsellors in hospitals and the presence of clergy in 
psychiatric wards 
clergy are being used more in psychiatry he said theres 
a coming together of resources in a way that didnt used to be the 
case its increasing 
theres a greater awareness that science just doesnt answer 
all of lifes problems 
he said disagreement still exists in psychiatry about whether 
religion is helpful or hurtful to mental health with both sides 
presenting evidence for their case he added 
most pscyhiatrists tend to take a neutral viewpoint and not 
to pay to much attention to it at all thats why theyve skipped 
over it and havent appreciated how important it was

a group of middleclass men concerned that 
friends were dying and nothing was being done met in greenwich 
village eight years ago 
they called themselves gay mens health crisis they had little 
money and less clout there was no name for the disease that 
brought them together 
today gay mens health crisis has a 10 million budget its own 
sixstory manhattan building and 2000 volunteers and the disease 
has a name acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
after years of hectoring politicians and public health officials 
to address the problems of people with aids gmhc and its cohorts 
are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of 
that population 
nationwide more than 87000 cases of aids have been reported 
about twothirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men but in 
many cities especially along the east coast someone diagnosed 
with aids today is about as likely to have become infected by 
shooting up with dirty needles as through sex 
in new york city intravenous drug abusers comprised an 
estimated 45 percent of all newly reported aids cases last year 
these projections bear out what we have long known that the 
spread of aids is fueled by drugs and that aids is accelerating 
its onslaught upon poor drugravaged neighborhoods and minority 
communities said city health commissioner stephen joseph 
in new jersey iv drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new aids 
cases 
what this means to aidsservice providers is only now being 
addressed 
san francisco with the most people with aids per capita of any 
us city wins praise from all quarters for its response to the 
epidemic 
its shanti project a peercounseling group for the terminally 
ill had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct now it has a 
3 million budget and a paid staff of 70 directing counseling 
groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for 
people with aids 
but greg day shantis education director notes that about 96 
percent of aids cases in the city are among gay males who used to 
lead relatively normal lives were employed full time and have a 
firmer footing in society 
i think that because the impact of aids has been primarily 
overwhelmingly on the gay community thus far we have succeeded so 
far in developing our resources along with the epidemic he said 
we dont have the answers yet on how to best serve the iv 
druguser population 
the situation is similar in los angeles seattle minneapolis 
and other cities where the number of iv drug users is relatively 
small experts say 
in chicago things are more difficult 
what were dealing with here in chicago particularly when 
were dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution is 
not the gay community but blacks minorities iv drug users 
prostitutes and their families people of the streets basically 
said al mascia of travelers and immigrants aid a private group 
that helps house homeless people with aids 
while we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of 
the models that san francisco has were talking about working with 
a different population for the most part mascia said 
part of the problem is that an iv drug user does not 
automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with aids but most 
aids organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment 
before they are accepted as clients 
its fine for us to deal with you as someone with arc 
aidsrelated condition or aids said tim sweeney gmhc deputy 
director for policy but the truth is if youre just leaving our 
front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm 
were really not doing you any big favor 
youve got two illnesses to be dealt with 
programs such as gmhc and the shanti project depend on 
volunteers but sweeney said we are finding now that the 
volunteer model really doesnt work with them they need much more 
direct intense case management much more involvement usually by 
a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of 
their life so that theyre independent 
the drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless yet shelters 
are no place for someone infected with aids several cities run 
apartments for people with aids capable of independent living but 
demand far outstrips supply 
people with aids who no longer need hospitalization but have no 
place to go often are sent to singleroomoccupancy hotels where 
they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy 
surroundings and crime 
many are discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench 
out front said larry ellis of lifelink a washingtonbased aids 
organization 
in new york a lucky few find room in the highly praised 
privately run bailey house the citys only supervised aids 
residence it opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to 
add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990 
for lawrence conklin 38 a 20year heroin and cocaine addict 
diagnosed with aids about two years ago a clean nicely furnished 
room at bailey house and a treatment program was the only thing 
that saved me

the 1989 cadillac fleetwood sedan offers a sedate way to travel 
in a big way 
passengers can relax on tufted seats in a roomy interior any 
jostles or bumps from the road are carefully cushioned even the 
impressive 45liter v8 pours on the power without throwing you 
abruptly back in the seats 
mostly this car is huge its like having your whole living 
room in the back seat 
for 1989 general motors corps cadillac division added nine 
inches to the length of the fleetwood sedan and its sister car the 
de ville and another three inches to the cars wheelbase 
the exterior styling also accentuates the large size subtle 
tailfins make the fleetwood look similar to the big cadillacs of 
earlier days the new fleetwood also has full rearwheel fender 
skirts 
why the change big is better with buyers 
after the de ville and fleetwood were downsized in the 1984 
model year many buyers and critics blasted the new models and 
sales suffered with the new bigger fleetwood and de villes out 
cadillac reports modelyear sales of the cars up more than 26 
percent to more than 71500 through early this year compared with 
yearago sales of more than 56700 
cadlac projects full modelyear sales to rise between 11 
percent and 15 percent over 1988 model sales of 148398 ite 
the size however the 1989 fleetwood sedan 
surprisingly easy to handle i didnt have much 
in its lane even on windy roaonic teves 
antilock brakes helped slow this big auto down safely even on 
rainslicked streets 
the engine coupled with fourspeed automatic overdrive 
transmission performed well and provided a smooth ride the 
computercontrolled transaxle waspecially set so there would be 
ting cadillac said 
the company also notedat the car can go from 0 to 60 man 10 seconds 
but the engine sure swigged down the gasoline 
in city driving i of fuel according to the 
onbmputer making just a couple 6m made more efficient use of fuel as 
expected on the 
highway and officially t fleetwood sedan is 
17 mpg in the city and 25 on the highway if youre paying one of these 
cars the price of gasoline may not be a big 
worry 
inside the fleetwood sedan there were pleasant surprisestouches lighted 
vanity mirrors popped out of the ceiling for 
rearseat passengers frontseat occupants had thn the back of the sun 
visors floor mats were reversible 
and machine washable the short nap on one side was for sloppy 
winter weather with the other side ideal for 
lessdirty times of the year 
thure brakes lights and blinkers worked 
because of small monitor lights above the red 
monitor lights would blink and light up in conjunction with the 
brake lights and blinkers likewise there were small light 
monitors on the front hood that indicated ife on 
the t also had some options that tookings 
automatically an automatic rearview mirror that adjusted to 
headlights an 80 option a sixway memory driver seat a 235 
option and door locks that automatically locked when the car was 
shifted out of park a 185 option 
needless to say there was plenty of legroom hip room and head 
room in this car in the front seats and ininess is what 
this car is all about the trunk with 184cubicf space 
compared with 16 cubic feet in last years model was mnctive in todays 
market where smaller cars dominate 
cadillac says compet 
is both wider and longer than the fleetwood by a few inches and 
starts at more than 25500 and the lincoln continental which is 
about the same length andidth as the fleetwood and starts at more 
than 28000 
cadspokesman kyle johnson said the company has only 
demographics of early buyers he said buyers range in age fromwith an average 
income of 50000 
in the past about 70 pe buyers have been men since 
the 1989 fleetwood is newly restyl no owner complaint 
data at consumer reports however 1986model frontdrive 
fleetwoods ranked average in the magazines trouble index while 
1987model frontdrive fleetwoods ranked worse than average

industrial america enjoyed a banner year in 
terms of profits and sales during 1988 as the economy expanded for 
the sixth consecutive year fortune magazine noted in its latest 
ranking of the 500 largest us manufacturing companies 
any way you cut it last year was the most prosperous for the 
500 since fortune published the first 500 directory in 1955 
fortune said in its april 24 issue released to the news media 
tuesday and available on newsstands today 
demand continued to surge and factories and refineries 
operated near capacity 
the magazine said sales by the fortune 500 last year topped 2 
trillion for the first time while total profits for the group 
jumped 27 percent to a record 115 billion 
the big three automakers had especially strong revenue last 
year with general motors corp again topping the fortune 500 and 
ford motor co bumping exxon corp from the no 2 spot chrysler 
corp jumped to no 7 from no 10 
companies involved in acquisitions also moved higher philip 
morris cos took the no 10 spot up from 12th last year partly 
due to its acquisition of kraft corp ranked 31st in 1987 eastman 
kodak co jumped to no 18 from no 25 with the acquisition of 
sterling drug inc ranked 174 the previous year 
the magazine ranks companies in terms of annual sales it also 
publishes a list later in the year of the top 500 us service 
companies 
the top 10 after gm and ford were exxon international business 
machines corp general electric co mobil corp chrysler texaco 
inc ei du pont de nemours amp co and philip morris 
american telephone amp telegraph co ranked 8th in the 1987 
listing was bumped from the 1988 list because most of its revenue 
was generated from the service sector itt corp ranked no 45 in 
1987 also fell into that category the highestranking newcomer to 
the 500 list was unilever us owned by the britishdutch consumer 
products giant unilever which debuted at no 63 
coincidentally all companies on the list this year had at least 
500 million in sales the 500th company chemed corp of 
cincinnati had sales of 5006 million 
but measured in constant inflationadjusted 1982 dollars 
chemeds sales were about 100 million less than the 1974 sales of 
tyler corp the record holder as the largest 500th company ever 
the magazine said nearly all of the 27 industrial categories 
contained in its list had doubledigit earnings growth in 1988 led 
by metal companies which showed a 100 percent jump boosted by 
soaring copper prices and the steel industrys successful 
restructuring 
fortune said some of the profit increases were due to accounting 
changes requiring companies to consolidate results of their 
majorityowned subsidiaries 
large oil refiners posted a 63 percent increase in profits 
benefiting from what fortune called a doubledose of luck opec 
squabbling drove crude oil prices down lowering costs while 
demand strengthened increasing prices 
no 31 phillips petroleum co profited most by those 
circumstances as earnings jumped 18fold 
pennzoil corp ranked no 201 was the biggest profit gainer 
among the 500 with a 30fold rise in earnings but the company 
owed most of that bounty to an extraordinary gain from its 
celebrated 3 billion lawsuit settlement with texaco 
hanna ma co a chemicals and energy concern had the 
biggest increase in sales a 122 percent jump 
the only two industry groups with declining profits in 1988 were 
apparel companies which suffered a 3 percent drop and building 
materials concerns which lost 18 percent as housing starts 
declined for the second straight year in 1988 
no 460 maxus energy corp had the biggest drop in sales 
suffering a 53 percent decline due to a restructuring 
maxus the renamed diamond shamrock corp spun off its oil 
refining and marketing operations as diamond shamrock rampm inc 
with maxus retaining the exploration and production business 
geographically new york is home to the greatest number of 
fortune 500 companies 48 down from 51 the previous year chicago 
repeated as no 2 with 22 down from 24 the year before and dallas 
was no 3 with 15 up from 12 
the rest of the top 10 were houston 13 up from 12 
pittsburgh 12 down from 15 cleveland 11 down from 12 atlanta 
and minneapolis tied for seventh with 10 each the same as last 
year and st louis and stamford conn tied for ninth with nine 
down from 10 last year

an uproar over the religious imagery in 
madonnas like a prayer music video has doomed the 
entertainers pepsi commercials 
pepsicola co confirmed tuesday it is dropping the ads even 
though the soft drink maker had no connection with the music video 
which some groups found sacrilegious 
pepsis decision is similar to a recent series of incidents in 
which corporations have bowed to pressure from consumers and 
religious activists over corporate sponsorship of programs the 
critics deem objectionable 
spokesman tod mackenzie said pepsi heard from consumers who 
complained about the music video because they thought it was 
pepsis commercial both the commercial and the video featured the 
same madonna song like a prayer 
its an unfortunate situation he said 
marty blackman head of a new yorkbased consulting firm that 
advises businesses on the use of celebrities said pepsi should 
have known madonna would prove controversial 
this was a personality controversial enough that you know you 
have to do your homework your research and it wasnt done he 
said 
but jesse meyers who publishes beverage digest in greenwich 
conn said he found it sad that any group can dictate to a 
consumer goods company what they can and cant do 
the pepsi commercial featuring madonna was run only twice in the 
united states in early march 
the ad which featured the first public airing of her song 
like a prayer made its debut march 2 in 40 countries it ran a 
second time in the us on a latenight show march 3 and continues 
to run overseas where there have been no complaints of confusion 
of the ad and the video mackenzie said 
pepsi had planned to cut the twominute ad into shorter versions 
for replay here after madonnas song built a following 
but in scrapping those plans pepsi joined several companies 
that have altered advertising plans after consumers blamed 
advertisers for the moral content of broadcasts 
ralston purina co procter amp gamble co tambrands inc and 
others recently either have cancelled ads or instructed their ad 
agencies not to buy more time on shows after consumers objected to 
the programs content two shows in particular that prompted 
protests are nbcs saturday night live and fox broadcasting 
networks married with children 
the trend has alarmed some constitutional rights advocates who 
say advertisers are opening the door to even more activism by 
selfstyled moral advocates and to selfcensorship by programmers 
who may want to avoid a fight 
but pepsis case is somewhat unique because it was blamed for 
something it did not produce 
the pepsi ad featuring madonna titled make a wish showed 
the singer posing as a woman watching an old home movie of her 
eighth birthday party 
the woman and the child traded places in the commercial with 
madonna singing like a prayer and dancing in school and in a 
church while the youngster browsed through the womans apartment 
pepsi said it created the ad without ever seeing the music video 
that accompanied the release of the like a prayer single 
the music video released a day after the ad ran showed a woman 
assisting a man wrongly accused of a crime madonna kisses a statue 
that comes to life dances among burning crosses and is afflicted 
with cuts on her hand resembling the wounds christians believe 
jesus christ suffered during crucifixion 
a mississippibased religious group the american family 
association and the bishop of corpus christi texas separately 
called for oneyear boycotts of pepsi products because of the 
videos imagery 
both boycotts were called off last week after pepsi officials 
told the bishop and the afa it planned to discontinue using the 
singer in its ads 
the rev donald wildmon of the afa said pepsi also planned to 
withdraw its sponsorship of a madonna concert tour but pepsi had 
no comment on that pepsi reportedly paid madonna about 5 million 
under a oneyear contract that included commercials and the tour 
liz rosenberg a publicist for madonna at warner bros records 
said the singer had no comment on pepsis action

the predators ball begins 
today but the life of the party isnt around 
michael milken top junk bond trader for drexel burnham lambert 
inc cant be at the annual event the company calls the 
institutional research conference which attracts a whos who of 
corporate takeover artists 
milken who was charged last week with 98 counts of securities 
fraud and racketeering in connection with alleged trading 
violations is officially on leave from his job as drexels junk 
bond guru 
the predators ball actually a 3day conference on highyield 
bond financing and finance in general was scheduled to open early 
today at the beverly hilton hotel with a talk by jaime escalante 
the highschool math teacher whose success with underpriveleged 
students was the basis of the movie stand and deliver 
john h kissick milkens successor as head of drexels 
highyield bond unit in beverly hills planned a getacquainted 
talk at the earlymorning session 
despite his absence milkens image looms large over the meeting 
he was omnipresent said clark johnson chairman and chief 
executive of pier 1 imports inc of fort worth texas a 
participant you saw him around and of course he was running the 
show he was having meetings he was doing deals he was being his 
usual energetic indefatigable self 
even without its guiding light the meeting is a unique 
convention of american entrepreneurs who have built or bought 
companies with junk bonds johnson said 
you always come away reenergized with a lot of new ideas 
johnson said in a telephone interview before the meeting these 
have been the growth companies the companies that are doing 
things the companies that are rebuilding corporate america 
drexel is downplaying milkens absence from the conference much 
as it is working to assure investors the firm can remain a prime 
mover in the highyield bond market without him 
the conference is the most heavily attended yet said drexel 
spokesman steve anreder who emphasized the varied schedule of 
sessions on subjects ranging from third world debt to employee 
stock plans to the savings and loan industry 
i think what that says is the highyield market has been 
validated and theres a lot of interest the spokesman said 
milken is credited with building the multibilliondollar market 
in junk bonds the highrisk highinterest bonds used by 
entrepreneurs and corporate takeover artists to raise cash 
in addition to popularizing use of the bonds dubbed junk 
because they receive lower than investmentgrade ratings from 
bondrating agencies milken was at the center of a newtork of 
traders who both sold bonds for their own projects and could be 
tapped to invest in junk bonds sold by others

us automakers new incentive packages are 
getting a big test in the midst of the traditional spring 
carbuying season as sales continued lower than expected down 183 
percent in late march compared with last year 
they carmakers have got to be a little bit nervous 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
said tuesday after the sales figures were reported 
vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 42451 in the march 
2131 period this year compared with a 51960 daily rate during 
the same time last year car sales were off 181 percent and light 
truck sales were 187 percent behind last year 
theres no question that the consumers may be cinching up 
their belts a little bit phillippi said it could be a tough 
go here in the month of april april is absolutely critical 
in years past car shoppers flocked to showrooms in march and 
april to get ready for the summertime driving season but the 
figures reported tuesday showed there was some hesitation 
during march cars and light trucks made in both north america 
and overseas sold at an average daily rate of 47848 vehicles down 
126 percent from the 54756 daily rate during march 1988 when the 
industry was establishing the secondbest sales year in history 
normally the month of march is a very critical month for 
determining the kickoff of the spring selling season phillippi 
said we didnt have a kickoff 
sales manager ham klosterman of lamar ferrell chevrolet in 
decatur ga outside atlanta said march sales were better than 
februarys but that he added isnt saying a whole heck of a 
lot 
if it hadnt been for the last five to seven days of march it 
would have been a disaster klosterman said noting that 
consumers were pushed toward showrooms by a 1 percentage point 
increase in the georgia sales tax effective april 1 
automakers themselves gave a good indication of their concern 
during the past week by offering new incentive packages that 
included more vehicles than previous programs boosted some cash 
rebates and slashed interest rates as low as zero percent at 
chrysler and 29 percent at ford and gm on twoyear loans 
i guess the key is that everybody was still sort of getting 
their incentive programs into place in late march and a lot of 
buyers were hanging back to wait and see what would happen 
phillippi said 
there was a question about how long car buyers would hold back 
especially those who have been hit by increased mortgage payments 
and other higher monthly bills because of climbing interest rates 
if the zeros and the 29s dont work then were in deep 
trouble phillippi said 
chryslers late march car sales fell to an average daily rate of 
3544 264 percent lower than the 4813 caraday rate during the 
period last year chrysler said it sold 216 percent fewer cars 
through march 31 this year compared with the same time last year 
chryslers truck sales during late march were 198 percent 
behind last years rate but for the year were up 07 percent 
gm reported a 239 percent decline in late march car sales 
dropping to a daily rate of 12159 during the period this year 
compared with a rate of 15973 cars during the same time last year 
for the first three months of 1989 gms car sales were running 
146 percent behind last years pace during the same time 
sales of gms light trucks fell 182 percent during the march 
2131 period this year and were down 66 during januarymarch 
ford said its sales of north americanmade cars averaged 8077 a 
day during late march compared with a rate of 9359 in late march 
1988 a decline of 137 percent for the year fords car sales 
were down 41 percent 
sales of light trucks made by ford were off 238 percent in late 
march this year and down 58 percent for the first quarter 
compared with the same periods in 1988

the legal system has failed to respond adequately 
to the threat that computer hackers pose to the computer networks 
that are crucial to corporate america a computer expert says 
many computer hackers are given slaps on the wrist mark 
leary a senior analyst with international data corp said at a 
tuesday roundtable discussion 
the justice system has to step up to the fact that these 
people are malicious and are criminals and are robbing banks just 
as much as if they walked up with a shotgun he said 
other panelists complained that hackers because of their 
abilities at breaking into computer system are even given jobs 
sometimes as security consultants 
the experts spoke at a roundtable sponsored by network world 
magazine a publication targeted at computer network users and 
managers 
compr networks have become crucial to business fromnd compiling information 
to overseeing and running 
manufacturing processes 
the public alss increasingly exposed to networks through such 
devices as automatic teller machines at banks airline reservation 
systems and company computers that store billing information 
companies became more willing to spend money on computer 
security after last years celebrated invasion of a nationwide 
computer network by a computer virus allegedly unleashed by araduate student 
the experts said 
the incident caused us to reassess the priorities with which 
we look at certain threats said dennis steinaur manager of the 
compcurity management group of the national instituttechnology 
but computer security is not only a matter of gagainst 
unauthorized entry according to max hoe president 
for information systems at american airlines 
hopper said american has built a cheyenne moun 
installation for its computer systems to guard against a varietf 
problems including electrical failure and natural disasterg to the defense 
departments underground nerve center 
inside acolorado mountain he said americans precautione a threeday supply 
of food 
weve done everything we caect the total 
environment hopper said 
hopper and steinaur said that despite the hightech image of 
computer terrorism it remains an administrative problem that 
should be approached as a routine management issue 
but the experts agreed that the greatest danger to computer 
networks does not come from outside hackers instead they said 
the biggesthreat is from disgruntled employees or others whose 
original access to systems was legitimate 
while screening of potential employees is usteinaur said 
it is more important to build within computer systems ways to track 
unauthorized use and to publicize that hacking can be found out and 
traced 
but steinaur said growing computer literay plus the activities 
of some nonmalicious hackers help security managers in some 
respects 
expanded knowledge forces us as security managers not to be 
dependent on ignorance s 
security needs to be a part of the system rather than a 
nuisance addition steinaur said and we probably have not 
done a very good job of making management realize that security is 
an integral part of the system 
idcs leary said the organizations surveys of fortune 1000 
companies surprisingly found a signiumber of companies were 
doing little to protect their systems 
the discussion the first of three planned by network world was 
held because computer sabotage is a real problem that p 
arent aware of said editor john gallant many business people 
believe sabotage cases are glamorous incidents that happen to 
sophisticated networks 
also it is a problem that many industry vendors are reluctant 
to address he said because it raises questions about a companys 
reliability 
data can be restored but it takes years to rebuild public 
confidence he said 
gallant said the magazine had tried and failed to get computors on 
the discussion panels 
they dont in the public eye he said he 
declined to say who turned doinvitations

paccar inc officials said little tuesday about 
texas financier harold c simmons interest in their company but 
stock analysts said they doubted simmons was looking to take over 
the truck manufacturing company 
jack mcrae spokesman for paccar in suburban bellevue said 
we knew he was purchasing stock but declined to comment 
further about simmons stock acquisition 
simmons investor group valhi inc has bought a 53 percent 
interest in lockheed corp he also said in an interview with the 
wall street journal published tuesday that he has received or 
sought clearance from the federal trade commission to buy at least 
15 million in stock in paccar and a like amount in chrysler corp 
and phelps dodge corp 
simmons said monday he did not intend to take over lockheed he 
declined to tell the journal whether he would make an offer for the 
other companies but said his purchases all start out as 
investments 
paccar stock closed at 4875 per share tuesday up 125 
paccar makes kenworth peterbilt and foden trucks and owns 
truck financing and leasing companies grand auto and als auto 
supply stores oil pump manufacturer trico industries inc and 
wagner mining equipment co 
in 1988 paccar earned a record 1758 million on sales of 31 
billion earnings were up 56 percent over 1987 while sales rose 28 
percent 
paccar has a strong cash flow a high cash position and very 
little debt so certainly that would make it more attractive on the 
surface said analyst steven colbert at prudential bache 
securities in san francisco 
colbert noted that the founding pigott family still holds a 
strong position in the company which would make a hostile takeover 
difficult and that the company has never expressed any interest in 
going private 
les childress lyst with harper mclean amp co in seattle 
agreed that a hostile deal would be extremely diffult to do 
childress said paccar has an ar plan in place in 
addition paccar is a wellmanaged company that has tried to please 
its shareholders he said 
simmons likes to invest in very fundattractive 
companies and his sec filing concerning paccar seems to 
indicate this is for investment purposes childress said

atampt and its unions opened the years largest 
round of collective bargaining today talking optimistically of 
avoiding a third strike this decade but sparring immediately over 
the companys finances 
during these negotiations atampts financial future should not 
be an excuse for evading a reasonable economic package for our 
members jack barry president of the international brotherhood 
of electrical workers said at a brief meeting with reporters prior 
to the first day of contract talks 
the ibew is for the first time this year negotiating jointly 
with the communication workers of america whose president also 
said it was time atampt workers got a bigger share of the companys 
success 
it is our members who are the most skilled people in the world 
at their jobs who have made atampt the industry leader cwa 
president morton bahr said 
robert e allen board chairman of american telephone and 
telegraph was also on hand for the session the first time an atampt 
chiarman has attended the opening of the talks 
we are up against a group of competitors who are tough and 
getting tougher allen said and most of them are not union 
represented in this process that starts today one thing we can 
demonstrate is that a company that has a large representative 
group represented by unions can be sufficiently flexible and 
compete effectively in the marketplace 
that was a reference to job flexibility changes being sought by 
atampt which along with wages and health benefits are the major 
differences between the two sides heading into the negotiations for 
a threeyear contract to replace a pact that expires may 27 
i dont know when weve had more positive relationships going 
into bargaining said ray williams the companys chief 
representative at the table when formal talks on a new threeyear 
contract open today 
when the two unions bargained separately three years ago cwa 
leaders accused the electrical workers of undermining their 26day 
strike by signing a me too agreement that kept ibew members 
working in atampts factories 
with a promise to the electrical workers they would share 
whatever additional benefits the cwa won through the strike atampt 
was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants operating 
the unions also are looking for stronger job security guarantees 
after losing thousands of jobs to management and atampts shift of 
some of its manufacturing overseas after the 1984 of the breakup of 
the bell system 
but like the issue of who pays for escalating health care costs 
that demand appears to be on a collision course with what atampt says 
it needs in job flexibility to keep up with changing technology and 
greater competition 
the newfound unity between the ibew and cwa gives the unions 
improved leverage in the talks because now if you have a strike 
it will be a total shutdown says bahr 
through the aflcio the two unions have made arrangement to 
call an immediate nationwide labor boycott of atampt products and 
services if there is a strike bahr said 
williams atampts vice president for labor relations doubts the 
unions claim that joint bargaining gives them more strength at the 
table 
if i thought it was to their advantage i never would have 
agreed to it he said 
as for pay the last contract provided members of both unions an 
8 percent raise over three years williams wouldnt reveal what 
atampt will offer initially this time but said the company has no 
plans to demand concessions 
we nee to have some conservative settlements and let the 
market move toward us he said 
average annual wages at atampt range from 22360 for operators to 
34453 for skilled technicians according to union figures 
both sides agree health care likely will be the major sticking 
point 
the unions want some improvements in their current plan 
williams without being specific said the company needs some 
help from workers to stem rising costs atampt will spend 1 
billion this year on health benefits for active and retired 
workers he said 
if theres any single issue that can prevent a peaceful 
settlement its health care bahr said 
atampts request for job restructuring also is likely to run into 
fervent opposition from the unions the cwa and ibew together have 
lost more than 78000 union jobs in the four years since the atampt 
breakup while the company has added some 13000 positions in 
management and other nonunion areas

takeover specialist t boone pickens jr has taken a substantial 
stake today said it was surprised by the move which made pickens 
its largest shareholder 
pickens held 202 percent of the stock in koito manufacturing 
co as of march 31 the secondlargest stockholder toyota motor 
corp holds 191 percent 
a koito spokesman mikio tsuruta said the unusually large 
investment by an american in a japanese company took the 
manufacturer of automobile lighting systems by surprise 
koito has contacted its lawyers and its major shareholders 
including toyota and nissan motor co which owns 595 percent he 
said 
we havent done anything else yet because this has been a 
very sudden event for us tsuruta said 
we have no idea why he bought our shares he added 
asked if the japanese company is worried about the 202 percent 
purchase of its stock by a us company tsuruta said of 
course 
the company would not comment on speculation that the purchase 
by boone co a privately held merchant bank formed in 1986 and 
controlled by pickens could involve a greenmail attempt 
on tuesday boone cos vice president of finance sidney 
tassin would not comment about the firms intentions toward koito 
or its strategy involving the investment but said he doesnt regard 
the stake as hostile in intent 
we believe that the japaneseamerican involvement and 
relationship is of increasing importance and opportunity said 
tassin 
keith donaldson an analyst at james capel pacific ltd in 
tokyo said it looks like a case of greenmail to me if you want 
to do this sort of thing the best target is toyota because theyve 
got 2 trillion yen 15 billion in cash 
greenmail is a term used for a method of reaping profits by a 
hostile corporate suitor when his stock is purchased at a premium 
by another shareholder friendly to the company 
theres no way boone pickens is interested in a small car 
parts manufacturer said donaldson theres also no way he 
would be able to take the company over because toyota will come in 
and buy him out 
donaldson and other analysts in tokyo said they believe a 
japanese luxury car importer azabu motors is behind pickens 
acquisition of 324 million shares of koito 
the azabu group which reportedly has targeted other japanese 
companies for greenmail in the past bought 48 million shares of 
koito in 1988 a large block of those shares was registered under 
the name of t boone pickens 
some believe azabu is only using boones name to greenmail 
toyota others believe t boone is the actual owner said ben 
moyer an automobile analyst at merrill lynch in tokyo 
the koito purchase is the second major acquisition of stock in a 
toyota group company by a third party in the past two years in 
1987 nippon land successfully maneuvered toyota into buying back a 
large portion of shares in toyoda automatic loom moyer said 
pickens has launched takeover attempts of oil companies 
including unocal diamond shamrock and phillips but has never 
succeeded in purchasing a company as a result of a hostile bid 
he has however made huge profits on some deals after friendly 
investors or the target company itself purchased his shares 
boone co is not connected with pickens mesa limited partners 
oil and gas company

the predators ball began today 
with a reserved tip of the hat to absent michael milken founder of 
the junk bond market it celebrates 
milken top junk bond trader for drexel burnham lambert inc 
cant be at the annual event the company calls the institutional 
research conference which attracts a whos who of corporate 
takeover artists 
milken was charged last week with 98 counts of securities fraud 
and racketeering in connection with alleged trading violations and 
is officially on leave from his job as drexels junk bond guru 
milkens successor john h kissick opened the 3day 
conference with a reserved tribute to milken and a promise that his 
company would continue to forge ahead 
after more than two years the government has finally brought 
charges against michael milken and others kissick told a 
standingroomonly audience now that they have an opportunity to 
exercise their right to due process they have our honest wishes 
for success 
kissick sought to reassure investors that drexel would continue 
to battle for the preeminent spot in the highyield bond market 
despite the loss of the man credited with creating it 
drexel remains committed to maintaining the high quality of 
this market as we move ahead kissick said 
kissicks talk to the beverly hilton hotel conference was 
followed by a pep talk on education from jaime escalante the high 
school math teacher whose success with underprivileged students was 
the basis of the movie stand and deliver 
except for the opening sessions each day the conference is 
closed to the news media the schedule calls for presentations by 
companies seeking to issue junk bonds including rjr nabisco inc 
and amc entertainment inc and sessions on such topics as 
bankruptcy and the balance sheet 
despite his absence milkens image looms large over the meeting 
he was omnipresent said clark johnson chairman and chief 
executive of pier 1 imports inc of fort worth texas a 
participant you saw him around and of course he was running the 
show he was having meetings he was doing deals he was being his 
usual energetic indefatigable self

convention of american entrepreneurs who have built or bought 
companies with junk bonds johnson said

johnson said in a telephone interview before the meeting these 
have been the growth companies the companies that are doing 
things the companies that are rebuilding corporate america

as it is working to assure investors the firm can remain a prime 
mover in the highyield bond market without him 
the conference is the most heavily attended yet said drexel 
spokesman steve anreder who emphasized the varied schedule of 
sessions on subjects ranging from third world debt to employee 
stock plans to the savings and loan industry 
i think what that says is the highyield market has been 
validated and theres a lot of interest the spokesman said 
milken is credited with building the multibilliondollar market 
in junk bonds the highrisk highinterest bonds used by 
entrepreneurs and corporate takeover artists to raise cash 
in addition to popularizing use of the bonds dubbed junk 
because they receive lower than investmentgrade ratings from 
bondrating agencies milken was at the center of a newtork of 
traders who both sold bonds for their own projects and could be 
tapped to invest in junk bonds sold by others

when dale voss bought noel ice co two years ago the first 
thing he did was fire all the employees 
but the cubemaking didnt melt down for a minute those same 
employees were back at the freezers of the nashvillebased company 
the next day although another company was signing their paychecks 
noel joined the growing number of businesses leasing some or all 
their employees a strategy that can cut costs and eliminate 
management headaches ranging from payroll deductions to 
employersponsored health insurance 
every time i get a little piece of paper from the government 
about my employees i can just write em back and tell em noel ice 
co has no employees voss says 
employee leasing is now used to staff entire departments from 
daycare centers to mail rooms to production lines it has gained 
the most popularity among small and mediumsized businesses but 
even large corporations are finding it attractive 
at chase manhattan bank leased messengers deliver up to 1000 
documents a day insurance giant cigna corp leases its daycare 
facility 
the national planning association an economic consulting group 
in washington reckons the number of employees under lease is at 
least 165000 but some other estimates range as high as 500000 
joseph honick executive director of the national staff leasing 
association says the number of leasees is swelling by about 30 
percent a year and by the end of the next decade he projects 
leasedemployee population could exceed 3 million 
leasing frees companies from the monumental worries associated 
with employees calling in sick juggling vacation schedules 
providing costly benefits and making social security payments to 
the government 
it tightens the line between businesses and their customers 
honick said if youre in the business to sell shoes youre not 
in business to run a payroll operation 
in turn a generation of entrepreneurs who organize the legions 
of leasees has been spawned an estimated 400 companies exist 
solely to lease workers to other companies 
the trend started because companies have gotten very hurt in 
the process of downsizing and upsizing and downsizing and 
upsizing said edith weiner of the new york management consulting 
firm of weiner edrich brown inc 
companies want to keep their constant overhead lower and they 
dont really want to have the problem of laying people off she 
said sometimes it costs more to lease but it gives you more 
latitude 
until the tax reform act of 1986 employee leasing was 
considered a questionable practice partly because highincome 
professionals such as doctors and lawyers used it so they could set 
up taxdeferred pension plans for themselves while avoiding them 
for their workers once those loopholes were closed leasings 
credibility rose 
many employers praise the system it saves me time said van 
stewart president of auto rental systems inc a car leasing 
company with operations in nashville memphis dallas and st 
louis that leases its 37 employees 
i dont have to spend any time on payroll i dont have to 
file social security im writing two checks a month instead 
of 50 or 60 said stewart he even gets his own check from the 
leasing company 
besides handling payroll leasing companies can pool groups of 
employees for cheaper insurance noels voss said before he bought 
the company it had been spending 112 a month per employee to 
cover health benefits now hes paying a leasing concern 87 a 
month per employee for benefits he says are superior 
while a full benefits package can run as much as 60 percent of 
an employees base salary we can bring it in for about 30 to 35 
percent said edward katz founder of new yorkbased choice 
courier inc 
katzs messenger service has evolved into a leasing operation 
with 1500 employees in nine east coast cities hes projecting 30 
percent growth this year to about 40 million in annual revenues 
like many other leasing concerns katz uses plenty of parttime 
help and scales back benefits like vacation time to save more 
money hell hire fire train and maintain a workforce for other 
businesses 
the savings for a company is noncalculable said katz 
the people were dealing with are on the bottom two rungs of 
the employment ladder weve got the new wave of immigrants and 
we have to train them 
with expertise in the mailroom katz says he can find savings 
where companies forget to look for example his workers transmit 
documents by facsimile machine to the west coast after 6 pm when 
phone costs are cheaper they use lightweight envelopes to slash 
postage 
to ensure each job is always fully staffed katz has a dozen or 
so workers waiting to be dispatched from a bullpen when other 
employees call in sick 
its hard to find a critic of leasing although leased employees 
dont necessarily have highpaying jobs with generous benefits 
they often have better security if theyre on one job and the 
contract is canceled their leasing company can shift them to 
another worksite 
when a leasing company moves in to run an alreadyfunctioning 
operation those same employees stay on the job although honick 
rejects the characterization that theyre fired first then rehired 
they dont write resignation letters he said a leased 
employee is a regular employee 
some say larger corporations have been slow to embrace the 
concept because they often are bound by strict union agreements 
but honick says a deeper reason is there arent enough 
professional qualified employeeleasing companies to go around 
in the past leased employees have been relegated to running the 
company cafeteria or providing janitorial services but the realm 
of services leased workers provide continues to broaden 
cigna corp has contracted with the national childcare chain 
kindercare inc to provide a fully staffed daycare center housing 
80 children at its headquarters in bloomfield conn the cost to 
the company has been minimal since employees pay for most of the 
expense 
if we were operating it ourselves i dont know what it would 
cost but i imagine it would be more expensive said cignas 
director of employee services beth fox we have some operating 
costs involved in grounds and indoor maintenance but thats about 
it we dont need to get involved in any great way 
because cigna provided a building to kindercare the childcare 
company was able to offer its services at a discount an existing 
space cuts kindercares capital investment by roughly 25 percent 
said len kuhn senior vice president of development at the 
montgomery ala company 
kindercare also can provide services cheaper than cigna could 
partly because of economies of scale and kindercares 
welldeveloped daycare structure 
we have all the programs in place all the policies and 
procedures an understanding of staffing needs and because we have 
an established track record and managed our liability very well we 
have a significant difference in the cost of insurance kuhn 
said 
end adv for sunday april 9

the stock market was little changed today in an 
atmosphere of uncertainty about the economic outlook 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 660 on tuesday 
slipped another 55 to 229765 by noontime on wall street 
gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of new 
york stock exchangelisted issues with 626 up 568 down and 583 
unchanged 
analysts said it was difficult to discern how the market might 
respond when the labor department issues its monthly report friday 
on the employment situation 
private forecasts generally call for a smaller gain in nonfarm 
payroll employment than the 289000 increase reported for february 
when the unemployment rate fell to a 15year low 
not so long ago that kind of news might have been interpreted 
as a plus for stocks indicating a slackening of upward pressure on 
inflation and interest rates 
but lately many traders have begun to worry that the battle to 
restrain inflation might wind up producing a recession and an 
accompanying slump in corporate profits 
auto stocks fell following the news on tuesday of weak car sales 
in the latemarch selling period general motors dropped to 40 
ford motor 1 to 47 and chrysler to 24 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 
19 to 16614 at the american stock exchange the market value

buying northwest airlines for 262 billion 
would not require selling the carriers strategic assets to 
finance the takeover debt suitor marvin davis announced today 
the investor made the statement in a letter to the board of 
directors of nwa inc the parent of the nations fourth largest 
air carrier 
davis a billionaire whose holdings include real estate and 
entertainment properties last week offered to pay 90 for each of 
nwas 291 million shares in a deal he insists is friendly 
northwest chairman steven rothmeier has said the board of 
directors will review the offer but he has not said when the board 
will meet 
the airline also said it intends to remain independent and state 
officials have rallied behind the carrier introducing legislation 
intended to thwart a hostile takeover 
no divestitures of strategic assets are required to service 
the debt that would be incurred to effect the acquisition davis 
said in his letter which was dated tuesday and released to the 
media today with the equity we are prepared to commit and the 
anticipated structure of the balance of the financing the 
companys projected cash flow is adequate to service the debt 
involved 
davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he 
intends to expand the airlines domestic and international routes 
and keep the headquarters in minnesota where northwest is one of 
the states largest employers he also said his plans call for no 
employee layoffs workforce reductions or alterations in seniority 
schedules 
the letter said northwest management would be retained in the 
event of a takeover but the letter also said we intend to 
effect only those management changes required to improve nwas 
performance 
since we have no current airline operations there are no 
redundancies or overlaps that would require layoffs or similar 
employee reductions the letter said we wish to buy nwa to 
operate and expand it 
analysts have said takeover debt could impair northwests fleet 
modernization plans but davis said in his letter that the 
acquisition plan in no way calls for the reduction of the 
companys present capital investment program or 
maintenancerelated matters 
kevin whalen a northwest spokesman confirmed that the board of 
directors received the letter he said there would be no comment 
from the company until the board reviews davis offer 
the letter did not say that financing was in place for davis 
proposal 
in morning trading on the new york stock exchange nwa stock was 
selling for 8475 a share up 1 from tuesdays close

a former marketing executive for a 
defense contractor testified today that he knew bribes were being 
paid to a navy engineer in exchange for inside information about a 
lucrative contract 
but michael savaides told the jury he never informed his 
superiors at teledyne electronics in newbury park calif about 
the bribery scheme 
savaides who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery 
and is cooperating with federal investigators in the case worked 
in washington as the marketing manager for the firm that was 
seeking a 24 million contract for handheld radar equipment in 
1985 
at that time the california company had already lost one or two 
government contracts and had fears of losing another program 
he said thus there was some pressure to win the pentagon business 
testifying at the trial of three former executives of teledyne 
electronics savaides said that at the same time he was employed by 
the firm he had entered into a secret agreement with two private 
consultants william parkin and fred lackner both men have pleaded 
guilty in the case 
in november 1985 parkin reached a deal with teledyne 
electronics to be paid 10000 in exchange for trying to obtain the 
contract at the same time parkin said teledyne agreed that he 
would be paid 150000 if he was successful 
if he was not successful then there would be no fee paid 
savaides said 
when he learned of parkins arrangement with teledyne savaides 
said my reaction was pure amazement and shocki didnt 
believe teledyne would enter into an agreement like this 
savaides testified that after parkin reached the deal with 
teledyne he parkin lackner and berlin were to split the money 
equally savaides was given some of his portion 
savaides testimony came on the third day of the trial the 
first in the longrunning investigation of the defense procurement 
case 
on tuesday the prosecution played a tape of a telephone 
conversation in which lackner and parkin joked about what would 
happen if ordinary americans discovered their bribery scheme 
if the farmers in indiana knew what you sons of bitches were 
doing with their money they would come up there and kill you with 
their pitchforks lackner told parkin on the tape 
lackners comment recorded by one of four fbi bugs placed on 
parkins home and office telephones in 1987 and 1988 was on two 
hours of tapes played for jurors at the trial 
lackners remark drew hearty laughter from parkin 
the tapes included numerous conversations between lackner and 
parkin detailing their efforts to obtain confidential bid 
information that would help teledyne in its negotiations with the 
pentagon 
they also provided evidence of repeated requests for such 
information by eugene r sullivan one of the three teledyne 
executives on trial in us district court in this suburb of 
washington 
during a conversation june 19 1987 lackner furnished parkin 
with details sought by sullivan about how much the army navy and 
air force were prepared to spend to procure handheld radar testing 
devices 
the deal is just a tad over 42 million lackner reported 
always helpful to know when youre negotiating he said with a 
laugh 
after teledyne negotiated the contract parkin pressured company 
executive george h kaub another defendant to make good on 
teledynes promise to pay parkin a 150000 consulting fee 
during a conversation july 8 1987 parkin told kaub that he had 
helped eliminate teledynes competition so that the company would 
qualify as a solesource provider of the military equipment 
since its sole source you should have much more than enough 
to take care of our little pets parkin told kaub referring to 
his contacts in washington who helped get information 
kaub said he wasnt sure the contract was that lucrative but 
concluded by saying i understand 
complaining also to sullivan that the money had not been paid 
parkin threatened to use his influence to get the defense 
department to cancel its options to buy additional equipment 
the only thing we can do is cancel next year by making sure 
its not exercised he told sullivan 
parkin remarked that his friends whom he never identified were 
getting goosey about not getting paid 
they have finessed this thing an awfully long way he told 
sullivan 
the defense contends that sullivan kaub and dale schnittjer 
the third teledyne executive on trial did not know that parkin was 
engaged in illegal activity after he was retained by teledyne to 
help it get the contract 
but conversations played on the tapes suggested that sullivan 
and kaub understood that illegal influence was being exerted 
in one conversation with parkin sullivan praised his friends 
ability to get him information about the contract i thought id 
come to the magic swami and have him check it sullivan said

when the first mcdonalds restaurant opens in 
moscow the canadian executive who helped make it happen probably 
will be remembering the montreal olympics and a fateful bus ride 13 
years ago 
george a cohon a chicago native who is president of mcdonalds 
of canada recalled that the companys corporate buses were lent to 
soviet organizers of the 1980 moscow olympics touring montreal in 
1976 
cohon who still quotes mcdonalds founder ray kroc with respect 
and relish went along for fun and made a stop at a montreal 
mcdonalds part of the tour 
that night we started talking about the possibility of getting 
involved he said 
cohon said the plan to have mcdonalds at the 1980 moscow 
olympics fell through before the usled boycott in a way it 
was the best deal i never made but he kept thinking about 280 
million people hungry this has got to be a great market 
i just went back at it he said in an interview at company 
headquarters in toronto 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policies allowing joint 
ventures with foreigners has made the agreement possible 
mcdonalds of canada a subsidiary of the us fastfood giant 
mcdonalds corp holds a minority position in partnership with the 
moscow city councils food service administration 
cohon just back from his latest trip to moscow and planning 
another trip in may said the food distribution center for the 
operation is under construction after its ready late this year or 
in early 1990 the first two of 20 restaurants specified in the 
agreement will open near red square 
he said the additional restaurants will be opening slowly as 
the supply and distribution lines are established and the staff 
trained 
were not in a race with anybody he said the big mac has 
to taste the same in moscow as it does in new york or london 
the 51yearold executive came to canada in the late 1960s as a 
young lawyer representing a client who had wanted to open what 
would be the first mcdonalds franchise in eastern canada but the 
client decided canada was too cold so cohon grabbed the 
opportunity to open the franchise himself 
the first mcdonalds in canada opened in 1967 in british 
columbia the first in cohons territory opened a year later in 
london ontario 118 miles west of toronto he still remembers the 
date nov 11 
the eastern and western canadian operations were consolidated in 
1971 and cohon was named president 
the 500th mcdonalds in canada opened in 1986 and the 600th will 
open this summer a huge operation at torontos new skydome stadium 
where the american leagues blue jays will play 
cohon who became a canadian citizen in 1975 is an enthusiastic 
booster of the restaurants and the country that was the site of 
mcdonalds first expansion outside the united states 
when we started here i dont think we faced the competition 
mcdonalds had in the united states he said also canadians 
are very mobile they travel a lot so there was an awareness 
level of mcdonalds that was really helpful to us 
cohon said he decided to become a canadian citizen so he could 
vote he has become a fixture on the local and national charity 
circuits perhaps best known for his efforts in saving the toronto 
santa claus parade that dates back almost to the turn of the 
century 
cohon said he heard about the parades financial troubles and 
decided it was a childrens favorite i said its an 
institution you cant let it die he recalled 
he musters the same enthusiasm to talk about the new moscow 
mcdonalds operation where the distribution center will have a 
meat plant a potato plant a dairy and a bakery all under one 
roof 
i dont have horror stories he said in any new country 
where mcdonalds goes its hard it was hard in canada but i 
have no horror stories 
he predicted that the hardest part will be coping with the lines

chevron corp expects to begin 
production near point arguello later this year as part of a project 
designed to supply enough energy to fuel 29 million cars a day 
according to a company attorney 
chevron lawyer doug uchikura made the statement tuesday night 
when the santa barbara county board of supervisors voted that a 
group of companies led by chevron be allowed to start oil and 
natural gas operations the board voted 4 to 1 that the 2 billion 
project meets county safety requirements 
uchikura said the company still needs board approval for using 
tankers to move oil from point arguello to california refineries 
including chevrons huge facility at richmond he said that once 
approval for the tankers is received the company plans to start 
operations in july or august 
the other companies in the partnership include texaco inc 
phillips petroleum co pennzoil co sun co and union pacific 
corp 
the plan calls for three offshore drilling platforms and two 
27mile pipelines that transport crude oil and gas to separate 
purifying plants in gaviota 
chevron agreed to install an alarm system on the pipeline that 
would detect a hydrogen sulfide leak the county planning 
commission earlier rejected th plan saying the companies 
underestimated by 65 percent the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the 
fields natural gas 
chevron also agreed to lower pipeline pressure to reduce the 
spread of a potential leak in an area that was hit by a 3 million 
gallon oil spill by union oil co in 1969 
backers say that by the 1990s the fields production could hit 
93000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feet of gas a day more 
than the current output for the entire santa barbara channel

exxon today refloated its stillleaking 
oil tanker whose fugitive captain surrendered a few hours earlier 
to face charges of operating the vessel while drunk 
a judge in hauppauge ny set bail at 500000 for the 
captain 20 times as much as prosecutors had recommended saying 
we have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled 
probably since hiroshima 
with claims against exxon for damages escalating into the 
millions us navy oil skimmers were pressed into service and 
exxon accepted an offer of help from the soviet union 
salvage crews pumped compressed air into the 125 million ship 
to float it off bligh reef 25 miles from the port of valdez from 
there it began a 30mile journey under the control of six tugs to 
a remote cove off naked island for temporary repairs picking its 
way through scattered icebergs 
the ship was refloated before tide reached its peak wednesday 
it was not just a stroke of good luck said gary gorski 
exxons salvage coordinator it took a lot of hard work 
company officials turned to the far east in search of a dry dock 
willing to accept the crippled leviathan exxon valdez 
as the oil off alaska spread over 2600 square miles an area 
larger than the state of delaware the fired captain of the tanker 
turned himself in this morning to authorities in hauppauge ny 
joseph hazelwood who lives on new yorks long island appeared 
with his attorney 12 days after his ship ran aground and nearly a 
week after the national transportation safety board said tests 
showed he was under the influence of alcohol several hours after 
the accident 
he had been sought since sunday on a fugitive warrant for three 
misdemeanor charges that carry a penalty of up to 2 years in jail 
alaska authorities have said they will seek his extradition 
exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and 
now requires crews to be aboard ship where drinking is prohibited 
four hours before sailing 
oil as thick as mayonnaise has soiled 800 miles of beach 
thousands of animals are known dead including at least 30 sea 
otters 
dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them 
said fish and game spokesman jon lyman 
the dead otters included a yearold pup one of five that had 
been sent to san diegos sea world for treatment 
while the toll from the nations worst oil spill mounted its 
impact on the flow of alaskan crude was abating 
the alyeska pipeline service co said it would resume a normal 
daily flow of 21 million barrels of oil through the transalaska 
pipeline today the flow had been cut by 60 percent because of 
restrictions on tanker traffic in valdez harbor but those 
restrictions have eased 
in the longer turn though the spill could slow petroleum 
exploration in environmentally sensitive areas at least 
temporarily environmental protection administrator william reilly 
told congress 
on tuesday crews finished transferring about 42 million gallons 
of crude from the crippled tanker to other ships in preparation for 
the refloating the 125 million vessel one of exxons newest had 
been sitting on bligh reef in since running aground march 24 and 
spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude 
after that exxon said its first choice for dry dock is 
portland ore but officials there said they werent sure if 
theyd allow that even though the 12 million repair bill would 
provide about 200 jobs 
a lot of questions that need to be answered oregon gov 
neil goldschmidt said 
canadian authorities also asked exxon for assurances that towing 
the tanker to oregon wont damage the british columbia coast 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi said the company has 
had discussions with dry docks in south korea japan and singapore 
about accepting the vessel he said the ship wont trail any 
pollution while it is towed 
iarossi said exxon had not added up its costs so far 
millions multiple millions its going to be big numbers he 
said 
one hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages 
including 40 on tuesday alone the claims have come mostly from 
fishermen exxon has settled only two so far 
at least 14 lawsuits have been filed 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration estimated 
the leading edge of the spill was 100 miles southwest of the tanker 
off the kenai peninsula the spill has been pushed away from kenai 
fjords national park and the area south of seward by water flowing 
out of resurrection bay 
fisheries within the sound remained threatened and the slick 
appeared to be oozing slowly toward other alaskan ports 
exxon gave 1 million on monday to prince william sound 
aquaculture corp to buy boom to defend hatcheries said susan 
ogle a spokeswoman for the cordova spill response office 
exxon said it has asked the state department to notify moscow 
that it has accepted a soviet offer of an oil skimmer five of the 
us navys 18 heavyduty oil skimmers went into operation monday 
and exxon requested the remaining 13 
the company also said that placing an oilcatching boom around 
the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a 
giant explosion of gases from the oil although that was not the 
reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line 
the worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom 
the vessel we would have lost the vessel said iarossi 
officials have said boom wasnt placed around the vessel 
immediately because the equipment wasnt available in valdez

production cuts and the first substantial layoffs 
in the auto industry in several years are probable by late summer 
if new incentives offered by us automakers strike out with 
potential car buyers industry analysts said wednesday 
youve got the best team coming into the ninth inning said 
analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york weve got 
to get some hits in here if the weather turns bad and you get 
rained out you lose 
brady who has normally been bullish on the domestic auto 
industry and other analysts said ambitious production schedules 
face certain cutting in the second half of the year if sales dont 
recover from an uncharacteristic slump in march 
normally march and april are strong sales months in 
anticipation of that carmakers allowed their inventories to grow 
as they do at the beginning of every year 
but there are differences this year because of recent years of 
healthy sales the market has become increasingly saturated with 
new cars 
automakers and industry watchers expected sales last month to be 
lower than in march 1988 when the industry was beginning the 
secondlargest sales year in history 
cars and trucks assembled by the eight major usbased 
carmakers sold at a rate 116 percent lower in march than they did 
during the same month last year through the first three months of 
1989 sales were off 76 percent 
there is some concern that the auto industry which often serves 
as a leading indicator of the us economys health may be in for 
a rocky time in the early 1990s 
the wall street journal on wednesday quoted sources as saying 
analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc had drastically 
cut his earnings projections for general motors corp ford motor 
co and chrysler corp for 1990 healy declined to discuss the 
report 
if these incentives dont work i think everyone is going to 
mark down their forecasts said donald ratajczak director of the 
economic forecasting center at georgia state university in atlanta 
a lot are riding on these incentives 
each of the big three signaled their concern about sagging sales 
within the last week by offering incentive packages including 
financing as low as zero percent and increased cash rebates on many 
cars and trucks 
if these incentives dont move the sales rate up temporarily 
the companies will have to cut production said healy 
were getting into a better selling season brady said 
weve got excellent rates out there in terms of the incentive 
programs and very good selection 
however he added the third quarter is a question depending 
on how many we sell in april or may last year sales during 
those two months trended just above what proved to be the annual 
rate 
i think they might be able to lift the secondquarter selling 
rate healy said but even then i think youll have a fairly 
skinny third quarter as far as production is concerned 
during march some automakers briefly cut production in what 
they called inventory adjustments longerterm production cuts and 
more layoffs may be on the horizon healy and brady said 
those production cuts probably wont come until the third 
quarter of the year when factories usually shut down to retool for 
the new model year secondquarter production is pretty well locked 
in they said because automakers already have placed orders with 
their suppliers 
youve seen no pullback in the production schedules brady 
said so weve been coming to april with sales mediocre and 
confidence levels among the domestic manufacturers remaining fairly 
high 
the fact of the matter is that production will probably come 
down a little he said weve gotten to the point where we have 
to produce now

investors in mutual funds that held stock in 
certain small fastgrowing companies made a tidy profit in the 
first quarter but those involved in equally risky worldwide 
fixedincome funds fared poorly a survey of mutual fund 
performance said 
alger small capital and the kaufman fund were the biggest 
gainers among nearly 1700 funds surveyed during the three months 
ended march 31 with rates of return of 20 percent and 19 percent 
respectively according to a tally released thursday by lipper 
analytical services inc 
the strategy of both funds was to pick small companies that 
showed potential for rapid growth 
in terms of specific industries lipper said the top performing 
funds had significant positions in broadcast cellular and selected 
telephone issues leading the pack were health and biotechnology 
funds which gained 1104 percent on average and natural resource 
funds which gained 863 percent 
less successful were funds specializing in foreign bonds which 
lost on average 220 percent thanks mainly to weakness in many 
foreign currencies lipper said utilities funds had a 225 percent 
gain it said 
eight of the 10 biggest quarterly losers were funds in the world 
income category which are most sensitive to fluctuations in 
currencies and interest rates international cash swiss franc and 
t rowe price international bond headed the list with losses of 
898 percent and 608 percent respectively 
lippers tally assumes that investors reinvest all dividends and 
capital gains distributions that the funds pay out 
overall investors who put their money in stock funds fared 
better than those choosing bonds according to lipper 
the average general equity fund gained 657 percent compared 
with a 117 percent return for fixedincome funds 
as the average fixed income returns were below the interest 
rates earned on the portfolios we believe it is reasonable to 
assume that many fixed income funds had a modest loss in terms of 
principal only performance said a michael lipper the firms 
president

petroleum prices plunged wednesday as traders 
reacted to a range of negative news by unloading energy futures 
driving down the price of unleaded gasoline by more than 3 cents a 
gallon 
trading was brisk on the new york mercantile exchange during a 
selloff that wiped away most of the gains achieved in the previous 
session 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude settled 43 cents lower at 1999 a barrel the 
contract had gone up 47 cents a barrel on tuesday 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange the may 
contract for unleaded gasoline slid by 303 cents to 6643 cents a 
gallon the contract had risen by 161 cents and 088 cent on 
tuesday and monday respectively 
may wholesale home heating oil which rose 089 cent tuesday 
fell 201 cents to 5163 cents a gallon 
jerry samuels an energy broker at shearson lehman hutton inc 
said the selling came in response to reports stating that opec 
lately has exceeded its crude production quota and that traffic and 
output in alaska have returned to normal following the disruptions 
caused by one of the worlds worst oil spills 
it was a wild day several bearish elements sent the market 
down samuels said 
the price retreat occurred despite an industry report showing an 
uncommonly large drop in crude oil stocks during the latest week 
the american petroleum institute said for the week ended march 31 
domestic crude oil stocks fell 128 million barrels to 32458 
million 
crude inventories have been drawn down due to delays in 
shipments from alaskas oil fields while a cleanup operation takes 
place 
it was reported wednesday that flow through the alaskan pipeline 
returned to its normal daily level of 21 million barrels 
oil flow from the north slope had been cut by 60 percent because 
the spill restricted tanker traffic in valdez harbor but traffic 
has increased 
energy prices have rallied recently responding to the temporary 
supply squeeze in the aftermath of a massive oil spill by an exxon 
corp tanker at the valdez alaska port 
there was no confirmation of reports concerning the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries crude oil output levels

polaroid corp exposed its first conventional 
film to reporters wednesday billing it as a onesizefitsall 
product that would work for more than 90 percent of the pictures 
snapshooters take 
analysts said the film was fairly ordinary but could do well by 
exploiting consumer confusion over film speeds 
theyve come up with a very clever marketing approach to a 
metoo product said eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter 
reynolds inc 
polaroid said it hopes to get as much as 5 percent of the 
conventional film market which is about 7 billion worldwide at 
retail prices glazer predicted the share would fall slightly short 
of 5 percent but still benefit the instant photography kingpin 
the announcement was widely expected but polaroids stock price 
rose 25 cents a share anyway to 3762 
polaroid under pressure until recently from a 32 billion 
takeover bid by investor roy e disney is hoping to improve its 
financial results the company lost 23 million last year after 
special restructuring charges and expenses of 152 million 
instant photography which polaroid founder edwin h land 
created in the late 1940s has had little or no growth in recent 
years while conventional film sales have grown 5 to 10 percent a 
year 
polaroid is hoping its name recognition and nodecisions 
sales pitch will give it a piece of the business dominated by 
eastman kodak co and fuji photo film co ltd 
polaroid is stressing that onefilm which goes on sale thursday 
relieves consumers of having to choose between different film 
speeds such as 100 200 400 and 1000 
but competitors said onefilm is nothing special they said their 
own films have wide exposure latitudes allowing them to be used 
under many different circumstances and they said quality is bound 
to suffer if a film is used in the wrong situations 
its not unusual to have a wide exposure latitude on a film 
all fujis color negative print films have wide exposure 
latitude said paul hudak general manager of the photographic 
products division of fuji photo film usa inc 
fujis position was backed by steven rosenbaum publisher and 
editorial director of modern photography magazine i dont 
believe there would be any great technological difference in 
exposure latitude said rosenbaum who said he tried samples of 
onefilm about a month ago and liked it 
onefilm is not much of a gamble for polaroid rather than build 
huge new film factories it is buying the film from minnesota 
mining amp manufacturing co or 3m which is making it according to 
polaroid specifications 
name recognition counts for a lot too polaroid has about 11 
percent of the blank videocassette market making it one of the 
market leaders it buys them from other sources keeping profit 
margins slim 
land more visionary than businessman long opposed getting 
polaroid into conventional film wednesday the company said it was 
extending not abandoning the instantfilm business pioneered by 
land 
we are achieving the contemporary vision of polaroid as a 
complete resource for imaging products including instant 
electronic and now conventional media carl j yankowski the 
vice president of marketing said at a news conference 
i macallister booth polaroids chief executive announced the 
intention to sell conventional film last july a few days before roy 
disney nephew of the late walt disney announced his shamrock 
holdings inc was bidding for the company 
polaroid also created an employee stock ownership plan 
repurchased shares and sold shares to a sympathetic third party in 
an effort to fend off shamrock shamrock recently said it was 
selling back its nearly 5 million shares to the company

a massachusetts utility wednesday became 
the second bidder for public service co of new hampshire making 
an offer it says would be worth 235 billion if the seabrook 
nuclear power plant operates commercially 
new england electric system of westboro which already serves 
60000 new hampshire customers through its granite electric co 
offered 14 billion if seabrook never overcomes 
evacuationplanning and financial obstacles to a commercial license 
public service the lead seabrook owner with a 36 percent share 
of the 59 billion project sought protection under the bankruptcy 
laws 14 months ago because of the plants licensing delays 
public service is exploring a sale of its assets as one possible 
reorganization option whatever it decides to do will be subject to 
bankruptcy court approval 
in january connecticutbased northeast utilities new englands 
largest power company announced a bid it said would be worth 2 
billion if seabrook runs and 12 billion if it doesnt 
both proposals would spin off public services 36 percent 
seabrook share into a separate company from which the reorganized 
utility would buy power if the reactor operates 
at a news conference new england electric president john rowe 
said his companys bid would offer greater return for public 
service investors and lower rates for its 360000 customers than 
northeasts offer and public services own reorganization proposal 
rowe called his proposal a kinder gentler acquisition 
kinder to investors and gentler to customers 
like the northeast proposal new england electric would keep 
public service under new hampshire regulation public service has 
proposed seeking federal regulation to bypass a state law that bars 
it from charging ratepayers for seabrook before it operates 
commercially however the company also is negotiating with its 
creditors and the state on a rate plan that could leave the utility 
independent and stateregulated 
rowe would not provide specifics on which creditors would get 
what under his companys offer 
our interest is in making the largest pie for investors with 
the smallest amount of cooking ingredients from the customers 
rowe said how the pie is cut well let the investors decide 
however rowe speculated that public service debenture holders 
and stockholders likely would get most or all of the new seabrook 
company northeast has said unsecured creditors would get the 
seabrook share and stockholders would have to negotiate with them 
for a piece of it 
jim neidhart chairman of the public service unsecured creditors 
committee called the new england electric bid a substantial 
improvement over northeasts offer 
however neidhart said by telephone from new york were 
concerned about any deals that in effect orphans seabrook and 
gives debenture holders a return only if the plant operates 
richard tilton lawyer for public services preferred and common 
stockholders said the new offer has many problems but is a good 
starting point he said it demonstrates that northeasts bid was 
not serious 
while saying he is quite concerned about the seabrook 
spinoff proposal tilton said that nees attitude is more likely 
to lead to a consensual plan than the nu approach of trying to wipe 
out the shareholders 
but bob busch northeasts chief financial officer said in a 
telephone interview that based on a very preliminary analysis we 
feel quite comfortable with our bidding position with respect to 
neess offer 
he would not say whether his companys bid is worth more than 
new england electrics however 
its pretty difficult to determine how much real additional 
value is there versus what just looks good busch said of the new 
bid 
public service president john duffett said the new offer was 
another step toward recognizing proper value for psnh 
but duffett expected more offers would be made and said we 
have an obligation to give those proposals due consideration before 
we decide if the sale of the company is the best option for 
emerging from bankruptcy 
larry smukler senior assistant attorney general and the states 
lead negotiator in rate talks with public service said new england 
electric and northeast are qualified to take over the utility 
both of them are talking about rates that are higher than what 
the state has been talking about but if they make a deal and 
want to negotiate with us well negotiate with them smukler 
said

the stock of nwa inc rose sharply wednesday 
following an announcement by oil mogul marvin davis that his 262 
billion proposal to buy the parent of northwest airlines would not 
require selling the carriers strategic assets 
we do not intend to bust up the company and our planned 
financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the companys 
strategic assets davis said in a letter dated tuesday to nwas 
board of directors 
the los angelesbased billionaire who owns about 3 percent of 
nwas 291 million shares released the letter wednesday to the 
media a spokesman for the nations fourth largest air carrier 
confirmed receipt of the letter but said the company would not 
comment 
with the equity we are prepared to commit and the anticipated 
structure of the balance of the financing the companys projected 
cash flow is adequate to service the debt involved the letter 
said 
nwa stock rose 350 a share to an alltime high of 8725 on 
the new york stock exchange more than 25 million shares traded 
hands 
davis whose holdings include real estate and entertainment 
properties offered to pay 90 a share for nwa stock in a letter 
last week to company directors 
in his second letter davis said his group is prepared to 
increase the price of our offer in the context of a negotiated 
transaction 
northwest chairman steven rothmeier has said the board of 
directors will review the offer but he has not said when the board 
will meet 
the airline also said it intends to remain independent and state 
officials have rallied behind the carrier introducing legislation 
intended to thwart a hostile takeover 
in washington minnesota gov rudy perpich and rep james 
oberstar dminn met with northwest representatives and spoke 
later by telephone with davis and told reporters they still 
opposed the billionaires offer 
perpich a democrat and oberstar chairman of the house 
aviation subcommittee said they were still worried that davis 
would have to sell parts of the airline to finance the deal they 
said that might result in layoffs and in northwest moving its 
service hub from minneapolis airport 
i want to see his prospective balance sheet oberstar said 
said perpich how can you guarantee that what they say 
verbally theyll follow through on 
guy cook chairman of international association of machinists 
district lodge 143 said he remains suspicious of davis offer 
because davis has not provided specifics about how he would finance 
the takeover 
i believe he has a history of buying and selling companies 
said cook who heads the union representing twothirds of 
northwests 35000 employees he has ownership for a period of 
time and then he sells it off 
kurt rivard an analyst for minneapolisbased dain bosworth 
inc said the increase in the stock price wednesday suggests 
confidence on the part of investors that a higher bid is on its way 
it could come from davis it could come from northwest it 
could come from somewhere else rivard said 
before davis made his offer to northwest the company disclosed 
a separate group of investors was interested in buying nwa the 
identity of that group which owns 49 percent of the stock has 
not been disclosed 
davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he 
intends to expand the airlines domestic and international routes 
and keep the headquarters in minnesota he also said his plans call 
for no employee layoffs workforce reductions or alterations in 
seniority schedules 
the letter said northwest management would be retained in the 
event of a takeover but the letter also said we intend to 
effect only those management changes required to improve nwas 
performance 
since we have no current airline operations there are no 
redundancies or overlaps that would require layoffs or similar 
employee reductions the letter said we wish to buy nwa to 
operate and expand it 
analysts have said takeover debt could impair northwests fleet 
modernization plans because davis would have to sell assets and cut 
operating costs to service takeover debt but davis said in his 
letter that the acquisition plan in no way calls for the 
reduction of the companys present capital investment program or 
maintenancerelated matters 
in other developments contract talks continued wednesday 
between northwest and its 5000member pilots union 
northwest has discussed profitsharing and stock ownership plans 
with its unions for more than a year analysts have said an 
employee stock ownership plan could help the carrier defend itself 
against a takeover by putting more stock in friendly hands 
meanwhile state commerce commissioner michael hatch told the 
st paul pioneer press dispatch that he is investigating the 
possibility of stock manipulation in connection with takeover bids 
for northwest but hatch said the inquiry is not based on any 
specific allegations

dallas investor harold simmons revealed 
wednesday he cut his stake in lockheed corp a day after the maker 
of the stealth fighter plane buttressed its takeover defenses 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission simmons 
said he had sold 200000 shares of recently acquired lockheed 
stock cutting his holdings in the aerospace company from 53 
percent to 42 percent 
officials at lockheed headquarters in this los angeles suburb 
refused to comment on simmons announcement which came one day 
after the company created an employee stock ownership plan that 
would have deterred a hostile takeover 
in trading on the new york stock exchange lockheed fell 112 
a share to 4662 
analysts suggested simmons had considered a buyout bid but gave 
up because of the new esop would put 17 percent of lockheed stock 
in employees hands that would effectively block a takeover 
because in delaware where the company is incorporated a buyout 
must be approved by holders of 85 percent of the stock 
basically lockheed put him in a box said analyst harold 
rubel who follows the company for cyrus j lawrence in new york 
simmons was outandout attempting to put the company into play 
and management did the right thing 
in the filing simmons said he sold the shares in light of the 
performance of the shares in the market and current developments 
involving the company including the companys sale of shares to an 
employee stock ownership plan 
the investor who made the purchases through his valhi inc 
said in the filing he would still consider future investments in 
lockheed 
when he revealed his investment monday simmons said he didnt 
intend to try buying the whole company 
lockheed said in announcing the esop that it wasnt responding 
to a possible takeover bid by simmons the plan was intended to 
boost employee performance by building their stake in the company 
and was part of an overall restructuring by the new chairman and 
chief executive daniel tellep 
included in the restructuring was acceleration of previously 
announced plans to move the top secret skunk works aircraft 
plant and other manufacturing operations from buildings next to 
burbank airport to palmdale and rye valley calif and marietta 
ga the factories employ 7000 people 
the moves would free 225 acres of land at the airport for sale 
in 1991 rather than in 1992 or 1993 as previously planned 
lockheed also said it would sell its computer operations over a 
period of time the operations cadam inc in burbank calcomp in 
anaheim metier inc in houston and lockheed dataplan inc in los 
gatos employ 3900 
im assuming he wasnt too happy with what they did so he 
took his profit and took part of his money and left said john 
simon who follows lockheed for seidler amdec securities inc in 
los angeles 
in addition to the radarevading fighter plane lockheed makes 
the trident ii missile the c5a military transport plane and 
works on nasas space station among other government and private 
industry projects

coal miners in two states struck the 
pittston co wednesday after working 14 months without a contract 
the strike affects 1600 members of the united mine workers 
union in virginia and west virginia other pittston employees in 
kentucky remained on the job the union said 
theres a series of decisons being made about our miners in 
kentucky and a couple of different groups locals in virginia 
umw spokesman joe corcoran said the decision not to strike them 
right now could be shortlived 
jackie stump president of the umws virginia district in 
castlewood said he was not optimistic 
we hope that its settled early but we have been telling 
people they may be on strike for a year or two years whatever it 
takes stump said 
umw president richard trumka announced the strike wednesday 
morning in a news release from the unions washington 
headquarters trumka said the umw has gone the extra mile to 
avoid a strike and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with 
the company both before and since the expiration of our contract 
with pittston 
but pittstons response an endless stream of labor law 
violations and broken promises has been antagonistic from the 
start 
michael odom president of pittstons coal operations said in a 
statement it is unfortunate that the union has called a strike 
againt the company which will undoubtedly cause much disruption and 
hardship for our employees and the coalfield communities 
odom also said the company will begin hiring replacement workers 
where needed 
besides representing the strikers the umw represents 
approximately 4000 laid off pittston employees and 1500 pittston 
retirees 
the unions contract with pittston expired feb 1 1988 after 
the coal company refused to sign the national coal contract agreed 
to by most major producers 
pittston is the nations 15th largest coal producer and the 
second largest exporter of coal

his roots in the travel industry go deep but peter v ueberroth 
leader of a group that wants to buy eastern airlines made his 
reputation as the man who made the olympics and major league 
baseball profitable 
ueberroth 51 already had founded a hugely successful travel 
business by the time he rose to prominence as president of the los 
angeles olympic organizing committee the group responsible for 
staging what generally had been a moneylosing enterprise 
the 1984 los angeles olympics expected to lose money or at best 
break even made 230 million 
major league owners made him baseball commissioner in 1985 
following a season in which the 26 teams reported losing 40 
million on revenue of 625 million the industrys 11th consecutive 
losing year 
ueberroth cut the losses to 6 million in his first year and 
baseball made 12 million in 1986 according to financial reports 
obtained by the associated press in 1987 baseball made a record 
103 million and preliminary figures for 1988 show a 100 million 
profit on record revenue of 977 million 
he also acted aggressively in helping end umpires and players 
strikes and negotiating a 1 billion television package for 
baseball 
detractors say the golden image isnt totally warranted 
claiming ueberroth made the olympics profitable by using huge 
numbers of volunteers who worked for free 
they also point to deteriorating labor relations in baseball at 
the time of his departure which have raised the specter of a 
strike next year and the possibility of hundreds of millions of 
dollars in judgments against owners stemming from collusion in 
closing the freeagent market 
regardless business success was old hat for ueberroth even 
before the olympics and baseball which he officially left on april 
1 
he was vice president of trans international airlines for two 
years when in 1963 he founded a small travel agency in southern 
california eventually he built first travel corp into the 
secondlargest business of its kind in north america and sold it in 
1979 for 106 million earning 44 million personally 
during his baseball tenure ueberroth stayed active in other 
businesses he is a director of several major corporations and as 
a director of ef hutton inc helped engineer the investment 
firms sale to shearson lehman brothers inc 
his reputation as a man with a golden business touch has put him 
in demand for other highprofile jobs 
the national republican senatorial committee wanted him in 1986 
to run for office but he said he wasnt a politician shaking 
hands and kissing babies wasnt his style 
ueberroth also turned down recent offers for the chief executive 
officers posts at mgm pictures inc and rjr nabisco inc 
i didnt think id make enough of a difference he said 
friends say the challenge of turning around eastern which has 
been wracked by financial losses and labor unrest for years 
intrigues him 
but ueberroths highprofile financial wizardry contrasts 
somewhat with a lowprofile personal style that some might even 
call bland 
he works in shortsleeve shirts not suits at his 17thfloor 
office on park avenue he walks carefully not confidently speaks 
softly and has employees who call him peter not mr 
im shy but i think you can be shy and ruthless at the same 
time he once said

informal talks seeking a compromise accord on 
liberalizing world trade in four key areas were mired wednesday by 
continuing disagreements over agricultural subsidies trade 
officials said 
the talks held under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade gatt officially opened wednesday morning but 
were adjourned after one hour to allow more time for informal 
discussions to reach a compromise on agriculture intellectual 
property textiles and gatt escape clauses 
it is recognized that agreement on agriculture is fundamental to 
consensus being reached in geneva on the other three outstanding 
issues 
we will have a final agreement on all four or none said 
karl falkenberg a spokesman for the european economic community 
delegation 
in his opening speech at the morning plenary session gatt 
directorgeneral arthur dunkel said that agreement on an 
agricultural package was near 
but eight hours of informal talks ended in disagreement between 
the eec the united states and the socalled cairns freetrade 
group over shortterm measures to freeze agricultural production 
and subsidies 
differences between the eec and the united states on farm policy 
caused stalemate at gatts ministerial talks in montreal in 
december 
the problem appears to be the same as it was in montreal 
said rubens ricupero head of the brazilian delegation 
dunkel who heads the 96nation trade forum was expected to 
spend wednesday night drafting a new set of compromise proposals to 
present to gatts plenary session thursday morning officials said 
negotiators refused to speculate on the consequences of failure 
to reach agreement at the negotiations scheduled to end friday

the former head of the securities and exchange 
commission has moved into an office at drexel burnham lambert inc 
but hasnt yet formally accepted the chairmans job the troubled 
investment firm said wednesday 
john sr shad who ordered the governments huge securities 
fraud investigation of drexel in 1986 has been working out of an 
executive suite at the wall street firm for several weeks drexel 
spokesman steven anreder said 
drexel seeking to repair its image after agreeing to a record 
650 million settlement with the government for a range of criminal 
securities law violations offered shad the post in january 
the nations fifthlargest investment firm currently is 
negotiating with the sec to settle separate civil charges that 
include insider trading 
shad 65 resigned later in january as us ambassador to the 
netherlands where he served from june 1987 he ran the sec the 
federal agency that regulates the nations securities markerts 
from 1981 to 1987 
anreder said shad would not decide whether to accept the drexel 
chairmans job permanently until after the sec settlement is 
completed the deal has been expected for months but negotiations 
recently deadlocked 
anreder would not say whether shad was waiting for the sec talks 
to end to avoid a possible conflict of interest the spokesman also 
said he didnt know whether shad was getting paid 
he has indicated all along he would wait until the sec 
settlement is in place he set that as one of his requirements 
he said 
if shad accepts the job it would mark an ironic twist in the 
legal battle he ordered the massive government probe of drexel in 
late 1986 after drexel was implicated in widespread wrongdoing by 
former speculator ivan f boesky who is now serving a threeyear 
jail term 
in addition drexels chief executive officer frederick joseph 
was once hired by shad 20 years ago when shad ran the nowdefunct 
investment firm ef hutton amp co 
shad was out of the office and unavailable for comment a 
secretary answering his telephone said 
anreder would not specify shads activities in the office but 
said he was familiarizing himself with the firm people doing 
the things one does in that process 
he is not working for the firm anreder said hes been 
examining the firm getting to know it doing his own kind of 
analysis

the predators ball opened 
wednesday with what amounted to an empty spot at the head table 
junk bond guru michael milken was missing from the official 
agenda for the annual drexel burnham lambert conference he founded 
11 years ago and was even forbidden to attend a dinner after 
wednesdays festivities 
milken who was charged last week with 98 counts of securities 
fraud and racketeering in connection with alleged trading 
violations is on a forced leave of absence from drexel 
a drexel employee had him on the guest list for one of several 
unofficial dinners that accompany the meeting but canceled the 
invitation tuesday according to a source familiar with the 
situation who commented on condition of anonymity 
drexel officials feared milkens presence could threaten the 
companys 650 million plea bargain to federal felony securities 
fraud charges the source said part of that deal which has yet to 
be signed bar drexel officials from business contacts with the 
indicted trader 
drexel spokesman steven anreder asked to comment said only 
originally he was supposed to speak at some kind of a meeting and 
our lawyers advised against it because they thought it would be 
inappropriate 
milken was far from forgotten at the 3day series of meetings 
and bond sales pitches at the beverly hilton hotel drexel calls it 
the 11th annual institutional research conference the name favored 
by the media comes from corporate raiders who sell junk bonds to 
raise funds for their exploits 
drexel representatives said the record attendance of 3000 
proved milken wasnt really the main drawing card 
but his evangelistic speeches and dynamic presence are missed by 
many said ralph rosenberg chairman of longview capital corp of 
miami 
i think a lot of people turned out as a tribute to mike 
rosenberg said wednesday 
milkens successor as head of drexels beverly hillsbased 
highyield bond department john kissick paid homage to his 
indicted predecessor offering our honest wishes for success in 
defending himself but he emphasized the unspoken theme even 
without the dynamic trader drexel intends to remain a powerhouse 
in the junk bond market which to date totals 183 billion 
drexel remains committed to maintaining the high quality of 
this market as we move ahead kissick said in opening the

polaroid corp was looking through the wrong end 
of the viewfinder wednesday when it said it was the only 
photographic company on a list of the 25 most respected brand names 
in the world 
polaroids carl j yankowski cited a study on corporate names by 
landor associates to back his contention that favorable name 
recognition would help sales of its new onefilm conventional film 
but according to landor associates of san francisco there were 
a few problems with polaroids interpretation of its findings 
canon inc a photographic company was in the top 25 at no 
23 one notch behind polaroid 
eastman kodak co was not on the list only because it was not 
included in the european portion of the 3000person survey kodak 
finished ahead of polaroid in both the united states and japan 
esteem was only half of what landor counted in its rankings 
the other half was simple name recognition or what landor calls 
share of mind 
the mistakes appeared to be the result of oversimplification 
not deception polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips said the 
company simply wanted to make the point that it had a good image

rejected requests from united and american airlines to establish 
nonstop flights from chicago to tokyo officials said wednesday 
but the agency left the airlines the option to reapply for the 
routes and said in a statement that us officials would discuss 
the expansion of nonstop air service between the cities in trade 
talks with japan next month 
the talks in tokyo will discuss possible revisions of the 
united statesjapan air transport agreement of 1952 which with 
amendments dictates what air routes are open the transportation 
department said in an order issued tuesday 
we remain sensitive to the issues raised by the 
applications from the airlines and we are prepared to discuss 
them with japan during the next round of negotiations said the 
order issued in washington 
currently nonstop chicagototokyo flights are provided only 
by minneapolisbased northwest airlines and japan air lines said 
russell mack a spokesman for chicagobased united

between the two governments will be the chicagototokyo direct 
routes which is considered good news by the airline 
the may 15 talks will be absolutely critical to us 
competitiveness a united statement said they are a priceless 
opportunity for this administration to take concrete action on its 
stated pledge to help redress the us trade imbalance with japan 
air service between chicago and japan has not kept pace with 
the growth in the usjapan market mack said

alternative operator services for telephones 
in the nations airports hotels hospitals and other public places 
are benefiting consumers by forcing american telephone amp telegraph 
co to improve service congress was told wednesday 
harvey m berg a member of the board of directors of the 
operator service providers of america also said the advent of such 
companies has led to new services 
berg in testimony before the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee acknowledged problems 
in his industry where customers have complained of charges two to 
three times those of atampt and of call blocking that doesnt 
allow customers to use the longdistance carriers of their choice 
for credit card or operator assisted calls 
his group does not condone consumer abuses but rather has 
acted to correct them berg said since its formation in april 
1988 he said the rate of complaints to regulators has fallen 
and rates have receded substantially the marketplace is 
working 
the federal communications commission has received more than 
2000 complaints about aos services from customers who often 
dont know whom theyre dealing with or why they get high bills 
from cities theyve never visited 
and some legislators fear the situation will get worse because 
of a federal judges ruling that required all owners of hotels 
restaurants and other public places to decide by april 1 who should 
provide their longdistance pay phone service 
the companies that own and operate the phones pay commissions to 
the premise owners to use their services 
the fcc last month ordered restrictions on aos companies that 
included notices of who the aos provider is and how to find out 
rates a ban on call blocking and a requirement that the alternate 
operator connect the caller with the longdistance carrier of his 
choice 
however the fcc did not impose price restrictions on aos 
companies 
the house subcommittee heard testimony from a number of 
witnesses on a bill by rep jim cooper dtenn that would order 
the fcc to impose restrictions on aos companies including a 
guarantee that they charge just and reasonable rates 
the cooper bill says that if a customer uses the credit card of 
a longdistance carrier the charge from the aos company may not 
exceed the carriers rates 
berg opposed the legislation as did gerald hines of atampt who 
said the company favored the fccs approach 
consumer group representatives favored the bill and steve 
hewlett commissioner of the tennessee public service commission 
said price caps were needed 
dennis thomas a board member of the nations largest aos 
company international telecharge said legislation was not needed 
in light of the fcc order but if a bill were passed it should seek 
to address the inequalities of cost and business opportunity that 
today discriminate in favor of atampt and impair other competitors 
gerald brock chief of the fccs common carrier bureau also 
said many of the bills provisions were contained in the fcc order 
last month

a major wall street investment firm has submitted 
a recapitalization plan for mcorp that would reassemble the giant 
bank holding company but federal regulators who last week took 
over 20 of the companys 25 banks said wednesday the plan is not 
in front of us 
shearson lehman hutton inc which holds a sizable chunk of 
mcorps outstanding debt and has been leading a creditors group 
submitted the plan sunday vice president steve faigen said 
wednesday 
the plan which was drawn up prior to the government seizure of 
the insolvent mbanks would combine the failed banks with the five 
solvent institutions left under the bank holding companys control 
faigen said 
alan whitney spokesman for the federal deposit insurance corp 
in washington said shearsons recapitalization plan was viable 
only if the government had not seized the insolvent banks last 
week forming the governmentowned deposit insurance bridge bank 
so as far as were concerned we have no proposal in front of 
us from the shearson group whitney said in a telephone interview 
faigen declined to say if the proposal was an active bid for 
the remaining banks asked about whitneys statement faigen said 
i dont want to be drawn into characterizing their actions 
all i can say is that the creditors group submitted for fdic 
review a recapitalization plan based on mcorps situation prior to 
the actions taken by the regulators last week he said 
the shearson bid included another new york securities firm 
kleinwort benson ltd faigen said 
whitney said federal regulators were considering several offers 
for the bridge bank but he would not say how many 
i can simply say weve been contacted by several parties who 
have a legitimate interest in talking with us about some kind of 
transaction he said 
whitney said federal regulators have not discussed any 
transaction involving the remaining mbanks because theyre not in 
our hands we couldnt put those five banks into a deal at this 
point anyway because we dont own them 
the seizure last week came after three minor bondholders sought 
to force the giant holding company into involuntary bankruptcy 
because they had not been paid since last fall 
mcorp responded by filing for voluntary reorganization under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code which would protect it from 
creditors lawsuits until it could develop a plan to put its 
finances in order 
analysts have said it could take as much as 2 billion to 
recapitalize mcorp making it the third largest bank bailout in 
history faigen would not disclose the amount of the shearson bid 
shearson holds 117 million in mcorp preferred stock and holds 
mcorp debt with a face value of 30 million 
the fdic has been looking for a buyer for mcorp since last fall 
and originally had set an april 3 deadline for receiving bids 
groups who reportedly expressed interest in the banks prior to 
the government seizure included first city bancorporation of texas 
san franciscobased wells fargo amp co leverage buyout specialists 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and a group affiliated with chicagos 
wealthy pritzker family gkh partners 
mcorp once the secondlargest holding company in texas has 
been hard hit by realestate loan losses last year its banks lost 
903 million 
mcorp was formed when dallasbased mercantile texas corp and 
southwest bancshares inc of houston merged in 1984

the bush administration expanded its temporary 
ban on imported semiautomatic rifles wednesday to include virtually 
all foreignmade models expressing regret that sales of similar 
americanmade weapons could not be suspended by executive action 
the step criticized by a group of republican lawmakers who 
oppose gun control widened a threeweek old import ban to cover 24 
foreignmade models missed initially said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater called the action which took effect immediately a 
midcourse correction on the way to longerrange measures 
he said the new step should completely dry up the flow of 
foreignmade semiautomatic weapons while an administration review 
continues 
the original suspension of imports declared march 14 by the 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who oversees the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms covered 80 percent of the imports 
wednesdays action was designed to get at the remaining 20 percent 
fitzwater said 
we think weve got 999 percent of the foreignmade 
semiautomatic rifles said atf director stephen higgins 
higgins said the bureau would try to identify additional models 
that are slight variations of the banned guns to make sure they too 
are covered by the 90day prohibition but higgins said he expected 
only a small addition to the list 
a prime reason for the expansion fitzwater said was to fill 
holes in the original order that had allowed foreign gun 
manufacturers not covered by the ban to gain a competitive 
advantage 
still fitzwater conceded there is some unfairness in the 
fact that the expanded ban still has no impact on sales of 
americanmade highpowered rapidfire rifles 
unfortunately it is not something we can do anything about 
fitzwater said to do anything about domestically manufactured 
weapons would require a change in the law fitzwater said 
colt industries inc suspended sales march 15 of its popular 
ar15 rifle the domestically made weapon most similar to the 
foreignmade assaultstyle rifles banned the previous day 
fitzwater declined to say whether seeking such a law change 
would be part of president bushs eventual decision 
even so wednesdays action represented yet another step in the 
administrations toughening attitude on such weapons bush 
initially said he opposed any efforts to outlaw the guns 
calls for a ban on the weapons had been prompted by scores of 
drugrelated shootings and the jan 17 slaying of five 
schoolchildren and wounding of 30 others in stockton calif when 
gunman patrick purdy opened fire on a playground 
according to an atf study of the guns it traces for law 
enforcement agencies nationwide the number of semiautomatic 
weapons used in crimes increased 57 percent between 1986 and 1987 
with respect to some of the weapons they are turning up in 
percentages which are far disproportionate to the numbers that are 
in this country higgins said 
higgins revealed that bush had asked him to study a proposal to 
require registration of semiautomatic assault rifles buyers of 
machine guns and other militarystyle weapons currently must pay a 
registration fee and submit to a background check and 
fingerprinting 
cbs news reported wednesday night that national drug control 
director william j bennett whom bush had asked to recommend what 
should be done about the weapons told bush a week ago that 
rambolooking rifles with a large clip should be treated the 
same as the machine guns 
however larry cirignano a bennett spokesman said we never 
talk about what we recommend to the president but added that the 
network report was not an accurate depiction of bennetts views 
a group of republican lawmakers who oppose gun control protested 
the action during a meeting with white house chief of staff john 
sununu 
most of us felt the action today solves no problems said 
rep larry craig ridaho administratively its a nightmare 
practically it solves nothing 
craig said that the action was a confirmation of the fact that 
he bush is parting company with gun control opponents 
the initial ban covered five general categories of weapons and 
25 specific models including the wellknown semiautomatic versions 
of the ak47 assault rifle and the uzi carbine 
among the weapons added to the ban wednesday were the beretta 
ar70 and bm59 the australian automatic arms sar 
higgins said foreign models account for 20 to 25 percent of the 
semiautomatic rifles sold in this country atf estimates there are 
3 million semiautomatic rifles in circulation 
the temporary ban announced last month covered permits to import 
up to 400000 assaultstyle rifles and the latest announcement 
involved up to 250000 weapons higgins said 
fitzwater said that treasury was imposing a ban on the 
additional 24 weapons to review their suitability for sporting 
purposes 
under the gun control act of 1968 the treasury department may 
ban firearms imports that are not particularly suitable for or 
readily adaptable to sporting purposes 
meanwhile stockton mayor barbara foss pleaded with lawmakers 
wednesday to get militarystyle assault weapons off americas 
streets 
we are asking for the same protection for our children and our 
communities that you have here the mayor told the house 
judiciary crime subcommittee which is considering new restrictions 
on assault weapons 
she pointed to security screening procedures designed to detect 
hidden weapons carried by visitors to the capitol and nearby 
buildings 
the mayor told of her horror at pulling up in front of the 
cleveland school on the day of the incident and seeing the front 
lawn of this normally quiet neighborhood school strewn with 
bodies 
repercussions of the shooting are still shaking the community 
she said 
i think of the mother who holds her hand over her heart to 
ease the pain she said i think of the little boy whose sister 
was killed and who implores her to return whenever the news is 
replayed and he sees her on television every unknown person on 
the playgrounds is now a threat a car backfiring sends students 
under their desks 
rep william j hughes dnj the subcommittee chairman said 
the lawmakers will have a tough job in striking a balance between 
imposing new safeguards and maintaining the rights of legitimate 
firearms owners 
america has a love affair with cars and guns and anytime we 
deal with guns we generally generate more heat than light hughes 
said 
fitzwater said we want to keep our options open on what 
next step the administration should take 
there has been an educational process here in which all of us 
have learned more about these weapons how they are being used and 
their danger fitzwater said there has indeed been an 
education and a heightened awareness of this issue 
fitzwater said that the 90day review of the entire subject 
ordered by bush on march 14 is moving along quickly 
other firearms listed by the treasury department as added to the 
ban by wednesdays action include algimec agm1 ar180 cis 
sr88 hk91 hk93 hk94 ak22 ap74 galil22 g3sa k1

a consultant who had bribed a navy 
engineer for information on a big pentagon contract hounded 
executives of a defense firm for money once the company was awarded 
the job according to tape recordings played in federal court 
wednesday 
private consultant william parkin also testified in person for 
the prosecution against three former executives of teledyne 
electronics of newbury park calif eugene sullivan george kaub 
and dale schnittjer in the trial in us district court 
he said that he himself accepted about 50000 in bribes in a 
10year period during the 17 years he worked for the navy before 
1983 
parkin the former director of acquisition for the navys joint 
missile project has pleaded guilty to bribing a government 
official and to other charges in the governments investigation of 
pentagon fraud and kickbacks in the 150billionayear purchasing 
system 
he is cooperating with the government in the current trial of 
the three former executives who are accused of bribery conspiracy 
and making false statements 
the government rested its case at the end of the day opening 
the way for the defense to begin calling witnesses on thursday 
parkin has admitted that he indirectly paid stuart berlin a 
navy engineer who also has pleaded guilty for confidential data 
about a 24 million contract that teledyne electronics was awarded 
in july 1987 the contract called for making handheld radar 
equipment 
prosecutors say parkins arrangement with teledyne electronics 
called for him to be paid 10000 in november 1985 and 150000 
once the contract came through 
in the wiretapped telephone conversations parkin who worked 
with private consultant fred lackner who also has pleaded guilty 
in the case complained to the executives that he hadnt been paid 
his 150000 even though the firm got the contract 
in november 1987 parkin told schnittjer that his associates 
were upset they hadnt been paid 
they feel theyve done their job and they are entitled to 
their just reward parkin said 
schnittjer replied i can understandive been delinquent 
in a conversation with sullivan who was schnittjers 
predecessor parkin complained every day i get strung along 
sullivan told parkin i dont think theyre giving you credit 
for this he added as far as i know dale was working to take 
care of this 
again parkin reiterated his situation my guys keep calling 
me they want their money 
the government contends that the three defendants knew about a 
deal that parkin and lackner had to pay berlin for information the 
private consultants were working with michael savaides the former 
washington marketing manager for teledyne according to testimony 
savaides also has pleaded guilty to charges in the case 
teledyne electronics ultimately paid the first installment 
6250 of the 150000 to parkin in march 1988 payments ceased 
shortly afterward when the federal probe known as operation ill 
wind was made public in june 
defense attorneys say their clients were in the dark about the 
illegal activities 
under crossexamination parkin said that over 10 years he 
collected about 50000 in that period in bribes he did not 
elaborate on the nature of the bribes or what he did for them 
in a softspoken voice parkin recounted persuading teledyne 
electronics executives they needed his services to win the 24 
million contract 
parkin acknowledged that the company stood a very good chance 
of winning the contract even without his help he also said it 
wasnt going to be a lot of work that he planned to do on it 
detailing his work as a private consultant parkin said he often 
bluffed in his conversations with people i embellished both 
ways he said
