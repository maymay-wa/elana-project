one of the latest crazes for thrill seekers 
bungee jumping has reached australia to find out what the fuss is 
about an associated press reporter took the plunge 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they wait their turns in a special 
area 
some sit quietly alone a few stretch muscles or pace nervously 
on the patch of artificial grass others chat boisterously with 
friends who came to watch have jumped already or plan to go later 
all steal glances at the oversize rubber bands to which they 
will entrust their lives will they prove thick enough when 
suddenly there is nothing below the feet but shallow water and 
your body plunges toward it 
this is bungee jumping the sport of pumping adrenalin pounding 
heart and an unlikely blend of cold fear and wild exhilaration 
cameras click and whir second thoughts skitter across a few 
faces when two candidates decide after looking down from a steel 
cage suspended 140 feet in the air by a crane that bungee jumping 
is not a good idea after all they forfeit their 69 55 us 
black clouds roll in a rainstorm suspends operations as gusty 
winds buffet the cage making it sway nerves tense and minutes 
drag by then the skies begin to clear and below the yacht 
pennants droop 
jumpers are weighed to determine which of several cords will be 
used to stop the fall 6 to 8 feet above water 
ankles are strapped snugly into heavy fabricandvelcro 
bracelets that are attached to each other with a loop for the long 
cord the other end is hooked to the bottom of the cage 
what bravado there was seems to continue until the jumper is put 
into the cage with two crew members secured with a seat belt and 
the crane begins lifting it 
on the way up the jumper is coached in what to do on the way 
down how to overcome fear and get the most from the jump the 
spiel also seems designed to give the mind a focus and keep terror 
away 
if you look down and start to get scared look at the 
horizon one crew member suggests put your toes on the edge of 
the cage then on our signal jump 
sounds simple but a glance at the water below dries the mouth 
and churns the stomach the height looks great enough from the 
ground but the concept of 140 feet changes drastically with the 
new perspective 
in parachuting the ground is so far down as to seem unreal 
here its easy to pick out details the people look like ants the 
yachts moored nearby are unfriendly shoals 
a crewman unstraps the seat belt and opens the gate the cage 
moves in the breeze before theres too much time to think and 
freeze theres a count of three two one 
bungeeeeeeee 
suddenly there is nothing below but shallow water and the body 
hurtles downward the adrenalin that had started the heart pounding 
now pours in 
the queasy stomach seems to be left up there somewhere and the 
weightless sense of free fall sets in just before the cord 
stretches stretches and then ends the dive 
it contracts again then relaxes contracts like a rubber band 
and the jumper gets a feel for manipulating the bounces like a 
yoyo or someone on a reverse trampoline 
by the time the cage and the jumper are lowered to the ground 
the initial fear has been replaced by disappointment that it is 
over a crew member grabs dangling hands and leads the body to a 
soft landing on a padded platform 
some of the spectators applaud as the anklets are removed the 
jumper stands a bit unsteadily and turns his attention to sorting 
out the sequence and feelings of the last few moments 
another jumper is strapped into the cage 
the roots of bungee are in pentecost island part of the vanuatu 
chain in the south pacific every may when the yams are ready to 
be harvested young males go through a manhood ritual by jumping 
from a homemade tower with vines attached to their ankles 
the lowest platform is 30 feet and the highest more than 120 as 
men gain stature in the village they move up to higher platforms 
inauguration of the hightech version is credited to the 
dangerous sports club of oxford university in britain members 
dressed in tuxedos among them graham chapman of monty python made 
several jumps from bridges about a decade ago including san 
franciscos golden gate 
in 1987 new zealander aj hackett made headlines when he and a 
friend hid on the eiffel tower overnight and plunged through the 
open center from the second level a height of about 360 feet 
hackett brought bungee jumping back to new zealand and 
commercialized it thousands of people take the plunge there each 
year and in january at auckland the commonwealth games featured a 
demonstration 
a few of the comparatively rich and famous have given it a try 
including boxer jeff harding rugby star wally lewis and singer 
deborah harry who went topless 
john fahey industrial relations minister of new south wales 
state delayed the sydney operation for three months because of 
health concerns then gave the goahead to what he called 
gluesniffing for yuppies 
but on sept 12 former miss australia natalie mccurry and a 
companion were injured when one of the cords attached to their feet 
broke free as the couple made a joint 130foot jump leaving them 
dangling with their heads just above water 
in response fahey banned the sport in his state until a report 
was completed on the accident which left ms mccurry with a broken 
collerbone she and andy gulby a staff member of the bungee bats 
thrillseeking group also were treated for neck and back injuries 
one fatality and a serious injury have been recorded in new 
zealand france where there were three deaths in 1989 recently 
introduced regulations

chile peppers burn your fingers and can make you cry and sweat 
but still people come back for more cooks and diners over much of 
the planet are devoted to them 
the whole chile pepper book published this week is for 
those who take chiles seriously if youre among the unschooled 
thinking hot is some chiles and hotter is just some more you have 
a lot to learn 
and these historians of heat these cherishers of chiles may 
convert you 
there are of course people who treat the fiery pods as a test 
of their bravery and authors dave dewitt and nancy gerlach tell 
chileeating contest tales such as john espinosas 1988 chowdown 
of 29 jalapenos in two minutes flat 
in 1956 newsweek reported contestants in lousiana were 
required to eat progressively hotter peppers and were penalized if 
they winced shuddered or flinched according to dewitt and 
gerlach 
but the authors frown on considering chiles merely a mild 
danger 
you ought to encourage people to appreciate the finer 
qualities of chile peppers than only the burning sensation said 
dewitt who with gerlach a dietitian has written two previous 
cookbooks and edits the whole chile pepper magazine in albuquerque 
nm 
theyre healthy theyre addictive the more you eat of the 
spicier foods the less you want to go back to meat and mashed 
potatoes said jane butel a chef and author who owns pecos 
valley spice co in new york city a little bit can change the 
entire complexion of food 
when a diner requested some hot sauce at the fourth street grill 
in berkeley calif recently chef kurt koessel sent out crushed 
red chiles a bottled sauce from the yucatan peninsula and three 
sauces from belize 
we want to make food that wakes up your mouth food that isnt 
just incidental on the table he said we want it to interrupt 
the conversation 
to that end his menu included pineapple habanero chile salsa 
with mint and coriander poblano chiles stuffed with smoked 
chicken apples and jicama and even a cascabel chile creme brulee 
you taste the sweetness first that kind of coats your tongue 
and when that fades away the heat comes on at the end koessel 
said 
chiles have at various times in various places been used as 
currency considered an aphrodisiac and been prized as a key to 
eternal youth the authors note their use for more than three dozen 
ailments 
sometimes they say the peppers are cited as the cure and the 
cause mexicans commonly treat stomachaches by chewing and 
swallowing a serrano chile while americans often complain that 
chiles give them stomach trouble 
nutritionally theyre a bargain chiles contain few calories 
three and a half ounces of fresh chiles contain more than twice the 
recommended dietary allowance for vitamin c 
and then theres the firepower 
the heat source capsaicin has no flavor color or odor it is 
measured by highpressure liquid chromatography in scoville units 
named for a pharmacologist who came up with an early measure of 
heat 
habaneros also called scots bonnet or scotch bonnet are the 
hottest chile known measuring 200000 to 300000 scoville units 
the authors say they quote a dominican priest francisco ximenez 
as saying in 1722 that a single habanero pod would make a bull 
unable to eat 
the authors quote a 1980 science news report noting that a 
single drop of capsaicin diluted in 100000 parts of water will 
produce a persistent burning on the tongue diluted in 1 million 
parts it produces a perceptible warmth 
we are not preaching that people submerge the flavors of food 
in so much heat that they break out in a sweat and start gagging 
dewitt said it does take some getting used to 
novices might avoid for example recipes in the whole chile 
pepper book for pepperpeanut beef kabobs from nigeria which 
rate an eight on a heat scale from one to 10 the berbere paste 
from ethiopia rated at nine or the sri lankan black curry an 
eight 
most of the 180 recipes in the whole chile pepper book 
little brown and co 1695 paperback measure four to six and 
thats the range dewitt said he generally enjoys 
but the point is to eat chiles he said daily 
the only requirement of the whole chile pepper diet is 
chiles in at least one meal a day 365 days a year 
i eat chile pepper in some form every day sometimes just a 
salsa on eggs today i had a simple hamburger with sliced 
jalapenos on it yesterday i had some enchiladas dewitt said 
i have to have them every day koessel said adding that he 
finds chiles erotic and curative as well as delicious 
sometimes you get into a macho thing with them he said 
on sunday mornings at the restaurant if weve had a long night 
on saturday maybe had a little bit to drink we have oysters with 
habanero sauce you wake right up 
the authors say the earliest evidence of chiles in the human 
diet is from mexico traced to 7500 bc 
chiles which are not related to black pepper are native to 
south america and inititally were spread by birds carrying seeds 
the authors say then columbus brought seeds to europe and from 
there chiles were spread by exploring and trading powers they say 
chiles now play featured roles in the foods of india china 
thailand much of africa and of course the americas even in 
japan where classic foods are not hot the fastestgrowing 
fastfood chain of the last decade sold mexican food the authors 
say 
they estimate threequarters of the worlds population eats 
chiles regularly 
the united states was one of the last countries to catch on to 
chiles but when they fired up american palates the palates stayed 
hot 
dewitt said he recently completed a study estimating the market 
at 2 billion to 3 billion wholesale for everything from fresh 
chile pods to commercial salsas and tshirts with chiles on them 
the most popular chile dish in this country is texas chili con 
carne cookoffs have been held since the 1950s and the authors 
estimate 700000 people attend annually 
perhaps one of the least popular uses was by employees of the 
new york city subway system who several years ago sprinkled token 
slots with chile powder to prevent vandals from sucking tokens out 
of the turnstiles a transit authority spokesman said recently 
however that was not policy we did not have boxes of chile 
powder in our supply houses

the writer trekked into a remote valley of the 
golden triangle drug region to meet the man us officials describe 
as one of the worlds main narcotics traffickers 
equals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they say i have horns and fangs opium 
warlord khun sa declared with a laugh curling fingers at his 
temples to illustrate actually i am a king without a crown 
they are american narcotics officials who indeed describe 
khun sa in devilish terms like the prince of darkness they say 
he is one of the worlds main drug traffickers exporting death 
from opium poppy fields and jungle laboratories that refine the 
sticky extract into heroin 
his kingdom is a large slice of the golden triangle the 
triborder area of burma laos and thailand where khun sa has been 
an often dominant and ruthless figure for three decades 
the 56yearold survivor of battles imprisonment and 
doublecrossing deals boasts that he controls 80 percent of the 
drugs in burmas shan state khun sa also claims his ultimate aim 
is to eradicate narcotics which flow by the ton to what he 
describes as the drugcrazed west 
american officials citing evidence of his involvement in 
largescale heroin shipments to the united states indicted khun sa 
in march and threatened to go after him if he can be located 
going after khun sa would appear difficult but his location is 
no more secret than was that of gen manuel noriega the panamanian 
strongman and alleged drug trafficker ousted and captured by us 
military forces 
khun sas headquarters is in a long idyllic valley about nine 
miles inside burma astride a road leading from the thai frontier 
the few reporters invited to visit receive a friendly reception 
after a grueling 11hour mule ride 
ho mong is neither the stereotype of a smugglers lair nor a 
plush hideaway like those of latin american cocaine lords it 
includes an orderly village of several thousand people schools an 
87bed hospital a large buddhist temple and tiger camp where khun 
sas muang tai army is trained 
the world sees me in a different way he said in an 
interview khun sa wants the world to view him as a rebel general 
fighting the burmese government to liberate the shan one of many 
ethnic minority groups suffering under an autocratic regime 
with a motley group of shan and chinese khun sa has built a 
nonmilitary organization they claim has won the loyalties of 
several million people in shan state it includes a constitution 
modeled on that of the united states and several political organs 
the most powerful led by khun sas uncle khun seng 
he clearly commands the loyalty of many shans in burma and 
across the border in thailand but has a poor record of fighting 
the burmese government which he described as the great enemy 
in fact he has been on its side in the past and is shunned 
today by the karen kachin karenni and other rebel ethnic groups 
khun sa acknowledges taxing opium that moves through his 
territory but denies refining it or trafficking in heroin western 
and thai narcotics sources say his empire includes laboratories 
along the thaiburmese border and inside laos 
the opium warlord argues that for 17 years he has proposed 
that the west buy the opium harvests he gathers and cooperate with 
him to eradicate the drug problem at its roots there have been no 
takers 
we have the opium we have the heroin said seng joseph one 
of khun sas aides were the only ones who can stop the flow 
the dea cannot stop it in a hundred years he said of the 
us drug enforcement administration 
several us officials have visited khun sa over the years and 
he recently sent a videotape to president george bush 
it urges bush to accept what khun sa presents as a sixyear plan 
to eradicate narcotics and turn the povertystricken golden 
triangle into a world garden of allweather roads tourist 
hotels international airport and prosperous peasants who no longer 
must grow opium for survival 
it was midmorning at tiger camp lingering mists swept the 
surrounding hills as khun sa inspected recruits on the training 
field he was dressed neatly in light blue trousers and a striped 
white shirt 
when asked if he was wealthy khun sa said his expenses were too 
high especially for the army 
shan state is like a lawless state he said the people 
who own more guns have the power 
he claims to have 20000 men under arms most of them teenagers 
from peasant families who apparently are happy to join up for the 
monthly pay of 150 baht the equivalent of 6 us estimates place 
his armed strength at just under 10000 
khun sa was in an expansive jocular mood shouldering a 
recoilless rifle for photographers and giving soldiers tips on 
firing a 60mm mortar 
beneath the swagger were signs of anxiety he admitted all was 
not well in his domain 
a day earlier reinforcements from tiger camp had marched out to 
face the wa in a monthslong conflict over an important smuggling 
corridor to the thai frontier 
wa tribesmen once fought the government under the burma 
communist partys banner but now are muscling in on khun sas 
territory with government help the new arrangement is typical of 
the triangles shifting alliances and bloody rivalries 
the wa are not khun sas only worry 
because of the us indictment there is pressure on the thais 
to cut links indispensable to him thailand is khun sas major 
source of supplies and weapons and aides say he has built a 
network of relationships with thai businessmen officials and 
military officers 
khun sa scoffs at americas showcase war on drugs directed 
by what he describes as incompetent dea agents but admits to 
having tightened security he travels in a pickup truck mounted 
with a machine gun accompanied by six bodyguards carrying 
battlefield weaponry 
if the americans put me into custody they will have to feed 
me he said whats the use the poppy cultivation will just go 
on and on 
analysts generally agree getting rid of khun sa would merely 
leave a temporary vacuum that other warlords would fight to fill 
they also agree with his assessment that the opium trade is 
flourishing the us government estimates burmas opium output 
doubled to 2600 tons from 1988 to 1989 
western officials say that mountain of narcotics is the core of 
khun sas organization not the shan nationalism he professes

syrian president hafez assads visit to 
tehran next week comes amid signals from several quarters that some 
of the western hostages held by proiranian shiite moslem militants 
in lebanon could be released soon 
diplomats in damascus the syrian capital said tuesday the 
plight of the hostages is one of the main topics assad will discuss 
with president hashemi rafsanjani and other iranian leaders 
in islamabad capital of pakistan iranian ambassador javad 
mansoori told a news conference tuesday that an unspecified number 
of the 13 westerners held in lebanon might be freed perhaps in 
the next few days pakistan a moslem state like iran has been 
used as an intermediary with iran by the united states 
mansoori gave no details but said that tehran has received 
promises from shiite zealots holding the captives that some 
will be released he did not name the groups 
most of the hostages six americans four britons two west 
germans and an italian are held by shiite factions linked to the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god it is tehrans main ally 
in lebanon 
syria the main power broker in lebanon and irans main arab 
ally has played a role in earlier hostage releases assads visit 
to tehran follows talks in damascus last week with secretary of 
state james baker iii during which they discussed the hostage 
issue 
assad long a maverick in the arab world has sided with the 
united states in the persian gulf crisis against his longtime arab 
rival iraq it is the first time syria has been aligned with 
washington in any middle east conflict and assad cast adrift from 
his longtime soviet mentor because of detente is eager to 
establish new links with the west 
hopes that some hostages will be freed have brightened since the 
persian gulf crisis set off by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the confrontation between iraq irans foe in their 198088 war 
and the united states has provided rafsanjani with unexpected 
benefits that have helped him consolidate power in the 
factionridden iranian hierarchy 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists has been 
seeking to rebuild bridges with the west despite opposition by 
antiwestern radicals he is believed to have had a hand in the 
release of american educators robert polhill and frank reed in 
april and in last months freeing of irishman brian keenan 
when the united states rushed to aid threatened saudi arabia 
iraqi president saddam hussein was forced to cave in to iranian 
conditions for a peace treaty to end the iraniraq war 
iraqi withdrew its troops from territory occupied in the 
conflict agreed to share sovereignty of the waterway forming the 
southern border between the two countries and began exchanging 
prisoners of war 
that boosted rafsanjanis prestige also in tehrans eyes it 
vindicated the iranian contention that iraq started the persian 
gulf conflict and that saddam would one day turn on wartime allies 
like kuwait 
the unimposed embargo on oil exports from iraq and occupied 
kuwait took 4 million barrels a day off the market and sent oil 
prices soaring iran has made billions of dollars more than it 
expected because of that 
informed shiites and other sources said that 15 iraqis and 
lebanese imprisoned in kuwait for 1983 bombings escaped before the 
iraqi army took control and were safe their release repeatedly 
refused by kuwaits desposed royal family has been a key demand of 
the kidnappers in lebanon 
the iranians have insisted that recent hostage releases were 
goodwill gestures that had to be reciprocated by the united 
states and its friends 
france recently released anis naccache a lebanese serving a 
life sentence for the attempted 1980 assassination of former 
iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar in paris 
syrias ambassador to iran ahmed alhassan was quoted by the 
englishlanguage tehran times daily newspaper on monday as saying 
further reciprocatory moves are needed by the west before any 
more hostages could be freed 
according to sources in various capitals those gestures may 
soon be forthcoming 
spurred by the persian gulf crisis the united states has been 
sending signals to tehran that it wants to improve relations one 
source said 
in amsterdam a western source at the iranus claims tribunal 
said the two countries are within days of settling irans request 
for payment of several hundred million dollars for military 
equipment ordered by iran before the 1979 islamic revolution 
delivery of the equipment was frozen by the united states that 
year 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said another 
iranian claim probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars was 
also close to settlement 
us sources have said the bush administration will not object 
to the payments to iran or to the world bank providing loans of 
several billion dollars to iran the world bank is scheduled to 
meet next week to consider iranian requests for loans to help 
rehabilitate areas devastated by a june earthquake

the pentagon is ending operations or trimming 
forces at 150 facilities overseas but the commander of us troops 
in europe says the cuts may not quickly translate into major cost 
savings 
yes there are some savings said gen bernard galvin but 
i doubt they are going to be anything close to what everyone is 
expecting 
the base closings and cutbacks most of which will occur in 
europe represent a reduction of up to 25 percent of the air 
fields barracks training grounds and other facilities of galvins 
command 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on military installations and facilities 
said defense secretary dick cheneys base closure list was a 
disappointment 
the defense department claims it will close 150 sites 
overseas but these sites include gas stations on the autobahn 
isolated housing units athletic fields and sites which had long 
ago been slated for closure she said 
facilities like these are closed every day at bases in the 
united states with no dod press release no news conference no 
hoopla she said 
galvin who also is natos top military commander said in an 
interview that the cutback will result in a reduction in costs for 
maintenance and military construction 
but he said closing costs including the cost of moving 
thousands of us troops back to the united states repairing 
environmental damage and destroying some weapons as spelled out in 
arms control agreements would reduce the impact of any savings 
savings he said likely will be reduced further when inflation 
and rapidly rising costs for needed modern military technology are 
considered 
pete williams the defense department spokesman told reporters 
ironically there are some costs associated with closing down 
sites but in the long run of course the goal is to end 
operations and save money 
the reductions will occur over the next few years at sites in 10 
countries that range from major bases to small installations 
the pentagon gave no official estimate of how much savings would 
be realized or how many troops would be pulled out of the 
facilities many of which us forces have occupied since the end 
of world war ii 
the west german defense ministry said plans call for the pullout 
by 1997 of about 60000 us soldiers from west germany the bulk 
of the reductions will occur by 1993 about 250000 american troops 
are stationed in the country 
but galvin and pentagon officials said decisions about troop 
withdrawal remain to be made 
bonn is winging it one pentagon official who asked not to 
be identified by name said about the statement from the west german 
defense ministry 
military operations will end at 94 sites in west germany 11 in 
spain nine in south korea three each in greece italy england 
and australia and one in japan williams said 
the united states also will reduce its forces at 14 sites in 
west germany three in south korea two in spain and at one site 
each in italy japan canada and bermuda 
while some of the sites involve small or minor facilities 
operations will end at three major bases torrejon air force base 
in spain and hessich oldendorf air base and lindsey air base in 
west germany 
williams said the reductions are partly a matter of budget 
necessity partly a matter of warming relations with the soviet 
union 
as the threat changes in eastern europe as the soviet forces 
pull back as east european governments change and become 
democratically elected clearly the nature of our deployments 
changes as well he said

environmental groups and cancer researchers 
today urged federal protection for a tree found mostly in the 
pacific northwest saying it provides a scarce chemical compound 
needed to treat ovarian cancer and possibly other cancers 
their petition asked interior secretary manuel lujan to list the 
pacific yew as a threatened species under the endangered species 
act 
environmentalists say the action could introduce a new element 
into a bitter fight over proposals to limit timber cutting in the 
oldgrowth pacific northwest forests to protect the northern 
spotted owl industry officials say saving the owl could destroy 
thousands of jobs in the region 
the debate over the future of the ancient forests involves 
much more than a choice between spotted owls and logging jobs 
said bruce manheim a lawyer and scientist for the environmental 
defense fund our ability to assure an adequate supply of this 
novel anticancer compound taxol is at stake as well 
the fund planned a news conference to announce the petition 
signed also by several other leading environmental organizations 
and by cancer researchers william p mcguire of the johns hopkins 
oncology center and susan b horwitz of the albert einstein college 
of medicine who conducted pioneering studies on taxol 
the american cancer society was sending a separate letter to 
lujan backing the proposal to designate the pacific yew a 
threatened species 
this action will ensure that women diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer in the years ahead will have access to a promising drug 
treatment said the societys letter signed by president robert 
schweitzer taxol while still under investigation through 
clinical trials is proving to be a very exciting compound for 
treating this type of cancer 
in the 1960s a wideranging plant screening program sponsored 
by the national cancer institute found the first indications that 
an extract of the pacific yews bark could be used against cancer 
the active chemical compound later was isolated and called taxol 
taxol acts by a mechanism different from other known 
anticancer drugs and has demonstrated confirmed activity against 
refractory ovarian cancer the petition to lujan says it may 
also help treat breast cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer head and 
neck carcinoma gastric carcinoma and malignant melanoma it says 
but taxol is in very short supply with researchers reporting 
current supplies sufficient to treat perhaps 200 to 300 patients 
alternate sources are not promising in the near future about 
20000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the 
united states and the cancer society said about 12000 were 
expected to die of the disease this year 
the petition said there appears to be a shortterm need for 
about 600000 large yew trees to develop taxol to treat ovarian 
cancer while only about 685000 yew trees greater than 10 inches 
in diameter remain on nonfederal lands in california oregon and 
washington 
the status of the species on us forest service lands is also 
precarious the petition said it identified major stands in the 
willamette and umpqua national forests in oregon and the nez perce 
national forest in idaho 
the pacific yew or taxus brevifolia is described as one of the 
slowest growing trees in the world appearing mostly as an 
understory tree in the ancient forests of the pacific northwest 
in addition the groups said in their petition the yews thin 
bark which is the source of its medicinal value also makes it 
unusually vulnerable in logging operations 
if the yew were listed as threatened federal agencies would be 
required to make sure any timber sales they approved did not 
endanger the tree 
the yews could however be cut to obtain bark needed to make 
taxol possibly in connection with logging of more commercially 
valuable trees in the same forests

the us ambassador to the 
organization of american states says the united states supports 
democracy in the region but would not intervene against a military 
coup 
the united states supports the democratic system prevailing in 
latin america but does not guarantee it luigi einaudi told a 
news conference on tuesday 
einaudi had spoken in favor of moves afoot to reduce the size of 
central americas armed forces and noted that would reduce the 
possibility for coups reporters asked him whether us policy was 
to stop coups 
the united states has committed itself to aid the democracies 
but it will not intervene if a coup occurs in any nation of latin 
america he said 
the united states would be limited to suspending relations 
with the country affected and also it could cut its economic 
aid he said 
he said he personally would work like a demon within the 
organization to isolate any government installed by coup 
the last central american coups overturned military regimes in 
guatemala in 1982 and 1983 but military ultimatums and coup rumors 
are a fact of life in most countries of the region 
einaudi spoke at the end of a sixday visit to nicaragua and 
honduras 
he said the united states supported moves to reduce militaries 
but added the security of each state should not be transferred to 
the us government because this type of security of 
sovereignty never can be in the hands of others

an envoy for un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar says the refugee relief effort in jordan is 
wellorganized but hundreds of thousands of asians remained 
stranded in iraq and kuwait 
on tuesday 33000 refugees remained in jordan down from a peak 
of 500000 the envoy prince sadruddin aga khan told a news 
conference 
on the whole the response has been really amazing said aga 
khan perez de cuellars envoy on matters related to humanitarian 
aid in the 6weekold persian gulf crisis 
aga khan said there was still no accurate way to assess how many 
more refugees could be expected to cross into jordan 
should there be hostilities god only knows what we will do 
with a lot of innocent human beings he said 
he said that if the hundreds of thousands of foreigners left in 
iraq and kuwait were allowed to leave relief officials would have 
to reassess how to handle the influx and how to transport them 
home 
the envoy said part of his mission was to determine how much it 
would cost to deal with a huge influx of new refugees and how that 
cost would be paid 
i dont think we can continue very long with piecemeal appeals 
to donor countries he said 
perez de cuellar is expected to make a coordinated appeal for 
more aid after he receives an assessment of the costs aga khan 
said 
iraqi troops overran kuwait on aug 2 and baghdad subsequently 
annexed the oilrich state about 2200 americans along with 
thousands of other westerners remain trapped in the two nations 
prevented from leaving 
hundreds of thousands of mostly arab and asian nationals have 
been allowed across iraqs borders into turkey and jordan filling 
refugee camps and straining already tight resources in both 
nations

the nations apple producers have boosted 
production in recent years but agriculture department researchers 
say imports will compete for the shoppers dollar this winter 
in 1989 the farm value of the apple harvest was more than 1 
billion making it third among fruit crops behind grapes and 
oranges 
apples are grown practically everywhere but the top three 
states washington new york and michigan account for 69 percent 
of the total says a report by the departments economic research 
service 
large plantings in the late 1970s and early 1980s have increased 
us production and probably will continue to do so over the next 
few years 
these ample supplies have come on the market at a time when 
other major producing nations such as chile new zealand and south 
africa have dramatically expanded their output the report said 
located in the southern hemisphere these countries can ship 
fresh apples when the united states is drawing on coldstorage 
supplies 
since consumers generally prefer fresh apples such exports 
enjoy an advantage in markets where they compete with us storage 
apples the report said the combination of higher overall 
world production and stable domestic demand is forcing us prices 
down 
moreover us apple exports have declined the last few years 
from 305328 metric tons in the 198081 marketing year to 249238 
tons in 198889 
canada the united kingdom hong kong and singapore although 
representing only 25 percent of the global market accounted for 82 
percent of the us apple exports in 1987 the report said 
us apple producers are trying to increase demand in a number 
of ways including advertising and promotion campaigns to boost 
domestic consumption the report said there is some evidence that 
is working 
in the 198889 marketing year domestic apple consumption rose 
to 264 million tons from 199 million tons the previous year and 
19 million tons the year before that 
expanding domestic production rising imports and stable 
demand at home are pushing down prices for us applesthe report 
said these lower prices are making it hard for us apple 
farmers to meet their costs of production and increasing the 
desirability of extending markets abroad 
the report was in the october issue of farmline magazine and was 
based on material supplied by usda economists amy sparks and boyd 
buxton and james seale of the university of florida 
 
washington ap cigarette consumption may decline 3 percent 
this year following an even sharper downturn in 1989 according to 
agriculture department analysts 
total us cigarette production however is expected to 
increase in 1990 reflecting growth in the export market the 
departments economic research service said tuesday in a report 
however increased cigarette prices health concerns smoking 
restrictions and declining social acceptability of smoking might 
cause us cigarette consumption to fall about 3 percent the 
report said 
in 1989 total domestic use plummeted 5 percent the sharpest 
decline in six years 
officials said this years drop would lower the per capita 
cigarette use further from the 1989 average of 2926 per year the 
lowest since 1942 the peak was 4345 cigarettes per capita in 
1963 before beginning a long decline 
the average is for all americans 18 and older smokers and 
nonsmokers alike it is a statistical comparison only and does not 
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population 
economists said us tobacco production in the 199091 crop year 
is up about 13 percent because of increased acreage and larger 
yields 
despite lower stocks the larger crop and prospects for a 
continuing decline in us cigarette consumption have kept 
fluecured auction prices below a year earlier the report said 
however cash receipts from the 1990 fluecured crop are expected 
to surpass last years level 
the fluecured tobacco harvest was estimated earlier this month 
at 892 million pounds up 10 percent from last year 
burley production at 568 million pounds is up 18 percent from 
last year 
because of the small 1989 burley crop ending stocks on 
sept 30 are projected at about 11 percent lower than last year 
the report said the 199091 supply will be down about 3 percent 
from a year earlier representing about 23 years use 
 
washington ap the us peanut crop isnt exactly peanuts 
but its not the biggest in the world either third place is more 
like it 
a report by the departments foreign agricultural service put 
estimated global production at more than 216 million metric tons 
one ton is about 2205 pounds 
the us harvest this year is expected to be 161 million tons 
with more than 20 million tons accounted for by other countries 
india is the largest producer at 73 million tons this year 
followed by china at 58 million tons 
other significant producers include argentina 430000 tons 
senegal 670000 south africa 240000 sudan 400000 and 
others not identified 518 million tons

former texas oilman george bush has been 
crusading to cut the capital gains tax for the past quarter of a 
century with his distaste for the tax possibly deepened by a 1984 
runin with the internal revenue service 
the current hangup in budget talks is largely due to a deadlock 
between the white house and the democratic congressional leadership 
on the tax that bush first tried to lower as a junior congressman 
in the mid1960s 
without a budget deal or a change in the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law automatic cuts of about 100 billion will be 
triggered after oct 1 the start of the new fiscal year 
the cuts evenly divided between defense and domestic programs 
would have a devastating impact on government programs and further 
endanger an already frail us economy 
although publicly the white house says it will keep plugging 
away privately officials have been increasingly pessimistic that a 
pact can be reached in time to avoid the cuts 
one senior administration official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said tuesday that a deal may in fact be beyond grasp 
until the reality sinks in after a few days under the harsh 
spending cuts 
the administration is hoping that the persian gulf crisis will 
make it easier to forge an eventual pact more to its liking by 
focusing public attention on the condition of the economy and by 
helping marshal a stronger argument for only modest cuts in defense 
spending 
however the 1 billionamonth price tag of the us military 
effort and the potential growth of oil prices makes the pact itself 
that much harder to forge 
bushs heels seem firmly dug in on his insistence for a lower 
capital gains rate 
his repugnance for the tax levied on the sale of real estate 
stocks works of art and other assets dates back to his oil field 
business background associates say 
in the 1960s bush championed a lower capital gains rate as a 
junior member of the house ways and means committee then and now 
bush argued that lower capital gains rates would encourage business 
investment and economic growth 
he has strongly disputed democratic contentions that a lower 
capital gains tax would benefit mainly the rich 
capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other income up to 
33 percent bush would like to cut the rate to 15 percent 
democrats have offered to cut it to 23 percent but they want 
something in return such as a surcharge on the wealthiest 
taxpayers 
bush advocated lower capital gains taxes throughout his 
presidential campaign and through the first 20 months of his 
presidency in fact efforts to strike a bipartisan budget 
agreement also broke down last year over a disagreement on the tax 
both the house and the senate voted for a lower capital gains 
rate last year but the plan died in a senate filibuster coming so 
close to victory served to further whet the administrations 
appetite for winning the tax reduction this year 
bushs 1984 brush with the irs which disallowed his efforts to 
claim a tax deferral on his vacation home in kennebunkport may 
have sharpened his zeal to reduce the tax 
bush had tried to shield himself from paying a capital gains tax 
when he sold his fivebedroom home in houston in 1981 for 843273 
bush argued that he used the money to buy his more expensive home 
in kennebunkport 
homeowners usually can defer paying capital gains taxes when 
they sell one principal residence and purchase another more 
expensive one 
however the irs said the seaside home in maine was not a 
principal residence bush and his wife barbara were hit with a 
144000 bill for back taxes and 54000 in interest penalties 
according to his 1989 tax returns released by the white house 
bush paid taxes last year on 36068 in capital gains generated by 
his blind trust 
bush made it clear this week that hes not about to abandon his 
call for lower capital gains taxes 
he told a republican fundraiser in denver on tuesday that a cut 
in the capital gains tax which will create jobs was one of a 
number of growthoriented tax incentives vital to a budget 
package 
the day before he told a news conference in washington that 
such a tax cut is something i really believe is necessary to 
stimulate the economy and i have not changed my view on that

in the 1950s industrialist william lanes 
voracious appetite for american art was limited only by the size of 
his car 
if it didnt fit into the back of my station wagon i wouldnt 
buy it he reminisced years after amassing what is considered 
one of the finest collections of early 20thcentury american works 
by such artists as georgia okeeffe arthur dove stuart davis and 
marsden harley 
now lane has given 75 of those oil paintings watercolors and 
drawings to the museum of fine arts the museums largest donation 
in 40 years they went on display tuesday night 
the gift to the boston museum already noted for its collections 
of 18th and 19th century art transforms our american painting 
collection director alan shestack said tuesday 
the collection makes us a real center for 20thcentury 
american art which we could not have said yesterday he said 
suddenly in one fell swoop we have gone from having very little 
to having a very distinguished collection 
the gift from the william lane foundation based in lunenburg 
includes four works by okeeffe seven by davis 12 by dove and 
three by harley 
lane a retired plastics manufacturer began collecting 
paintings in the 1950s guided primarily by his instincts he 
slowly amassed what turned out to be a spectacular collection 
shestack said 
efforts to reach lane and his wife saundra were unsuccessful 
their telephone number in lunenburg is not listed lane recounted 
his collecting habits in a statement issued by the museum 
his finds include okeeffes muchreproduced painting of 1936 
deer skull with pedernal which depicts a stylized deer skull 
suspended on a blackened tree limb stuart davis pivotal abstract 
egg beater 3 of 192728 and doves 1944 masterpiece that red 
one 
lane appreciated these paintings at a time when they were 
being overlooked by almost everyone else shestack said they 
represent the birth of abstraction in american art 
lanes collection has been exhibited frequently at the museum of 
fine arts and around the world he approached trustees of the 
boston museum this summer about making his permanent donation 
shestack said 
lane is an honorary trustee at the museum and his wife is a 
trustee 
the collection hung in the museums central firstfloor gallery 
which has been renamed the william h and saundra b lane gallery

americans are far less supportive of israel 
than they were three years ago according to a new opinion survey 
that also found growing negative feelings toward japan and mexico 
growing dislike for israel is evident across all demographic 
political and social groups except among american jews said the 
times mirror survey titled the people the press amp politics 
1990 
the survey found that 44 percent rated israel favorably and 45 
percent unfavorably three years ago the split was 65 percent 
favorable and 27 percent unfavorable 
that finding was disputed by malcolm hoenlein executive 
director of the conference of presidents of major jewish 
organizations who called it inconsistent with other surveys of 
american attitudes toward israel 
the survey also found that as economic expectations of people 
have declined antijapanese sentiment has soared 
dislike for the japanese has become more mainstream 
concluded the survey it is no longer primarily concentrated 
among the kinds of people who have been hit especially hard by 
japanese competition 
the news was equally bad for the republican and democratic 
parties according to the times mirror survey americans have 
become increasingly alienated from the parties as well as from 
government in general 
even among the strongest supporters of the democratic party it 
was viewed as incapable of governing america successfully and 
unclear on what it should stand for 
despite the republican success at holding the white house the 
survey concluded the party has been unable to capitalize on these 
declining democratic fortunes because the gop itself is now seen by 
a majority of the public as the political instrument of the 
nations rich and powerful 
im not at all disheartened by those findings said 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
he noted that the survey was conducted at a time when the 
republican president has very high approval ratings but that 
nonetheless it reinforces the point that weve been trying to get 
across namely that the republican party is the party of the 
privileged few 
brown said his party must do a better job of getting across the 
point that republicans have been in charge of government for the 
last decade it hasnt been democrats and republicans have failed 
totally in managing this government 
the findings were based on facetoface interviews in may with 
3004 adults a random sample of 1000 was reinterviewed between 
aug 19 and 25 the responses for the overall sample had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points 
the responses were analyzed by princeton research associates and 
compared to the findings of a similar study conducted in 1987 
hoenlein said the finding that 44 percent of americans back 
israel was a strong statement of support 
i would say that the negative was completely inconsistent with 
every other finding that i see he said 
a new york timescbs poll conducted in june said 61 percent of 
people questioned supported sustaining or increasing levels of aid 
to israel a washington postabc poll last year said 72 percent 
favored maintaining or increasing aid to the middle east country 
the american jewish committee commissioned a poll by the roper 
organization that was conducted in may and asked people whether 
they found themselves more in sympathy with israel or with the arab 
nations that survey found 39 percent saying their sympathies were 
more with israel while 9 percent said they were more with the arab 
nations 
when that question was posed in february 1987 48 percent said 
their sympathies were more with israel 
in the times mirror survey when asked about attitudes toward 
japan 56 percent gave a favorable opinion and 39 percent 
unfavorable three years ago 69 percent viewed japan favorably and 
27 percent unfavorably 
the greatest increases in unfavorable opinion toward the 
japanese occurred among whites men upperincome earners and those 
in the western united states the survey found 
the survey also found growth in the already large numbers of 
americans feeling alienated from their government 
among the findings were these 
thirty percent said they agreed completely with the statement 
that generally speaking elected officials in washington often 
lose touch with the people pretty quickly three years ago 22 
percent agreed completely 
the majority who felt people like themselves have no say in 
what government does grew from 52 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 
1990 
the number of people who said that elected officials care what 
they think declined from 47 percent to 44 percent 
thirtyeight percent said they agreed completely with the 
statement its really true the rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer that was an increase from 31 percent in 1987

the proiraqi media contends that american 
soldiers sent to saudi arabia are afflicted with all the 
manifestations of us decadence including aids alcohol drugs 
and a yearning for prostitutes 
the iraqi people also are being told that israel far from being 
a peripheral player in the persian gulf crisis has sent planes 
tanks and soldiers to saudi arabia all elaborately disguised as 
being part of the american arsenal 
a us information agency analysis of the prosaddam hussein 
media in iraq and elsewhere says there has been an extremely 
active disinformation campaign waged against the united states 
and us forces in saudi arabia since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
although many iraqi disinformation claims are crude and 
patently false past experience with disinformation campaigns 
indicates that even the most outrageous claims can be widely 
believed the analysis said 
some examples of claims found in the iraqi media or sympathetic 
news outlets elsewhere 
the pentagon has arranged to send two groups of 5000 egyptian 
women each to provide for the sexual satisfaction of american 
servicemen in saudi arabia 
us troops 40 percent of whom are suffering from aids are 
occupying and defiling moslem holy places in saudi arabia 
some military planes in saudi arabia are actually israeli 
planes disguised as us aircraft the israeli pilots have been 
provided with us identity cards and americansounding names 
saudis resent the us military presence in their country and 
have sabotaged us military equipment in response us forces 
have killed some saudis 
us forces are dumping nuclear waste in the saudi desert 
even if iraq had not invaded kuwait the united states and 
other countries would have sent forces into kuwait 
the united states and other countries are covertly trading with 
iraq in violation of the united nations embargo 
a station identifying itself as holy mecca radio has been 
broadcasting tendentious messages about the american presence to 
listeners in saudi arabia purportedly from saudi territory the 
analysis said 
the american foreigner is on our land a recent broadcast 
said the us soldier has his customs and traditions which 
include drinking alcohol eating pork and practicing prostitution 
the american soldier has come with all the manifestations of 
decadence dominating us society drugs prostitution and aids 
iraq meanwhile has claimed for weeks that the bush 
administration has been operating its own disinformation campaign 
by contending that us forces in saudi arabia are on a defensive 
mission 
iraqi spokesmen have noted that the us military arsenal in 
saudi arabia in addition to defensive arms includes offensive 
weaponry such as the stealth fighterbomber for use in a possible 
attack on iraq 
all of the disinformation claims that have turned up over the 
past six weeks have appeared in the iraqi media except the one 
involving egyptian prostitutes the usia study said 
that story may have been an iraqi disinformation plant the usia 
study said the story appeared in the times of india on aug 
13 a few days after bush committed us forces to saudi arabia 
after the initial 10000 egyptian women were sent the account 
predicted that the number eventually would rise to 100000 its 
alleged source was an unnamed sort of opposition arabic 
newspaper published in london the usia report said it added 
that the times of india immediately terminated its relationship 
with the author 
the article was reprinted in bangladesh and similar story 
appeared in an islamic newspaper in malaysia 
the claim about israelis masquerading as americans was made as 
the first american forces were being sent to saudi arabia the 
iraqi armed forces general command spokesman contended that the 
israelis were planning to attack iraq 
the iraqi news agency distributed embellished versions of the 
story later in the month inspiring similar accounts in a number of 
other arab countries

nigeria is going through a parents 
nightmare medicine for their children that turns out to be 
poisonous 
health minister olikoye ransome kuti announced tuesday that more 
than 100 children have died in the past month after taking a 
tainted syrup prescribed as a painkiller 
ransome kuti told a news conference that first word of the 
danger came from ibadan 80 miles north of lagos when 102 children 
fell ill in late july 
investigations showed the children who had been in several 
ibadan hospitals all had taken a patent syrup to kill pain 
eightyfive of the victims died he said 
reports in lagos newspapers say more than 240 children have been 
killed by the poisonous mixture 
most victims were between six months and six years old 
prescription of the syrup to children under 10 years old was 
temporarily banned in nigeria on thursday 
ransome kuti said laboratory tests showed the lethal painkiller 
was using ethylene glycol as a base instead of propylene glycol 
ethylene glycol causes kidney failure the minister said 
he said the source of the ethylene glycol had been traced but 
refused to indicate whether the case was being treated as one of 
wrong labeling of drugs or production of bootleg medication 
nigerias government has been fighting such bogus medications 
for more than a year licensed and unlicensed drug stores sell 
them as do street hawkers and vendors in marketplaces 
the government last year legislated against producing such 
medicines and introduced prison sentences of up to a year and stiff 
fines for those convicted 
government investigations took officers to far eastern countries 
like taiwan korea and singapore where nigerians fly to buy fake 
drugs 
endemic corruption in the country involves port officials and 
customs officials who turn a blind eye ransome kuti said in an 
interview with the associated press earlier this year 
between 40 percent and 50 percent of drugs available in nigeria 
are fake or substandard the un world health organization 
representative in nigeria dr sh brewergraves said in an april 
interview 
the morbidity rate is very very serious he said 
this oilrich nations economy has been drained by slumping 
petroleum prices that have hit people hard many opt for the 
bootleg medications becaue they are cheaper 
fake medications reach a huge market in nigeria which has more 
than 100 million people and is the most populous nation in africa 
open borders in the region have allowed the killer drugs to 
surface in other countries notably sierra leone

4anhour jobs every day little by little we are giving away our 
entire manufacturing base 
the house on tuesday approved the legislation that would 
restrict further growth of fabric and apparel imports to 1 percent 
a year and freeze shoe imports at 1989 levels but the 271149 vote 
was five votes short of the twothirds majority needed to override 
a presidential veto if all 433 members vote 
the senate passed the same bill in july on a vote of 6832 two 
more than necessary to override a veto 
president reagan vetoed nearly identical legislation in 1985 and 
again in 1988 bush has pledged to do likewise 
it represents the worst form of economic policy for america 
one based upon the mistaken belief that less trade throughout the 
world will somehow save american jobs and enhance our prosperity 
bush said in a letter to house leaders 
supporters contend the legislation is needed to stop the erosion 
of more than half a million us jobs in the three industries in 
the past 17 years as imports have grabbed a dramatically larger 
share of the us markets 
imports they said account for more than onethird of the 
clothing and 80 percent of the shoes sold in the united states 
boosting the nations trade deficit by 265 billion last year 
opponents however contend the new protections would raise an 
average familys clothing costs by 100 a year through higher 
prices and invite retaliation against us farm technology and 
service exports 
the administration and other critics said the bill would scuttle 
a fouryear effort under the uruguay round of the 100nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade to lower other nations 
barriers to us exports 
it makes the congress appear hypocritical said rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee which oversees us trade relations how can we expect 
other countries to observe trade agreements when we wont observe 
them ourselves 
opponents say lawmakers show little reluctance to buying their 
own clothing overseas sen ernest f hollings dsc the bills 
primary sponsor in the senate last week acknowledged ordering 
custommade suits from a south korean tailor 
without mentioning any names there are members on both sides 
of this issue who are very proud to have their suits made in 
seoul said rep david dreier rcalif the american consumer 
should have the exact same right that all these members of congress 
have 
rep tom delay rtexas said families already are paying about 
250 a year more than they should for clothing because of 18 
percent tariffs on imported textile and apparel compared with 4 
percent tariffs on most other manufactured products 
the bill would require the administration to establish 
nationbynation quotas on us imports of textiles apparel and 
leather vinyl and plastic shoes except for products from canada 
and israel which have freetrade agreements with the united 
states 
textile and apparel imports would be allowed to grow only 1 
percent a year and nonrubber shoe imports would be frozen at 1989 
levels

nine major chemical polluters plan sizable 
reductions in cancercausing emissions from 30 plants states over 
the next three years as a result of armtwisting by the 
environmental protection agency 
epa administrator william k reilly said tuesday the planned 
pollution cuts although only a small portion of the 24 billion 
pounds of toxic industrial chemicals released annually are 
significant because they come from plants where the cancer risks 
are considered highest 
the voluntary reductions were agreed upon after lengthy 
negotiations with the agency reilly said that under current laws 
it would be exceedingly difficult and timeconsuming to force 
similar emission cuts 
the nine corporations are among the major petrochemical 
companies in the nation they are basf dow chemical co exxon 
corp general electric goodyear tire and rubber co occidental 
reichhold texaco and texas petrochemical 
most of the reductions totaling nearly 95 million pounds 
annually were scheduled to be made from within a few months to two 
years general electric said it would meet the cuts by the end of 
1993 
a number of other companies such as du pont and monsanto have 
previously announced plans to significantly reduce toxic emissions 
but were not part of the discussions with the epa 
under the agreement releases of cancercausing chemicals will 
be cut by about 80 percent at the 30 plants in 14 states the epa 
said the planned reduction covers six cancercausing chemicals 
the action comes as congress nears approval of tougher pollution 
control legislation that will require industry to sharply reduce 
toxic emissions from factories over the next seven years 
david doniger a specialist on toxic industrial pollution for 
the natural resources defense council said that while the 
voluntary reductions are welcomed they are not believed to go 
beyond what the legislation in congress will require anyway 
at most its a small down payment on the reductions that are 
needed to protect people from these highrisk chemicals at 
plants he said in an interview 
although the planned cuts are only a small share of the total 
annual emissions reilly called the companies actions quite 
significant because the reductions will come from plants where 
the epa considers the cancer risks among the highest 
for example one plant is the texaco facility in port neches 
texas where the epa has estimated the cancer risk to be as high as 
1 in 10 for a lifetime of sustained maximum exposure to toxic 
chemicals texaco has promised to reduce emissions of butadiene a 
carcinogen by 12 million pounds at port neches by february 
twelve of the plants under the agreement have cancer risk levels 
of at least 1 in 100 over a lifetime if a person were to live at 
the plant boundary the epa said 
but the voluntary reductions by the nine companies dont cover 
dozens of other refineries and perochemical plants where the epa 
estimates comparable health concerns 
the 30 plants are among 182 cited by the epa last year as posing 
a worrisome level of cancer risk because of toxic releases into the 
air these 182 plants in 1988 released more than 34 million pounds 
of the six chemicals covered by the agreement the epa said 
ten of the plants are in texas and four are in louisiana others 
are in tennessee pennsylvania georgia california connecticut 
michigan west virginia illinois indiana ohio north carolina 
and delaware 
here is a list of the plants involved by manufacturer

the bush administrations ambiguous behavior 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait may have led saddam hussein to 
believe the united states would not resist such a move 
congressional democrats contend 
rep lee hamilton dind sternly reminded assistant secretary 
of state john h kelly on tuesday of his testimony before the 
foreign affairs middle east subcommittee july 31 just two days 
before the invasion 
after reading kellys words from a transcript hamilton 
concluded you left the impression that it was the policy of the 
united states not to come to the defense of kuwait in the event 
of an invasion 
the administration also has been criticized for failing to heed 
warning signs about the same time during a meeting between saddam 
and us ambassador april glaspie who left iraq for a vacation 
just before the invasion 
the obsequious treatment of him saddam by a large number of 
highranking officials encouraged him to take that action and 
theres no escaping that responsibility said rep tom lantos 
dcalif 
lawmakers have scrupulously avoided any criticism of president 
bushs handling of the persian gulf crisis which has been publicly 
popular and sent bushs approval ratings to nearrecord highs but 
hamilton was clearly annoyed by the administrations efforts to 
defend its prior policy of hoping to moderate saddams behavior by 
treating iraq gently 
he implied that kelly was seeking to recast or escape 
responsibility for his earlier testimony in which he suggested 
congress had misread saddams intentions and the prospects for an 
improvement in usiraqi relations 
in response kelly cited bushs acknowledgement monday that the 
previous policy didnt produce results 
and was wrong asked hamilton 
it did not succeed kelly answered 
thats for sure hamilton said 
only rep christopher smith rnj came to kellys defense 
it is unhelpful to imply blame on the part of the united states 
for saddams unprovoked aggression he said or to suggest that 
glaspie somehow gave saddam hussein the green light to invade 
smith noted that egyptian president hosni mubarak was fooled 
too about saddams intentions in the days before the invasion 
it would be most unfair if this develops into a blame america 
situation he said it would be most hurtful to the 
sustainability of this policy 
under questioning by hamilton kelly said the united states is 
committed to defend not only saudi arabia and kuwait but other gulf 
states helping in the crisis he agreed when hamilton specifically 
named qatar bahrain the united arab emirates and oman 
also at the hearing friends of israel attacked the 
administrations proposed 20 billion arms sale to saudi arabia 
saying the package isnt justified by the persian gulf crisis 
both its magnitude and its premises are outrageous said 
rep mel levine dcalif it has little or nothing to do with 
anybodys legitimate defense needs 
levine said the proposed sale the largest ever would alter the 
military balance in the middle east and deprive israel of the 
qualitative edge in defense capability it has traditionally 
been guaranteed by the united states 
but henry s rowen the assistant secretary of defense for 
international security affairs said us officials are discussing 
with israel a new security package of its own and said the saudi 
weapons would not erode israels advantage 
in response to another question kelly said he expects the 
crisis will have a cathartic effect in the gulf encouraging 
real changes in the way states in the region are governed 
including increased political openness and pluralism 
in other matters tuesday 
the pentagon said iraqi troop strength in and near kuwait has 
risen to 360000 while some tanks and artillery have been pulled 
back from the front lines near saudi arabia the pentagons last 
estimate two weeks ago was that there were 265000 iraqi troops and 
2200 tanks in kuwait and nearby sections of iraq 
defense secretary dick cheney consulted with the white house 
about his selection of a vietnam veteran and former thunderbird 
pilot gen merrill a mcpeak to replace the general he fired as 
air force chief of staff gen mike dugan was fired monday after 
revealing secret us plans that contemplate bombing iraq and 
personally targeting saddam

the hunt by the bush administration and 
congressional leaders for a budget compromise is lurching into an 
uncertain direction as the two sides their eyes on the calendar 
search for a compromise 
the top five congressional leaders planned to meet again today 
with white house chief of staff john sununu and two other 
highranking administration officials they are seeking a package 
to cut the federal deficit by 50 billion next year and 450 
billion more by 1995 
the group met in the capitol on tuesday a day after the 
10dayold negotiations at andrews air force base in nearby 
maryland ended in stalemate 
it was reaffirmed on all sides that it continues to be our 
strong desire to reach agreement as soon as possible said house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
gephardt and white house budget director richard darman also 
planned to meet separately in the hope of making a breakthrough 
the effort continued as oct 1 the first day of fiscal 1991 
rapidly approached if no deal is in place by that day the 
grammrudman law will chop about 100 billion out of the 12 
trillion federal budget a cut that all agree would stagger 
government operations 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan began gathering 
signatures among his colleagues on a letter promising support for 
president bush if he vetoes a bill rolling back the grammrudman 
cuts should one arise 
but some officials who asked to not be identified including 
republicans said that because the effect of the grammrudman cuts 
would be so severe it was not clear that dole would get 34 
signatures the minimum amount of votes needed to sustain a veto 
democrats said the andrews talks failed because of bushs demand 
to cut the capital gains tax rate republicans say the reduction 
would stimulate the economy while democrats contend only the rich 
would benefit because they own most of the property affected by the 
tax 
republicans also blamed the impasse on democratic efforts to 
raise taxes too high and to protect domestic programs from spending 
cuts

victims of whitecollar fraud would find it 
harder to win court damages under a bill approved by a house 
committee but sponsors say current law has gotten out of hand and 
urgently needs reform 
the accounting industry and others being named in racketeering 
suits have been pushing for legislation to tighten the law the 
bill was approved tuesday by the house judiciary committee on a 
voice vote 
critics said the measure would prevent victims from collecting 
damages from whitecollar criminals sponsors said the 
antiracketeering law was meant for use against organized crime 
not bankers and accountants as its being used 
businessmen have been vulnerable to horrible damages when 
there hasnt been anything close to proof of criminal conduct 
rep bill mccollum rfla told the committee 
the capitol hill watchdog group public citizen issued a 
statement saying the bill provides a bailout for the accountants 
law firms real estate appraisers and investment bankers whose 
participation was essential to the success of the sampl scams 
quick floor action is expected with congress set to leave 
washington for the campaign trail in a matter of weeks 
the measure would make major changes in the racketeer influenced 
corrupt organizations act it allows victims of whitecollar crime 
to collect triple damages if they can prove they have been harmed 
by a pattern of fraud 
those who lost money in the collapse of charles keating jrs 
lincoln savings of irvine calif are seeking triple damages under 
the law from several figures in the scandal including accountants 
who gave keating a clean bill of financial health 
legislation that would make it more difficult to get triple 
damages under the law already has been approved by the senate 
judiciary committee 
in contrast the house bill sets up strict standards that 
lawsuits must meet a lawsuit would be allowed only if it clearly 
serves the public interest and provides appropriate deterrence 
against the repetition of egregious criminal conduct 
the committee also adopted a provision to require those filing 
suit to prove that the defendants were an integral part of 
ongoing racketeering activity 
but a number of lawmakers warned that could prove an escape 
hatch for various minor figures who were not at the heart of 
whitecollar scandals but who still played a role 
rep craig washington dtexas said the provision would 
create a small loophole through which a crafty lawyer could drive 
a large van of lawyers and accountants 
i dont agree with the gentleman said rep william hughes 
dnj the chief sponsor of the amendment 
committee members also questioned the provision limiting 
lawsuits to those involving ongoing fraud were going to 
have trouble with the language said rep don edwards dcalif 
to me ongoing means going on right now 
rep romano mazzoli dky said that because of the amendment 
the lawmakers might be inadvertently insulating people but the 
same amendment erased a provision of the bill that would have made 
it retroactive and could have thrown a number of current lawsuits 
out of court

the syrian generals previous 
campaigns were against israelis and in the lebanese maelstrom but 
he appeared happy enough to be lining up on the side of the 
americans 
because of the enemy he said saddam hussein 
i hope he dies very soon gen mohammed deeb dhaher said of 
the iraqi leader during a visit tuesday by journalists to his camp 
in the northern saudi desert 
i am an arab officer said dhaher a veteran of the 1973 
golan heights battles against israel i am ready to go any time 
and stand with other arab countries 
the syrian fighters under his command are among a group of small 
arab units who form the front line of the multinational force 
arrayed against iraqioccupied kuwait they include saudi egyptian 
and kuwaiti troops 
dhahers forces include 1200 to 1500 commandos who have seen 
fighting in lebanon he described them as a buffer between the 
brother arab nations of iraq and saudi arabia 
the syrians are here for the defense of saudi arabia but if 
they have to go for offense they will be ready he said 
like the egyptians now 2000 strong they are awaiting the 
arrival of reinforcements 
but their deployment appears more a political statement than a 
military threat the bulk of the foreign troops in saudia arabia 
are american but most of the us troops are based about 30 miles 
behind the arab forces which are about 40 miles from the kuwaiti 
border 
one of dhahers men ramzi salim said the syrians would have no 
problem fighting alongside americans if hostilities break out 
everyone in the world is against saddam hussein salim said 
kuwait will be kuwait again 
the arab field commanders spoke of working together for now to 
defend saudi arabia perhaps soon to push saddams army from 
kuwait 
it is the first time syria has been aligned with washington in 
any middle east conflict secretary of state james a baker iii 
visited damascus last week and president hafez assad promised to 
bolster his forces in saudi arabia 
prior to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait assad figured more 
prominently on the us list of troublemakers in the middle east 
than did saddam syria is one of seven nations on a state 
department list of terrorism sponsors 
but assads emnity for saddam is strong they lead rival wings 
of the baath party and with diminishing soviet support he is 
seeking to improve his ties with the west 
the egyptian commander col abdul rahim mohammed said played 
down suggestions the arabs forces might have trouble fighting 
together either because of political differences of different 
military training 
we have no problems with the arab forces he said most 
important is we speak one language which is the arabic language 
which will make it much easier 
during tuesdays visit arranged by the saudi government the 
arab troops in the desert camps to the northeast of hafr al batin 
spent much of the day dealing with a swirling wind that stirred up 
sand clouds at times so thick they hid the tents and equipment 
at the kuwaiti camp men from the army that was quickly defeated 
in the iraqi invasion spoke of leading the charge home although 
only about a third of the preinvasion kuwaiti army of 20000 
remains 
we are willing to go for offense and get our country back but 
we are waiting for orders says the kuwaiti commander col 
ibrahim mohammed 
as the television cameras rolled a handful of kuwaitis rode 
atop an armored personnel carrier flashing the v for victory

new jersey and indiana lawmakers are at odds 
over a senateapproved measure that would allow states to close 
their borders to other states garbage to protect shrinking 
landfill capacity 
sen dan coats rind said his bill would give every state 
the right to determine its own destiny in managing trash but new 
jersey democratic sens frank lautenberg and bill bradley contend 
the bill could slam the door on states unprepared for critical 
landfill shortages 
the senate approved the measure tuesday on a 6831 vote 
lautenberg and bradley say they will try to persuade a housesenate 
conference committee to kill the bill 
new jersey is the largest exporter of solid waste to indiana 
landfills which coats said are eight to 10 years from reaching 
their capacity indiana he said is afraid of being overrun by 
trash 
but new jersey says its also in danger of being overwhelmed by 
garbage 
coats proposal offered as an amendment to the district of 
columbia appropriations bill would let states block garbage 
imports as long as they had a 20year solid waste plan in place 
lautenberg and bradley charged the measure would block 
development of a comprehensive national solid waste policy by 
pitting state against state 
what goes around comes around bradley said several times 
on the senate floor as he warned colleagues that 37 states and the 
district of columbia export garbage and could find themselves in 
new jerseys position 
the new jersey senators told reporters the garbage measure could 
be stripped from the district appropriations bill because the house 
has no similar garbage provision in its version 
the district appropriations bill is also in danger of a 
presidential veto because it contains abortion funding language 
that led to two vetoes last year 
if the garbage provision is knocked out well be back next 
year coats said at minimum we have established a 2to1 
majority to do something about this problem 
lautenberg accused coats of playing electionyear politics with 
the garbage issue by running television campaign ads that depict a 
caricature of a new jersey man dumping garbage on a hoosier stoop 
coats was among those accusing new jersey of not doing enough to 
control its own waste crisis 
new jersey has to solve its problem in a sensible 
nonpolluting way lautenberg said acknowledging the states 
position had few adherents outside the northeast 
we knew we were on the lesspopular side of the issue he 
said 
but lautenberg argued that passage would let states impose 
unlimited punitive fees on outofstate garbage without 
environmental protection agency review 
a state writes its own ticket he said 
lautenberg also warned the bill would force lockedout states 
to take desperate steps that may mean a rush to incinerators 
or illegal dumping

remnants of an ancient indian pueblo or 
centuriesold ox deposits nobodys sure what lies beneath santa fe 
plaza in the heart of the nations oldest capital city but 
archaeologists hope to find out 
watched by plaza regulars skateboard riders and tourists an 
archaeological team on tuesday began the first of several 
exploratory digs on the verdant square which is surrounded by 
museums boutiques and gift shops 
within hours volunteer diggers were unearthing interesting 
shards of pottery including a buttonsize chip of blue and white 
mexican majolica clay used in pottery since the 17th century 
excavation leader david snow said diggers could find older plaza 
levels indian artifacts and evidence of frontier life 
weve already learned something in the top six inches he 
said 
santa fe was the seat of frontier government and a distant 
outpost of civilization for most of its 380year history 
the plaza was once a terminus for exploration trade and 
immigration routes including the camino real from mexico city and 
the santa fe trail from the mississippi river it was used for 
troop encampments trade markets for holding oxen from missouri 
wagon trains and for growing corn and alfalfa 
it was the center of the frontier for at least three 
nations snow said this was the focus of the frontier up until 
the railroad came in the early 1880s 
the plaza is anchored by the palace of the governors the seat 
of government built by the spanish starting about 1610 pueblo 
indians threw out the spanish in 1680 and it is thought that some 
indian dwellings and a kiva a large room often used for religious 
purposes were built on the plaza 
the spaniards returned in 1692 the palace housed spanish 
mexican and us territorial governors until the late 1800s 
these days the only conquistadors and mountain men around these 
days are reenacting history in the palace now a museum indians 
sell jewelry to tourists under its portal youngsters loiter in the 
square riding skateboards and playing games 
archaeologists will work for about a month on the first phase of 
the excavation and are restricted to selected areas totaling 10 
square meters 
if they uncover enough promising artifacts and if the city 
council approves a second dig will begin next year under san 
francisco street the street across from the palace that leads to 
st francis cathedral 
if that pans out a major plaza dig would be conducted in 1992 
the plaza is a historically designated site protected by city 
ordinances and the surrounding buildings are unlikely to be 
threatened by any excavation

no signs were in arabic but 
iraqioccupied kuwait city couldnt have been far from their 
thoughts as marine assault teams stormed and captured a mock 
third world city and rescued its civilian refugees 
the assault was fast and furious but with only light enemy 
resistance tuesdays training exercise was far from a realistic 
warmup for kuwait 
iraq would be a hell of a lot different a lot scarier 
said sgt keith cawthorn a member of the 1st battalion 8th marine 
regiment that took the mock city 
standing aside his lightarmored vehicle he quickly adds but 
we could do it 
cawthorn and several hundred of his compatriots showed some of 
the skills they would need in kuwait 
amid a deafening roar of fire from rifles and machine guns 
loaded with blanks a camouflaged marine partly hidden in a smoke 
screen shinnied up a downspout to the roof of city hall he 
tossed a rope to the ground and several others quickly joined him 
within minutes they had secured the buildings top floor 
hoisted extra weapons up by rope leaped through a lower floor 
window from ropes attached to the roof and rushed a group of 
civilian refugees out the front door to waiting rescue vehicles 
alls clear a voice called 
operating from a previously secured hotel in the center of the 
city other marines quickly overcame the enemy stronghold in a 
residential area a cobra attack helicopter strafed the nearby 
school complex and seconds later a half dozen marines dropped from 
a ch46 helicopter by rope to the roof of the school gym 
once the school was under marine control more civilians ran from 
the rear of the gym to an adjacent soccer stadium there they met 
incoming helicopters that whisked the group to safety as amphibious 
assault vehicles ringed the grassy field 
the exercise marking the opening of a new marine corps urban 
warfare training center was not designed to simulate an attack on 
kuwait city said brig gen michael downs commander of the camp 
lejeune training base on the carolina coast 
downs and other marine officers showed in their public comments 
however that operation desert shield in which about onethird of 
the 150000 us forces deployed to the persian gulf area are 
marines was not far from anyones mind 
while our attention these last weeks has been on the sands of 
saudi arabia many of us remember vietnam we remember beirut 
and panama downs told a group of pentagon officials 
congressional staffers and journalists observing the exercise we 
must be capable of fighting in all these environments 
president bush sent the marines navy air force and army to 
saudi arabia and the persian gulf area to defend against a possible 
iraqi attack on the saudi oil fields but he has not ruled out an 
offensive strike on kuwait to force iraq out 
downs said the artificial city carved out of 17 acres of pine 
forest at a cost of 79 million was not designed specifically to 
train for operations in the middle east but others acknowledged 
that some camp lejeune marines saw a link to kuwait 
capt greg sumner a company commander said some of his men 
already had dubbed the mock town kuwait city even though its 
street signs read mayberry drive and weaver way and a 
church with steeple stands at one end of town 
even gen al gray commandant of the marines made a veiled 
reference to the persian gulf crisis in brief remarks at a 
ribboncutting ceremony at camp lejeune on tuesday 
we would like to avoid the kind of combat and conflict youre 
going to see he told a group of visitors who accompanied him to 
the training exercise but you cant always do that 
particularly in many of the less developed parts of the world 
where a single city is really what controls the country

at first glance it seems like a club med vacation the 265th 
quartermaster detachment is camped on a beach a few hundred yards 
from the azure blue of the persian gulf a steady breeze off the

there are beachside showers and latrines the tents even have 
electricity produced by the steady thump of a generator 
its a place thats all right to visit said spc henry

more significant than the accommodations is that the 14 members

oil and natural gas drilling should 
be banned within 50 miles of floridas shores including the 
panhandle gov bob martinez said as he campaigned for reelection 
in the region 
the governors proposal tuesday would tighten existing drilling 
limits that include a 30mile buffer in the gulf of mexico from 
naples to cape san blas in southwest florida that agreement leaves 
the western panhandle unprotected outside statecontrolled waters 
which extend 10 miles into the gulf 
in essence we want a safety collar around the state of florida 
from any possible drilling also any spilling that can occur as a 
result of the drilling martinez said 
martinezs democratic opponent former sen lawton chiles 
would support what martinez is proposing but he would go farther 
than that said julie fletcher a spokeswoman for the chiles 
campaign in tallahassee 
she said chiles would oppose any drilling off floridas shores 
regardless how far it may be off the shore she also questioned 
whether the governors proposal is merely for political 
expediency

democratic sen max baucus opposition to 
the strategic defense initiative leaves the nation vulnerable to 
missiles from enemy nations says republican us senate candidate 
allen kolstad 
kolstad the lieutenant governor said tuesday that baucus 
repeatedly has voted against the sdi program 
kolstad praised the program supported by the reagan and bush 
administrations it is technologically feasible strategically 
necessary and morally imperative said kolstad 
baucus responded by saying the nations overreliance on 
expensive nuclear and star wars defense programs has hampered the 
us buildup in the persian gulf during the last six weeks 
he said he supports funding for the kind of conventional weapons 
that would be needed in a mideast conflict tanks attack 
helicopters fighter planes and missiles money should be shifted 
from the more costly and controversial military programs to bolster 
other weapons systems he said 
baucus said he voted against the defense spending measures cited 
by kolstad because they spent too much on star wars and nuclear 
weapons

for two years the powdery soil on david 
langs farm refused to yield a crop 
this year he finally got rain and about 1500 acres of golden 
wheat but hes stuck with the wheat 
a world wheat glut totaling more than 216 billion bushels is 
holding down prices experts say the us wheat crop alone is 
expected to total a record 276 billion bushels up 35 percent from 
last year 
theres a wheat war going on said neal fisher director of 
the north dakota wheat commission canadians sold wheat to china 
about two weeks ago for something around 250 a bushel the 
european community is selling it for 205 
north dakota wheat farmers like lang are getting about 220 a 
bushel at least 1 less than last year and the lowest theyve seen 
in at least five years farmers say the costs of producing a bushel 
are at least three times that much 
you have to pay 135 to 140 for a gallon of gasoline just 
to harvest that crop said lang 44 who farms 3000 acres with 
his father about 20 miles from bismarck 
government subsidies help offset production costs but farmers 
say they also are being squeezed this year by energy prices which 
have risen sharply since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
we will probably lose more farmers this year than any year 
previous said gov george sinner the longrange future is so 
bleak to many farmers that they are simply saying the hell with 
it 
wheat growers say the embargo against iraq is having little 
effect on the market because american wheat sales to iraq had 
already virtually dried up this year 
farm leaders are asking the us agriculture department to help 
lift wheat prices by keeping more grain in reserve offering bigger 
loans to farmers and paying more federal export bonuses to increase 
sales 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has said that if 
american farmers plant less or put more in storage foreign 
competitors will only plant more his department already has 
increased export bonuses at the risk of driving the market lower 
he said 
were doing all we can to help move us wheat in the 
marketplace in a sensible way yeutter said in a letter to rep 
dan glickman dkansas 
for some farmers its a hard blow after two years in which 
nothing would grow lang said he is leaning on strong livestock 
prices he can sell some of his 150 cattle and hell get a usda 
loan on his wheat to help pay bills 
under the loan program farmers can pay back the money at the 
end of nine months and sell their wheat for a higher price or the 
government gets the grain but farmers also say the loan rate less 
than 2 per bushel is too low 
north dakota expects to harvest a record 275 million bushels of 
spring wheat and 104 million bushels of durum a wheat variety used 
in pasta 
lang said hes not asking for wheat at 5 per bushel when 350 
would do all he wants is a stable farm program 
urban people have got to realize where food comes from he 
said if were not out here producing it one of these years 
theyre going to go hungry

president bush is using the persian gulf 
crisis to beef up campaign speeches saying theres no reason 
politics should stop just because of the turmoil abroad 
bush told a republican fundraising dinner tuesday night that 
we will not allow our political life to he held hostage to a 
crisis 
the president today was heading to san francisco for more gop 
politicking in californias tight governors race before returning 
to washington tonight 
bush predicted the armed forces hes sent to the gulf region 
now numbering some 150000 will vote by absentee ballots and said 
their compatriots at home should do no less on election day 
if our soldiers sailors airmen and marines can find the time 
to vote under such difficult circumstances surely those of us at 
home will do our civic duty as well he told a dinner fundraiser 
for the gubernatorial campaign of sen pete wilson 
he also reiterated that his persian gulf strategy includes 
driving iraqi president saddam hussein from occupied kuwait and 
restoring the deposed kuwaiti emir to power he said he wants to 
create a new partnership of nations a new world order freer from 
the threat of terror stronger in the pursuit of justice more 
secure in the quest for peace 
on matters like these we are called upon to put country before 
self and patriotism before party bush said so its good that 
politics now are stopping at the waters edge but that still 
leaves a lot of america in between 
the president issued a virtual call to political arms on the 
home front 
we will vigorously campaign right up to the november 
election bush pledged for those of us at home we can serve 
our country by being the best candidates the best citizens and 
yes the best republicans and democrats we can be 
bush earlier visited denver on his twoday swing the type of 
campaign trip he likely will take each week until the november 
election hes expected to make another visit to california where 
the governors race is the gops top national priority 
bushs schedule today included a breakfast fundraiser for the 
state party and a san francisco lunch for wilsons campaign the 
wilson forces hope to raise between 15 million and 2 million at 
the 1000aperson events 
bush was to highlight wilsons environmental record 
courting the environmental vote has been a hot issue in the 
gubernatorial race between wilson and former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinstein the democratic nominee 
wilson has ardently supported coastal protection bucking both 
the reagan and bush white houses and championed forestry and river 
protection as well he has won the backing of environmental groups 
that traditionally would be expected to back the democratic 
nominee 
wilson won the endorsement of friends of the river and the 
western river guides association 
other environmental groups including the sierra club and league 
of conservation voters have yet to announce an endorsement 
wilsons campaign anticipates spending more than 15 million in 
his bid to defeat feinstein whose fundraising goal is 10 
million both are spending heavily on dueling tv commercials 
bush in his comments at a 1000aticket audience tuesday 
night at the downtown bonaventure hotel dovetailed his remarks to 
go with wilsons current toughoncrime theme 
he noted that wilsons grandfather was a chicago police 
detective who was gunned down by cocaine dealers 
bush praised wilson for supporting his crime package which has 
been mostly rewritten by the democratic controlled congress 
he wants to govern a california where women need no longer 
fear the night because drug dealers and criminals will fear the 
law bush said and he would start by extending capital 
punishment in california to major drug traffickers the same as my 
proposal before congress

makers of computer software could bar video 
stores and others from renting their software to customers as the 
result of legislation approved by the house judiciary committee 
manufacturers have complained that the rentals of video games 
are cutting into sales the games often cost between 40 and 50 
the bill sponsored by rep mike synar dokla is similar to a 
law already passed by congress under which record manufacturers are 
allowed to bar rentals 
the idea behind the bill is that its easy to copy both records 
and computer software stored on floppy discs the rentals are 
therefore considered to undercut the copyrights held by the 
manufacturers 
under the bill manufacturers would have the option of allowing 
rentals or barring them in the case of records most makers dont 
allow rentals 
the bill applies to a wide range of computer software in 
addition to video games but the rental of games by stores that 
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the issue

salvadoran government and guerrilla 
negotiators ended six days of talks toward ending a decadelong 
civil war without success and both sides said they expected an 
escalation in the fighting 
the parley that ended tuesday was the fifth session of 
unmediated talks that began in may between representatives of 
the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani and the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
the two sides agreed to meet again in mexico before november 4 
the top item on the agenda was the future role of the armed 
forces 
the guerrillas demanded a purge of human rights abusers and 
corrupt officers as well as measures to ensure an end to decades 
of impunity for military men who commit crimes 
international human rights monitoring agencies accuse the armed 
forces of involvement in the murders of as many as 30000 suspected 
government opponents during the past decade 
even so not a single officer has been tried for a crime 
characterized by the politically motivated abuse of human rights 
rights groups also blame the fmln for summary executions of 
suspected opponents but in far fewer numbers 
the government says it is willing to reform the military but 
its proposal calls for the armed forces to do their own reforming 
which the guerrillas say would result in only cosmetic changes 
the fmln contends purge and reorganization of the armed forces 
should lead to eventual demilitarization of salvadoran society 
both the guerrilla and government armies would disappear giving 
way to a civilianrun police force according to the rebel 
proposal 
both sides accused each other of biding time to gain tactical 
battlefield advantages 
the civil war which began in late 1979 has left an estimated 
72000 people dead death squads linked to the military and 
rightwing extremists are blamed for a large percentage of the 
deaths 
since 1980 the united states has provided more than 4 billion 
in economic and military aid to bolster a succession of salvadoran 
governments 
but congress increasingly exasperated with the military 
standoff and military atrocities like the murder of six prominent 
jesuit priests in november is expected to significantly pare 
military aid this fall 
rebel commanders for weeks have said a stalemate at the 
negotiating table could provoke a major insurgent offensive the 
launched its biggest offensive of the war last fall 
col mauricio vargas agovernment negotiator said the rebel 
predictions of an imminent offensive amount to blackmail

nasa says it may have caused the 
leaks plaguing columbia when it took apart the engine compartment 
after the shuttles last flight in january to remove polishing grit 
that got inside 
someplace we didnt get a seal back on right or something 
henry pohl director of engineering at johnson space center said 
tuesday 
frustrated engineers planned as early as today an exhaustive 
search of the cramped engine compartment for the pinhole or cracks 
from which hydrogen is escaping 
insulation probably will have to be removed from the 
compartment a timeconsuming job that can always run the risk of 
creating another problem pohl said 
nasa also plans to conduct a fueling test on columbia no earlier 
than sunday with tv cameras mounted inside the engine compartment 
columbias launch along with the 150 million astro observatory 
was scrubbd because of a hydrogen leak during fueling monday 
night the fourth postponement since may hydrogen leaks caused all 
but one of the postponements 
nasa said it is forming an investigative team to look into the 
leaks 
the beleaguered space agency has not launched a shuttle since 
april discovery is scheduled next for launch around oct 8 and 
columbia will not fly until at least november 
if discovery does not lift off with the ulysses satellite by 
oct 23 the 750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991 
when earth the sun and jupiter are back in the proper alignment 
officials have not decided yet whether to perform a fueling test 
on discovery the only shuttle in the threevehicle fleet in which 
hydrogen leaks have not been found about five days are needed for 
such a test 
workers took apart columbias engine compartment after the 
january launch in a search for contamination by a metalpolishing 
abrasive nasa said 
i think we created a problem in that process pohl said 
pohl said the leaks are difficult to trace because they appear 
only when the liquid hydrogen is at its coldest minus 423 degrees 
fahrenheit 
he said nasa should have checked columbia more thoroughly after 
hydrogen leaks first were detected in may 
new fuel lines were installed between the orbiter and external 
fuel tank before the second launch attempt but hydrogen still 
escaped into the engine compartment 
two leaky components in the compartment were replaced last week 
but that reduced the leakage there by only a third

butte county accepted an 111 million 
state bailout to avoid becoming the first county in the nation to 
declare bankruptcy but warned that more danger lies ahead 
the board of supervisors voted 32 tuesday to accept gov george 
deukmejians emergency offer of money to balance the countys 155 
million budget 
the tax base in mostly agricultural butte in northern california 
is buckling under costly welfare and health care programs in june 
voters rejected several tax increases 
county officials said the bailout could allow for minimal wage 
increases for county workers and for the hiring of more than a 
dozen sheriffs deputies 
the lack of revenue had forced the elimination of 23 jobs at the 
sheriffs department libary closings longer delays at county 
offices and fewer firefighters because of a fouryear freeze on 
salaries 15 workers in buttes welfare department qualify for 
benefits themselves 
however county administrative officer will randolph said butte 
county faces a 25 million deficit in 1991 
were only putting off the inevitable he said 
the bailout agreement culminated weeks of acrimonious 
negotiations between the county and the governors office the 
supervisors had earlier said they could not accept less than 141 
million to balance the budget 
county authorities maintained they had no money to carry out 
stateordered programs the governor suggested the county had 
failed to manage its money properly 
even before the plan won approval butte county officials 
cautioned that another budget shortage is looming and urged other 
strapped counties to declare bankruptcy as a protest against the 
state 
we need to put together some kind of plan for the abcs of 
county survival supervisor haskel mcinturf said i would call 
it the alliance of bankrupt counties 
christina cutshaw spokeswoman for the county supervisors 
association of california said that there are at least 15 
counties right behind butte facing hardships aggravated by 
statemandated programs annexations incorporations and big 
increases in jail operations 
the governor agreed to defer more than 63 million owed the 
state for fire protection postpone the states demand for payment 
of a 2 million matching share for a new jail and grant 115 
million in cash 
the bailout also calls for the county to raise 165 million by 
increasing fees including those involving property tax collections 
and jail booking 
butte county ranks last among the states 58 counties in the 
amount spent per capita on local government county officials say 
85 percent of their budget is locked into existing programs 
mandated by law such as firefighting welfare and health care for 
the poor

oklahoma has gone where no state has gone 
before by slapping a limit on how long state lawmakers may serve 
by a 21 margin voters tuesday approved a constitutional 
amendment to put a lifetime cap of 12 years on legislative service 
the amendment takes effect jan 1 legislators now in office will 
be allowed to serve 12 more years 
in final unofficial returns yes votes outnumbered nos 
by 436347 to 212318 or 67 percent to 33 percent it was 
democracy in action said the proposals chief backer tulsa 
businessman lloy noble ii 
it is the first time a state has enacted such a limit colorado 
and california will vote on limits nov 6 and similar legislation 
has been introduced in florida and new york the national council 
of state legislatures said 
noble argued that the limit was needed to keep legislators from 
becoming entrenched in office and beholden to special interests 
instead of the people 
it is time to put limits on the professional politicians he 
said 
opponents contended that the ballot box already provided the 
remedy only 16 members of the 48member state senate and 14 of the 
101 house members had 12 or more years of service at the end of the 
1990 legislative session 
sen ben brown doklahoma city complained that the amendment 
took away basic rights of representation and turned more power over 
to bureaucrats who stay in office while elected officials come and 
go 
by voting the way they did we have taken away one of the 
basic rights the framers of the constitution had provided and have 
given it to the rich and powerful he said 
the amendment will tilt the government he said everyone 
complains about the bureaucracy but this is going to put it more 
in power the thomas jeffersons who designed our system of 
government meant for it to change gradually this will cause it to 
change rapidly 
brown said he was not personally affected by the amendment i 
have served 10 years and frankly i dont know whether im even 
going to seek reelection in two years he said 
from the outset most observers had predicted the measure would 
pass particularly after voters approved an amendment in 1989 that 
sharply limited the time the legislature can remain in session

the dollar closed higher against the japanese yen 
in tokyo wednesday while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
fell slightly 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 
15865 points or 066 percent to close at 2372617 
on tuesday the nikkei index fell to 2330831 its lowest level 
this year before recovering to 2388482 down 48078 points or 
197 percent 
the dollar closed wednesday at 13805 up 037 yen from 
tuesdays close trading ranged between 13805 yen and 13885 yen 
the us currency started trading at 13835 yen up 067 yen from 
tuesdays close of 13768 yen 
in bond dealings the yield of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds closed at 8560 percent the same as 
tuesday after trading at higher rates most of the day the closing 
price also was the same as tuesday at 8123 points 
bargainhunting helped push up the index wednesday morning 
despite a mood of pessimism and uncertainty traders said the 
market rose steadily but dipped down again toward the end of the 
morning session 
there is still a bearish feeling in general said toru kanai 
of new japan securities 
the dollars higher opening in tokyo followed its increase in 
new york where it gained 120 yen closing at 13775 yen 
the currency dropped against major european currencies after the 
us government reported its foreign trade deficit had climbed to 
933 billion in july from junes revised 534 billion the 
shortfall was nearly 2 billion greater than predicted 
but the dollar fell against the yen only briefly said a dealer 
with the bank of tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the dollar is strengthening against the yen which is being 
sold against the european currencies especially the german mark 
she said 
she said however that the current strength of the dollar does 
not mean it has reversed its recent downtrend because the slowdown 
in the us economy remains a negative factor 
investors have been making technical adjustments because they 
have overbought the yen against the dollar and european 
currencies she said 
other dealers said tuesdays august us consumer price report 
which showed a 08percent increase has lowered expectations of a 
nearterm fall in us interest rates helping the dollars 
recovery against the yen 
continuing weakness in the japanese bond market also discouraged 
yenbuying they said

millioncirculation daily of the communist youth league 
it also will appear in this weeks literaturnaya gazeta the 
respected cultural weekly 
the commentary represents yet another step in solzhenitsyns 
official reemergence in the soviet union 
his longbanned books are being published in the nation that 
expelled him in 1974 for treason and last month president mikhail 
s gorbachev ordered his citizenship restored 
however solzhenitsyn has rebuffed an invitation to return from 
exile 
we have to admit that the whole 20th century has been cruelly 
lost by our country he wrote in the commentary the 
achievements that we were shouting about are all imaginary from a 
flourishing state we have been thrown back to a halfsavage state 
we are bankrupt 
solzhenitsyn chose to address the russian people as secessionist 
forces threaten to pull the soviet union apart and parliament 
grapples with proposals for scrapping communism and embracing free 
enterprise and private property 
he calls for a return to private ownership but he also urges 
rejection of capitalist exploitation and western cultural 
garbage 
solzhenitsyn advocates forming a russian union of the 
republics of russia byelorussia and the ukraine the other 12 
soviet republic have different cultures and should be allowed to 
secede he said 
to keep the great empire dooms people to death 
byelorussia and the ukraine should not be tied to russia by 
force but to divide the ukraine from russia means to cut through 
millions of families brothers dont let us have such cruel 
separation he wrote 
at tuesdays session of the supreme soviet parliament many 
legislators were seen reading in their seats the tract by the man 
who described life in soviet prison camps in books such as one 
day in the life of ivan denisovich and the gulag archipelago 
while praising gorbachev for setting a new course solzhenitsyn 
lashed out against communism and its legacy and cautioned that 
anarchy could strike the soviet union as it emerges from decades of 
totalitarianism 
we shouldnt be trapped as our grandfathers and fathers of 
1917 were we shouldnt become a toy of tempting slogans and 
eloquent speakers he wrote 
solzhenitsyn praised the powerful presidency that has been 
created by gorbachev saying it will be helpful for quite a long 
period 
he wrote in favor of supporting and protecting small 
enterprises and argued against monopolies he said collective 
farms should be broken up and the land returned to private farmers 
private ownership of land guarantees longterm 
improvement rather than exhaustion of the soil and only with it 
can we be sure that our agriculture will not move backward 
solzhenitsyn wrote 
he cautioned however against letting foreigners buy russian 
land and forests 
we shouldnt tempt western capital with conditions beneficial 
for it and humiliating for us we will not be able to correct 
the results of such a sale and we will turn into a colony he 
said 
he also repeated his longheld abhorrence of materialism 
disdain for western mass culture and belief that a democratic 
society can exist under a powerful leader 
solzhenitsyn spoke against atheism urged women to return to the 
home and raise children and called for textbooks to be revised or 
thrown away 
he said russian youth by emulating those in the west were 
being led in the direction of a barbaric copying of something 
alien to us 
our historic iron curtain perfectly protected our country from 
everything good in the west from civilian freedom respect for 
personality the right of diverse personal activity 
but this curtain didnt extend to the very bottom and through 
this opening popmass culture and vulgar fashion has been 
leaking he said and this garbage has been greedily accepted 
by our deprived youth 
solzhenitsyn said any royalties he earns from the article will 
be given to victims of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident 
we should get down on bended knee before byelorussia and the 
ukraine for the chernobyl tragedy which happened because of the 
fools of the soviet system he said at least 31 died in the 
disaster

outspoken boston university president john silber shocked the 
massachusetts political establishment tuesday by winning the 
democratic nomination for governor over former state attorney 
general francis bellotti 
silber known for a series of controversial statements known as 
silber shockers will face former federal prosecutor william 
weld in the november general election 
in oklahoma voters approved a firstinthenation 
constitutional amendment limiting legislators to no more than 12 
years in office runoff elections for oklahoma governor went down 
to the wire in both parties democrat david walters and republican 
bill price each won by 51to49 percent margins 
in both massachusetts and oklahoma tuesdays elections followed 
unusually spirited primary campaigns the incumbent governors 
michael dukakis in massachusetts and henry bellmon in oklahoma 
are both stepping down 
the massachusetts primary which was waged against the backdrop 
of a failing state economy and a governor who had tumbled from near 
president to political neerdowell featured some unusually 
barbed broadsides between bellotti and silber 
lt gov evelyn murphy was listed on the democratic ballot 
despite having dropped out of the race following an attempted 
mutiny against dukakis 
silber had been considered an underdog to bellotti who won the 
endorsement at the june democratic state convention and has led in 
political polls through most of the campaign but silber had 
attracted increasing attention with his blunt shootfromthehip 
style 
with 75 percent of the precincts reporting silber had 389408 
votes or 53 percent to bellottis 323727 votes or 44 percent 
murphy had 21275 votes or 3 percent 
this has got to be a shocker by any definition former us 
sen paul tsongas said as silber sustained his lead 
with 73 percent of the precincts reporting in the republican 
race weld had defeated house minority leader stephen pierce by 
182399 votes to 119756 votes 60 percent to 40 percent 
under the democrats who have controlled our state government 
for the past several years massachusetts has lost its way weld 
declared to cheering supporters 
it appeared that voters agreed attorney general james shannon 
and both the majority leader and speaker of the massachusetts 
statehouse were among the victims of what appeared to be strong 
sentiment against the democratic political establishment 
in a republican us senate primary real estate developer james 
rappaport defeated businessman dan daly and will challenge 
democratic us sen john kerry with 64 percent of the precincts 
reporting in that race rappaport had 154387 votes or 66 percent 
to dalys 79439 votes or 34 percent 
in oklahoma both parties held runoffs to complete the process 
begun in an aug 28 primary 
with all precincts counted in the democratic runoff walters 
the partys 1986 nominee had slipped past us rep wes watkins by 
fewer than 7000 votes 242997 to 236181 
in the republican race price won by even fewer votes he 
received 94588 to businessman vince orzas 91542 both men are 
newcomers to politics 
price who was beaten badly in the regular primary by orza 
said its been a long trail but this comeback tonight has to be 
one of the greatest comebacks in the annals of oklahoma political 
history 
it is just absolutely incredible he told cheering 
supporters in oklahoma city 
for the ballot question there were 436347 yes votes to 
limit legislative service and 212318 no votes a 67to33 
percent margin 
in washington state state supreme court justice richard guy was 
elected to the high court bench beating back a challenge from 
former republican gov john spellman guy had been appointed to the 
bench with 81 percent of the precincts counted guy had 257789 
votes and spellman had 212841 
 
in massachusetts nearly everyone seemed to be running against 
dukakis for whom the loss to george bush in the 1988 presidential 
campaign was just the beginning of a political career gone sour 
no one it seemed wanted to be associated with the man once 
credited with presiding over the massachusetts miracle this 
time the catchphrase of the campaign was the massachusetts 
mutiny the tag given to murphys attempted coup 
the lieutenant governor tried to impose her own fiscal solutions 
after dukakis left on a trade mission to europe earlier this month 
nothing came of it except the collapse of murphys already failing 
campaign 
bellotti who won murphys endorsement after she dropped out 
appealed to voters as an experienced politician who could 
straighten up the fiscal mess silber contended her withdrawal made 
bellotti the candidate of the political establishment 
in making his first bid for public office silber didnt tone 
down his style the silber shocker that may have caused the 
biggest furor came when he suggested during a debate that the state 
may want to ration health care when youve had a long life and 
youre ripe then its time to go he said 
last week asked about giving a crime control speech in an 
innercity neighborhood silber said there was no point addressing 
a group of drug addicts 
weld portrayed pierce as someone who failed to bring about 
change during his six terms in the legislature pierce focused on 
welds wealth touting himself as the more electable candidate 
the oklahoma primary campaign was the states most expensive in 
history on both sides watkins who is leaving congress after seven 
terms listed 18 million in contributions walters listed more 
than 1 million 
the latest campaign reports showed price nearing 1 million in 
expenditures including 435000 of his own money orza reported 
about 315000 including 150000 of his own funds

sri lankas security forces have in recent months 
killed hundreds of civilians during raids on villages where rebels 
operate amnesty international said today 
entire communities have been attacked in retaliation for 
opposition violence the international human rights group said in a 
report 
many people have been arbitrarily rounded up and sometimes 
killed on the basis of anonymous accusations of subversive 
involvement it said 
in june government soldiers who had regained control of the 
town of kalmunai after separatist tamil tigers left it rounded up 
many young men stabbed them to death with bayonets and burned 
their bodies in shops the report says 
indeed the government appears to condone the summary killing 
of suspected tamil tiger members 
as many as 30000 people are believed to have died in 1988 and 
1989 in the south of sri lanka where the government faced 
sinhalese rebels the report says those rebels oppose the 
sinhalesedominated governments offer of autonomy to the tamils in 
an effort to end the separatist fighting 
although reports of extrajudicial executions and 
disappearances in southern sri lanka diminished after march 1990 
they did not cease and intimidation and death threats by 
government forces continued amnesty said 
with the renewed heavy fighting between government and the 
tamil tigers in the northeast since june amnesty international 
fears the pervasive pattern of violations is continuing the 
report says 
the human rights group said the sinhalese extremist peoples 
liberation front tamil separatists and the indian peacekeeping 
force deployed in sri lanka between 1987 and 1990 were all guilty 
of serious human rights abuses 
in the south where the dominant group is sinhalese the 
government is opposed by the peoples liberation front in the 
northeast the liberation tigers of tamil eelam or tamil tigers 
are fighting for a separate tamil state 
fighting continues in the northeast and more than 300000 
people have fled their homes in the jaffna district amnesty said 
since 1987 the report said the united national party 
government of president ranasinghe premadasa had apparently allowed 
its security forces to ruthlessly suppress armed opposition 
thousands of people have disappeared or been killed at the 
hands of security forces in recent years in the south and hundreds 
more have fallen victim to this violence in the latest wave of 
repression in the northeast amnesty international said 
since 1987 the security forces had killed under many guises in 
uniform in plainclothes operations attributed to vigilantes 
and in death squads amnesty said

the huge mens central jail packed with 
thousands of county prisoners was an unlikely place for charles h 
keating jr to end up 
the 66yearold keating has been an athlete pilot crusader 
against pornography lawyer presidential commission member 
associate of lawmakers real estate developer millionaire 
businessman and philanthropist 
keating surrendered tuesday to face a 42count indictment 
alleging fraudulent sales of worthless junk bonds to thousands of 
elderly investors through his collapsed lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine 
a judge ordered him held on 5 million bail next stop was the 
huge los angeles county jail amid factories rail tracks and 
wrecking yards east of downtown he joined 6700 other prisoners 
there 
we keep it under the federal limits but just barely hal 
grant a sheriffs spokesman said of the jails population 
keating who controlled lincoln as chairman of american 
continental corp of phoenix ariz was born dec 4 1923 to a 
prominent cincinnati family with strong connections to the 
republican party 
he became an accomplished competitive swimmer served in the 
navy as a fighter pilot and emerged in public life in the late 
1950s as a vigorous opponent of pornography a campaign he 
continued for three decades 
president nixon appointed him in 1970 to the federal commission 
on obscenity and pornography 
one of his first actions was to sue to prevent publication of a 
commission report until he could write a dissent to the conclusion 
that pornography did not pose a threat 
keating gained business experience as a vice president and 
director of american financial corp billionaire carl h lindners 
banking insurance real estate and meatpacking empire 
but it was there he had his first misadventure with federal 
regulators 
the securities exchange commission claimed the pair fraudulently 
diverted company assets to their own use in 1979 keating signed a 
consent decree admitting no wrongdoing but promising not to do it 
again 
he later claimed that signature cost him an appointment by 
president reagan as ambassador to the bahamas 
in the mid1970s keating had become the head of an american 
financial homebuilding subsidiary continental homes inc of 
phoenix he bought it out in 1978 and renamed it american 
continental corp keating then became known for his large 
contributions to politicians at every level 
lincoln was purchased by keating in 1984 for 51 million what 
was once a traditional home mortgage lender soon came under the 
scrutiny of federal thrift regulators they said its heavy 
investments in speculative real estate deals and junk bonds were 
combined with accounting gimmickry to hide losses that ultimately 
may cost taxpayers 2 billion 
lincoln was seized by the home loan bank board last year two 
years after examiners recommended that action critics contend 
keating and associates kept regulators at bay with heavy donations 
to politicians 
keating who says he is now broke has maintained the seizure 
was unnecessary drove american continental corp into bankruptcy 
and stemmed from regulators anger over his vocal criticism of them 
as incompetent

the us syphilis rate has risen 34 percent since 
1981 to its highest level in 40 years suggesting precautions 
spurred by the aids outbreak have waned scientists reported today 
a separate study also in todays journal of the american medical 
association said the most common inexpensive methods of treating 
gonorrhea should be abandoned because of sharp rises in both the 
penicillinresistant and tetracyclineresistant strains of the 
disease 
in the first study researchers at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta said the biggest increase in syphilis was among 
blacks the rate among blacks more than doubled between 1985 and 
1989 to 1218 cases from 526 cases per 100000 people they said 
in contrast syphilis rates among white males have dropped 69 
percent since 1982 the disease rate for white females remained low 
and unchanged 
overall 184 of every 100000 americans were treated for 
syphilis last year up from the 137 cases per 100000 treated in 
1981 the study showed last years rate was higher than at any 
time since 1949 
the rate has risen most sharply in the past four years which 
may reflect a decline in concern about aids researchers said 
obviously the message has not gotten out to certain groups 
said one of the studys authors dr allyn k nakashima of the 
cdcs division of sexually transmitted diseases 
researchers said the higher rate among blacks may be linked to a 
higher incidence of drug abuse poverty and homelessness this is 
just one more problem that can be attached to that disenfranchised 
group nakashima said 
the gonorrhea study found that although the incidence of the 
disease has decreased since 1975 infections caused by strains 
resistant to treatment with penicillin and tetracycline are a 
growing problem 
in the 198788 study researchers examined 6204 cases from 21 
clinics nationwide and 21 percent showed potential for resistance 
to both treatments as well as to two other oftenused drugs 
cefoxitin and spectinomycin 
the cdc recommends gonorrhea be treated with ceftriaxone which 
is at least seven times more expensive than common treatments and 
is the only treatment that works on all of the diseases strains 
said the studys primary author dr sandra k schwarcz

the broadway production of miss saigon 
canceled in a dispute over the casting of a white actor as a 
eurasian pimp will arrive in new york next spring as originally 
scheduled 
producer cameron mackintosh made the decision after reaching an 
agreement with actors equity over the casting of other roles in 
the musical which is a hit in london 
the union leadership in a meeting described as tense and tough 
approved the pact monday 
in a statement mackintosh and the union said the producer 
acknowledges equitys efforts to improve equal employment 
opportunities for its ethnic members and he and his creative team 
support that goal 
mackintosh had scrapped the 10 million musical on aug 8 the 
day after actors equity barred white englishman jonathan pryce 
from repeating in new york his portrayal of the eurasian brothel 
owner the union which has veto power over foreign actors in the 
united states said it would be offensive to cast a white in the 
role 
the ban stirred debate over colorblind casting and minority 
opportunities on stage and the union later reversed itself 
but mackintosh sought assurances that he would have a free hand 
in other casting decisions for the musical a love story set during 
the closing days of the vietnam war of the nearly 50 performers in 
the large cast some 34 roles are played by ethnic minority actors 
including 27 asians 
equity and the producer began meetings on sept 6 
the agreement according to the new york times lets the 
producer use two nonamerican asian actors in the broadway 
production for one year he must request permission to bring over 
lea salonga a filipino who plays the leading female role in the 
london production 
mackintosh also will agree not to use yellowface makeup or 
facial devices designed to simulate asian eyes in any american 
production and to make an effort to recruit asianamerican actors 
for lesser roles in the show 
the producer also will seek minority performers for two of his 
longrunning hits on broadway and on the road the phantom of the 
opera and les miserables 
miss saigon had sold a record 25 million in advance tickets 
before the cancellation

indians brawled with canadian troops 
who were seizing weapons at a mohawk reservation and soldiers 
fired tear gas to disperse the crowd at least 82 people were hurt 
officials said 
dozens of men women and children jumped into the cold st 
lawrence river on tuesday to escape the stinging gas 
mohawks punched and kicked soldiers who used rifle butts and 
fists in the brawl after the indians intervened during the 
searchandseizure operation at the kahnawake reservation by the 
military and quebec provincial police 
it was one of the most violent clashes since the mohawk standoff 
began more than two months ago over plans by the city of oka 18 
miles west of montreal to build a golf course extension on what 
the indians say is tribal land 
the federal government has since bought the disputed land in an 
attempt o settle the quarrel but some mohawk activists have held 
out for settlement of other grievances including demands for 
greater sovereignty 
eight helicopters and about 100 troops took part in the raid on 
tekakwitha island 
maj rusty bassarab a military spokesman said the raid netted 
about 50 weapons ranging from shotguns and handguns to hunting 
rifles and ak47 assault rifles the weapons wrapped in plastic 
were found under rocks in the forest and were taken out by 
helicopter 
but mohawks struck back one soldier was dragged to the ground 
punched kicked and struck repeatedly on the head with his own 
helmet 
bassarab said between five and seven soldiers were injured by 
the mohawks 
the soldiers fired several volleys of submachinegun fire into 
the air and then shot tear gas pointblank into the crowd forcing 
them back dozens of people jumped into the river to evade the 
fumes 
about 75 people including several children were treated at the 
nearby kateri memorial hospital for tear gas and released 
dr louis montour medical director of the hospital said a 
15yearold girl with a possible fractured hip and a 24yearold 
man with a possible fractured knee were sent to montreal general 
hospital by ambulance 
the clash at the reserve on the south shore of the st lawrence 
river shifted attention away from kahnesatake near oka where the 
military has surrounded about 50 mohawks in a drug and alcohol 
treatment center 
mike myers an american chief who is trying to reach a 
settlement in the oka standoff said tuesday night that the battle 
in kahnawake is certainly toughening the attitude of the mohawks 
in kahnesatake 
the mohawks had erected barricades in front of approaches to the 
mercier bridge a major commuter link to montreal after the july 
11 botched provincial police raid on an indian roadblock at the 
mohawk settlement in kahnesatake 
a police officer was killed in the july assault which was 
launched to enforce a court order that the oka roadblock be 
dismantled 
troops dismantled the oka roadblock after the mercier bridge 
barricades were removed by troops and mohawks late last month

a brick facade that collapsed on a busy 
sidewalk killing three people and injuring eight apparently was 
improperly anchored and was pulled down by signs and iron shutters 
attached to it officials say 
don kligerman commissioner of the department of licenses and 
inspections said the accident tuesday could lead to criminal 
charges 
the twostory facade of two storefronts gave way shortly before 
230 pm between 9th and 10th streets on market street one of the 
citys main arteries 
among the 11 passersby caught in the collapse were four police 
officers walking a beat two of the injured were seriously hurt 
it happened so fast you couldnt see anything said alom 
kadosh manager of a stereo store but as soon as it happened 
people went outside and everybody pitched in to help pull off the 
bricks and the metal that covered the people that had been trapped 
underneath 
neil daniel was trying to fix his car when he heard a rumble and 
screams 
i looked up and saw a wall of bricks coming at me and all i 
could do was close my eyes he said 
the cause of the accident was under investigation but 
authorities said they believed the wall was not properly anchored 
to the 19thcentury building 
it appears the weight of signs and security gates may have 
caused the collapse but it will have to be checked by engineers 
said fire commissioner roger ulshafer 
kligerman said the owners of the building were cited in june for 
putting up the sign over a checkcashing agency without obtaining a 
zoning permit he said the sign apparently extended too far over 
the sidewalk the case has not reached court 
the cumulative effect of that sign the iron shutters and the 
wall that was just free standing it was really just a matter of 
time until it fell over kligerman said 
it was not immediately clear who owned the building 
three of the injured died on arrival at a hospital a woman and 
a man of crushed chests another woman of head injuries 
the husband of one of the dead was listed in critical condition 
with a broken pelvis and facial bones and a man was in serious 
condition with chest and head injuries

an excia agent who acted as a middleman in the 
irancontra affair faces up to 16 years in prison and 1 million in 
fines after being convicted of hiding arms profits from us tax 
collectors 
a jury deliberated 3 hours tuesday before convicting thomas g 
clines 61 of understating his earnings on his 1985 and 1986 
returns and failing to disclose his foreign financial accounts 
the middleburg va man bought and arranged shipments of 
machine guns rifles grenades and explosives to nicaraguas contra 
rebels 
sentencing was set for oct 31 
clines made at least 882953 during the twoyear affair but 
understated the amount by at least 260440 the internal revenue 
service said 
he also kept some of his profits in a swiss account that should 
have been reported to the irs government witnesses said 
prosecutors depicted clines as a sophisticated international 
businessman who reported only the arms deal profits he thought the 
irs would find out about 
defense attorney paula m junghans said clines misunderstood or 
was unfamiliar with the rules 
witnesses testified that clines was in the arms business with 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord and his iranian 
business partner albert hakim 
the irancontra scandal involved the covert sale of arms to iran 
and efforts to supply weapons to the contras at a time when 
congress banned such assistance

pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the 
irancontra congressional committees he was placed on two years 
probation

gen wojciech jaruzelski who as communist 
leader tried to crush solidarity in 1981 and all but surrendered 
power last year will step down down early as president his office 
announced today 
the move will allow poland the first east bloc country to oust 
ruling communists when a solidarityled government was formed last 
year to complete its transition to democracy with the popular 
election of a president 
on monday solidarity chairman lech walesa became the first 
person declare his candidacy for the post prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki is also known to be considering a bid for president 
parliament is to begin debate thursday on a schedule for the 
elections which are expected as early as this fall and no later 
than the spring 
jaruzelskis announcement came a day after he met with walesa 
and mazowiecki and they agreed on accelerating plans for holding 
postcommunist polands first fully democratic general elections 
the current parliament elected last year includes holdovers 
from the old regime who as part of a political compromise took 
seats without a challenge at the polls 
a spokesman for jaruzelski said in a statement that the general 
wishes parliament to enable him to transfer the office he holds 
to a president chosen in a general election 
jaruzelski was elected to a sixyear term as president by 
parliament in july 1989 with some support from solidarity members 
largely to smooth relations with the soviet union in the early 
months of democratic change 
but it became increasingly apparent as his former political 
opponents took control of government that he would not serve much 
of the term 
the solidarityled government took power in september and the 
communist party dissolved itself in january 
jaruzelski who had interned walesa and mazowiecki along with 
thousands of other labor activists when he imposed martial law is 
technically empowered as president to run the army the police and 
the nations foreign policy 
but he has taken a backseat role and never interfered with the 
solidarityled overhaul of polands government and economy 
the struggle over governing poland is now among people who once 
joined together to challenge jaruzelski 
walesa has broken with mazowiecki and some other former 
solidarity allies in government over the pace of change he says 
too many members of the ousted communist regime are still in 
positions of authority and ought to be removed 
a public opinion poll conducted sept 34 and published tuesday 
showed mazowiecki was supported for president by 48 percent of 
those surveyed compared with 37 percent for walesa the rest had 
no opinion 
the poll also showed a drop in confidence in the government to 
61 percent from 82 percent in january when sweeping 
marketoriented reform went into effect that caused higher prices 
and unemployment in the shift to capitalism 
the statement issued by jaruzelskis spokesman referred to 
tuesdays meeting and said the president would forward a letter to 
the speaker of the parliaments lower house asking that a date be 
set for ending his term 
participants in tuesdays meeting suggested jaruzelski resign no 
later than dec 13 the ninth anniversary of the day he declared 
martial law to try to crush the solidarity movement the gazeta 
wyborcza newspaper reported today 
the 67yearold jaruzelski remains a complex figure in polands 
political life some credit him with preventing a warsaw pact 
invasion and bloodshed by having polish forces crack down on 
solidarity 
he is also is the only communist leader in the east bloc to stay 
in office aftr democratic change 
jaruzelski joined the polish communist party in 1947 rising 
through the ranks until he was appointed defense minister in 1968 
in 1981 as poland was being rocked by labor unrest jaruzelski 
was named first secretary of the communist party the only career 
military officer to rise to supreme power in the east bloc 
although he has spoken of the very painful decision to 
impose martial law he has never repudiated the declaration 
leaving open the question of whether a patriotic wish to avoid 
soviet intervention or loyalty to the kremlin prompted the decree

john silber boston universitys blunt and caustic 
president upset former state attorney general francis bellotti for 
the democratic nomination for governor as voters swept out 
candidates with ties to gov michael s dukakis 
silber who was all but written off a week ago for referring to 
an innercity neighborhood as a group of drug addicts will 
face republican william weld a former federal prosecutor in 
november 
in oklahoma voters on tuesday approved a firstinthenation 
constitutional amendment limiting state lawmakers to 12 years in 
office in runoff elections for the gubernatorial nomination 
democrat david walters and republican bill price slipped past their 
opponents by as few as 3046 votes 
it is time to put limits on the professional politicians 
said businessman lloyd noble ii chief backer of the limit on 
legislative careers 
both men in oklahoma were newcomers to politics as was silber 
in massachusetts where the native texan styled himself a political 
outsider and stunned the state democratic establishment in winning 
there was a tidal wave coming and we happened to be standing 
on the beach when it hit massachusetts attorney general james 
shannon said after losing his reelection bid 
shannon and bellotti were among several democrats with ties to 
the dukakis administration who were swept away amid the states 
inability to come to grips with a crumbling economy dukakis like 
republican gov henry bellmon of oklahoma is stepping down 
with 93 percent of the precincts reporting silber had 520926 
votes or 54 percent to bellottis 423390 votes or 44 percent 
lt gov evelyn murphy had 27546 votes or 3 percent she was on 
the democratic ballot despite having dropped out following a mutiny 
against dukakis in which she tried to take control of the states 
finances while he was in europe 
weld also won an outsiders victory in the gop primary 
defeating house minority leader steven pierce an early favorite 
with 93 percent of the vote in weld had 245179 votes or 60 
percent and pierce 163508 votes or 40 percent 
silber a 64yearold shootfromthehip educator whose drug 
addicts remark was one of his trademark silber shockers said 
he would continue to emphasize his 19 years as bu president as 
experience that qualifies him to change the ailing state 
government 
the choice is between leadership proven by experience or more 
of the same silber told cheering supporters at his victory 
party have you had enough i think you have then join me in 
taking back our government 
weld said only republicans would provide the change voters want 
massachusetts has lost its way weld 45 told jubilant 
backers politicians on beacon hill have grown arrogant and 
cynical they see the taxpayers as a limitless source of cash with 
which to feather their own nests or fund their latest 
experiments 
in the other major statewide contest businessman james 
rappaport who spent 2 million of his own money on his first major 
campaign easily defeated dan daly for the right to oppose 
democratic incumbent john kerry in the us senate race in 
november 
in oklahoma voters approved the limit on lawmakers tenure by a 
21 margin the amendment takes effect jan 1 lawmakers now in 
office will be allowed to serve 12 more years 
in the gubernatorial race walters the democrats 1986 nominee 
slipped past us rep wes watkins 242997 votes to 236181 the 
republican nominee price won by even less beating businessman 
vince orza 94588 to 91542 
youve heard me say this before its time to put someone 
different in the governors office said walters who overcame 
controversy in 1986 about a 162500 loan that was the subject of 
an ethics complaint 
in washington state former republican gov john spellmans 
political comeback fell short he lost in his bid to unseat state

an appeals court ruled a member of the 
ku klux klan can keep her aryan1 personalized license plate 
because state law prohibits obscene or profane words but not 
inflammatory ones 
it was the latest ruling in a fouryear legal battle over a 
plate owned by mary e carr a member of the missouri klan 
the state department of revenue which issues license plates 
said tuesdays ruling by the state court of appeals could lead to 
problems with plates that contain racist or derogatory terms 
duane benton the departments director said an appeal to the 
missouri supreme court is being considered 
neither ms carr nor richard petrofsky an american civil 
liberties union lawyer representing her could be reached for 
comment 
after a complaint from the antidefamation league of the bnai 
brith the revenue department ordered ms carr in september 1986 
to surrender the license plate it had issued three months earlier 
the department argued that under state law license plates cannot 
be profane obscene or conflict with an overriding public 
policy benton said his office has used the publicpolicy 
exception to deny objectionable plates and avoid problems 
encountered in other states 
discrimination is illegal and a racist plate violates that 
public policy the state argued aryan was used by the nazis to 
describe a superior race and is a racist word when used on a klan 
car it said 
but the appeals court said benton went beyond his authority and 
state law in denying the plate

direct ship travel will be allowed between 
china and taiwan for the first time since 1949 under an agreement 
to repatriate mainland chinese who enter taiwan illegally the red 
cross announced today 
the new operation will replace existing repatriation which has 
been criticized as inhumane and dangerous illegal immigrants had 
been sent back to china on the often rickety fishing boats that 
brought them to taiwan 
at least 46 chinese illegal immigrants have died in accidents 
during forced repatriations over the last two months 
under the agreement vessels painted with red cross flags will 
carry illegal immigrants directly from the nationalistheld matsu 
islet 10 miles to mawei a port near fuzhou in the chinese province 
of fujian 
we all agree the repatriation should be done with concerns for 
humanitarianism safety and convenience chen changwen 
secretary general of taiwans red cross association told a news 
conference 
the new repatriation is scheduled to begin in october and will 
mark the first time boats have legally sailed between taiwan and 
china since 1949 when nationalists fled to taiwan after losing a 
civil war to the communists 
chen said a fivemember delegation of chinas red cross 
association discussed the issue with its taiwanese counterpart in a 
twoday meeting on taiwans quemoy island last week 
officials said more than 10000 illegal immigrants from china 
seeking jobs in taiwan have been caught and repatriated since 1987 
when the nationalists relaxed a policy to allow private contacts 
between taiwanese and chinese 
thousands of taiwanese have also journeyed to the mainland 
usually entering china through hong kong or japan taiwanese have 
also invested billions of dollars in chinas economy still the 
nationalist government continues to reject official contacts with 
its rival government in beijing

an army paratrooper suffered a 
superficial leg wound today when struck by shrapnel from a 
misguided artillery shell during livefire exercises in the saudi 
desert 
the 105mm struck sand and exploded about 100 yards from an 
infantry platoon from the 82nd airborne division that was lying in 
the sand to prepare for firing exercises 
one of the soldiers identified by others in the platoon as pvt 
gustavo torres of puerto rico was struck in the right calf by a 
piece of shrapnel from the artillery shell 
torres was treated at the scene the wound required only 
cleaning and bandaging and stayed while his unit completed its 
training 
lt col ned spohn the commander of the artillery battery that 
fired the shell speculated that human error was to blame for the 
shot but said it was also possible the howitzer had suddenly 
shifted in the desert sand 
spohn was using a handheld satellite position locator to chart 
the exact location of the platoon and the shell as part of the 
armys investigation 
the accident was witnessed by a dozen reporters and 
photographers at the firing range to watch the exercises

the head of a san francisco bay area 
crisis center says shes gratified oakland police will reopen about 
200 rape cases after admitting they blundered by dropping numerous 
investigations 
i think theyre trying said marcia blackstock executive 
director of bay area women against rape theyve been really 
candid with me that they really messed up and need to make some 
changes 
the police department announced monday it would reopen the 
sexual assault cases after an investigation showed that nearly one 
in four oakland female complainants had her case thrown out as 
unfounded 
candidly we blew it police chief george hart said i 
think we got into a procedure there that was contrary to the way we 
want to do business 
hart said police would take immediate action to correct the 
problem 
a police audit of the departments rape investigations came 
after a probe by the san francisco examiner showed that nearly one 
in four women who reported a rape to oakland police last year had 
her case tossed out as being without merit thats 2 times the 
rate of any other major california city 
of the 967 rape cases reported to oakland police between 1989 
and the first half of this year 203 were classified as unfounded 
the internal audit which included every rape case in the city 
during the past two years found 37 cases in which detectives filed 
a report away as if it had never happened without once contacting 
the victim 
in addition the department plans to contact 166 other women who 
reported rapes but whose cases police dropped even though the cases 
did not meet the us justice departments criteria for 
unfounding a case 
some cases were declared unfounded if the victims were 
prostitutes if drugs were involved in the incident or if the 
victim was uncooperative with officers or could not be contacted 
police capt jim hahn said the audit indicates that more than 
half of the 203 cases may have been improperly declared without 
merit 
hahn who heads the departments criminal investigations 
division said the audit reveals that police had not thoroughly 
investigated the cases before deeming them unfounded 
i have instructed my investigators that everybody all 
victims on all unfounded cases will be recontacted hahn said 
oakland police have six sexual assault investigators who handled 
585 reported cases last year by comparison san francisco had 
eight detectives handling 385 cases last year 
though hart there were no plans to increase the number of sexual 
assault investigators hahn said he might rotate sergeants through 
the sexcrimes unit so that a higher number of investigators would 
on hand to handle such cases

west german authorities plan to arrest 
suspected east german spies after the two countries unite on oct 
3 the federal prosecutors office said today 
lutz stavenhagen a top official in the chancellors office in 
bonn said that up to 8000 east germans could be apprehended the 
exact number was not certain 
the announcement came after government officials in bonn ruled 
out any amnesty for the spy corps before oct 3 the day germans 
celebrate their unification 
in east berlin the interior ministry said it had stopped 
destroying secret police files that could incriminate hundreds of 
people 
on tuesday west germanys federal prosecutor alexander von 
stahl said east germanys exsecret police chief had set up 
meetings between palestinian guerrillas and a leftist west german 
terror gang 
grappling with the brutal legacy of the secret police called 
the stasi has become a national obsession in east germany in the 
last days of the countrys separate existence 
today von stahls spokesman rolf hannich said the prosecutor 
was legally required to issue arrest warrants for suspected stasi 
spies if there is no amnesty 
hannich declined to say how many suspected stasi spies could be 
arrested he said agents facing arrest will be those who are 
already under criminal investigations 
in addition to a dreaded interior security agency that kept tabs 
on millions of east germans the communist regimes stasi also ran 
a formidable network of agents abroad 
stavenhagen who is chancellor helmut kohls chief intelligence 
adviser said the number of arrests could strain the court system 
if there is no amnesty our officials would have to issue some 
7000 to 8000 arrest warrants over there immediately the courts 
would be totally overburdened the newspaper die welt quoted 
stavenhagen as saying 
in east berlin the interior ministry said it stopped destroying 
stasi files to put aside irritations however the ministry 
repeated its assertion that it had only been getting rid of 
duplicates 
since the fall of east german leader erich honecker in october 
1989 there have been constant disclosures about his communist 
governments alleged support of terrorism 
the latest such disclosure concerns imprisoned former secret 
police chief erich mielke 82 and his former deputy gerhard 
neiber 
both are suspected of having harbored members of west germanys 
leftist terrorist red army faction von stahl said tuesday he said 
a criminal investigation was under way 
proof of the allegations is contained in nearly 200 pages of 
documents seized from the former secret police von stahl said in a 
statement a spokesman hansjuergen foerster said it was too 
early to tell when or whether mielke or neiber will be brought to 
trial 
east german police working with their west german colleagues 
rounded up nine red army faction terrorist suspects in june they 
had been living in east germany under assumed names 
the red army faction has waged a deadly campaign against west 
german businesses military facilties and other targets 
von stahl in a television interview monday night said he 
believed east german secret police were involved in the bombing of 
west berlins la belle discotheque in april 1986 
that bombing led to the us air raids on the libyan cities of 
tripoli and benghazi 10 days later after washington blamed libya 
for the attack the la belle attack killed two us soldiers and a 
turkish woman 
the disco was a popular spot for american servicemen in west 
berlin 
in west berlin justice department spokesman cornel christoffel 
said the stasi had an inside agent who provided the east german 
secret police with information before the attack however he said 
he could not confirm that the stasi played an active role in the la 
belle bombing 
honecker himself is the target of several criminal 
investigations including one in west germany for obstruction of 
justice

the handmade national aids quilt vandalized for 
the first time in its threeyear history will be restored 
organizers said 
two teddy bears were cut from two of the four 12footby12foot 
sections of the quilt on display last week at the hotel 
intercontinental said jerry suarez chairman of the south florida 
names project 
the group set up the display in the hotel mezzanine in 
conjunction with the national conference of the council on 
foundations 
it was very difficult to explain how much this meant said 
aids activist shelley rappaport who had sewed one of the bears on 
for a friend who died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
its like would someone walk up to the vietnam war memorial and 
start scratching names off 
scott lago head of display marketing for the national names 
project which made the memorial quilt said sections of it have 
been displayed 257 times around the world this year but the quilt 
had never been vandalized before he said monday 
on saturday four sections of the quilt were to be taken down 
after the conference but on friday another group meeting at the 
hotel the club connection asked that the quilt sections be 
removed 
that group which bills itself as a selective singles group 
considered the display ugly said the hotels resident manager 
jurgen dinger 
a hotel employee then took down the quilt sections without 
consulting management dinger said 
suarez found the quilt wadded up in a closet saturday and he 
discovered two teddy bears had been cut 
its not just a teddy bear ms rappaport said its the 
only memorial i have thats why it hurts so much 
the other teddy bear wearing surgical gloves had been cut from 
the panel dedicated to suarezs father a doctor 
it didnt just come off suarez said you could tell 
someone took scissors to it 
both teddy bears will be sewn back on ms rappaport said

iraqs oil exports and blocking goods heading for the nation most 
countries including the united states have followed the 
sanctions 
iraq will also collect any interest accumulated by the sezied 
assets the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in nicosia 
the council headed by president saddam hussein is iraqs 
highest policymaking body it is the only body that can override 
iraqs national council or parliament 
the text made no mention of kuwait but earlier council 
decisions have stated that iraqi law applies to the emirate which 
baghdad annexed six days after the invasion 
the united states and britain froze iraqi and kuwaiti assets 
immediately after the invasion other countries including all 
european community nations quickly followed suit 
president bush said in a televised message to the iraqi people 
on sunday that saddams invasion of kuwait was going to cost the 
nation an average of 20 billion a year in lost oil revenue 
iraq piled up a foreign debt of 60 billion to 70 billion 
about half of it owed to arab states during its eightyear war 
against iraq which ended in 1988 it has unilaterally canceled its 
debt of about 10 billion to kuwait 
the rest of the money is owed to japan italy britain france 
and the soviet union most of for arms bought on credit during the 
war 
the new iraqi law said foreign governments that froze iraqi 
assets after the invasion of kuwait are responsible for 
safeguarding the cash and the assets and for protecting any revenue 
coming from accumulating interest on investments 
banks it added were fully responsible for protecting iraqi 
cash plus the interest revenue and any other rights owed to 
iraq 
iraqi companies private and government are not responsibile 
in any way for losses resulting from any delay by foreign firms in 
fulfilling contracts in iraq but these firms are held responsible 
for for any damge inflicted on the iraqi side 
iraqi courts have also been ordered to reject any application 
for any case against iraqi firms private or government and 
declared any ruling by foreign courts against iraqi firms null 
and void

on tuesday the closely watched index fell at one point to 
2330831 before recovering in the afternoon to 2388482 
stock traders said investor pessimism spurred by uncertainty 
over the middle east inflation concerns and rising oil prices and 
interest rates was continuing to pull the market down 
there were no special influences market sentiment is bad 
said haruo ueno manager of stock trading for wako securities 
tuesdays sharp fall and partial rebound represented mostly 
technical movement said toshiaki kakimoto chief economist at 
sumitomo bank 
he said trading has been light this week because the first half 
of the fiscal year for many companies ends sept 30 
an estimated 360 million shares changed hands on the stock 
markets first section today down from 400 million shares on 
tuesday 
investors are just taking a waitandsee attitude said 
akira yasuihead of research at county natwest securities japan 
ltd he said many have pulled out of the market and have put their 
cash instead into intermediate and longterm deposits 
yasui said players also were waiting for indications from the 
bank of japan that it will not raise its official discount rate in 
the near future after raising the rate five times since may last 
year if the bank of japan understands that higher interest rates 
will damage the economy the stock market will be stronger he

despite the trade figures and the us government announcement 
tuesday that the august consumer price index was up 08 percent 
kakimoto said 
traders said they believed the dollar had been oversold

the first meeting of what was to become 
cambodias interim government ended in disagreement today with the 
warring factions arguing over how to guide the country to free 
elections 
the factions accused each other of trying to destroy the supreme 
national council formed a week earlier as part of a comprehensive 
un security council peace plan 
the talks failed despite the intercession of diplomats from 
thailand and china which arm the guerrillas but have been actively 
seeking an agreement 
our regret is that in the three days of our meeting we have 
not been able to reach any agreement at all premier hun sen of 
the vietnameseinstalled cambodian government told a news 
conference 
the first meeting is not yet over he said its only a 
temporary adjournment a guerrilla spokesman said the talks could 
resume within days 
meanwhile the radio of the powerful khmer rouge guerrillas said 
the provietnamese forces began an offensive sept 6 to retake the 
rich gemmining town of pailin near the thai border 
it said the attack would last until november including the span 
of the un general assembly session where cambodia again will be 
a major issue the assembly session began on tuesday 
the khmer rouge had seized pailin in october shortly after 
vietnam made what it called the withdrawal of its last troops from 
cambodia 
the supreme national council held only one formal meeting at 
the opening session monday at the cambodian embassy for the next 
two days the factions stayed in their bangkok hotel 
the council currently consists of six government representatives 
and two from each of the three allied guerrilla groups the khmer 
rouge the forces of former head of state norodom sihanouk and the 
khmer peoples national liberation front led by former premier son 
sann 
a plan adopted last month by the five permanent members of the 
un security council and embraced last week by the cambodian 
factions as a basis for a settlement says the council would be the 
sole source of authority in the period before elections 
it would however cede many of its powers to a un interim 
authority and peacekeeping force that would guarantee the 
transition to democratic rule 
the guerrilla coalition wants sihanouk as the councils 13th 
member and chairman who could conceivably break a tie vote 
hun sen said sihanouk could be chairman but not an additional 
member and the vice chairman should be from the hun sen camp if 
sihanouk joined as the 13th member the government said it also 
must have another member 
son sann said if the guerrillas accepted hun sen as head of the 
un delegation we accept the fait accompli of the occupation of 
cambodia by the vietnamese we cannot accept that when we have 
fought for 11 years to liberate our country 
in a statement today the khmer rouge said that rejecting 
sihanouk can only be construed as an attempt to prolong the 
war in cambodia 
sihanouk said from his beijing home that he was ill and could 
not attend the meetings in jakarta or this week in bangkok 
the cambodian civil war began with vietnams late 1978 invasion 
which ended a radical communist khmer rouge rule in which hundreds 
of thousands of people died 
the un security council plan is considered crucial because it 
represents agreement on the part of powers that back different 
sides in the conflict 
britain china france and the united states back the 
guerrillas the soviet union backs the government in phnom penh 
thailand and china which arm the guerrillas have been actively 
seeking an agreement 
with roughly 30000 guerrillas and chinese arms the khmer rouge 
is the most powerful guerrilla group

after getting the upper hand on a blaze 
that gutted a tanker officials today were assessing damages and 
trying to afix blame in the explosion that set off the fire 
crews hoped that the mangled mv jupiter would cool enough 
today to begin salvaging and moving the vessel from the saginaw 
river where the tanker was docked said tom schneider spokesman 
for total petroleum inc 
one crewman is missing and believed dead 
the 391foot jupiter had unloaded a little more than half its 
cargo of 23 million gallons of gasoline when the fire broke out 
sunday and raged for 30 hours before being doused it somehow 
reignited monday night 
us coast guard safety inspectors said the jupiter must have 
pulled away from its dock splitting its fueling hose and spilling 
gasoline as a series of explosions occurred the source of the 
ignition was undetermined 
ashland oil inc of ashland ky which owns the company that 
owns the jupiter thinks a passing coal freighter the buffalo may 
have created a wake that rocked the jupiter parting mooring lines 
and causing a transfer hose to snap and spew gasoline 
we have put american steamship lines on notice that we hold 
them responsible for the incident weve done that through legal 
channels ashland spokesman roger schrum said tuesday 
no lawsuits have been filed however 
american steamship co owners of the 635foot buffalo denied 
that the buffalo would have been traveling dead slow 1 to 2 
mph just fast enough to keep control in the river current 
american steamship spokeswoman kelly pezone said from corporate 
headquarters in buffalo ny 
buffalo skipper john macfalda told coast guard investigators 
tuesday he was going as slow as possible as he passed the jupiter 
the tanker appeared to have broken free from its moorings and was 
pushed away from the dock by the wind he said 
three of the tankers 18 crewmen remained hospitalized today in 
fair condition at bay medical center one crewman tom sexton 46 
of iowa was believed to have died while trying to swim ashore from

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan issued 
a gloomy assessment of the us economy today saying the turmoil 
in the persian gulf had introduced new and substantial risks 
for the prospects of continued growth 
with all of the economic uncertainty greenspan said the bush 
administration and congress should intensify their efforts to get a 
credible package to reduce the budget deficit 
as he has in the past greenspan predicted that such a deal 
would give the fed leeway to reduce interest rates something the 
administration has been seeking for months in an effort to avert 
the first economic downturn in eight years 
greenspan said despite mounting evidence of widespread economic 
weakness he did not believe the country was currently in a 
recession but he listed a number of negative impacts stemming from 
the more than 10 per barrel rise in oil prices since aug 2 and 
said prospects of a downturn in the future could not be ruled out 
regrettably events in the middle east have introduced new and 
substantial risks to the outlook greenspan said in testimony 
before the congressional joint economic committee 
just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions 
in the persian gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the 
economy in a negative way greenspan said in his first comments

police briefly detained winnie 
mandela today after finding spent bullet cartridges in her car 
an angry mrs mandela claimed the incident was part of an 
ongoing plan to harass her and her husband african national 
congress leader nelson mandela 
the incident came a day after the government announced that it 
will prosecute mrs mandela on charges of kidnapping and assault 
for the 1988 abduction and beating of four youths 
the charges could harm negotiations between the anc and the 
government of president fw de klerk 
in her first public comment about the pending charges mrs 
mandela said today i welcome the decision in the sense it will 
give me the chance to clear my name after this trial by 
media 
mrs mandela was traveling today in her white mercedes benz 
through the tokoza township southest of johannesburg when she was 
stopped at a police roadblock 
mrs mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting 
said a police spokeswoman capt ida van zweel she handed them 
to a policeman there is no crime involved 
mrs mandela said she was taken to a local police station and 
detained for almost three hours 
police harassment has never been a suprise to the mandela 
family mrs mandela said later the dirty methods they are 
using are nowhere near an end 
the anc claimed mrs mandela had been arrested the group said 
she had been invited to the township by residents who wanted to 
hand over the spent cartridges from the recent black factional 
fighting 
the organization said it condemns the harassment meted out to 
mrs winnie mandela by police intent on curbing the normal 
activity of the anc 
in the 1988 incident four youths were allegedly abducted and 
beaten at mrs mandelas house in 1988 while her husband was still 
imprisoned 
one of the youths was killed and the head of mrs mandelas 
former bodyguard unit jerry richardson has been convicted of 
murder kidnapping and assault the three surviving youths 
testified that mrs mandela beat them with a whip 
mrs mandela is expected to be formally charged monday on four 
counts of kidnapping and four counts of assault 
the anc said it objected to mrs mandelas trial by media 
but did not criticize the government 
also today president de klerk met with his cabinet and mandela 
conferred with other anc leaders as both sides sought solutions to 
the violence in black townships around johannesburg which has 
claimed about 800 lives since early august 
local media reports said de klerk was expected to announce 
additional steps to curb the unrest possibly a dusktodawn 
curfew 
police have been seaching for weapons setting up roadblocks and 
sending in reinforcements to the townships following the 
announcement of operation iron fist on saturday 
police also say they will mount machine guns on armored patrol 
vehicles to counter the growing number of attacks on police sixty 
policemen have been killed this year 
mandela has predicted the measures will be ineffective and 
amount to a license to kill for the security forces he also 
has said the anc the largest black opposition movement could 
break off talks with the whiteled government if it cannot stop the 
bloodshed 
five people were injured one seriously when black men with 
machetes and knives attacked passengers on a black communter train 
west of johannesburg on tuesday police said 
the attack was similar to one last week in which assailants 
killed 26 and wounded more than 100 on a train traveling from 
johannesburg to the neighboring soweto township 
the main combatants have been supporters of the anc and zulus 
who back the conservative inkatha movement 
both groups oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and plans 
for a future south africa their power struggle in the eastern 
province of natal has claimed about 5000 lives since 1986 
the recent fighting has strained relations between government 
and the anc and both sides have become increasingly critical of 
the other

marine corps commandant gen al gray 
says it is ludicrous to send entertainers to visit american 
forces in saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
the entertainment organized by the uso is inappropriate 
because it detracts from the mission at hand gray told 
reporters tuesday during a visit to this marine training base 
we shouldnt be having any shows over there gray said 
the united service organization has booked comedians steve 
martin and jay leno and it is seeking other bigname talent to 
entertain the more than 150000 american soldiers sailors and 
airmen deployed in the gulf area martin is scheduled to meet with 
soldiers next month at an air base in the northeastern saudi city 
of dharhan 
thats ludicrous said gray who made no mention of the 
specific entertainers common sense will tell you that such 
entertainment is inappropriate he said 
gray who rarely grants interviews had little else to say about 
the situation in saudi arabia except to note that the marines are 
continuing to ship supplies and equipment to improve their 
capability to sustain a possible combat mission 
about 45000 marines are in the gulf area including about

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan issued 
a gloomy assessment of the us economy today saying the turmoil 
in the persian gulf had introduced new and substantial risks 
for the prospects of continued growth 
with all of the economic uncertainty greenspan said the bush 
administration and congress should intensify their efforts to get a 
credible package to reduce the budget deficit 
as he has in the past greenspan predicted that such a deal 
would give the fed leeway to reduce interest rates something the 
administration has been seeking for months in an effort to avert 
the first economic downturn in eight years 
greenspan said despite mounting evidence of widespread economic 
weakness he did not believe the country was currently in a 
recession but he listed a number of negative impacts stemming from 
the more than 10 per barrel rise in oil prices since aug 2 and 
said prospects of a downturn in the future could not be ruled out 
regrettably events in the middle east have introduced new and 
substantial risks to the outlook greenspan said in testimony 
before the congressional joint economic committee 
just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions 
in the persian gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the 
economy in a negative way greenspan said in his first comments 
on the economy since iraqs invasion of kuwait 
greenspans appearance today had been eagerly awaited by 
financial markets around the world who were hoping the central 
bank chairman would give clues to the future course of interest 
rates 
greenspan however did not signal that the fed either had eased 
credit already or was planning any immediate easing moves instead 
he merely repeated comments made in the past that financial markets 
would respond favorably to a credible deficit reduction package by 
pushing longterm rates such as mortgage rates lower and the fed 
would do its part by helping to lower shortterm rates shortterm 
rates include variablerate home equity loans and banks prime 
lending rate 
greenspan said that the oilprice rise since august had made 
much more difficult the feds job of promoting economic growth 
while keeping inflation in check 
the fed chairman said that if crude oil prices average around 
30 per barrel over the next year about 10 above the price before 
aug 2 the higher oil prices would likely lower economic growth by 
a full percentage point over a years time 
he said that inflation would be boosted by up to 2 percentage 
points over the next year the government reported tuesday that the 
first shock wave from the persian gulf had pushed consumer prices 
up by 08 percent in august and left inflation running at an annual 
rate of 62 percent so far this year the fastest clip in nine 
years 
greenspan said that a 10 per barrel jump in oil prices would 
add roughly 30 billion to the countrys annual import bill 
draining away purchasing power from consumers and businesses 
but greenspan said he was not yet convinced that the country was 
headed for a recession because the prospects for weakness 
cascading throughout the economy do not as yet appear compelling 
however he added later in the final analysis no one can 
guarantee that real growth will proceed smoothly without a hitch 
on a quarter to quarter basis 
some private economists believe that it may already be too late 
to avoid the first recession since the steep 198182 downturn the 
bush administration insists that the economy can keep chugging 
along especially if the fed relents and helps out with a dose of 
lower interest rates 
the need for an easier money policy has been a consistent 
administration theme for months with president bush firing the 
latest salvo tuesday 
the president told reporters the best thing the government can 
do for the economy is lower interest rates he noted greenspans 
indication last week that the fed would move to cut rates if 
congress and the administration reach a credible agreement to 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
but the budget negotiations are bogged down making the timing 
of any fed interest rate cut unclear 
because of the volatility of events in the middle east and the 
uncertainty over whether there will be a deal to cut the deficit 
many private economists believe the fed will bide its time 
watching to see how the economy performs in coming weeks 
i think the feds frozen in place said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a majority of fed 
policymakers would like to keep policy unchanged while they let 
the dust settle on the middle east explosion

the irish republican army claimed 
responsibility today for shooting and gravely wounding the man who 
was governor of gibraltar when british commandos killed three ira 
guerrillas there in 1988 
the attackers opened fire on air chief marshal sir peter terry 
and his wife tuesday night at their home in the village of milford 
near stafford 130 miles north of london 
terry 63 was reported in stable condition today following 5 
hours of surgery for injuries including fractures of his right arm 
and right leg and severe facial injuries he also underwent a 
tracheotomy an operation on his windpipe and was on a ventilator 
to aid his breathing 
bullets had struck him in the head hip stomach legs and arms 
said surgeon john lotz terrys wife lady betty suffered an eye 
injury 
the ira which is fighting to end british rule in northern 
ireland said in a statement in dublin that such attacks would 
continue as long as the british government persists in its 
illegal and illogical claim to ireland 
police had launched a major manhunt using a helicopter 
cordoning off a wide area around the couples home setting up 
roadblocks and searching nearby countryside with tracker dogs 
ballistic and forensic experts scoured the house and surrounding 
area 
prime minister margaret thatcher denounced the attack today as 
cowardly wicked and evil 
the ira lost three guerrillas in gibraltar on march 6 1988 in 
an ambush staged by the special air services an elite 
counterinsurgency unit 
the shooting of terry came hours after the ira issued a 
statement claiming responsibility for shooting a british army 
sergeant in london on monday for an explosion at an army 
recruiting office in derby on sept 10 and for two thwarted bomb 
attacks in august 
as governor and commanderinchief of gibraltar terry had 
formally authorized the british military to take over the 1988 
operation that resulted in the killing of the three unarmed 
guerrillas by undercover commandos 
the ira said the guerrillas were on active service a euphemism 
for a bombing or shooting mission when they were gunned down but 
said they were given no chance to surrender 
british authorities at the time of the gibraltar slayings said 
commandos of the armys special air service regiment killed mairead 
farrell sean savage and daniel mccann because they feared they 
were about to detonate a car bomb 
no bomb was found in gibraltar but two days after the slayings 
spanish police found a car packed with explosives in the spanish 
resort of marbella 40 miles northeast of gibraltar the car had 
been rented by one of the three 
the jury at a monthlong inquest in gibraltar decided on a 92 
vote in september 1988 that the three were lawfully killed but the 
slayings drew criticism from amnesty international and prime 
minister charles haugheys government in the republic of ireland

millions of infant deaths could be prevented 
if women in developing nations were able to increase the length of 
time between having babies according to a study released 
wednesday 
birth intervals of less than two years are strongly and 
consistently associated with higher mortality reported the 
analysis prepared by the independent population crisis committee 
when there is less than two years between births the risk of 
the second child dying in infancy is increased by between 60 
percent and 70 percent the study said and it doubles the chance 
of the earlier child dying by age 5 
family planning should be the first step toward improving 
child survival said sharon l camp vice president of the 
committee which advocates provision of contraceptives and family 
planning programs 
through family planning the cycle of weak mothers giving birth 
to weak children can be broken said camp 
pregnancy and nursing make major nutritional demands on the 
mother if a new pregnancy follows without enough time to recover 
the chances are increased that the second child will be premature 
and underweight the report states 
in addition becoming pregnant again quickly can cause a woman 
to stop breast feeding the earlier child the report adds 
it also suggests that spacing children too closely together 
increases competition for limited family resources and may increase 
the spread of infectious diseases among children 
while admitting that accurate statistics are difficult to 
collect in many developing nations the report estimates that 10 
million infants and 4 million children aged 1 to 5 die each year 
about 18 million of these deaths could be prevented by 
extending the interval between births to two years the study 
estimates 
that calculation is based on an earlier study that concluded 
that a longer interval between births could reduce infant mortality 
by 10 percent and mortality in children aged 1 to 5 by 21 percent 
in addition to birth spacing the report says that childbirth 
before age 20 also increases the likelihood of infant and child 
death 
children born to mothers under age 20 common in many 
developing countries where girls marry very young are a third 
more likely to die before age 5 than children born to mothers aged 
25 to 34 the report states 
in addition the study concludes infant and child deaths could 
be reduced by as many as 3 million annually through the use of 
family planning services to delay first births for young women and 
to space them out later

conference said that in a survey of 30 cities more than two out 
of five said they think they are losing the war on drugs 
the system as currently designed is not capable of doing 
what it was intended to do isaac said at a news conference it 
is not capable of getting the federal antidrug funds through the 
states to the cities where the drug war is the hottest 
he called for approval of legislation providing that cities 
eligible for a minimum grant of 50000 would receive it directly 
instead of having it passed through the states the measure has 
been approved by the house judiciary committee and is pending as an 
amendment to a crime bill 
isaac said the survey conducted in january showed that city 
governments had received only 15 percent of the 150 million 
available in the state and local grant program he said 
calculations by the mayors conference showed they were entitled to 
65 percent 
the money was bogged down in the bureaucracies of the federal 
and state governments the colorado mayor said 
isaac noted that william bennett national drug policy director 
said this month the drug problem in general nationwide is no 
longer getting worse and in some very significant aspects is now 
getting better not victory but success if we keep pressing the 
way we have been pressing and if we keep our commitments we will 
get where we want to go 
in the survey isaac said 41 percent of the cities said that 
taking all efforts into consideration they feel they are losing the 
war on drugs twentyeight percent said they are winning and most 
of the rest described a situation somewhere in between he 
said

the daily astorian astoria ore on congress 
occasionally we gain a glimpse of what congress and the federal 
government are really up to 
remember the watergate tapes they were a shock to many 
americans because they revealed a private white house manner that 
was much at odds with the public persona that president richard 
nixon had conveyed remember the pentagon papers they revealed a 
defense establishment that was managing a war without any clear 
plan for how to win 
and now we have a list of epithets that were compiled by a 
national republican organization for use by candidates across 
america michael oreskes revealed the guts of this letter in 
the new york times 
congressman newt gingrich rga is the prime mover behind the 
list gingrichs organization gopac even went to the trouble of 
testing these epithets with focus groups the product was 113 words 
that gopac urges candidates to use to put down their opponents 
and to praise themselves 
if this is the kind of science practiced on capitol hill is it 
any wonder that we have a savings and loan mess dont look for 
leadership from that corner of america at all soon the boys and 
girls on capitol hill are too busy boning up on bad names to call 
each other

the providence ri journalbulletin on nasas problems 
why is nasa in so much trouble 
space shuttles that cant blast off orbital telescopes that 
wont focus a satellite that blacks out around venus 
nasa isnt the bright young agency it was when the race for 
space put the first men on the moon 
the average age of the scientific staff at the heart of the 
agencys operations has grown in the two decades since from 37 to 
42 with nearly a third eligible for retirement 
why has the technical staff become older and apparently less 
vigorous perhaps the answer is more interesting than reduced 
funding or bureaucratic inertia or competitin for talent from 
private industry 
maybe the vigor is waning because the magic is gone there 
was a sense of purpose that energized nasa during the space race 
years moon missions glamorized the agency 
when it stopped going to the moon perhaps nasa stopped 
attracting the best and brightest the explanation may be that 
simple 
if the nation expects nasa to recapture the esprit of its 
earlier years it will require missions worthy of the pride those 
years inspired

the record hackensack nj on new tv shows and educators 
parents wondering what they can do to help their children in 
school this fall might take a look at some of the seasons new 
sitcoms the ones aimed directly at young viewers parental 
guidance is suggested 
not that the shows are too mature heaven forbid what is 
troubling are the images they present of teachers principals 
students who actually study and students who make a successful 
career out of outwitting the authorities 
teachers on these shows are rarely much smarter than their 
students and principals are bullies or pushovers just waiting to 
be made into fools in nbctvs ferris bueller the hero 
controls his school with his computers and tapes and reduced his 
incompetent principal to a childish rage hull high also on 
nbctv features an emptyheaded young teacher given to wearing 
skintight clothes 
is it really funny to see educators belittled and education so 
trivialized parents might want to take some time to discuss the 
content of these shows with their children before or after they 
watch them better still why not turn off the tv and read together 
instead

kenosha wis news on backtoschool fashions 
some people say theres not much regional variation in american 
artifacts and ways a can of coke a pair of jeans a supermarket 
is more or less the same from maine to arizona 
but we read about a fashion that as far as we know is unique 
to new york city 
it seems a former city cop is marketing bulletproof 
backtoschool clothes vests blazers tshirts bulletproof 
clipboards and book bags give added protection 
despite high prices 450 for a jacket three dozen orders are 
already being filled 
that should not be surprising in a city that recorded 1905 
homicides last year four children were shot in an eightday period 
in august 
but it is certainly grim may this tragic symbol of urban 
barbarism remain a new york oddity

pope john paul ii on wednesday accused the 
mass media of being instruments of sin and spreading models of 
aberrant behavior 
the situation in which man lives today is marked by a vast and 
complex condition of slavery in the moral sphere the pontiff 
said in a speech to 4000 priests attending a spiritual retreat at 
the vatican 
the popes comments appeared to reflect his growing concern 
about western models of consumerism and materialism being taken up 
by catholics in the formerly communistdominated countries of 
eastern europe 
the contagious force of bad proposals and examples can avail 
itself of the channels of persuasion offered by the varied gamut of 
the means of mass communications he said 
in this way models of aberrant behavior become progressively 
imposed on public opinion a subtle network of psychological 
conditioning is thus established which can resemble chains 
inhibiting the true freedom of choice

from their earliest days together john 
sununu and bill zeliff were among the insiders offering advice to 
george bush in his new hampshire presidential primary campaigns 
from the white house sununu endorsed his old friend zeliff for 
congress helping him win the gop nomination in an eightway 
primary last week and provoking the wrath of other republicans 
along the way 
cronyism and politics at its worst complained dean 
dexter a businessman and former state representative 
i cannot envision a circumstance where i think john sununus 
interference in a new hampshire primary would be appropriate 
said state sen william johnson 
both were among the losers in the gop primary that zeliff won by 
314 votes a recount is planned 
zeliff sidesteps questions on whether his campaign used the 
voting lists computerized data volunteers and organizers that 
sununu had begun assembling in his earliest tries for elective 
office in the late 1970s 
i used everything at my disposal said the 54yearold 
innkeeper 
zeliff made the comments at his campaign headquarters where his 
chief operatives are former sununu aides from the days when he was 
new hampshires governor sununu now serves as bushs white house 
chief of staff 
zeliff served in sununus administration on committees to create 
jobs through private industry he says sununu persuaded me to get 
involved 
zeliff who was a fundraiser for sununu said his longtime 
friend suggested a couple of years ago that i should consider 
running for congress he thought i would make a good congressman 
zeliffs gop opponents were angered when sununu endorsed zeliff 
in a radio commercial that aired in the closing days of the primary 
campaign 
dexter criticized the endorsement as hypocritical noting that 
zeliff favors abortion rights while sununu is opposed 
zeliff will be a rubber stamp for whatever sununu and 
president bush want including higher taxes predicted larry 
brady a washington lobbyist who also was among those defeated by 
zeliff in the gop primary 
zeliff said that on the friday before the primary sununu 
called me and offered unsolicited a tape for the campaign 
because were good friends 
ive known bill zeliff for a long time sununu said in the 
ad nobody will work harder to get the job done 
on primary election night sununus attention was focused on the 
presidents speech to congress nonetheless the former governor 
phoned zeliff to see how we were doing and to wish us luck 
zeliff said 
the white house has not been reluctant to endorse new hampshire 
candidates giving its blessing to us rep bob smiths easily won 
race in the us senate primary zeliff is running for smiths 
house seat 
when smiths opponents and party officials complained that the 
white house should have been neutral in the primary sununu replied 
that he wasnt helping candidates so much as he was helping the 
process 
although zeliff denied that his tv advertising program took 
lessons from sununus strategies in earlier campaigns the zeliff 
ads had a familiar tone 
in the 1988 presidential campaign bush attacked kansas sen bob 
dole as a taxer zeliffs campaign sounded a similar theme 
zeliff labeled house speaker doug scamman a broadbased 
taxer the unkindest cut one republican can make against another 
in new hampshire which has no general sales or personal income 
tax 
the general election campaign against democrat joe keefe will be 
an aggressive one zeliff predicted 
im a conservative republican businessman hes a trial 
lawyer a liberal spending democrat thats the basic difference 
said zeliff

although iraq is beginning to feel the 
impact of economic sanctions ordinary people in the capital seem 
determined to resist outside pressure 
bread powdered milk sugar rice macaroni chicken and rice 
are in short supply other food is available but prices have 
skyrocketed since the united nations imposed the trade sanctions 
aug 6 
the sanctions were ordered to force president saddam hussein to 
withdraw the troops he sent into kuwait on aug 2 
the west believes we will kneel to their will when they impose 
sanctions against us but we have stored for all our needs said 
salwa bayati a mother of two who chatted with neighbors over 
morning coffee last week 
the coffee was served without sugar 
iraqi homemakers commonly keep household food storerooms full 
and refrigerators stocked a habit developed during the eightyear 
war with iran 
mrs bayati said she has enough food on hand to feed her family 
for seven months sugar however was in short supply even before 
the trade embargo and it is one of the items not in her cupboard 
the iraqi government has closed all fastfood restaurants and 
many pastry shops because they use large amounts of scarce sugar 
those remaining open bake bread instead of sweets 
mrs bayati and her neighbors compared living conditions now 
with life during the 198088 war with iran they said more food was 
available then but they still have managed to pile shelves full of 
canned goods and pickled food and to load refrigerators with meat 
and frozen vegetables despite government warnings against 
hoarding 
the women said the last war and the current crisis have forced 
them to economize those at the table included christeen yohan a 
german married to an iraqi man who has lived in iraq for 20 years 
iraqi women are quite capable of overcoming difficulties 
she said 
the women said they have taught their children to cope with 
difficult conditions 
i believe our children have started to be aware of the war 
conditions in which we are living they understand they cannot get 
everything they want said hana sabah the other women agreed 
todays children are the war generation they tolerate 
conditions other children cannot mrs sabah said 
elsewhere in baghdad life seems to roll along without much 
change 
some businesses like travel agencies and airline offices have 
closed but people rarely complain grumbling is frowned upon by 
the iraqi government and the ruling baath party has a wide network 
of neighborhood informers who watch for potential troublemakers 
we hope this crisis ends peacefully but in the meantime we 
try to live normally said the manager of an iraqi airlines 
office he said he has cut the salaries of employees who have 
almost nothing to do 
i have two employees who are now taking turns off work he 
said this is part of our struggle against western hegemony and 
we will be patient 
throughout the city people stood in lone lines outside bakery 
shops to get the daily ration of bread rationing began sept 1 
loaves are smaller 
we are out of bread today said a waiter in one of baghdads 
finer restaurants they were also out of rice if a customer wanted 
tea or coffee it came black no sugar or cream 
in a baghdad hospital a doctor said some operations were being 
postponed and only emergency cases were treated because surgical 
thread alcohol and other medical items are in short supply 
the only medicines on pharmacy shelves are drugs bought before 
aug 2 or those made in jordan prices have increased dramatically 
tarik al sukooti a leader of the accountants and auditors 
union said iraqi people support their president because they 
belive he is doing the right thing he said westerners do not 
understand the arab mentality 
iraqi people would rather starve than accept humiliation he 
said

a law applying the states 4 percent 
sales tax to magazines while exempting newspapers was upheld 
wednesday by the iowa supreme court 
the court found no censorial threat motive or element 
imposed by the states tax policy and rejected a constitutional 
challenge by the hearst corp publisher of cosmopolitan good 
housekeeping popular mechanics harpers bazaar sports afield and 
town and country 
the focus is not on the content of the journalism the court 
said rather the form and frequency of the publication are the 
primary factors for determining whether a publication qualifies for 
the iowa sales and use tax exemption 
hearst based in new york had argued that the states tax laws 
violated first amendment guarantees of freedom of the press giving 
the state the power to tax different publications at different 
levels or to exempt some amounts to granting censorship powers the 
company argued 
under iowa tax laws newspapers do not pay the 4 percent sales 
tax that magazines and other periodicals are required to pay 
regulations spell out the definitions of magazine and 
newspaper for tax purposes the most crucial centering around 
how often they are published 
the court conceded that a tax exemption is a government subsidy 
but said legislators were within their rights in providing such a 
subsidy as long as it doesnt discriminate between similar media 
and is not impermissibly directed at a publications content 
hearst also had said the tax policy violated equal protection 
provisions but the court rejected that argument saying that while 
legislators cannot use a taxing power to block press organizations 
they are not required to help them either 
the constitution does not require that the government remove 
all obstacles in the path of the exercise of a persons rights 
said the opinion written by justice bruce snell where 
government subsidies are not aimed at the suppression of dangerous 
ideas its power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public 
interest is necessarily far broader 
hearst also complained that the tax law favored iowabased 
companies but the court rejected that saying newspapers were 
exempt from the tax no matter where they were published

an unarmed minuteman 3 
missile was launched today and tracked to a pacific target for the 
first time with airborne strategic defense initiative sensors 
military officials said 
the missile roared off at 140 am and its dummy warhead struck 
the kwajalein atoll missile range in the south pacific half an hour 
and 4200 miles later said maj michael dobel an air force 
spokesman in washington 
the rocket was tracked by a boeing 767 equipped with the 
worlds most sophisticated infrared equipment said bill congo 
chief of external affairs for the army strategic defense command 
which runs the program 
this is the first time this test has been done congo said 
we have tracked stars but this is the first time this vehicle 
has tracked a live target 
the airborne surveillance testbed is designed to determine 
whether longwave infrared sensors can give early warning of enemy 
missile warheads and track them the sensor is housed in an 
86footlong cupola atop the 767 
congo said the jet would be flown to seattle so that data 
collected by the sdi machinery can be taken off and analyzed 
we feel very confident about the data collected on this 
test congo said 
the data should not only provide measurements of the missiles 
speed and accuracy but also a picture of what the missile looks 
like on radar 
if this was indeed a real warhead we could track how it looks 
on the infrared sensor congo said 
the minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile can carry 
three independently targetable warheads the sdi equipment is 
designed to detect incoming warheads to alert defenses while still 
hundreds of miles away 
this program will help us to be able to test other sensors in 
the future he said this was a special oneofakind thing 
im really excited about this 
the missile tested today became operational in june 1970 the 
launch one of a series of strategic air command operational tests 
of the minuteman system was delayed a day by ground equipment 
problems officials said 
minuteman 3 missiles are threestage solidfuel icbms standing 
60 feet tall and weighing 78000 pounds they reach a speed of 
15000 mph and have a range of 6000 miles

barring unforeseen calamities the jewish new 
year is looking happier than usual for israel 
the caveat about calamities is necessary 
when jews celebrate they traditionally smash a glass to remind 
themselves there is no joy without sorrow and with each puff of 
good fortune israelis listen for the tinkle of broken glass 
the persian gulf crisis the rapid thaw in israels relations 
with moscow and the influx of soviet jewish immigrants are forcing 
israelis to confront the unimaginable the sands of the middle east 
havent just shifted they have quaked 
the horizon that has opened up is unlimited and were playing 
for the whole kitty says amnon abramovitz a columnist for the 
maariv newspaper 
were at a junction of several roads and its hard to know 
right now what road well be taking this year it could lead to 
negotiations with syria or a war with saddam hussein or both 
he said 
israels steadfast lowprofile conduct in the gulf crisis has 
transformed its image from bully of the west bank to loyal ally of 
the west and relieved the pressure on jerusalem to negotiate with 
the palestinians 
still israelis worry what if iraq attacks them with chemical 
weapons there was panic buying of survival supplies last month 
and a debate is raging about whether to distribute gas masks 
soviet jewish newcomers kissing the tarmac at bengurion airport 
are a heartwarming spectacle for israelis a reminder of why they 
built a jewish state 
but can a small troubled economy pay to house and employ an 
immigrant multitude that may increase the jewish population by 50 
percent by the mid1990s 
it is a most revolutionary thing says immigration official 
simcha dinitz i know of no other society going through such a 
massive absorption process 
many of israels 7000 synagogues opened to immigrants free 
following a request by minister of religious affairs avner shaki to 
waive the fees that some synagogues impose to raise funds for 
religious work 
the new year 5751 on the jewish calendar was welcomed with the 
blowing of the rams horn known as the shofar and begins 10 days of 
introspection which culminate in yom kippur the day of atonement 
according to figures released wednesday by the central bureau of 
statistics israels jewish population grew by 39 percent since 
last rosh hashana of the 115000 new immigrants 88 percent were 
from the soviet union 
stateowned radio reports a nearly 10 percent unemployment rate 
the intefadeh the 34monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip has slowed sharply but no 
israeli imagines it is over 
once the dust has settled when the gulf has calmed down 
there will still be two peoples left in this country two people 
whose lives will become hell unless the conflict between them is 
solved by peaceful means warned peace now a grassroots israeli 
movement in a new year message 
still as they take to the synagogues beaches and picnic 
grounds for a long weekend starting wednesday night many israelis 
will agree with prime minister yitzhak shamirs assessment that 
we had a great year and were entering an even greater one 
most extraordinary is the turnaround by the soviets who had 
armed the arabs denounced zionism as nazism and persecuted 
wouldbe jewish emigrants the soviets now line up with the united 
states against iraq and entertained israeli ministers in the 
kremlin 
finance minister yitzhak modai and science minister yuval neeman 
on saturday became the first israeli cabinet ministers to meet a 
soviet leader 
asked how he felt as he walked into the kremlin to meet 
gorbachev 64yearold modai replied in awestruck tones not heard 
from israeli politicians since egyptian president anwar sadat 
landed in israel 13 years ago 
you cant even imagine it was so dramatic it was so out of 
anything that any normal human mind can conceive that i dont 
think anybody who hasnt gone through it can imagine it 
we were frozen there on our seats you sit across from 
gorbachev you can touch him you look at his face and that famous 
mark and you are able to read his mind not just to listen to 
him he said 
a year ago iraq was a distant threat jordan looked like 
israels most peaceful and responsible neighbor and syria as 
ever was israels implacable foe 
now jordan is drifting into iraqs embrace and readmitting the 
palestine liberation organization leaders it expelled 20 years ago 
while syria sends troops to join the western buildup in the gulf 
and now that the soviets no longer guarantee to bankroll syrias 
army some israelis are speculating about a tradeoff involving the 
israeliannexed golan heights a year ago the notion of peace with 
syria would have been laughed off now the jewish settlers on the 
northern golan heights are calling emergency meetings to discuss 
the prospect of an israeli withdrawal 
in saudi arabia the us military staged private srvices 
wednesday for jewish troops wishing to mark the holiday despite 
saudi restrictions on overt practice of any religion other than 
islam 
all these things simply make you lose your bearings says

iraqi president saddam hussein today seized all foreign assets 
from countries honoring the embargo on trade with his nation just 
days before the un security council was expected to toughen its 
sanctions 
in washington federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned 
that the 6weekold crisis in the persian gulf had introduced new 
and substantial risks for the prospects of continued growth of 
the us economy 
just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions 
in the persian gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the 
economy in a negative way greenspan told the congressional joint 
economic committee 
and in more troubling economic news a leading oil industry 
group said today that us petroleum imports rose 41 percent in 
august compared with a year ago while us crude oil production 
dropped 48 percent 
in an effort to cripple the iraqi economy nine west european 
countries on tuesday endorsed a proposed united nations air 
blockade and argentina said it was joining the multinational 
flotilla enforcing the naval blockade of iraq 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he feared 
the gulf military standoff brought on by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait could turn into world war iii

american women and children from kuwait left baghdad for london 
officials said 
in washington the house of representatives approved a nearly 
1 billion package to assist the us military buildup in the gulf 
the chairman of the kgb offered to give the cia intelligence 
about iraq where the soviet government still has about 5000 
specialists 
defense secretary dick cheney asked congress to let the 
pentagon accept and spend billions of dollars in allied 
contributions for military operations in the persian gulf without 
prior approval from capitol hill 
an army paratrooper suffered a superficial leg wound when 
struck by shrapnel from a misguided artillery shell in livefire 
exercises by us forces in the saudi desert he was treated at the 
scene and remained with his unit 
a french foreign ministry spokesman said iraqi soldiers 
arrested two frenchmen this week in kuwait they join about 60 
other french citizens and thousands of other foreigners held 
hostage in iraq and kuwait 
iraq offered to pump free oil to turkey through two pipelines 
ankara closed last month a spokesman for turkeys foreign ministry 
said the government has made no decision on the offer which was 
similar to one iraq made to third world countries last week 
jordans king hussein flew to the moroccan capital rabat for 
a summit with moroccan and algerian leaders that hussein hopes will 
work out a joint blueprint on solving the persian gulf crisis 
before leaving hussein conferred with palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat 
the flow of kuwaitis into saudi arabia slowed four days after 
iraq allowed citizens to flee only about 30 cars passed through 
the khafji border crossing 
in baghdad the iraqi government said today it has seized all 
cash deposits and property of governments companies and banks

command council ordered the confiscation under a new sevenarticle 
law dealing with the protection of iraqi interests money and 
rights in iraq and abroad 
ina did not mention how much money was involved the us state 
department was unable to say how much the american assets seized by 
iraq were worth 
it is not clear from the iraqi statement in what form or 
against whom the action will be taken state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
in any case actions like this can only make it more difficult 
for iraq to return to the international community of nations and to 
restore economic relations which are crucial for iraqs longterm 
development she said in washington the clear way for iraq to 
protect its interests is to comply with the security council 
resolutions relating to its invasion of kuwait 
the united states and other countries already have frozen iraqs 
foreign holdings kuwaits foreign assets estimated at about 100 
billion have been turned over to the the countrys exiled leaders 
the treasury department is reviewing the situation to 
determine the specifics a spokesperson said adding that the 
treasury would not be able to determine the extent of private 
property involved until it receives claims from the private sector 
the revolutionary command council is iraqs highest 
policymaking body headed by saddam an official iraqi newspaper 
reported tuesday that a member of the council 51yearold saadoun 
shaker had quit for health reasons leaving seven members on the 
panel it gave no details on his illness 
appeals for an air blockade to make the unordered trade 
embargo as airtight as possible grew stronger after iraqi troops 
raided several western diplomatic compounds in kuwait last week 
in new york soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov said 
he expected the un security council to approve the embargo this 
week 
prime minister margaret thatcher said today in hungary that the 
five permanent members of the security council the united states

resolution condemning iraq denouncing the violation of diplomatic 
privileges displayed in fridays embassy raids

refugees out of iraq or kuwait or bringing in medical supplies and 
food specifically authorized by the security council would be 
allowed to travel to those nations 
planes could not be shot down under the proposed resolution 
that is banned by the 1944 international civil aviation convention

a rand corp study indicates black 
and hispanic students are falling behind in math and science 
because school districts are more likely to put them in classes for 
those with lower skills 
such student sorting according to the report released tuesday 
narrows the opportunity of lowincome and innercity blacks and 
hispanics to learn science and math 
additionally those students have fewer materials and 
lessqualified teachers the nationwide study concluded 
our analyses reveal clear and consistent patterns of unequal 
opportunities to learn mathematics and science said jeannie 
oakes principal author of the report and a professor of education 
at the university of california los angeles 
rand surveyed 1200 public and private schools and questioned 
6000 teachers nationwide to come up with its 132page 
multiplying inequalities report 
the socalled tracking method sorts students into classes based 
on their academic abilities but rand researchers said ethnicity 
too often plays a role in class placement 
for example 28 percent of the curriculum at elementary schools 
where minority students make up most or all of the population 
consisted of lowability math and science courses the report 
showed 
at schools where 90 percent to 100 percent of the students were 
nonminorities only 7 percent of the classes were on the slow 
track 
the researchers also found that junior and senior high schools 
with a large concentration of nonminority students were seven 
times more likely to be hightrack than their heavily minority 
counterparts 
even if objective ability groupings appear logical they are 
easily confounded with race and social class moreover the 
differences in opportunities they provide actually limit 
instruction rather than fine tune it the study said 
the tracking system should be eliminated researchers concluded 
and some educators agreed 
philosophically we dont believe in it the best mix is to 
have low and highability students together so they can learn from 
each other said richard thome director of elementary education 
for the capistrano unified school district in orange county 
the study funded by the national science foundation was 
carried out by researchers at the santa monicabased rand corp a 
private think tank engaged in research and analysis of national 
security and domestic welfare issues

the senate judiciary committee today completed 
its hearings on supreme court nominee david souter after hearing a 
black lawyer friend vouch for the judges sensitivity to the plight 
of minorities 
i think he is fundamentally fair lacking in prejudice said 
wesley williams jr a washington attorney whose friendship with 
souter extends back to their days at harvard college and harvard 
law school 
during his three days of testimony souter had portrayed his 
home state of new hampshire as free from discrimination the 
statements generated concern from some panel members and criticism 
from other witnesses 
this is an insensitive man that you are foisting upon us 
complained joseph rauh general counsel to the leadership 
conference on civil rights who pointed to examples f racism in 
the state 
but williams said today that david souter understands he has 
lived in the world and seen the trouble in the minority 
community i think hes prepared to do the right thing he 
said 
williams testimony like that of the nominee himself appeared 
aimed at calming liberals who fear souter will swing the courts 
majority firmly to the right but while reassuring the liberals 
the testimony has aroused doubts among conservatives 
the concern is that judge souter is a man of empty philosophy 
all things to all people bruce fein a conservative court 
analyst said tuesday 
howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus said in 
testimony today that souter lacked moral courage because he 
didnt declare himself against abortion at the hearing or years 
earlier when he sat on a hospital board that voted to permit 
abortions at its facility 
souter testified for three days before the committee finishing 
monday night the committee was expected to conclude its hearings 
today and vote on the nomination before the end of the month 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel said the committee vote 
on the nomination could be as early as next week the panels next 
regularly scheduled business meeting is sept 27 
the panel spent tuesday hearing from other witnesses with 
opinions on whether the 51yearold new hampshire jurist should 
join the nations highest court 
many longtime acquaintances of souter urged his approval but 
civil rights womens groups and those supporting the right to 
abortion said they oppose him despite his expressions of 
openmindedness on the 1973 decision in roe v wade that legalized 
abortion 
president bush has called for overturning that decision but his 
nominee declined to take a position before the committee despite 
repeated attempts to get him to do so by senators on both sides of 
the issue 
souter also avoided taking stances on other issues and declined 
to criticize other controversial court decisions of the last few 
decades 
but he raised conservatives eyebrows when he voiced support for 
affirmative action praised retired liberal justice william j 
brennan and talked of filling a legal vacuum when other 
branches of government dont act the judicial activism that 
conservatives oppose 
sen orrin hatch rutah a committee member actively supporting 
the nomination said some fellow conservatives inside and outside 
the senate are worried but he said only the real farright 
wing people are getting physically unnerved 
hatch said souter was a shrewd witness before a very difficult 
group to play to some may be mistaking souters genial 
personality as being soft on issues he said 
he may be more influential than anybody thinks once he joins 
the court because of his ability to work with both sides hatch 
said he just may be the glue that binds on that court 
despite the concerns hatch said he doubted any senate 
conservatives would vote against the nominee 
thomas jipping court watcher at the conservative coalitions for 
america said some conservatives were disappointed because souter 
apparently has no political agenda 
conservatives as well as liberals want others to do their work 
for them he said souter is the kind of conservative judge 
that means conservatives are going to have to do more work he 
said 
fein said his concern was that judge souter is a man who is 
complacent with the legal status quo he could not think of a 
single supreme court decision which was wrongly decided 
fein predicted souter would join the court as the moderate he 
portrayed himself to be the savin grace he said is that 
the intellectual brainpower on the court is on the conservative 
side and eventually may win him over

americas gasguzzling cars are under the 
heaviest attack in more than a decade as the mideast crisis brings 
home the countrys reliance on foreign oil 
and detroit is shuddering 
thursday the senate is expected to take up a bill that would 
require automakers to produce cars with an average gas mileage of 
40 miles per gallon 
the bill was once given scant chance but industry lobbyists and 
members of the bush administration now say theyre concerned the 
measure may sneak through as congress searches for a response to 
the crisis in the persian gulf 
the spotlight shining once more on efficient cars could not have 
caught automakers at a worse time for years they have been 
increasingly pushing performance over gasoline savings 
as the bills prospects have risen so have the voices on both 
sides of the issue 
it should be called the highway fatality bill 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told a news conference 
called so he could denounce the legislation if passed he said 
the measure would lead to smaller cars and more traffic deaths 
skinner said the near hysteria over the mideast situation 
may propel the legislation through congress even though he 
insisted the mileage goals are unrealistic irresponsible and 
more important unattainable he said he would urge president 
bush to veto the bill if it reaches his desk 
but environmentalists say skinner is being taken in by the 
automakers who repeatedly have said they lack the technology to 
improve fuel efficiency dramatically after years of making cars 
lighter smaller and more efficient 
since 1975 the average fuel economy of cars sold in the united 
states has doubled from about 14 mpg to 28 mpg a third of all 
models now get more than 30 mpg 
further improvements in automakers fleetwide average the 
manufacturers say would mean restricting buyers to compacts 
were at a different plateau now than we were in 1975 says 
albert slechter government affairs director for chrysler corp 
fifteen years ago he acknowledges cars were too heavy engines 
were too big cars werent designed to save gas 
such technologies as improved aerodynamic design frontwheel 
drive improved transmissions fuel injection and smaller more 
efficient engines are already being used in many cars without 
approaching the 40 mpg level of performance the automakers argue 
there is no secret or magic technology on the shelf to 
drastically increase fuel economy argues thomas hanna president 
of the motor vehicle manufacturers association hich is 
spearheading the fight against the senate bill 
not true argues sen richard bryan the nevada democrat who is 
the architect of the bill earlier this year he touted the 
legislation as a way to deal with global warming now he says 
concerns over dependence on imported oil are giving the measure its 
momentum 
bryan has accumulated his own folder of studies that he says 
show clearly cars can meet his bills requirements if automakers 
are told thats what they have to do he scoffs at suggestions that 
cars would have to become much smaller calling the claims scare 
tactics 
the studies cited by bryan contend there are changes in 
transmissions tires engine designs and fuel injection systems 
as well as improved aerodynamics that could significantly improve 
fuel economy and maintain a selection of car sizes 
deborah lynn bleviss executive director of the international 
institute for energy conservation says manufacturers have 
developed a half dozen prototypes that average 60 to 75 mpg she 
contends they demonstrate the technological potential for 
dramatically more fuelefficient cars 
environmentalists accuse the automakers of pushing 
highperformance muscle cars and contend the vehement 
opposition to higher fueleconomy standards stems from the millions 
of dollars already invested in future production plans for such 
cars 
detroits 1991 model line includes several highperformance 
models weighing more than two tons one is general motors buick 
roadmaster its v8 engine gets 16 miles to the gallon in city 
driving 
its hard for me to believe that any patriotic american would 
buy a roadmaster with american boys sitting in the desert 
snapped rep george miller dcalif during a recent debate on 
fuel economy at a house hearing 
the companies are working flat out to improve fuel 
efficiency says hanna of the trade association he says that if 
the bryan bill becomes law it would have economic disaster as 
automakers scramble to retool production lines 
supporters of bryans bill say they are unimpressed by the 
complaints from detroit noting that automakers have fought other 
proposed fueleconomy regulations only to find ways to comply 
bryan argues that the nation cannot significantly ease its 
dependence on foreign oil without improving automobile fuel 
efficiency he cites conservationists estimate that a 40mpg fleet 
average could save 24 million barrels of oil a day 
last week the senate easily overrode efforts by sen donald 
riegle dmich to prevent the measure from being considered 
the vote was the first step to remove the oil weapon from the 
hands of saddam hussein declared daniel becker of the sierra 
club 
and in the house rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of 
similar legislation is trying to take her bill directly to the 
floor sidestepping the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich has made no secret of his 
distaste for the legislation

soviet officials eager to copy americanstyle 
singlefamily houses are getting some tips from us housing 
experts learn from americas mistakes dont waste timber 
resources by failing to make the most out of every tree 
they have some of the largest and highest quality timber 
stands in the world but theyre not applying the proper technology 
to use it effectively said leonard sylk of shelter systems 
group a new jersey company that manufactures roofs walls and 
floors 
its a chance to learn from our mistakes it wasnt until most 
of our timber industry was used up and gone that we got smart about 
using it sylk said 
americans now use about 93 percent of each log taken the 
russians are making use of only about 55 percent sylk said 
he said an example of their ignorance of new engineering 
techniques was their use of 12inch lumber where 4inch lumber 
would work 
sylk was one of 15 chiefs of american corporations dispatched to 
the soviet union last week by president bush 
the delegation led by commerce secretary robert mosbacher met 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other officials to 
explore how the united states could help the soviets move toward a 
market economy and improve oil production housing transportation 
and agriculture techniques 
oil is the soviets top priority because its the countrys main 
source of hard currency increasing its production and the 
revenues that flow from it would free up more money for the 
countrys ailing roads and railroad system housing and 
agricultural advancements 
still the soviets needs run the gamut of industries the 
businessmen said and us technology could help make dramatic 
improvements in many areas for instance 
soviets are unfamiliar with new oil drilling techniques that 
shorten by more than a year the time it takes to drill a 
16000foot well said chesley pruet the owner of an el dorado 
ark oil company who made the trip the soviets are spending 500 
days to drill such a well the same task takes us oilmen less 
than 100 days pruet said 
the soviets could benefit from a common practice in the us 
poultry industry spiking chicken feed with lysine an amino acid 
made easily from sugar beet molasses to promote growth that could 
help boost soviet production from 500 million birds a year to 3 
billion said dwayne andreas chairman of archerdanielsmidland 
co 
a lack of grain storage and drying equipment at soviet farms 
results in huge losses and an inability to save crops for 
yearround distribution theyre losing nearly 30 percent of 
their crops to rodents and rotting deterioration andreas said 
the soviets are so eager to improve their standard of living 
they dont realize how much catching up they have to do sylk said 
the soviets dont want to see progress in a year or two they 
want it in a couple of weeks 
they tend to forget that americans spent decades experimenting 
with technology and investing in roads bridges sewer and water 
systems all the support systems needed to ensure that factories 
run smoothly and theres a way to transport and distribute goods 
the us businessmen said 
they want that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow but they 
havent prepared for it they read these western magazines and want 
what we have but they dont know what went in to achieve it 
sylk said 
during the trip the soviets pledged to pass an emigration law 
that would remove obstacles to us trade the soviets also said 
they were considering a historic first allowing foreigners 100 
percent ownership of soviet plants and factories 
gorbachev told the us businessmen that the soviets might act 
soon to allow western investors to buy whole existing 
enterprises or any of a number of different kinds of businesses 
such as fabricating or aluminum plants andreas said 
the theory goes that western investors would pump money new 
equipment and technology into the facilities to make them 
profitable proving lucrative for both the investor and the 
soviets 
allowing foreigners 100 percent ownership of soviet facilities 
would be a mammoth step andreas said it could multiply many 
times over the investment that we make over there 
however the us businessmen noted that barriers remain such 
as the emigration reforms which make americans leery of jumping 
in wholeheartedly 
the message we got across the board was theyre interested in 
american investment but until they finish their voting and 
parliament and we see whether therell be any central government 
left therell still be some question marks about how much money 
anyone will invest said h leighton steward chairman of the 
louisiana land and exploration co of new orleans

oklahoma voters enacted the nations first 
sweeping limit on how long politicians can hold elective office 
but in massachusetts they did it the old fashioned way and threw 
them out 
in a primary election that was reminiscent of the french 
revolution heads rolled at all levels of the massachusetts ballot 
a lot of voters have been very angry for a long time and they 
finally got a chance to go to the ballot and say so said ralph 
whitehead analyst at the university of massachusetts 
in the democratic primary john silber easily defeated former 
attorney general francis bellotti for the nomination to succeed 
gov michael dukakis silber on leave as president of boston 
university ran as the antiestablishment candidate 
winning the republican gubernatorial nomination was former us 
attorney william weld who also ran an outsiders campaign against 
state house republican leader steven pierce 
candidates all the way down the ballot who held elective office 
were defeated including attorney general james shannon who said 
he was swept away by a political tidal wave 
a certain kiss of death was close association with dukakis in 
silber democrats nominated a candidate who admitted without 
hesitation that he voted for republican george bush in the 1988 
presidential election 
but is that anger a nationwide phenomenon that will sweep 
incumbents from office this november 
the antiestablishment sentiment said analyst william 
schneider is a very potent theme its out there it may be 
stronger in mssachusetts than elsewhere but with the economic 
downturn its going to catch on elsewhere too 
a prevailing theory is that 1990 will be a tough year for 
incumbents as voters concerned about the economy and angry over 
the savings and loan scandals are attracted to new faces 
but until this week incumbents generally had survived 
challenges 
an exception was in the district of columbia where democrats 
nominated sharon pratt dixon for mayor the clear outsider in a 
fivecandidate field the result was widely considered a protest by 
an electorate angered by the citys crime and financial problems 
as well as by mayor marion barrys legal difficulties 
how deep that anger runs may be seen in november when barry who 
was convicted on a cocaine possession charge is on the ballot as 
an independent candidate for the city council 
but elsewhere endangered incumbents withstood challenges just 
a week ago gov rudy perpich of minnesota swept past a democratic 
primary opponent who polls had once shown running even with the 
governor in maryland congressman roy dyson easily topped three 
democratic challengers despite a solid year of bad publicity 
including the recent disclosure that the hawkish congressman had 
been a conscientious objector during the vietnam war 
the results from massachusetts and oklahoma seemed to blow away 
any complacency on the part of incumbents 
by a 2to1 margin oklahoma voters approved a constitutional 
amendment placing a 12year lifetime limit on state legislative 
service the first state to do so but probably not the last 
similar proposals will be on the november ballot in california 
and colorado and additional proposals have been introduced in new 
york and florida 
oklahoma voters also backed the outsiders in the primaries for 
governor giving the nod to david walters over veteran congressman 
wes watkins for the democratic nomination and for bill price over 
vince orza in the gop balloting orza had the backing of republican 
gov henry bellmon who is retiring 
even in washington state for no clear reason voters threw the 
chief justice of the state supreme court out of office in favor of 
an unknown challenger who never campaigned 
charles johnson who defeated chief justice keith callow said 
he entered the race because nobody ever runs against these guys 
and i think people want somebody else to vote for 
observers of the electoral purge in massachusetts cautioned that 
the level of voter anger in that state was not likely to be seen 
elsewhere 
there is a sense of betrayal here said schneider who is on 
the faculty at boston college michael dukakis ran for president 
on the massachusetts miracle and its a lie they feel lied to 
they feel betrayed by the whole political establishment 
its virulent up here to a level that is probably not quite as 
true in other places said steve grossman a massachusetts 
businessman who is a member of the democratic national committee 
political activist ann lewis said the results signal the 
growing irrelevance of party she said the massachusetts results 
were not a referendum on liberal versus conservative it was a 
referendum on the ins versus the outs

the internal revenue service is dropping a 
bribery charge against a dead man and is asking that his 110000 
bail be turned over to his estate but its still seeking back 
taxes from him 
the irs had questioned whether ehsanolla motaghed had actually 
died and said it was considering digging up his grave for proof 
but a court document filed in august indicated the government had 
dropped exhumation plans 
at a hearing tuesday attorneys for both sides told a magistrate 
they agreed to dismiss a charge that motaghed paid a 4000 bribe 
to an irs agent 
they also said they agreed that motagheds bond be turned over 
to his daughter 
meantime the irs filed 156337 in liens against the estate of 
motaghed who imported optical lenses the irs claims motaghed owed 
that amount in personal income taxes for 198587 
the axiom the only things that are certain are death and

american troops eager for entertainment in the 
blazing sands of saudi arabia will have to wait a little longer 
a planned tour by comedian steve martin to entertain us troops 
has been postponed by at least 10 days to allow the forces more 
time for their military duties an official said wednesday 
martin was scheduled to head for saudi arabia at the start of 
october but he wont go before oct 15 said kevin mccarthy 
executive producer of the united service organization uso 
the private nonprofit group has signed up martin and other 
celebrities to entertain the more than 150000 american soldiers 
sailors and airmen deployed in the persian gulf area 
weve been told theyre the military not ready said 
mccarthy 
he said uso was ready to send its staff and entertainers to 
saudi arabia immediately but it also understands that logistical 
considerations come first 
defense officials originally planned to have all us troops and 
equipment in saudi arabia by oct 1 but delays have been reported 
in the massive operation 
in a related development marine commandant gen al gray issued 
a statement saying that while he doesnt object to entertainment 
for his troops in saudi arabia its too soon to start such 
programs 
a spokesman issued the statement to clarify remarks gray made 
tuesday in which he said it was inappropriate to send entertainers 
to saudi arabia 
the remarks caused concern at uso which contacted the 
commandants office and received a clarification of his comments to 
reporters at camp lejeune nc 
the majority of marines have been there less than a month and 
they still have much to do to prepare themselves to carry out the 
tasks assigned said grays spokesman lt col fred peck 
with the marines still digging in and preparing defenses 
against a possible iraqi attack thats where our focus must be 
anything else detracts from the mission 
but once things settle down a little bit gray would be 
happy to have uso entertainers in saudi arabia peck said

talks among cambodias warring factions 
collapsed wednesday over disagreements on how to bring rebel leader 
prince norodom sihanouk onto a council seeking to end 11 years of 
civil war 
the factions accused each other of sabotaging the supreme 
national council formed last week to join members of the 
vietnameseinstalled government and the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition 
the 12seat council held its opening session monday at the 
cambodian embassy in bangkok progress quickly stalled when the 
government side refused guerrilla demands that sihanouk be the 
councils 13th member and its chairman 
we have not been able to reach any agreement at all 
cambodian premier hun sen told a news conference before leaving for 
home wednesday but he called it only a temporary adjournment 
the council established under a undrafted peace plan has 
six seats for the government and two spots for each of the three 
rebel factions the plan also allows for a 13th seat for a 
chairman 
the rebel coalition includes the noncommunist forces of 
sihanouk and former cambodian premier son sann who have been 
backed by washington and the chinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
ek sereywath a spokesman for sihanouk expressed optimism the 
dispute would be settled before the oct 18 deadline for cambodias 
new credentials to the un general assembly the supreme national 
council is supposed to replace the rebel resistance in the un 
seat 
hun sen wants to go to the un and he will compromise ek 
said 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan said the issue must be settled 
so that the paris international conference on cambodia can be 
recovened the 19nation conference ended last year after failing 
to reach a peace plan 
the guerrillas say sihanouk must be chairman because only he was 
accepted by all parties and could bring about national 
reconciliation and implement the un plan the plan was adopted 
last month by the five permanent members of the security council 
the united states soviet union china britain and france 
but hun sen said sihanouk could be chairman if he replaced 
someone already on the council and if the 13th seat went to the 
governments side if sihanouk joined as the 13th member the 
government said it also must have another member 
a khmer rouge statement claimed the governments position was an 
attempt to prolong the war in cambodia 
sihanouk said from his beijing home that he was ill and could 
not go to bangkok his son and chief representative prince norodom 
ranariddh left for paris on tuesday after attending the first 
session of the council 
when ranariddh left it all fell apart the khmer rouge took 
over the meeting said a thai official who demanded anonymity 
we got a call from prince sihanouk in beijing who said he would 
agree to anything the khmer rouge wanted 
the un plan proposes the council would cede much of its power 
to a un interim authority and peacekeeping force until free 
elections un officials have said up to 20000 troops and 
civilian personnel could be sent to cambodia to monitor the 
transition 
the cambodian war began with vietnams invasion in late 1978 
which ended four years of khmer rouge rule the khmer rouge tried 
to transform the nation into a radical agrarian society resulting 
in the deaths of nearly 1 million people

the democratic and republican parties can claim 
nearequal numbers of texans for the first time this century 
according to a newspaper poll 
the poll results show growth of the republican party and a 
decline for the democratic party in texas said university of 
houston political scientist richard murray who conducted the poll 
for the houston chronicle 
in the most recent study 34 percent of those questioned said 
they think of themselves as democrats 33 percent as republicans 
and 33 percent said they were independent the percentages were 
rounded off 
the republican party clearly has reached parity with the 
democrats murray said 
a year ago a poll by murray showed democrats with 33 percent 
and republicans with 28 percent of voters questioned another 
survey by texas aampm university showed the parties virtually even 
with democrats at 32 percent and republicans at 31 percent 
thats compared with a survey in september 1986 showing 
democrats with 38 percent and republicans with 23 percent 
and in august 1978 when the university of houston first 
included party affiliation questions in its polls democrats drew 
48 percent and republicans 14 percent 
the latest survey was conducted sept 512 among 1042 texas 
voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage

president wojciech jaruzelski the only 
communist leader to survive politically after democratic 
revolutions swept the east bloc told parliament on wednesday he 
will resign early to help poland complete its transition to 
democracy 
jaruzelskis announcement came amid increased calls for his 
resignation to make way for a popularly chosen head of state 
solidarity chairman lech walesa has already declared his 
candidacy for president and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
walesas former adviser and ally also is considering running 
as communist party leader in 1981 jaruzelski imposed martial 
law but peacefully transferred power to a solidarityled government 
eight years later he was named president by parliament in july 
1989 for a sixyear term 
jaruzelski sent a letter wednesday to the sejm or lower house 
of parliament asking it to name a date for ending his term 
jaruzelski announced his planned resignation after a sixhour 
meeting at which the nations feuding political leaders agreed in 
principle to hold early elections for both the presidency and 
parliament no date was set for what would be postcommunist 
polands first fully democratic elections for president and 
parliament 
the current parliament was elected in jun 1989 but 65 percent 
of the seats were guaranteed to the nowdissolved communists and 
their allies 
the president wants parliament to enable him to transfer the 
office he holds to a president chosen in a general election a 
jaruzelski spokesman said in a statement 
jaruzelski is concerned about preventing unnecessary social 
emotions and willing to develop democracy according to the 
statement carried by the official pap news agency 
elections are expected as early as this fall and no later than 
spring 
participants in a meeting tuesday suggested that jaruzelski 
should resign no later than dec 13 the ninth anniversary of the 
day he declared martial law to crush the solidarity movement 
according to sources contacted by the gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
jaruzelskis election as president in 1989 came about with some 
support from solidarity parliament members it was meant to 
guarantee good relations with the soviet union in the first months 
of polands democratic reforms 
but the arrangement was overtaken by events after mazowieckis 
solidarityled government took power in september revolutions 
swept through the east bloc toppling neighboring communist 
leaders the polish party itself dissolved in january 
on monday police draggged away two dozen demonstrators of the 
confederation for independent poland who attempted to block the 
belweder palace where jaruzelski has his office 
the protesters chanted jaruzelski must go and affixed 
posters with the caption already too long to the palaces iron 
gates they derided the police as soviet servants some 
protesters were detained briefly 
a petition demanding the presidents resignation was launched 
recently by the center alliance a political group formed to back 
walesa for president 
the 67yearold jaruzelski who often appears remote behind his 
dark glasses remains a complex figure in polands political life 
responsible for among the most traumatic events in modern polish 
history walesa and mazowiecki were among thousands imprisoned by 
the military government he also is the only communist leader in 
the east bloc to retain office after democratic governments took 
over 
although technically empowered as president to run the army the 
police and the nations foreign policy jaruzelski has taken a 
backseat role and never interfered with the solidarityled 
overhaul of polands government and economy 
born to a landedgentry family in an eastern polish village he 
was attending a catholic boarding school in warsaw when world war 
ii broke out 
his official biography says he stayed in the northeastern 
territories of the soviet union working as a laborer during the 
war but poles who knew his family have said they were caught by 
the invading soviet army and deported to siberia where 
jaruzelskis father felled logs in a forced labor camp until his 
death 
in 1943 jaruzelski entered a soviet officer training school and 
then served with the communistled polish first army which 
advanced with the red army against the nazis 
he joined the polish communist party in 1947 rising through the 
ranks until he was appointed defense minister in 1968 then the 
youngest of the east blocs top military chiefs 
in 1981 as poland was being rocked by the defiance of eastern 
europes only legal independent trade union jaruzelski was named 
first secretary of the communist party the only career military 
officer to rise to supreme power in the east bloc 
although he has spoken of the very painful decision to 
impose martial law he has never repudiated the declaration

iraqi soldiers in kuwait are torturing 
and executing kuwaitis seizing youths for possible drafting and 
restructuring the very face of kuwait to make it more a part of 
iraq according to refugees 
soldiers are searching house to house for westerners and have 
turned kuwait citys embassy row into an armed camp surrounding 
western missions with tanks and leveling their cannons at them the 
escapees say 
iraqi authorities have even banned dawn prayers in kuwait as 
they come before the end of the 11 pm to 7 am curfew 
tales of the oncestable emirate now plunged into fear and chaos 
continued to emerge as refugees squeezed through a border 
checkpoint into saudi arabia six weeks after iraqi president saddam 
hussein sent in his army overrunning and annexing kuwait 
the iraqis are out to demolish anything that has to do with 
kuwait renaming streets hospitals and other institutions and 
buildings so that it is all becoming iraqi said one man 
interviewed at the border who identified himself only as a 
professional worker 
another escapee interviewed in manama bahrain who said he was 
a state technocrat said the iraqis renamed the alsabah hospital 
as saddam hospital and were taking apart a traffic circle in 
kuwait city opposite the sheraton hotel to put up a lifesize 
statue of saddam in its place 
on the kuwaiti side of the 12milewide no mans land near the 
border crossing at khafji northeastern saudi arabia iraqi 
soldiers were confiscating papers that identified anyone as a 
kuwaiti refugees said 
i want the world to know that the iraqis threatened to take my 
9monthold baby boy from the lap of his mother at the border post 
if we would not give them our passports all our identification 
papers including car registration said the man who said he was a 
professional worker 
they insisted they take every document anything that bears 
the name of kuwait he said 
it was unclear why the soldiers were confiscating the passports 
and other documents but refugees speculated it was so iraq could 
send spies or terrorists abroad on forged papers or just to keep 
kuwaitis out 
several refugees told of summary executions of kuwaitis in the 
streets by iraqi soldiers soldiers also seized young men trying to 
flee their homeland and stopped asian housemaids trying to cross 
into saudi arabia 
most of the household workers in oilrich kuwait were asian and 
the refugees said they believed the iraqis might be preparing to 
pressure developing nations to drop support for un sanctions 
several kuwaiti refugees said soldiers were demanding that the 
servants be brought back to kuwait city or left to fend for 
themselves at the roadside 
they gave no explanations and no argument would help despite 
the tears and the screaming one refugee said 
while the number of westerners in kuwait has been reduced 
because saddam allowed thousands of women and children to leave 
hundreds of thousands of asians remain mainly in miserable 
condition as they await their governments to help release them 
the indian government wednesday said it had dispatched two ships 
to pick up as many as 2500 refugees from iraq and kuwait so far 
india has evacuated 48575 of its nationals since the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion of kuwait about 175000 indians were in kuwait and 10000 
were in iraq when the crisis erupted 
the entire population of kuwait including thirdcountry 
nationals is being subjected to a reign of terror systematically 
planned and relentlessly pursued by the iraqi occupiers the 
kuwaiti ambassador to the united nations mohammad abulhasan said 
in a letter to the un secretarygeneral monday 
iraqi criminal practices are being stepped up with the 
sinister objective of making life under occupation so intolerable 
that the population is forced out in order to alter the 
demographics of kuwait abulhasan said many are being 
subjected to all sorts of intimidation and physical torture

the sputtering new york gubernatorial effort 
of republican pierre rinfret ground to a near halt wednesday as the 
manhattanbased economist admitted his campaign was broke 
a top rinfret aide said there was a strong possibility the 
candidate would cease active campaigning and rinfrets campaign 
manager announced that he was no longer part of the campaign 
rinfret making his first run for public office is waging an 
underdog campaign against democratic gov mario cuomo he was 
recruited to run by top new york party officials after other 
republicans refused to take on cuomo 
john denny rinfrets deputy campaign manager said the 
candidate was absolutely discouraged by what he perceived as a 
failure by new york republicans to support him financially 
at a private fundraiser on tuesday rinfret said that the way 
its going we cannot win the new york daily news reported 
wednesday were blowing it 
an independent statewide poll released this week had cuomo as 
the choice of 60 percent of those surveyed while less than 15 
percent backed rinfret 
our financial situation is so desperate that im probably 
going to have to shut down our entire operation this friday 
rinfret wrote to key gop leaders in a letter dated tuesday 
denny said wednesday that closing down the campaign operation 
friday remained an option 
while there was no direct plea by rinfret in the letter for 
funds republican leaders interpreted it as such and scurried to 
control the damage from rinfrets public disclosure of campaign 
problems 
its in all of our interests to help our gubernatorial 
candidate and we intend to help him to the extent we can said 
john mcardle a spokesman for state senate majority leader ralph 
marino 
meanwhile state assemblyman john faso who had been serving as 
rinfrets campaign manager issued a statement saying he was no 
longer part of the campaign 
it has been mutually decided that the campaign would take a 
different direction said faso fasos statement said he would 
continue to support rinfret but he could not be reached for 
further comment 
vice president dan quayle at a campaign stop in suburban 
buffalo on wednesday said rinfret told me last night that he was 
in this for the future he did not elaborate 
cuomo has reported having about 8 million on hand for his 
campaign while rinfret has reported raising about 900000 
including a 500000 loan from himself 
thus far the gop candidates campaign has drawn more attention 
for his controversial offthecuff comments than for his campaign 
positions 
most recently rinfret on friday called federal housing 
secretary jack kemp a traitor to the republican party and a 
lackey for governor cuomo 
rinfret said republican kemp had gone back on a promise to stage 
a fundraiser for rinfret in the buffalo area kemp aides said no 
such promise was ever made

a new era in massachusetts politics began 
wednesday launched by an eruption of voter antiestablishment 
sentiment that almost no one saw coming 
voters frustrated with the utter collapse of what gov michael 
s dukakis had termed the massachusetts economic miracle in his 
ques for the presidency turned out in record numbers to vent 
their wrath on almost any politician associated with the democratic 
old guard 
the only thing the backpedaling experts will now say is that 
the turmoil is likely to continue in the general election 
the boil hasnt been lanced and the issue is alive and well 
and will be in november said marty linsky lecturer at harvards 
john f kennedy school of government and a former republican 
legislator there are a lot of people who are going to walk in 
and say this is a little irresponsible what im doing maybe but 
ive got to shake this thing up 
the primary beneficiary of the discontent was boston university 
president john silber a toughtalking native texan running for 
governor last week pundits dismissed his candidacy after silber 
uttered what seemed to be a disastrous 11thhour shocker the 
label given to silbers frequent provocative comments this time it 
was about a minority neighborhood 
the preprimary favorite among democrats former state attorney 
general francis x bellotti who served during the dukakis era was 
said to be leading by as much as 10 percent 
but with 98 percent of the vote counted among the more than 14 
million cast it was silber with 545447 votes to bellottis 
446265 on the republican side former us attorney william weld 
defeated house minority leader steven pierce the leader in the 
polls until shortly before the primary 
it is about as angry as it gets the pollsters have never seen 
this level of anger said lou dinatale a public policy professor 
at the university of massachusetts boston theres 
antiincumbency fever out there 
at a democratic breakfast wednesday silber sounded the theme of 
revolt we do not come before voters as the old democratic party 
we have been through a watershed experience he said 
the voter mood should even raise red flags for democratic 
stalwarts like sen john kerry dmass who was unopposed in the 
primary but who now faces gop competition in november 
the notion of the public being angry is there and its being 
directed at virtually anything which smacks of traditional 
politics said paul watanabe head of the political science 
department at umass that assuredly is something to raise 
concerns all up and down the ballot 
the primary also saw the defeat of the state house speaker in 
the democratic primary for treasurer and of incumbent attorney 
general james shannon whose loss to middlesex county district 
attorney scott harshbarger reportedly marked the first primary 
defeat of an incumbent attorney general 
massachusetts legislature has been dominated by democrats since 
the 1950s its top elected offices have been held by a block of 
democrats since the early 1970s the past eight years under dukakis 
saw the creation of liberal programs fueled by a booming economy 
president bush already has pledged to do what he can to help 
ensure that a republican replaces his old rival 
silber will be teamed with the feisty marjorie clapprood a 
state representative and they will present a campaign duo 
distinctly different from dukakis and evelyn murphy both reserved 
technocrats 
murphy dropped out of the primary after her failed coup to 
attack the states fiscal problems while dukakis was out of the 
state 
clapproods consistently liberal agenda might seem to put her at 
odds with silber but she has a personality big enough to match 
silbers and she promised to work as a team referring to the new 
ticket as the yinyang of the party 
the victories of silber over bellotti and weld over pierce were 
both upsets for the party establishments with 98 percent of the 
vote counted weld took 261150 votes or 60 percent to pierces 
173146 
under the democrats who have controlled our state government 
for the past several years massachusetts has lost its way weld 
said he blasted politicians who see taxpayers as a limitless 
source of cash with which to feather their own nests or fund their 
latest experiments 
bellotti and pierce had won the endorsements of their party 
silber was generally shunned by democrats aligned with dukakis 
welds stands favoring abortion rights and distribution of condoms 
in public schools under some circumstances failed to endear him to 
gop conservatives 
silber said the promise of change he raised in the primary would 
continue to be the theme of his general election race 
weld a boston brahmin who quit the justice department over his 
displeasure with reports about the personal finances of his boss 
edwin meese won through a combination of personal campaigning 
aggressive debate performances and a contribution of more than 1 
million from his own checkrm rates such as mortgage 
rates lower and the fed would do its part by helping to lower 
shortterm rates 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co said 
that greenspans testimony signaled new fed concerns about a 
possible steep downward slide in the dollar if the fed pushed 
interest rates lower at a time when other countries were raising 
their rates to fight inflation 
this was a major departure he emphasized strongly the dangers 
in a declining dollar it means he will delay any easing steps 
jones said 
the fed chairman said that if crude oil prices average around 
30 per barrel over the next year about 10 above the price before 
aug 2 the higher oil prices would likely lower economic growth by 
a full percentage point over a years time while boosting the 
inflation rate by up to 2 percentage points 
a fed report released wednesday on conditions in various parts 
of the country emphasized the weak economy the report known as 
the beige book said economic activity in the feds 12 regions 
was either expanding more slowly at present or actually declining 
weakness is most apparent in the northeastern and midatlantic 
districts the report said 
asked about the regional disparities during his testimony 
greenspan said that clearly the east coast was in worse shape at 
present than the west coast

a fire raced through a wooden boarding 
house for the elderly early wednesday killing four people 
officials said but a teenager was credited with saving 10 others 
by desperately dragging them to safety 
i went to the back of the house where the four people 
perished but the heat and fire were too much said shawn bates 
16 i thank god for the people i got out and i wish i could have 
done more for the other people 
bates a high school junior and football player said he ran 
from room to room carrying and dragging people out but was unable 
to reach the last four people 
the fire was reported at wilsons a onestory wooden boarding 
home for the elderly and infirm around 230 am said capt 
richard davis of the bessemer fire department 
when firefighters arrived bates already had rescued 10 of the 
15 residents and one woman had escaped on her own 
of the four fatalities two were in wheelchairs and all four 
were invalids davis said 
bates who sleeps in the boarding house and whose parents live 
next door said a fire alarm alerted him to the blaze and when he 
ran out of his room he found the fire had been started by an 
elderly man smoking on a couch 
bates said the man fought with him but he managed to drag him 
and another man from the building then he said i went in 
peoples de klerk spoke after meeting with his cabinet on further 
measures to halt the township violence 
he said special units led by deputy attorneys general would 
investigate four incidents a police shooting this month that 
killed 11 people in the sebokeng township two attacks on train 
stations in johannesburg that killed more than 30 people and an 
alleged ambush that killed a policeman 
the president also said he was considering appointing an 
indpendent investigator to handle allegations of misconduct by 
government institutions organizations or by individuals 
much of the fighting has pitted xhosas and other blacks linked 
to the anc against zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement anc and other black leaders have accused police of 
favoring inkatha and called for a purge of rightwing elements 
from security forces 
there was no immediate anc response to de klerks announcement 
inkatha and the anc oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and 
plans for a future south africa their power struggle in the 
eastern province of natal has claimed about 5000 lives since 1986 
de klerk spoke a day after the government announced plans to 
prosecute winnie mandela the wife of nelson mandela on charges of 
kidnapping and assault for the 1988 abduction and beating of four 
young men her prosecution could harm the ancgovernment 
negotiations 
mrs mandela said wednesday she was detained by police for about 
three hours after handing over spent cartridges from an assault 
rifle given to her by residents of the tokoza township she accused 
police of harassing her and her husband 
the whole idea really is to undermine the anc she said 
the anc said it condemns the harassment meted out to mrs 
winnie mandela by police intent on curbing the normal activity 
of the anc 
mrs mandela was traveling in her white mercedes benz through 
the tokoza township when she was stopped at a police roadblock 
mrs mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting 
said police spokeswoman capt ida van zweel she handed them to a 
policeman there is no crime involved 
in the 1988 incident four young men were abducted and beaten at 
mrs mandelas house according to court testimony 
one of them was killed and the head of mrs mandelas former 
bodyguard unit jerry richardson has been convicted of murder 
kidnapping and assault the three survivors testified mrs mandela 
beat them with a whip she has denied wrongdoing 
mrs mandela faces four counts of kidnapping and four counts of 
assault and is expected to be formally charged monday 
i welcome the decision in the sense it will give me the chance 
to clear my name after this trial by media she said 
if convicted on all counts mrs mandelas punishment could 
range from a suspended sentence to the death penalty prosecutors 
said no one has ever been executed for kidnapping or assault in 
south africa 
also wednesday police used rubber bullets and tear gas to 
disperse about 200 students at the university of the witwatersrand 
protesting alleged police bias in the recent township violence 
mervyn shear vicechancellor of the university in downtown 
johannesburg was hit in the hip by a rubber bullet but was not 
seriously hurt his office said police said the protest was

rankandfile members of congress began 
deserting party leaders over the stalled budget summit wednesday 
saying it is time to abandon the talks and let lawmakers fight it 
out over their fiscal priorities 
there is very little sentiment for continuing on this path for 
summit meetings that go nowhere said rep richard durbin 
dill after a closeddoor meeting at which many of the 257 house 
democrats complained about the budget standoff 
we think they should junk the budget summit said rep dan 
burton rind we werent elected to sit around and wait we were 
elected to do the job 
the complaints came as congress five highestranking leaders 
and three top administration officials met for a second day in the 
capitol in hopes of finding their way to a deficitreduction deal 
the goal is to put together a collection of new taxes and 
spending cuts that will cut the budget gap by 50 billion next year 
and 500 billion over the next five years the two sides 
stalemated over the budget all year on monday ended 10 days of 
talks at nearby andrews air force base 
the rankandfile impatience was fueled by impending drastic 
cuts in federal spending under the grammrudman law when the new 
fiscal year starts oct 1 the law in the absence of specific 
cuts will automatically trim the 12 trillion federal budget by 
about 100 billion 
as the deadline neared democrats and republicans began 
separately piecing together budgets reflecting each partys 
spending and tax goals 
burton and others said they could balance the budget within 
seven years increasing spending for all programs by 4 percent 
annually but not raising taxes 
some democrats were talking of a plan to raise taxes on the 
wealthy while relying on deeper defense cuts but shallower 
reductions in domestic programs that are likely to emerge from the 
budget negotiations 
if we sat down with some discussions we could have a 
significant deficitreduction package with broad support on the 
democratic side said rep martin olav sabo dminn 
congressional leaders meanwhile expressed optimism that the 
bipartisan negotiations would eventually produce a compromise 
its wrong to suggest its such a polarizing thing that we 
cant get an agreement said house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
but the leaders conceded that with the grammrudman cuts about 
to be imposed lawmakers have to be prepared to act 
if we cant come to an agreement we cant just sit back 
said the house budget committee chairman rep leon panetta 
dcalif 
some lawmakers expressed a willingness to use the grammrudman 
cuts to put political pressure on the other side with many 
democrats saying they could convince the public that such cuts 
would be the result of republican insistence on tax breaks for the 
wealthy 
if theyve got to suffer that pain for a little while its 
okay with me said the house ways and means committee chairman 
rep dan rostenkowski dill 
but the no 2 house republican rep newt gingrich of georgia 
said the public would blame such a spending cuts on the democrats 
i think 48 hours of sequester will help solve the problem 
he said using the technical name for the grammrudman reductions 
democrats have said the budget talks have stalled because 
republicans insist the capital gains tax rate must be reduced to 
stimulate the economy democrats oppose the cut which they say 
would mainly benefit wealthy property owners 
republicans say they want deeper cuts in domestic programs than 
democrats are willing to accept they also oppose some democratic 
tax proposals such as their plan to raise energy taxes by 49 
billion over the next five years

the us military staged private 
services wednesday for jewish troops wishing to mark the high 
holiday of rosh hashana in the land of islams most holy sites 
officially islam is the only religion allowed in saudi arabia 
but saudi government officials said they had no objections to the 
services as long as they were confined to the military camps 
military officials refused to provide details of the services or 
allow media coverage 
islam recognizes judaism and christianity but the saudis 
guardians of the islamic holy cities of mecca and medina prohibit 
practicing and proselytizing faiths other than islam 
our personnel whether jewish christian and any other faith 
are free to practice their religion as long as they do so in a 
discreet manner according to a onepage us military memo 
this is the only restriction placed on the practice of religion 
in saudi arabia and is equally applicable to all nonislamic 
religions 
christian services have been led by military chaplains since the 
early days of the american deployment those also have been off 
limits to media 
initially us military officials offered to bring jewish 
troops to a ship offshore or to neighboring bahrain for traditional 
sundown services according to sources who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
but commanders decided to arrange small services in camps where 
requested the sources said 
rosh hashana marking the jewish new year began at sundown 
wednesday 
a saudi diplomatic official speaking on condition of anonymity 
conceded some saudis may object to a jewish ceremony in their 
nation but said there was no religious basis for such complaints 
islams koran refers to jews as people of the book meaning 
the old testament and judaism and islam share many dietary rules 
but there also have periods of strain between the two religions 
particularly because of the zionist movement in israel

while voters in massachusetts and 
washington state were busy tossing incumbents out of office 
oklahomans were planting a time bomb it goes off in another 12 
years unless voters decide to defuse it 
a ballot measure that passed overwhelmingly tuesday limits 
legislators to a lifetime maximum of 12 years in office one 
veteran legislator said wednesday that the measure let people take 
out their frustrations on a faceless target 
people always are upset with the legislature as the they 
but they like their own legislator said state sen gene stipe a 
democrat who has been in the legislature since 1949 with only one 
fouryear break in service this was a chance to strike out at 
the rascals and they took it 
still stipe said the sky is not going to fall this will not 
take effect for 12 years the pendulum of public opinion swings 
back and the people generally right any wrong they have done 
the constitutional amendment becomes effective jan 1 but 
legislators now in office may serve 12 more years 
it was the second time in three years the voters had acted to 
put a crimp on legislative activities they adopted another 
amendment in 1988 that sharply limited the time the legislature 
could be in session 
oklahomans also decided on their nominees for governor in close 
democratic and republican runoffs 
david walters the 1986 democratic nominee won another shot at 
the governors office and former us attorney bill price defeated 
restaurateur vince orza in a strong comeback from the august 
republican primary 
orza had led the ticket in the primary with 40 percent of the 
vote to 27 percent for price price won tuesdays election with 51 
percent of the vote 
walters also received 51 percent in defeating us rep wes 
watkins who decided against seeking another term in congress to 
run for governor 
walters price and independent thomas ledgerwood will be on the 
nov 6 ballot seeking to replace gov henry bellmon who did not 
seek reelection 
lloyd noble ii the tulsa oil man who circulated the initiative 
petition that got the termlimitation issue hailed the vote as 
democracy in action 
stipe contended the action concentrated more power in the 
media and more power to the lobbyists stipe and other 
legislators had warned that passage would mean that inexperienced 
legislators will lean on lobbyists and get direction from newspaper 
editorials in making their legislative decisions 
it is always good to have someone around who remembers what 
the bureaucrats problems were four or six years ago and what the 
lobbyists said then said stipe 
still stipe added ive always believed in what the people 
say we should do i can serve until the year 2004 and right 
now i plan to do just that

a final decision in the governments 
conflictofinterest case against neil bush wont be made until 
next spring a federal regulator said wednesday 
the presidents 35yearold son faces a public hearing starting 
next tuesday in denver on the governments charges against him 
bush was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association a denver thrift that collapsed in late 1988 at a cost 
to taxpayers estimated at 1 billion 
the office of thrift supervision is seeking an order against 
bush which effectively could bar him from working for a bank or a 
savings and loan the thrift agency contends that bush failed to 
adequately disclose to silverado his business relationships with 
developers kenneth m good and bill l walters two big borrowers 
from the institution 
bush has denied any wrongdoing 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson wont make an 
immediate decision on the case after the hearing before him both 
sides will file detailed written arguments which are due on oct 
23 ots chief counsel harris weinstein told reporters at a 
briefing 
bush and the regulators will have until nov 6 to respond in 
writing to each others arguments weinstein said that deadline 
like others in the proceeding could be extended 
after considering the two sides briefs davidson is expected to 
make a nonbinding recommendation by dec 6 to ots director timothy 
ryan 
the judge could recommend to ryan that the regulators proposed 
ceaseanddesist order against bush be issued or he could rule 
against it the order would bar bush from engaging in future 
actions that would involve a conflict of interest 
davidson also could recommend a stronger permanent prohibition 
weinstein said five other former officers and directors of 
silverado including former chairman michael r wise consented to 
prohibition orders earlier this year 
the ceaseanddesist order proposed by ots would stop short of 
totally banning bush from the financial institutions industry but 
could impose strict conditions on his holding such a job in the 
future a prohibition order would be an absolute bar weinstein 
said 
a draft internal document written earlier this year by ots staff 
members recommended that a prohibition order be issued against 
bush but the thrift agency later found there wasnt sufficient 
evidence to support a prohibition and the less serious 
ceaseanddesist order was proposed an ots spokesman has said 
under the administrative timetable the two sides would be 
required to respond to davidsons recommendation by next jan 7 
ryan would make his decision by april 8 weinstein said bush 
would have the right to appeal the decision most likely to the 
us court of appeals in denver he said 
at next weeks hearing the regulators will challenge the 
testimony of expert witnesses called by bush to defend his actions 
bush also will testify 
the ots will call other outside experts former silverado 
officials and some of its own regulators to buttress the 
governments case against bush witnesses to be called by the 
agency include wise russell murray a former loan officer at 
silverado and florian barth a former silverado director 
wise and murray have been issued subpoenas to testify while the 
other witnesses are appearing voluntarily wise has said he plans 
to take the fifth amendment and decline to answer some questions 
because they could incriminate him 
in that case davidson would decide whether wise would be 
allowed to do so

the former leader of the union representing 
city employees was sentenced wednesday to 46 months in prison for 
theft conspiracy mail fraud and racketeering 
earl stout may have been a good man and a generous man but 
unfortunately his generosity was with somebody elses money the 
union whose trust he enjoyed said us district judge j william 
ditter jr 
stout who will be 68 this month headed district council 33 of 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
for 14 years he was convicted in may of stealing more than 
700000 from the union which represents 13000 municipal workers 
most of them trash collectors 
defense attorney elizabeth ainslie was able to dissuade ditter 
from imposing the maximum 70month sentence the government sought 
stout will be on probation for three years after he serves his jail 
term 
mr stout is not an evil man ainslie said he is in 
fact a good man it is true that he acted often without 
authorization but he always acted in the best interests of the 
union which was central in his life 
stouts attorney said she would immediately appeal to the 3rd 
us circuit court of appeals she said stout would remain free on 
100000 bail pending that appeal which could take a year 
stout was convicted on 32 counts of mail fraud six of theft and 
one each of conspiracy and racketeering 
among the allegations were that he gave noshow jobs at 
unionowned john f kennedy hospital which was headed by his son 
he also was accused of hiring consultants without permission from 
the unions governing boards converting the beneficiary on two 
life insurance policies on himself from the hospital to his family 
and using hospital employees to work on properties owned by his 
family or his friends 
ditter also ordered stout to make restitution to the union of 
445309 although assistant us attorney john dodds had asked the 
judge to order stout to repay 1016281 
union attorney howard kaufman told the judge restitution was 
important and that stout without authority took thousands and 
thousands of dollars 
stout said nothing to the judge before sentencing 
the judge said the sentence was limited to federal guidelines 
and acknowledged stout did a great deal for the union members 
but he also did a great deal for himself 
ainslie said stout had no comment after the sentence he was 
obviously relieved it wasnt a longer sentence she said 
she said stout never stole money from the union even if he may 
have wasted it and that she would pursue that argument on appeal 
cynthia bullock former head of the unions legal services 
program was convicted with stout on may 4 of illegally getting 
money from the union treasury ditter sentenced her wednesday to 
six months of house detention followed by five years probation 
ms bullock was convicted of conspiracy mail fraud and 
embezzlement

who is charles johnson everyone wanted to know 
on wednesday the day after the little known tacoma lawyer pulled 
off the political upset of the year in washington state 
no one is quite sure how or why but johnson defeated the chief 
justice of the state supreme court in tuesdays primary thus 
virtually assuring himself of winning washingtons top judicial job 
in november 
his victory over chief justice keith callow came out of nowhere 
all eyes had been on another state supreme court race in which 
former gov john spellman was challenging justice richard guy the 
power of incumbency worked for guy who staved off spellman 
but for no immediately apparent reason the same quirky voters 
bounced callow an amiable moderate who had made neither waves nor 
enemies on the bench by a 53to47 percent margin they picked the 
39yearold johnson who had done little more than pay his filing 
fee and wait for lightning to strike 
johnson as amazed as anyone said he decided to run because 
nobody ever runs against these guys and i think the people want 
someone else to vote for they wanted a new face on the bench 
im not a politician he added im not a democrat or 
republican im a true independent i owe nothing to anyone i 
accepted no campaign contributions i paid my 800 filing fee out 
of my own pocket 
there was a sense of disbelief at the high court 
were in shock here we dont know what happened said 
supreme court clerk jerry merritt 
justice bob utter senior member of the high court said he had 
no explanation 
its obvious keith should have campaigned utter said 
callow conceded the point 
between the filing period and election with court business 
with the bar association meeting and with the judicial conference 
i didnt campaign he didnt campaign and now the voters have 
spoken callow said 
i wish johnson well he added and i wish the court well 
the next six years 
secretary of state ralph munro suggested that voters may have 
confused johnson with king county superior court judge charles v 
johnson or possibly justice charles z smith both well known in 
king county the states largest 
that theory washed out when it was learned that callow had 
outpolled johnson in king county 
i dont know what you can attribute it to except the name 
confusion munro said i think this is going to prompt a look 
at the law 
munro said it might be better to have supreme court races 
decided in the general rather than the primary election even when 
there are only two candidates 
johnsons name will appear alone on the ballot nov 6 virtually 
assuring him of election 
johnson said he is a graduate of the university of puget sound 
law school and has been practicing criminal and civil law in tacoma 
for 13 years 
he said he probably could be considered conservative but his 
answers to questions suggested no strong ideological leaning 
he said he is strongly prochoice on abortion he supports the 
death penalty but does not want to see a speedup in the appeal 
process for death cases 
johnson said he wasnt worried that the sitting justices would 
resent him or regard him as unqualified 
i dont know any of the justices but i know their work he 
said i read every decision handed down by the supreme court and 
i read every legal article i can lay my hands on i have the legal 
knowledge needed to sit on the court

the episcopal churchs house of bishops has 
disassociated itself from the ordination nine months ago of a 
homosexual priest 
church spokesmen said the bishops after an emotional debate at 
their autumn meeting voted narrowly to affirm that it is 
inappropriate to ordain a practicing homosexual 
we regret the hurt and confusion caused for many members of 
the church and by subsequent events the bishops said of the 
ordination last december of the rev robert williams by bishop john 
spong of newark nj 
we believe that good order is not served when bishops 
dioceses or parishes act unilaterally said the resolution 
submitted by bishop william wantland of eau claire wis and 
approved tuesday 
spong later suspended williams from functioning in the diocese 
after he made public remarks disparaging monogamy and the celibacy 
of mother teresa of india 
however spong sharply critized his fellow bishops action 
saying 
the way the church treats its gay and lesbian members 
strains the very fabric of my life by tearing it between my loyalty 
to jesus christ who made a habit of embracing the outcast and my 
loyalty to a church that historically has rejected blacks women 
and gays 
bishop william frey dean of trinity school for ministry in 
pennsylvania characterized the bishops action as a mild 
reprimand 
some have said this is a gun pointed at the head of spong 
frey said but its really a water pistol

forced labor is widespread in china according 
to a congressional report that says some prison products may be 
reaching the united states illegally 
the general accounting office an investigative agency of 
congress says china with millions of prisoners in 3000 to 5000 
reeducation facilities uses inmates in farming mining and 
manufacturing 
the report prepared for the senate foreign relations committee 
and made public this week says the customs service is 
investigating allegations that such goods have been imported into 
the united states 
the report says products made by chinese prisoners include tin 
handmade rugs fireworks baskets bags and clothing 
both government and private sources have circumstantial 
evidence that the products of forced labor have been exported by 
china and that such products might have reached the united 
states the report said 
the importation of products made by foreign prisoners is illegal 
under a 100yearold law 
the congressional report is based on information from private 
and government sources 
tracing inmatemade goods is difficult because most products 
from china pass through several business transactions before they 
reach us consumers the report said 
it quoted a chinese press report as saying that prisoners 
produce 5000 products yielding 15 billion in sales annually 
some prisoner labor also has been used to attract foreign 
investors for joint ventures the report said citing the case of a 
chinese wine jointly produced with a french company using grapes 
grown on prison farms the practice was stoped when the french 
discovered the source of the grapesthe report said

the senate judiciary committee completed 
hearings on supreme court nominee david souter on wednesday with 
all signs pointing to quick approval 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel tentatively set a 
committee vote for next thursday while confident republicans were 
already looking ahead to the timing of a vote by the full senate 
senate gop leader bob dole and sen orrin hatch a senior member 
of the judiciary panel said there should be a quick final vote so 
souter could take his place as the nations 105th supreme court 
justice in time for the start of the fall term on oct 1 
while some lawmakers have voiced reservations none has spoken 
out against souter and several members of the judiciary committee 
told him as his three days of testimony neared an end on monday 
that his confirmation was all but certain 
informal speeches supporting him were already beginning on the 
senate floor on wednesday 
a democrat sen j james exon of nebraska said souter would be 
fair to those who came before him and that is all we can ask and 
all we can expect from a member of the supreme court 
a number of republicans added their praise including john 
chafee rri who said that souter had been careful to avoid 
commitments on key issues but if we want to take a leap of faith 
judge souter in my judgment is the best one to take that leap 
with 
arlen specter the pennsylvania republican whose opposition 
helped defeat the nomination of robert bork said of souter i 
intend to support him in committee and on the floor 
the committee on wednesday heard conflicting views on whether 
souter who has spent most of his 51 years living in a small new 
hampshire town was sensitive to the concerns of minorities 
wesley williams jr a washington attorney who traced his 
friendship with souter back to harvard college and harvard law 
school told the committee that souter was fundamentally fair 
lacking in prejudice 
williams who is black said he was confident souter would be 
prepared to do the right thing in fighting discrimination once 
on the high court 
but haywood burns past president of the national lawyers guild 
and another harvard acquaintance said he wasnt so sure 
i did not find he had an understanding of human rights said 
burns who also is black the person that i knew is very 
different than the one mr williams described 
sen paul simon dill said he had a considerable amount of 
unease about souters appreciation of civil rights issues based 
on his record as a judge souters comments during three days of 
testimony at the confirmation hearings appeared more 
enlightened simon said but he wondered whether that represented 
personal growth or political acumen 
a leading conservative on wednesday also opposed souter 
questioning his moral underpinnings on a different issue 
abortion 
howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus said based 
on souters record he was absolutely certain that judge 
souter has a permissive view toward abortion 
an antiabortion member of the committee sen gordon humphrey 
rnh said he too was troubled but reflecting the view of many 
conservatives said he would give the nominee the benefit of the 
doubt 
perhaps souter had never really given it deep thought said 
humphrey 
despite doubts put forth on both ends of the political spectrum 
no stated opposition to souter has emerged in the senate 
some witnesses at the hearings implored biden to bring souter 
back to the stand for more questions but he refused he said the 
schedule for the confirmation vote was being worked out with the 
republicans who were pushing for quick action 
after three days and 18 hours of often grueling congressional 
testimony judge souter has demonstrated to america that he 
deserves a place on our nations highest court said dole rkan 
i urge the judiciary committee to act as quickly as possible 
so that judge souter can be confirmed by the full senate before the 
supreme court begins its october term he said 
hatch rutah a senior member of the committee said souter 
would be handicapped if he didnt join the court on time 
i want him on the court by oct 1 hatch said by law the 
court session begins that day the first monday in october 
in other testimony wednesday homosexual rights advocates 
opposed souter law enforcement groups endorsed him 
urvashi vaid director of the national gay amp lesbian task force 
said souter would continue the shameful denial of equal justice 
under which gay and lesbian americans live tilting the court to 
the right in critical areas of civil rights and privacy 
much of the gayrights opposition was based on a new hampshire 
supreme court decision in which souter joined in saying that 
homosexuals could be barred from adopting children 
dewey stokes national president of the fraternal order of 
police said law enforcement officers appreciated souters 
practical approach in criminal cases 
judge souter has demonstrated an appreciation for the 
application of blackletter law to fact patterns and situations 
faced daily by police that do not always lend themselves to 
tidy legalistic conclusions he said

an electrical surgical instrument caused the 
flash fire that killed a patient in a hospital operating room fire 
officials said 
the cauterizing tool used to sear small blood vessels and 
lessen bleeding during surgery apparently brushed against a metal 
instrument tray causing sparks that ignited material draped over 
the patient at university of californialos angeles medical center 
investigators said tuesday 
this was a terribly unfortunate accident deputy fire chief 
davis parsons said at a news conference about the findings of an 
investigation into the may 28 fire that killed angela hernandez 
ms hernandez 26 was being treated for heart and liver damage 
suffered in a traffic accident 
the cauterizing tool was not in use when the fire began but was 
dangling from an instrument tray said battalion chief william 
burmester 
in october 1988 a cauterizing tool started a fire that killed a 
15dayold infant undergoing heart surgery at cedarssinai medical 
center 
the pensized tool has been common in operating rooms since the 
1920s in the oxygenrich environment of an operating room any 
spark can easily ignite flammable materials investigators said 
fire officials called for legislation requiring flameresistant 
surgical drapery

the virus that causes fever blisters and cold 
sores also may cause the arteryblocking clots that lead to heart 
attacks according to a study 
the suspect organism is herpes simplex virus1 or hsv1 which 
can remain dormant in the body for years according to a report by 
university of minnesota researchers in tuesdays issue of the 
proceedings of the national academy of science 
the report says the clots may be caused by a flashing on or 
sudden activation of hsv1 the virus can set off a series of 
changes in the lining of a coronary artery that touch off clot 
formation and inhibit the dissolution of the clots the researchers 
said 
heart attacks occur when the blood supply to the heart is 
blocked 
if our hypothesis is correct it could lead to treatment that 
would prevent the herpes virus from being flashed on said dr 
harry jacob head of hematology at the university of minnesota and 
leader of the study 
jacob emphasized that the research has all been at the 
laboratory bench we havent looked at this in people 
in spite of that dr morrison hodges chief of cardiology at 
hennepin county medical center in minneapolis said the finding 
sounds very exciting 
the idea of being able to get at the molecular basis for 
plaque and the subsequent clot formation is exciting he said 
getting at the basic mechanism of vexing medical problems is a 
real clinical problem 
gregory vercellotti one of the researchers said the herpes 
virus infects cells in the lining of the artery and halts 
production of molecules that usually prevent blood from sticking to 
it the virus also can cause platelets in the blood to stick 
together he said 
jacob said it is possible that hsv2 which causes genital 
herpes also may be involved in coronary disease that theory is 
untested 
he said the drug acyclovir can suppress herpes symptoms but 
there is no evidence that the drug would prevent heart attacks 
at least 70 percent of americans have been exposed to hsv1 and 
millions of people develop fever blisters when exposed to intense 
sunlight friction or some form of stress thats an indication 
that the virus lies inactive in the body until something activates 
it 
the hypothesis that the herpes virus lies dormant in the inner 
wall of a coronary artery isnt widely accepted said dr jesse 
goodman one of jacobs associates in the research 
but this is all very tantalizing goodman said 
other researchers have found traces of hsv1 in atherosclerotic 
plaque the material that narrows coronary arteries some 
researchers believe the virus causes damage that causes plaque to 
collect on the lining of the artery 
the first strong evidence of a link between herpes and heart 
attacks was reported in 1983 by dr ep benditt of the university 
of washington he found genetic markers for hsv1 in plaque that 
had been removed from patients whose clogged coronary arteries were 
surgically bypassed 
earlier this year researchers at cornell medical college 
reported discovering that the virus invades human cells by riding 
piggyback on a protein that cells need to survive the cornell 
scientists said they were on the trail of a link between the virus 
and hardening of the arteries

public spending on drug abuse treatment should 
be increased by more than 2 billion to help more users quit their 
drug habits a panel of experts recommended wednesday 
treatment needs to be recognized as a more important component 
of drug policy than it has been in recent years said lawrence s 
lewin chairman of the institute of medicine committee that studied 
the problem 
it is time we allocated sufficient resources so that everyone 
who needs drug treatment will be able to get it said lewin a 
healthpolicy consultant 
he said he was encouraged that the bush administration has 
increased support for treatment to around 600 million but the 
panel recommended boosting that by 22 billion annually to expand 
services it also recommended spending 11 billion in onetime 
costs to upgrade facilities 
an estimated 55 million people in the united states need 
treatment for drug abuse or dependence according to the panels 
report which was requested by congress 
but in 1987 the latest year for which figures were available 
about 650000 received treatment in public programs and 200000 
were treated in private programs the report said 
the present war on drugs could be fought more effectively if 
more people could get treatment on demand if the quality of 
treatment programs were improved and spending were better managed 
lewin said 
while drug treatment programs vary widely in their methods and 
results the treatment methods available today can yield benefits 
including reduced criminal activity that well exceed the costs of 
delivering these services he said 
the quality of public programs deteriorated through most of the 
1980s largely because of aid cutbacks the report said federal 
support grew quickly in the early 1970s to 300 million then 
stabilized around 260 million through the end of the decade but 
sank to 160 million in 1982 federal aid remained around that 
level until it jumped to 370 million in 1987 and 520 million in 
1989 
treatment with methadone a synthetic narcotic can effectively 
wean addicts from heroin when given in adequate doses the report 
said 
however tight regulations on its use as well as criticism that 
it substitutes one dependence for another have combined to 
encourage many programs to give lowerthaneffective doses it 
said also financial strains make it difficult for programs to 
retain competent staff it said 
therapeutic communities typically a highly structured 
residential program lasting six to 18 months with intensive therapy 
and work responsibilities were found to be effective these 
programs usually serve those with hardcore drug problems 
including people with criminal records 
outpatient nonmethadone programs of counseling and therapy were 
the least expensive but varied widely in methods and philosophies 
the panel said that while hospitalbased dependency programs are 
more expensive they are no more effective than residential 
programs for most patients 
in many communities drug abusers must wait months to enter a 
public treatment program while capacity goes unused in private 
facilities 
theres a lot of capacity if you have insurance lewin said

east germanys ousted secret police 
chief threatened to break former communist leader erich honeckers 
neck when the two faced each other in jail a west german newspaper 
reported wednesday 
you traitor 82yearold former security chief erich mielke 
shouted at honecker according to bild newspaper 
mielke also screamed at honecker ill break your neck the 
newspaper quoted witnesses as describing the scene when the two met 
in an east german jail honecker 78 was jailed for one day in 
january 
mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police known as 
stasi which built up files on 6 million east germans and kept a 
tight rein on the population he was one of honeckers closest 
aides 
after the popular revolt last fall that ousted the communist 
regime and opened the way to german unification mielke and other 
former communist leaders were jailed 
mielke remains in custody honecker was released from jail for 
health reasons 
west german authorities on tuesday opened a criminal 
investigation of mielke he is suspected of giving sanctuary to 
members of west germanys leftist terrorist group the red army 
faction and of setting up contacts between the group and 
palestinian guerrillas 
honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations 
one in west germany for obstruction of justice 
bild said the imprisoned mielke also accused other former 
communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against 
them 
one prison warden told bild that many of the guards had worked 
for mielkes stasi and that they might interpret his threat against 
honecker as an order to kill the former communist chief 
bild said mielke and other members of honeckers ruling circle 
will be moved to a west berlin prison after german unification on 
oct 3 
honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his health 
improves enough for him to be imprisoned he is suffering from 
kidney cancer and is being kept at a soviet military hospital

nine months after a yugoslav freighter 
ran aground and destroyed a 500foot swath of live coral off key 
west the state and the ships owner and captain have reached a 
tentative 33 million settlement 
tuesdays agreement which must still be approved by gov bob 
martinez and the cabinet came just one day before a lawsuit filed 
over the grounding would have gone to trial in key west 
we think its a very very good settlement john costigan 
chief of environmental litigation in attorney general bob 
butterworths office 
allen von spiegelfeld a tampa attorney who represented the 
freighter mavro vetranic owner atlantska plovidba and captain 
zdravko berana said his clients agreed to the proposed settlement 
late monday by telephone from yugoslavia 
the 33 million will go to the states coral reef restoration 
fund which finances research and other activity to preserve and 
revitalize the reefs 
the florida barrier reef a tract of about 6000 coral reefs 
extending from miami along the keys to the dry tortugas archipelago 
west of key west is the thirdlongest barrier reef in the world 
its home to 52 coral species and 10 times as many fish it can 
take 100 years for a coral to grow one yard 
the grounding last oct 30 was the second of three such 
incidents in less than three weeks in the florida keys 
the federal government filed a 9 million lawsuit alleging that 
the mavro vetranic was unseaworthy and its crew incompetent when it 
ran aground but government attorneys later conceded that the reef 
was in state territory and stepped aside to let the state handle 
the suit costigan said

the united states and other governments risk 
shortages and other troubles if they try to hold down the price of 
gasoline at the pump as the gulf crisis drives up the price of oil 
the international monetary fund warned on wednesday 
price controls lead to shortages while price subsidies cost 
governments money the fund said in its semiannual world 
economic outlook it added that cheap money policies to help 
businesses hit by high oil prices could result in inflation and in 
the longer run higher interest rates and a drop in output and 
jobs 
oil price controls and artificial interventions of this type 
create pressures that will burst one day jacob frenkel the 
funds research chief told a news conference 
so far there has been no sign of a major country trying to block 
price increases to consumers said ernesto hernandezcata who was 
in charge of the report he added that recent us figures show the 
oil price increase already reflected in higher consumer prices 
both men are americans 
the fund watches 151 member countries and some that would like 
to join particularly the soviets for the first time the soviet 
union will be sending a delegation as guests to the annual meetings 
of the fund and its sister organization the world bank which open 
here monday 
president bush is expected to address one session treasury 
secretary nicholas brady will be the top us delegate 
the report predicted small but significant effects of the oil 
price rise over the next year looking ahead for three years it 
saw greater importance for the world in the unification of germany 
and the movement away from communism in eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
the funds calculations are based on a price of 26 a barrel of 
oil for the rest of this year and a decline to 21 by the end of 
1991 this week prices are running 32 to 33 
hernandezcata said the funds scenario is consistent with a 
settlement of the crisis by next spring and with the promises of 
other oil producers to make up for a loss of production from iraq 
and kuwait 
of course the price depends on the political and military 
situation and were not experts in either of those fields he 
said 
the report sees the growth of world production dropping to 2 
percent this year and 24 percent in 1991 from 3 percent in 1989 
last may before the invasion of kuwait the fund forecast 23 
percent for 1990 and 31 percent for 1991 
relatively low growth is foreseen for the united states 13 
percent in 1990 and 17 percent in 1991 
the highest growth is foreseen for japan 51 percent this year 
and 37 percent next year and west germany 39 and 33 percent 
the funds calculations put production of a unified germany in 1991 
at 2 percent greater than it would be if it remained divided 
lumping together the soviet union and other east european 
countries the report sees a decline in production of 25 percent 
this year and 3 of 1 percent in 1991 it said this would be due to 
the shortrun shock of change but it foresaw a better situation 
over the following few years as marketbased economic measures are 
introduced 
third world countries are expected to grow at a slower pace 
225 percent this year compared with 3 percent in 1989 this 
amount of growth means that individual incomes in many will 
continue to decline especially in africa since their 
population will increase faster than their production

a housesenate conference committee working 
on the 1990 farm bill decided wednesday to take some of the 
uncertainty out of winter wheat planting by voting for 15 percent 
acreage reduction 
the vote occurred at the first meeting of the committee that 
will be melding the two versions of the fiveyear bill approved 
this summer by the house and senate 
it came at the urging of the agriculture department which needs 
to advise farmers on planting requirements for participation in the 
governments subsidy programs 
though action on the farm bill is far from complete winter 
wheat planting for the 1991 crop year has begun 
under the provision approved by the conference committee 
farmers will have to idle 15 percent of their acreage for this year 
only to participate in the price support program reduction during 
subsequent years covered by the farm bill is to be decided later 
the purpose of acreage reduction is to keep surplus wheat stocks 
from getting too large 
the conferees agreed to begin taking the massive farm bill title 
by title on monday 
both house and senate agriculture committee chairmen rep kika 
de la garza dtexas and sen patrick leahy dvt said 
differences in the bill were small compared to most legislation 
going to conference committee 
the differences between the house and the senate could be 
resolved in a couple of days said de la garza the difficult 
part is the budget 
negotiations between the white house and congress over budget 
cuts are not complete de la garza said he did not know how much 
would be taken from agriculture 
if there is an agreement at the budget summit said leahy 
both chairman de la garza and i are committed to producing a farm 
bill that is consistent with budget responsibilities

the owners of wsnstv in chicago lost a 
lengthy license renewal battle wednesday when the federal 
communications commission in a rare move said a competing 
applicant was more deserving to run the station 
the commission granted monroe communications corp a license to 
build a new tv station on channel 44 it said monroe was more 
qualified than the current licensee video 44 which had switched 
the stations format to a subscription movie service 
monroe which began seeking the license in 1982 also claimed 
video 44 had broadcast obscene material but the fcc did not reach 
a decision on that allegation 
the fcc almost never denies license renewals to incumbents and 
already had given video 44 a renewal in 1989 but the commission 
reconsidered the case under orders from a federal appeals court in 
washington 
video 44 may appeal the decision to the appeals court 
otherwise it must discontinue operations 90 days after the fcc 
formally releases its renewal order which could occur sometime in 
the next week or so fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said 
video 44 officials in chicago did not immediately return a call 
seeking comment wednesday 
monroes attorney howard gilbert said todays decision means 
the fcc is sending the clearest possible signal that it expects 
every tv station to meet the highest standards of public interest 
in order to earn the expectation of a license renewal 
monroes principals include such prominent chicago business 
executives as robert haag the cofounder of albertoculver co 
and wayne fickinger the former president of the j walter thompson 
advertising agency 
video 44 is 50 percent owned by harriscope corp which also 
operates kwhytv in los angeles 
after the license challenge began wsns switched to 
spanishlanguage programming gilbert said monroe intends to 
continue similar programming

a federal appeals court wednesday upheld a bush 
administration policy prohibiting federal funding of foreign family 
planning agencies that perform abortions 
the challenge was brought by the planned parenthood federation 
of america which asserted the policy was an unconstitutional 
violation of its first amendment right to advocate abortion the 
organization also said the policy interferes with the privacy 
rights of people seeking abortion information 
howver the ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
said the antiabortion policy of the us agency for international 
development was legal and didnt restrict how planned parenthood 
spends money it receives outside federal grants 
planned parenthood may continue to participate as a conduit 
for aid funds that are restricted to nonabortion activities while 
maintaining with its own funds abortionrelated activities in the 
same countries the judges said 
the appeals court upheld a march ruling by us district judge 
john walker who found that the president has the authority to 
impose such a policy affecting private organizations overseas 
this decision means that tax dollars will no longer support 
organizations which campaign to legalize abortion as a method of 
birth control overseas the national right to life committee 
said hailing the court of appeals ruling 
planned parenthood didnt respond to telephone calls for 
comment 
aid began the policy under president reagan in 1984 the bush 
administration elected to retain the policy which states that 
foreign private health agencies in return for us grants certify 
that they dont perform or actively promote abortion as a method of 
family planning

the united states will increasingly ask allies 
for money to meet foreign policy needs rather than further strain 
its own federal budget deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger told congress wednesday 
separately lawmakers gave a chilly reception to the 
administrations plan for such money to go into a national 
defense gift fund which the pentagon could tap without prior 
congressional approval 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
called the administration request an attempt to set up in effect 
a military spending slush fund 
in other developments 
president bush warned anew that saddam hussein could expect 
further action against iraq if the un economic embargo and 
diplomatic efforts fail to move his forces out of kuwait 
bush on a campaign trip to california said that if iraq 
doesnt withdraw then its isolation will not end we are as i 
have said before prepared to take additional steps if sanctions 
and the quest for a political resolution do not work 
the army ordered 62 reserve units in 27 states to report for 
active duty in support of the military buildup in the persian gulf 
area and alerted 24 other units to prepare for possible callup 
the navy said it was activating 3 reserve units 
defense secretary dick cheney said he had approved imminent 
danger pay for the more than 150000 us soldiers sailors and 
airmen already in the gulf region retroactive to sept 1 
us fundraising efforts have so far yielded pledges of 20 
billion from persian gulf states japan germany and the european 
community to meet the costs of deterring aggression by iraq 
this is a kind of a new invention in the practice of 
diplomacy eagleburger said of such soliciting in testimony to 
the house appropriations foreign aid subcommittee 
i would expect you will see this administration approaching 
foreign policy questions more and more in that direction he 
added 
eagleburger acknowledged that such an arrangement creates some 
constitutional problems because it could establish a pool of 
money outside congress jurisdiction 
at the same time the appropriations defense subcommittee 
meeting behind closed to act on bushs request for an additional 
19 billion to meet unexpected gulf costs sought to ensure that 
any money raised from allies would be subject to congressional 
control 
the white house had asked congress to approve the gift fund 
which would receive donations from friendly countries and which 
would be available to the pentagon to spend as it saw fit 
cheney argued at the hearing that such authority would increase 
his flexibility in the middle east troop deployment he promised to 
work out a way to keep congress informed of how the money was being 
spent 
but subcommittee chairman john murtha dpa labeled the 
request unacceptable and foreign aid subcommittee chief david 
obey dwis called it one of the most spectacular endruns 
around the constitution i have ever witnessed 
americas leadership role in the persian gulf has put mammoth 
new strains on an already overstretched federal budget costs 
include not only the expense of deploying 150000 troops but also 
the need for new aid to allies such as egypt whose economies are 
suffering because of the crisis 
of the 20 billion raised so far roughly half is destined to 
help shore up the economies of such frontline states eagleburger 
said 
but he also argued strongly at the hearing for cancellation of 
some 67 billion in debts egypt owes the united states from past 
military equipment purchases saying cairos already weak economy 
is suffering a 37 billion added shock from the gulf crisis 
failure to meet these needs could threaten political stability 
in egypt with potentially serious consequences for everything we 
and our egyptian friends are now doing to resist saddams 
aggression he said 
and he said bush feels strongly that the gesture was important 
as a public show of support for egypt and for president hosni 
mubarak who eagleburger said is and must continue to be the 
solid foundation of arab leadership in the region 
while congress which must approve any request for debt relief 
has voiced appreciation for mubaraks leadership it has also been 
skeptical about the size of the reward lawmakers are leery of any 
increase in foreign aid at a time when budget cutters are being 
forced to hack away at favorite domestic programs 
eagleburger acknowledged that debt relief for egypt would 
trigger requests from other countries who believe themselves 
deserving but he added we are not going to be anxious to be 
generous with most of the requests 
he said israel whose foreign aid package has traditionally been 
linked to the size of egypts would also be getting more from the 
united states its no secret were talking about what kind of an 
assistance effort we should put together for israel he said 
while specific aid figures and weapons transfers for israel 
remain to be worked out eagleburger said an announcement could 
come as early as next week on conditions for proceeding with 400 
million in loan guarantees to help israel house an influx of soviet 
jewish refugees 
israeli officials have been in washington this week arguing for 
additional aid contending the gulf crisis has cost them 1 billion 
in additional military spending the price of maintaining forces on 
high alert 
eagleburger also said no final decision had been reached on a 
proposed mammoth arms sale package for saudi arabia reportedly 
planned at a level of 18 billion or more the final shape of that 
package will depend on the outcome of consultations with congress 
he said

silber said at the outset of his campaign that he wouldnt talk 
what he called political plastic and his blunt remarks 
surprised observers early on 
commenting on how best to distribute health care funds he 
referred to extraordinary and costly health care measures to 
prolong the life of the elderly and then let loose with 
when youve had a long life and youre ripe then its time 
to go 
in january while postulating that massachusetts welfare 
policies were attracting people from out of state silber referred 
to lowell home to many cambodian immigrants 
why should lowell be the cambodian capital of america he 
asked it is extraordinary why should they all be concentrated 
in one place 
days before the primary during a televised debate with 
bellotti silber said he saw no point going to an inner city area 
to talk to a group of drug addicts later he said he didnt 
mean to imply all residents of the predominantly minority area were 
on drugs 
if he wins the general election it will be a bit of a financial 
comedown for silber who gets 275000 plus a house in his current 
post compared to the governors 75000 paycheck and no mansion 
weld was another winner in the rush to evict the political 
leadership voters associated with two years of fiscal chaos he 
handily defeated house minority leader stephen pierce who had been 
considered leading just a few weeks ago 
with 99 percent of the vote counted weld had 60 percent and 
pierce 40 percent 
weld was appointed us attorney for massachusetts in 1981 five 
years later president reagan named him assistant attorney general 
in charge of the criminal division he resigned from that post in 
1988 to protest the actions of then us attorney edwin meese 
weld who lost to bellotti in the 1978 race for attorney 
general is fiscally conservative favoring a citizens for limited 
taxation proposal that would roll back taxes and fees to their 
mid1988 levels he is supports womens right to have abortions 
and has stressed his commitment to the environment 
silber opposes the citizens for limited taxation tax repeal 
initiative and has said he would campaign hard against the measure 
in the general election campaign he says he personally considers 
abortion homicide but stresses he wouldnt limit abortion rights

the goldwindowed parliament building a 
shimmering showcase of east germanys communist rulers and the 
birthplace of its first democracy closed its doors wednesday 
officials evacuated and locked the palace of the republic just 
two weeks before the nation itself ceases to exist it wasnt 
german unification that forced the closing but a legacy of the old 
regime cancercausing asbestos 
the move will force the nations first freely elected 
legislature to look for a new place to hold its final three 
meetings before it too goes out of business when the german 
states unite on oct 3 
parliament which still has to approve a treaty for unification 
had planned to meet in the building thursday as of late wednesday 
officials still were looking for alternative quarters 
government spokesman matthias gehler said the future of the 
building a massive rectangular edifice of white stone and 
goldtinted windows will be left to the west german government 
the palace of the republic has been mentioned frequently as the 
possible new house of a united parliament if the parliament moves 
to berlin capital of the new germany 
gehler said one expert estimated that it will cost 253 million 
to rid the building of the asbestos 
the fire retardent was sprayed throughout the inside some of it 
more than an inch thick and gehler said the fibrous asbestos 
deposits could be jarred into the air by mere room drafts 
the building was a legacy of the old regime of deposed communist 
boss erich honecker who dedicated the cornerstone on nov 2 1973 
the massive complex was completed 1000 days later standing in 
the heart of historic berlin its blocklike dimensions and huge 
communist insignia a hammer and drafting compass an eyesore to 
many 
it became the home of the communist parliament that 
rubberstamped the edicts of honeckers inner circle 
the building was also the meeting place of national communist 
party conferences it contains a theater bowling alleys sauna a 
disco and 13 restaurants cafes and bars 
sixteen years after the building was constructed honecker was 
ousted by masses of people demanding democracy 
in april the nations first democratically elected parliament 
convened for the first time in the buildings cavernous meeting 
hall 
the building is on land where the historic berlin palace once 
stood the castle was blown up by the soviets in 1945 
the fact that the parliamentary building was closed because of 
environmental hazards is the latest of a series of ecological 
horrors in east germany one of the most polluted lands on earth 
east germanys communists were guilty of allowing unrestrained 
waste dumping unfiltered factory processing and building 
inefficient smokebelching autos 
about 1700 people work in the parliament building and they will 
be given special employment benefits gehler said

keston college which for 20 years 
monitored religious oppression in communist eastern europe is 
struggling to survive under the regions new democracy 
some of the colleges main supporters have cut their financial 
contributions believing the college no longer serves a purpose 
the reality is that christians in eastern europe think our 
work is just beginning said the rev michael bourdeaux kestons 
founderdirector 
bourdeaux has called a meeting thursday of the colleges 
20member management council of christians and jews to discuss 
kestons role in a changing world 
on the eve of the crucial meeting researchers jane ellis and 
phillip walters were in moscow in keston michael rowe briefed an 
american academic headed for romania and fiona tuppercarey 
interviewed the daughter of a romanian priest 
others were busy with research and preparing news releases 
i am certain the college will continue because its academic 
work has given it a serious reputation around the world said 
bourdeaux a canon of anglican rochester cathedral 
he said that despite the colleges mailing list of 14500 
supporters and help it receives from church parishes and trusts 
the administration was having difficulty raising the 756000 a 
year needed to keep keston functioning 
that amount pays for the staff an international 
informationgathering and publishing organization and for visitors 
to come from eastern europe 
the college has cut its staff from 20 to 14 but the work has 
not diminished bourdeaux said 
theological education in the east has fallen to almost nothing 
and seminaries need to be restarted bourdeaux said the 
churches need guidance and practical support as these countries 
will remain a difficult area whatever their political systems 
one option is to sell the college premises and affiliate with a 
university 
bourdeaux 56 said several universities have expressed interest 
in taking over the college which has thousands of books 
newspapers journals documents and contacts across europe and 
asia 
nick woodcock the college chief executive and secretary showed 
a visitor the secure room where 26 filing cabinets hold documents 
about religious activity and persecution in eastern europe 
one envelope contained strips of linen covered with neat 
ballpen notes of the trial of a soviet religious dissident aida 
skripnikova thde notes were brought to the west wrapped around a 
travelers body 
skripnikova was released in the 1970s and is now active in the 
church in leningrad rowe said 
college researchers once used newspapers telephones the mail 
and interviews with travelers to peer behind the iron curtain 
bourdeaux said now they travel freely throughout eastern europe 
ms ellis author of a contemporary history of the russian 
orthodox church that has been translated into russian was refused 
a visa for the soviet union for more than five years but this week 
she watched the russian republics supreme soviet reporting on 
moves to legalize religious denominations 
in 1965 bourdeaux began collecting information on religion in 
eastern europe when the work overflowed from his home in 1973 he 
raised 84000 to buy an old school building in keston 14 miles 
southeast of london 
bourdeaux in 1984 was awarded the templeton prize for progress 
in religion in 1984 upon making the award judges said bourdeaux 
had stabbed awake the conscience of comfortable western 
christians

thousands of refugees could lose asylum status 
under a new policy to determine if their claims of persecution are 
invalidated by political changes in eastern europe and central 
america officials said wednesday 
under the new policy the rise of new governments in nicaragua 
panama hungary and poland could make it more difficult if not 
impossible for refugees to press claims they would be persecuted 
if returned to their homelands 
political asylum granted refugees from those countries will be 
reviewed under a july 25 directive issued by the immigration and 
naturalization service the reviews will be conducted when a 
refugee applies for permanent residency after living in this 
country for a year the ins said 
the largest group affected by the new policy is refugees from 
nicaragua where the leftist sandinista government was turned out 
of office in feb 25 elections 
poles and hungarians who were given political asylum could lose 
their refugee status unless they can prove a wellfounded fear of 
persecution despite the demise of communist governments in their 
homelands 
the same is true of panamanians who fled the government of gen 
manuel antonio noriega who was deposed last december when us 
forces invaded that country and arrested the dictator on federal 
drug trafficking charges 
it is difficult to get accurate figures on the number of 
nicaraguan refugees living in this country some estimate there are 
hundreds of thousands 
about 8000 nicaraguan refugees have applied for permanent 
resident status and have not yet been interviewed said ins 
spokesman duke austin 
as of july the ins had asylum cases in some stage for 27000 
nicaraguans according to arthur helton a refugee expert with the 
lawyers committee for human rights 
there were 2356 asylum cases involving polish refugees 313 
involving hungarians and 457 panamanians that month he said 
miami immigration attorney robert boyer said he plans to seek a 
federal court injunction to prevent implementation of the policy 
which was contained in a july 25 directive by deputy commissioner 
ricardo inzunza 
no one has been deported as a result of this process austin 
said the review of asylum status in light of political changes in 
the four countries is required by law he said 
refugees whose political asylum is revoked will still be able to 
challenge deportation orders in immigration courts he said 
refugees who were interviewed for permanent resident status 
before new governments took power in their homelands are not 
effected by the new policy ins officials said

a company shipping ballistic missile parts to south 
africa has been shut down by us customs agents after a sixmonth 
investigation authorities said wednesday 
one woman was in custody and a man was being sought said 
customs service spokesman michael sheehan 
computerized missile guidance equipment known as isolators and 
circulators was shipped from a boynton beach company york ltd to 
telecom industries of south africa sheehan said 
these are for largescale ballistic missiles not 
handlaunched rockets said sheehan and these particular items 
were built to military specification there is little question in 
our mind as to its ultimate use 
south africa is believed to be on the verge of nuclear 
capability last year the whiteminority ruled country reportedly 
tested a modified version of the israelimade jericho ii 
mediumrange missile at armaston on the indian ocean coast near 
capetown 
the united states has had an arms embargo against south africa 
since 1964 to protest its apartheid system 
arrested at her delray beach home tuesday night was beverly 
barratt 59 a federal magistrate in west palm beach set bond 
wednesday at 50000 but ms barratt could not immediately make 
bail said charles dodge the customs investigations supervisor who 
led the investigation 
customs agents were seeking the dutch owner of york ltd 
reginald van rossum 48 of ocean ridge 
a search of the company headquarters last month uncovered 
records indicating similar parts had been bought previously in the 
united states and shipped to south africa 
the company did not have a license to order some of the military 
items and falsely told us manufacturers that the equipment was to 
be shipped to the netherlands instead of south africa customs 
agents said 
the importance of this case lies in the technology involved 
and the fact it was going to south africa sheehan said the 
equipment could legally have been shipped to the netherlands he 
added but only if york had us permits which it lacked 
if convicted of violating the arms export control act the two 
could face maximum terms of 10 years in prison and a 1 million 
fine 
the announcement of the charges came only a day after the state 
department said it would welcome reported statements by south 
african officials that their government was willing to sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty

cases actually abetted the sampl ripoff which will now cost every 
american family an estimated extra 30 per month for the next 30 
years the ad read in part 
the money started rolling in after that first advertisement 
allowing thro to buy others in newspapers across the nation 
ninetyseven ads later gargan has been flooded with letters from 
people pledging from 1 to 100 in support 
gargan estimated contributions have reached 200000 which hes 
used to pay for more advertisements telephone bills and paperwork 
the money is placed in his nonprofit groups bank account 
which will be audited annually he said 
now gargan and his staff of 40 volunteers are looking ahead to 
the 1992 elections they plan to register their fellow 
disillusioned to vote and starting booting out incumbents

advocates for the citys homeless protested on 
wednesday the construction of an iron fence to prevent people from 
camping on a steam grate outside the justice department 
about a dozen protestors shouted take down the fence and 
aint too late to save our grate outside the entrance used by 
visitors to the office of attorney general dick thornburgh 
its just really barbaric and stupid said homeless advocate 
carol fennelly you dont find people freezing to death on 
heating grates 
during the cold months a small number of homeless people have 
camped atop the steam grate located just yards from the entrance 
justice department security chief d jerry rubino said the fence 
was being built as a security precaution because the grate covers a 
steam tunnel to the agencys headquarters and other government 
buildings nearby 
the steam grate represented a security vulnerability rubino 
said he also said that homeless people living on the grate had 
posed health problems for maintenance personnel 
rubino noted that the general services administration had alrady 
installed alarms on the steam grate to notify security officers of 
any instrusion 
the fence topped with sharp spikes is nearly complete except 
for a gate which fennelly said was taken away wednesday by a group 
of people who drove off with it on the back of a truck 
rubino said he didnt know what happened to the gate saying it 
wasnt taken away by workmen

president fw de klerk 
responding to criticism from blacks that he is not doing enough to 
quell factional violence said wednesday he will appoint special 
units to investigate four recent incidents 
he also announced an amnesty for individuals or organizations 
turning in illegal firearms and explosives by oct 1 and offered 
rewards of up to 40000 for information leading to discovery of 
such weapons 
black leaders have called for independent inquiries into police 
shootings and other incidents during more than five weeks of unrest 
in black townships around johannesburg that has killed almost 800 
people 
wednesdays announcement followed new police measures declared 
last week including reinforcements roadblocks weapons searches 
and equipping police vehicles with machineguns 
african national congress leader nelson mandela has predicted 
the previous measures would be ineffective he also has said the 
anc the largest black opposition movement might break off talks 
with the whiteled government if security forces cannot stop the 
bloodshed 
there was no immediate response from the anc on wednesday its 
leadership met for a second day and announced it would meet again 
thursday a statement would be issued at the end of the meeting it 
said 
speaking on the eve of his first anniversary in office de klerk 
told a news conference that special units led by deputy attorneys 
general would investigate four incidents a police shooting this 
month that killed 11 people in the sebokeng township two attacks 
on train stations in johannesburg that killed more than 30 people 
and an alleged ambush that killed a policeman 
the president also said he was considering appointing an 
independent investigator to handle allegations of misconduct by 
government institutions organizations or by individuals 
much of the fighting has pitted xhosas and other blacks linked 
to the anc against zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement anc and other black leaders have accused police of 
favoring inkatha and called for a purge of rightwing elements 
from security forces 
inkatha and the anc oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and 
plans for a future south africa their power struggle in the 
eastern province of natal has claimed about 5000 lives since 1986

anc and south african communist party were seeking a 
winnertakesall victory in a bid to create a future oneparty 
state in south africa

office saying the president had done more to bring about a new 
and stable south africa than all his predecessors 
de klerk has pledged to wipe out the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and white dominance his government and the anc have 
held talks on ending apartheid and sharing power with the black 
majority

planned to try her on charges of kidnapping and assault for the 
1988 abduction and beating of four young men 
mrs mandela said wednesday she was detained by police for about 
three hours after handing over spent cartridges from an assault 
rifle given to her by residents of tokoza township she accused 
police of harassing her and her husband 
the whole idea really is to undermine the anc she said 
the anc said it condemns the harassment meted out to mrs 
winnie mandela by police intent on curbing the normal activity 
of the anc 
mrs mandela was traveling in her white mercedes benz through 
tokoza township when she was stopped at a police roadblock mrs 
mandela apparently picked up the shells while visiting said 
police spokeswoman capt ida van zweel she handed them to a 
policeman there is no crime involved

the house on wednesday approved a 283 billion 
defense bill that would make wholesale cuts in president bushs 
fiscal 1991 budget request for the strategic defense initiative and 
b2 stealth bomber 
voting along party lines the house adopted the military 
blueprint for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 despite the threat 
of a presidential veto and sharp differences with the 
senateapproved bill 
the vote was 256155 with 33 republicans joining 223 democrats 
in passing the bill twenty democrats and 135 republicans opposed 
the legislation 
among the major provisions of the bill is a 24 billion cut in 
bushs 47 billion proposal for sdi a halt in production of the 
b2 bomber and a reduction of 129500 troops 
house and senate members will meet later this month to thrash 
out a final defense bill last month the senate approved a 289 
billion military bill that left the presidents b2 request intact 
and trimmed 1 billion from sdi 
further revisions in the measure could come if congressional and 
white house negotiators break their impasse over how to pare the 
federal deficit and at the same time decide on a final defense 
total for fiscal 1991 
house democrats argued that their bill reflects a lessening 
soviet threat to the west while trying to assist the military 
prepare for conflicts in the third world including iraq 
it takes the first step toward buying the right defense for a 
new era said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
republicans accused their colleagues of business as usual 
filling the defense bill with pet projects for their constituents 
back home while undermining the men and women in uniform 
its a bad bill it should be voted down and the president is 
going to veto it said rep bill dickinson of alabama ranking 
republican on the armed services panel 
the sharpest exchanges came on a measure by dickinson to alter 
the troop cut in the bill and eliminate millions of dollars the 
panel added for weapons key to some democrats 
to the young men and women sitting in saudi arabia trying to 
defend their country what message is the house going to send them 
that porkbarrel in the form of f18s are more important than 
human beings said rep newt gingrich rga a member of the gop 
leadership 
the amendment sponsored by dickinson would have revised the 
troop cut in the house bill to 101000 instead of 129500 while 
cutting out money for the f18 fighter planes 
the measure failed along a partyline vote 254156 
in final day action on the bill the house also approved a 978 
million package to assist the military buildup in the persian gulf 
aimed at stopping iraqi aggression the vote was 41310 
the measure includes 185 million in pay and other benefits for 
military personnel 250 million for three fast sea lift ships and 
187 million for chemical and biological equipment and training 
the measure also requires congress to authorize funds received 
from us allies to defray the cost of the military buildup which 
could rise to 15 billion next year 
a 1954 law allows the treasury secretary to spend donations on 
defense without congressional review or approval 
the house action came as elsewhere on capitol hill defense 
secretary dick cheney asked lawmakers to let the pentagon accept 
and spend allied donations without prior approval from congress 
among the major aspects of the house bill are 
approximately 23 billion for sdi the antimissile shield 
commonly known as star wars the senate approved 37 billion for 
the program and after the housesenate conference a total of 3 
billion will likely emerge 
an end to production of the b2 bomber the costliest aircraft 
in history at nearly 865 million a plane after the 15 aircraft 
currently under construction bush had sought 46 billion for two 
of the batwinged planes and advanced procurement of parts for six 
more in fiscal 1992 
elimination of the 16 billion bush sought for moving the 
multiplewarhead mx missile from fixed silos to railroad cars and 
202 million in research on the singlewarhead midgetman missile 
instead the house created a 610 million fund for developing the 
next generation of intercontinental missiles 
a reduction of 129500 in military personnel the total 
reduction from the nearly 21 million troops is slightly higher 
than the 100000 approved by the senate and nearly four times the 
38000 in the presidents proposed budget 
one of two seawolf attack submarines bush had sought and 12 
billion for the 18th trident missilelaunching submarine 
rejection of cheneys second attempt in two years to cancel the

premier andrei lukanov on wednesday 
announced a new government that contains only one nonsocialist and 
ends the 28year tenure of defense minister dobri dzhurov 
lukanov provided a list of new ministers but failed to name 
heads of several departments 
the remaining ministers were expected to be nominated thursday 
when the grand national assembly is to vote on lukanovs second 
government in seven months 
dzhurov a longtime associate of ousted communist party chief 
todor zhivkov had been defense chief since 1962 
but while he has been widely associated with the zhivkovs 
orthdox communist rule the general was credited with helping 
remove zhivkov last fall 
dzhurov was replaced by yordan mutafchiev 
the proposed government roster contained only a handful of new 
names all of them former communists with the exception of new 
science minister ilya konev from blagoevgrad who is nationally 
unknown and without party affiliation 
besides konev and mutafchiev other new cabinet members include 
deputy premier georgi pirinski foreign minister lyuben ghotsev 
and atanas paparisov minister for external economic relations 
the bta news agency said lukanov did not announce his choices 
for the ministries of justice the economy and industry 
we have not managed to set up a government of national 
consensus and trust the country would have needed lukanov a 
51yearold moderate reformer in the socialist party the former 
communist party told parliament 
lukanov repeatedly had refused to put together an allsocialist 
cabinet but the opposition rejected the idea of joining a broad 
coalition 
the main opposition group the union of democratic forces has 
said that its demands for participating in the cabinet were 
unacceptable to the socialists 
the opposition seeks immediate privatization of land and 
industry and return of land to those who owned it before it was 
collectivized under communist rule the socialists agree to land 
reform but say the land should be given to those who now till it 
lukanov said his government would not act as one dominated by a 
single party but as a government of national understanding 
socialist party members in the government would act as if they did 
not belong to the party he said 
repeating the oppositions criticism of the ruling party stoyan 
ganev the spokesman for the union of democratic forces called on 
the socialists to assume responsibility of the past communist 
regime 
at a rally on monday dimiter ludzhev the deputy opposition 
floor leader also called on the former communists to quit 
ludzhev warned that the opposition would be seeking new 
elections soon 
in the first free multiparty elections in bulgaria in 58 years 
which were held in june the socialists won a majority with 211 
seats in the 400seat parliament the opposition mustered 144 
but since then the bulgarian economy has slid seriously some 
basic foodstuffs and key consumer goods are in short supply or 
unavailable and the government began rationing sugar cooking oil 
and other goods this summer

one of two judges who voted to set aside the 
irancontra convictions of oliver l north has been assigned to the 
panel that will hear the appeal of former national security adviser 
john m poindexter 
circuit judge david sentelle will sit on the panel reviewing 
poindexters convictions along with judges abner mikva and douglas 
h ginsburg the us circuit court of appeals here said in an 
order made public wednesday 
in july sentelle joined judge laurence silberman in setting 
aside norths three irancontra convictions 
the judges ordered a hearing to determine if references to the 
testimony that north gave congress under a grant of limited 
immunity from prosecution had unfairly seeped into the former white 
house aides trial 
poindexter convicted of five counts of lying and obstructing 
congressional investigations of the irancontra affair was given a 
sixmonth sentence but is free pending appeal 
both poindexter and north testified before congressional 
committees about the irancontra affair under immunity grants that 
bar prosecutors from using what they said as evidence against them 
the appeals court gave poindexter until dec 14 to file his 
appeals brief and set arguments on the case for feb 28 
last month poindexter tried unsuccessfully to have his case 
assigned to the same panel that set aside norths convictions 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh meanwhile has asked the 
appellate court to reconsider its decision on the north case 
north was ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service 
and fined 150000 for his three felony convictions

a deer hunter says he was jumped by a 
black bear that picked him up and swatted me like a badminton 
birdie but he escaped with only minor injuries and a good scare 
tom walsh of iron river said the attack occurred over the 
weekend in the long lake area of the chequamegon national forest in 
northern wisconsin while he was hunting deer with a bow 
walsh 29 noticed a bear was feeding on corn that was set out 
for deer cautiously he checked for other bears and counted six 
then suddenly he was the target of a male bear he hadnt 
spotted 
he grabbed a hold of me picked me up and swatted me like a 
badminton birdie thats exactly what it felt like walsh said 
guessing the bears weight at 325 pounds 
he estimated the bear hurled him 10 to 15 feet 
walsh said he put his hands over the back of his head played 
dead and the bear came over and rolled him on his back 
he drooled in my face and snorted it smelled like death 
warmed over walsh said the bear then ambled away allowing 
walsh to escape 
walsh was treated at an ashland hospital for a sprained ankle 
cracked ribs a slightly bruised kidney and a claw mark on one leg 
black bears normally shy away from people 
game warden mark disalvo said it was hard to say why the bear 
attacked walsh 
perhaps the animal was protecting its food or it just picked 
up walshs scent too late and was startled disalvo said ive 
been that close to bears before and have never been attacked

king hassan ii met with the leaders of 
jordan and algeria on wednesday and in a private peace initiative 
the three sought common ground on the persian gulf crisis 
hassan personally welcomed king hussein of jordan and president 
chadli bendjedid of algeria at rabat airport they drove in 
separate convoys to the kings summer residence at shkirat 25 
miles away 
the trio met behind closed doors late into the night officials 
would not say whether the talks would continue thursday and there 
was no immediate word on any outcome 
hassan invited bendjedid and hussein to discuss the outline of a 
peace plan he hopes will overcome the rift in the arab world over 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and later annexation of the 
oilwealthy emirate officials said 
they said the talks might be expanded to include other arab 
leaders who have not endorsed western military intervention in 
saudi arabia 
these leaders could include col moammar gadhafi of libya 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat and 
president abdullah salah of yemen officials said 
moroccan officials said hassans compromise had some chance of 
success because it has not been rejected thus far by the united 
states the soviet union or even by saddam hussein 
the officials said the plan urges the following 
total iraqi withdrawal from kuwait a summit of all arab leaders 
including the iraqi president withdrawal of nonarab troops from 
saudi arabia a privileged relationship between iraq and 
kuwait and a middle east peace conference that includes lebanon 
and the israeli occupation of the west bank 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity rejected 
the last two points which he said would reward saddam hussein 
for his acts of aggression 
in taif saudi arabia the kuwaiti governmentinexile issued a 
statement rejecting any mediation efforts 
kuwaits crown prince sheik saad alabdullah alsabah said this 
was because his government was convinced that such attempts were 
futile in the face of saddam husseins defiance of the arab 
islamic and international will 
the morocco meeting brought together three countries that have 
taken markedly different stands since the crisis began 
morocco has sent 1200 troops to saudi arabia to help riyadh 
deter any further attack by iraqi forces hussein has aligned 
himself more closely with saddam 
algeria has chosen neutrality trying to carry out the mediating 
role conferred on it by the fivenation arab maghreb union before 
the invasion the union also includes morocco tunisia libya and 
mauritiania 
before leaving the jordanian capital of amman hussein conferred 
with arafat for the second time in less than 18 hours 
hussein was accompanied to rabat by premier mudar badran who 
said in a newspaper interview published wednesday that the king was 
keen on producing a collective plan on the gulf crisis 
badran said husseins own efforts to formulate a peace plan came 
to a halt 10 days ago when saddam told him that iraq will not 
pull out its forces from kuwait

thousands of votes cast in the state sept 
11 primary were thrown out because voters apparently didnt 
understand they could elect only candidates from one party 
the problem is being blamed on punchcard ballots which are 
used in about a third of wisconsins 72 counties a ballot change 
in 1986 appeared to clear up the problem in 1988 but it reappeared 
in last weeks primary 
the number of disqualified ballots has brought renewed efforts 
to change the states closed primary system to a nonpartisan 
system 
an associated press review found at least 5500 of the estimated 
400000 ballots cast statewide including more than 17 percent in 
one county were rejected because they violated wisconsins 
closedprimary law county clerks who provided the figures said the 
total could be much higher because in some jurisdictions the 
number of disqualified ballots isnt counted 
statewide the disqualified ballots amounted to 14 percent of 
the total cast 
it could make a difference in a close local race i am 
concerned about it i always have been walworth county clerk 
carol krauklis said 
in jefferson county the errors caused election officials to 
discount 176 percent of the vote including nearly half in the 
village of johnson creek leading to speculation that a close 
sheriffs race may have been affected 
the races could very well have been affected said jefferson 
county clerk barbara a geyer in the sheriffs race it was only 
154 votes different 
under wisconsins closed primary law enacted in 1903 voters 
may cast ballots in only one political partys races 
sen walter john chilsen said he will introduce legislation for 
a nonpartisan primary system arguing many voters stayed away from 
the polls last week because they were turned off by the present 
system 
only about 9 percent of the states estimated 36 million 
eligible voters cast ballots in the primary 
im convinced the low turnout for primary elections is caused 
in large part by the inflexibility of the closed primary process 
chilsen said 
but closed primary proponents believe a return to open primaries 
would encourage republicans and democrats to meddle in each others 
affairs and try to nominate weak opposition candidates said rupert 
theobald director of the legislative reference bureau 
the argument is that the purpose of the primary is to permit a 
party to select its nominees theobald said 
most votes rejected in the sept 11 election were punchcard 
ballots in which voters punch out a space near the name of the 
candidate of their choice 
the ballots list both democrat and republican races critics say 
such ballots lead some to believe they can vote in both races 
voting machines paper ballots and electronically scanned 
ballots used in other counties have safeguards to prevent voters 
from voting for both democrats and republicans in a primary 
punchcard ballots have been permitted in the state since 1980 
cities using punchcard ballots in 1984 disqualified an average of 
8 percent to 25 percent said kevin kennedy executive director of 
the state elections board 
since 1986 voters can identify their party on the ballot then 
counting machines cancel votes given to a candidate from another 
party crossover voters who dont identify their party have their 
entire ballot disqualified however 
the state doesnt have a count yet on disqualified ballots from 
last week 
kennedy said he suspects errant ballots probably result from 
complicated ballot instructions and a lack of explanation from 
polling place workers 
the voters may not have understood the instructions and thats 
not a slam against the voters the wording of the instructions can 
be easily criticized kennedy said

the magellan spacecraft completed its 
30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked volcanic landscape of 
venus on wednesday despite some hiccups from one of its 
computers nasa said 
since venus is almost the same size as earth the 30orbit 
image patch would drape an area on earth extending from los 
angeles to albuquerque and from the north pole to nearly the south 
pole said a statement by the agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
the orbiter resumed using its radar to make pictures of the 
cloudcovered planet on saturday a month after it yielded its 
first images during an aug 16 radar test engineers temporarily 
lost radio contact the night of that test then again on aug 21 
they still havent identified the cause of the problem and the 
spacecraft continues to have occasional malfunctions nicknamed 
hiccups by the engineers said steve wall magellan experiment 
representative 
its a sign theres still something awry but weve made 
it magellan so it can still map and recover from any future 
communications blackout he added 
magellan and venus were 1558 million miles from earth on 
wednesday magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 
4 1989 
before mapping resumed saturday magellan played back a tape 
recording of some of the picture data collected aug 16 steve 
saunders the projects chief scientist displayed a few of thoe 
pictures wednesday during a nasa briefing but prints werent 
released publicly 
the pictures show the same kind of features seen in other 
images ridges valleys extensive networks of intersecting seismic 
faults large solidified flows of lava a volcanic dome and 
calderas the craters left by the collapse of large volcanos 
the spacecrafts most recent computer glitch happened monday 
night when the backup to magellans main computer got a set of 
false alerts from the backup computer that helps point magellan 
the spacecraft wasnt operating on either backup computer so 
mapping continued 
wall said there seems to be a common factor linking that and 
other glitches including both communications failures and lesser 
malfunctions on aug 10 and sept 4 they all involved the backup 
pointing computer

an elderly woman was left homeless after 
authorities auctioned off her home to pay a tax bill her lawyers 
say should never have been levied 
mary amaro 78 has been living out of her buick since sheriffs 
deputies evicted her from her modest home in late august 
the mess began years ago when the city mistakenly billed her for 
530 for business taxes for 198384 amaros attorneys said 
tuesday 
ever since amaro paid her property tax bills on time and in 
cash but she never paid the business tax because she maintained 
that shed never operated a business or rented her home 
she went to city hall and signed a paper swearing she had 
never operated a business or rented her home said amaros niece 
belmira dutra she thought that took care of it 
last may alameda county auctioned amaros home for 47000 on 
aug 28 sheriffs deputies locked her out 
city officials declined to comment on the case 
amaro has shunned reporters since word of her plight appeared in 
news reports tuesday dutra said her aunt leaves her mobile 
home parked in front of her former house only to report to work 
as a domestic worker 
she took food from her mouth to send us money so we could come 
here said dutra who emigrated from portugal with amaros help 
she cared for her invalid husband 10 years and still found money 
to send back to the family but from us she takes nothing 
attorneys with the legal aid society of alameda county have 
threatened to file a lawsuit if necessary to rescind the sale 
at this point the city and county would gladly rescind the 
sale but it hinges on approval of the new owner said legal aid 
attorney laurie gong she added that the new owner mohamed mosleh 
was reconsidering his earlier refusals to consider giving amaro 
back the house 
when the government is selling property you have to assume 
the government knows what it is doing said moslehs attorney 
peter kerman 
others expressed dismay at amaros saga 
however it happened it should never have happened said 
lindy graham an administrative assistant for alameda county 
supervisor don perata her property was sold for what might well 
turn out to be an error

president bush warned saddam hussein on 
wednesday the united states will take tougher action against iraq 
if sanctions and diplomacy fail to work he said demands for iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait were nonnegotiable 
bush said the united states joined by other nations is 
standing firm and unyielding in the distant desert sands 
against the iraqi president 
in a speech winding up a twoday campaign trip the president 
called anew for iraq to withdraw its invading army from kuwait 
restore the countrys exiled leaders and release all foreign 
hostages 
if iraq does not meet these nonnegotiable conditions bush 
said then its isolation will not end and we are as ive said 
before prepared to take additional steps if sanctions and the 
quest for a political resolution do not work 
he did not specify what additional steps are being contemplated 
and his warning did not go beyond a single sentence in his prepared 
remarks white house aides said the comment was not intended as a 
new signal but reinforced earlier statements 
with more than 150000 us combat troops in the persian gulf 
bush has refused to rule out the possibility of military action 
moreover contingency plans for waging war against iraq have been 
publicly discussed by gen mike dugan whose comments were deemed 
an indiscretion and led to his firing as air force chief of staff 
bushs threat against iraq echoed a warning from the helsinki 
summit between the president and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
they agreed that the superpowers are prepared to consider 
additional unspecified action against iraq unless it pulled out of 
kuwait however gorbachev appeared far more resistant than bush to 
possible military action 
in his speech here bush hailed the global cooperation against 
iraq 
the unity of outrage across the globe the depth of support in 
the gulf and the ferocity of condemnation in the united nations are 
unprecedented the president said 
he said saddam has been put on notice by the extraordinary 
joint declaration that bush signed with gorbachev 
it is an absolutely unparalleled message of solidarity a 
clarion call for iraq to comply immediately and completely with 
the five resolutions which had been so urgently ordered by the un 
security council bush said 
and it heralds a new era for our world the soviet union and 
the united states standing together in vigorous condemnation of an 
outrageous aggression 
he said the gulf crisis had forged a new partnership for 
peace a united world response to iraqs aggressive ambition 
bushs appearance here and a stop in los angeles were intended 
to raise between 15 million and 2 million for sen pete wilson 
who is locked in a close race for governor with former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinstein 
environmental issues have been a major focus of the campaign 
and bush underscored that theme in his speech 
wilson has ardently supported coastal protection bucking both 
the reagan and bush white houses and championed forestry and river 
protection as well he has won the backing of environmental groups 
that traditionally would be expected to back the democratic 
nominee 
wilson won the endorsement of friends of the river and the 
western river guides association 
feinstein has been endorsed by the sierra club the league of 
conservation voters has yet to announce an endorsement 
speaking of wilson bush said his brand of environmental 
activism is the kind california needs 
before returning to washington bush taped some public service 
announcements urging a big voter turnout on nov 6 
bush also used the occasion to prod congress anew to reach 
agreement with the white house on a deficitreduction agreement 
no domestic issue has been more on our minds of late than our 
economy and it remains an absolutely critical imperative that we 
reach a bipartisan agreement immediately he said

israel will fight a proposed 18 billion us 
arms sale to saudi arabia unless it in turn gets 1 billion in 
emergency american aid to confront threats from iraq and to counter 
growing saudi might officials said wednesday 
israel has already started mobilizing its congressional 
supporters who met tuesday with visiting defense minister moshe 
arens 
the israeli position could put it on a collision course with the 
bush administration which is trying to restrain federal spending 
and at the same time bolster saudi arabia against iraqs superior 
military strength 
israels supporters on capitol hill have already attacked the 
proposed saudi sale as unbalanced and disproportionate to the iraqi 
threat others in congress say pumping vast amounts of arms into 
the volatile region increases the prospects for conflict there 
seeking to ease israeli concerns defense secretary dick cheney 
told arens on tuesday that the united states will give israel 15 
f15a fighter jets 10 helicopters and 2 patriot antimissile 
systems said officials familiar with the situation they spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
thats just not adequate said one source theres grave 
dissatisfaction with this saudi sale 
israel needs 1 billion immediately to buy more sophisticated 
planes and other stateoftheart equipment to match the saudi 
package said the source saudi arabia financially supports the 
palestine liberation organization and other israeli foes 
in addition arens asked cheney for a 700 million increase in 
the annual 18 billion military aid israel gets from the united 
states said the source 
the additional us aid would be used to strengthen israels own 
defense industries in order to make the small country more 
selfreliant 
nothing was finalized at the cheneyarens meetings said 
israeli embassy spokeswoman ruth yaron they decided the dialogue 
would continue 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger told congress on 
wednesday the administration was still putting together a package 
for israel to balance the sale to the saudis 
there is a whole list of things being discussed he told the 
house appropriations foreign aid subcommittee 
he said one item of aid 400 million in loan guarantees for 
israel to build homes for soviet jews should be worked out by next 
week israels defense budget has been feeling the crunch of 
hundreds of thousands of soviet immigrants arriving in recent 
months 
arens argued here this week that israel greatly outnumbered by 
its arab enemies has been weakened in recent years because the 
united states sells the arabs everything it sells the israelis 
cheney and his aides were taken aback by the israeli request 
that arens made monday and invited the israeli defense official 
for a second meeting tuesday said one source 
at the second meeting cheney offered israel the f15s and the 
helicopters 
us officials dont perceive israel as being in danger from 
iraq at present said the source while israel feels more 
threatened every day 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened to attack israel 
with chemical weapons if the united states attacks his country 
the iraqi threat has also prompted israel to seek forgiveness 
for its 45 billion debt to the united states if washington erases 
egypts loans finance minister yitzhak modai will put the request 
to us officials formally next week 
president bush has recommended that egypts 67 billion debt be 
forgiven to help it cover expenses incurred in the gulf crisis 
eagleburger made it clear debt forgiveness would not be extended 
to israel which is in different circumstances than egypt on 
that score 
with over 3 billion in overall aid annually israel is the 
largest recipient of us foreign aid

mormon church president ezra taft benson 
underwent surgery wednesday to remove two blood clots on his brain 
his surgeon termed the operation a success but said it was too 
early to tell if the 91yearold church leader had suffered brain 
damage 
the ultimate outcome in a 91yearold person we never know 
but hes doing very well dr bruce f sorensen a neurosurgeon 
said after the 2hour procedure at lds hospital 
sorensen said he removed clots on each side of bensons brain 
that were 1 to 2 centimeters thick and covered a significant 
portion of his head compressing the brain 
he came through the surgery very well the surgeon said 
benson was listed in serious but stable condition in intensive 
care and will be hospitalized for seven or eight days if all goes 
well sorensen said he said the clots formed within the past week 
but family members didnt know of any falls or injuries that might 
have caused them 
the doctors main concern was that new clots could accumulate 
he said the ailment could have a significant impact on 
bensons mental capacity but that cannot immediately be 
determined 
benson had experienced difficulty in swallowing and had severe 
headaches in the days before he was admitted to the hospital 
tuesday when his swallowing became more labored the surgeon said 
when benson was hospitalized for four days in june with a 
bacterial infection a brain scan showed him free of such clots 
benson who was agriculture secretary in the administration of 
president eisenhower became president of the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints in 1986 
presidents of the 75 millionmember church serve for life 
sorensen said he didnt think benson would be able to attend the 
churchs semiannual general conference on oct 6 
benson had a heart pacemaker implanted in 1987

the top us official for africa 
went behind liberian rebel lines wednesday to meet with rebel chief 
charles taylor and said the man many accuse of prolonging a brutal 
war is in a negotiating mood 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen met taylor across the 
border from ivory coast a day after he risked his life to meet 
rival guerrilla leader prince johnson in the liberian capital of 
monrovia where bullets flew over his head 
the prospects for increased warfare are growing cohen said 
at a news conference in abidjan i feel the situation in liberia 
is deteriorating more and more people are in danger of starvation 
and death from diseases especially a growing cholera threat 
cohen described the catastrophe of liberias 9monthold war 
to reporters a few hours after a fivenation west african army sent 
to enforce a ceasefire in monrovia announced a total offensive 
against the warring rebel factions 
the task forces commander lt gen arnold quainoo of ghana 
made the announcement in lagos nigeria saying he had received a 
new mandate to intervene actively instead of keeping with the 
task forces original peacekeeping mission 
ghanaian and nigerian jets bombed taylors artillery positions 
in monrovia suburbs during the weekend they were retaliating for 
taylors shelling of the west african headquarters in the monrovia 
port with shells two ghanaian sailors and three nigerian medical 
workers were killed in the attack 
cohen said his mission was to persuade the rebel chiefs to 
negotiate a peaceful settlement 
he met taylor at luguatuo a liberian border post near ivory 
coasts western border town of man 
taylor began the war with a dec 24 invasion from ivory coast to 
topple doe and is considered the key to peace since doe died in 
the hands of johnsons faction two weeks ago taylor has demanded 
the withdrawal of the 3000 west african troops as a condition for 
peace talks 
i have the feeling that charles taylor is prepared to 
negotiate everything cohen said i think he feels that peace 
is more important than war 
he said both rebel leaders told him they would like to see 
liberia with a truly democratic system and would cooperate in 
organizing that 
johnson has embraced plans of the west african economic 
community which sent the task force to help install an interim 
government and organize fair elections but taylor says the west 
africans want a puppet government 
cohen said he also was traveling around the region to assess the 
magnitude of the liberian crisis and report to president bush for a 
review of us policy and aid to the warravaged nation 
when i was in monrovia i saw large columns of smoke indicating 
that large sections of monrovia had been burned down deliberately 
by the troops of the late president samuel doe cohen said 
the city of monrovia may be destroyed when this is over he 
said 
he announced that bush had increased aid for the halfmillion 
liberians who have fled to neighboring states including 23 
million for the un high commissioner for refugees and 18 
million for relief groups including the international committee of 
the red cross 
this was in addition to 16 million already pledged for 
refugees the united states also is sending another 39200 tons of 
rice cohen said 
he would not say whether washington was considering giving aid 
to the west african army which includes troops from sierra leone 
nigeria ghana guinea and gambia 
everything is going to be reviewed when i get back he said 
however he said us troops would not intervene 
many prominent liberians have criticized washington for refusing 
calls including ones from doe to intervene critics say americans 
are watching from the sidelines while innocent people die more 
than 5000 civilians have been killed 
the 2100 us marines sent to liberias coast have evacuated 
hundreds of foreigners and are guarding us installations 
including a shiptracking station for us traffic in the atlantic 
and a voice of america transmission station 
cohen departed ivory coast for lagos

animals looking for food or a drink in 
what looks deceptively like a pond are being killed by a sticky 
contaminated black muck and officials trying to clean up the oily 
pit are looking for someone to blame 
the swampy pit in an industrial area 60 miles north of chicago 
holds a toxic chemical mixture that has snared scores of 
unsuspecting animals 
it is instant death said us fish and wildlife officer 
john brooks who is studying the chemicals in the pit it looks 
just like a natural pond 
eight blue herons a beaver and several mallard ducs have been 
coated with the black substance that looks and smells like tar 
within the last year according to brooks and city animal control 
officials 
blue herons make their living spearing fish the bird will 
land sink down and get the stuff on itself it will try to preen 
or clean itself and it gets the stuff on its beak then it is all 
over once it is on the bird it wont come off brooks said in a 
telephone interview from his offices in rosemont 
other animals probably have died in the pond and sunk out of 
sight brooks said 
several industries once operated in the area surrounding the 
pit including a tannery a concrete lamp pole manufacturer and a 
north shore gas co gas plant a railroad track runs beside the 
pit 
because so many industries set up shop in the area city 
officials have been unable to find who dumped the chemical 
i would like to have them clean it up voluntarily said jack 
simonian the citys governmental service director but no one has 
come forward to do so he said 
the northshore sanitary district which owns the 16 acres on 
which the pit lies is awaiting results of tests to identify the 
contents of the pit to determine if filling it in is feasible 
wildlife advocates are uneasy about leaving the pit as it is 
andrea kane a wildlife expert in woodstock who tried to save 
two of the birds said even if the animals had survived they would 
be unable to lead a normal life 
oily substances and chemicals that are toxic can be absorbed 
into the birds system miss kane said 
i sincerely hope that they do something before a child falls 
into it she said

the irish republican army claimed 
responsibility wednesday for seriously wounding the man who was 
governor of gibraltar when british commandos killed three ira 
guerrillas there in 1988 
prime minister margaret thatcher called the attack on air chief 
marshall sir peter terry cowardly wicked and evil 
terry 63 suffered at least nine bullet wounds when assailants 
opened fire tuesday night at his home in milford a village near 
stafford 130 miles north of london 
his wife lady betty terry suffered an eye injury tom storrow 
general manager of staffordshire district general hospital said 
mrs terry was in satisfactory condition 
storrow said terry was stable wednesday night after 5 hours of 
surgery for injuries including fractures to his right arm and right 
leg and severe facial injuries terry also underwent a tracheotomy 
an operation on his windpipe and was on a ventilator to help him 
breathe 
he is very lucky to be alive said surgeon john lotz 
he said two bullets were removed from behind terrys left eye 
mrs thatcher on an official visit to budapest hungary said 
the ira was engaged in guerrilla warfare 
they are at war with us and we can only fight them with the 
civil law she said so they are acting under what they regard 
as rules of war and we are acting with the ordinary law of the 
land it is the action of terrorism 
the ira which is fighting to end british rule in northern 
ireland said in a statement issued in dublin that the attack had 
been carried out by one of its service units 
the ira this week claimed responsibility for mondays shooting 
of a british army sergeant in london for an explosion at an army 
recruiting office in derby on sept 10 and for two thwarted bomb 
attacks in august 
conservative party lawmaker ian gow a close friend of mrs 
thatchers was killed by an ira bomb on july 30 
detective chief superintendent malcolm bevington of the

israelis flocked to synagogues wednesday for 
rosh hashana the start of the jewish year 5751 expected to be 
dominated by the thousands of soviet immigrants arriving in the 
jewish state 
the new year holiday traditionally welcomed in with the blowing 
of the rams horn known as the shofar begins 10 days of 
introspection the period culminates with yom kippur the day of 
atonement 
many of israels 7000 synagogues opened their doors free to 
immigrants following a request by minister of religious affairs 
avner shaki to waive the fees that some synagogues charge to raise 
funds for religious work 
israels state television on wednesday marked the holiday with a 
special broadcast accompanied by a russian translation 
while many soviet immigrants will be hearing a shofar for the 
first time sovietborn yuri stern noted that most new arrivals are 
nonobservant jews and probably will not go to synagogue 
stern a government adviser on soviet jewry said many 
immigrants were culturally sterile from the soviet unions 
discouragement of judaism and would have to learn to identify with 
the jewish people 
this is the people they basically belonged to but never had 
any idea about stern said they did not have any chance to 
know what the whole thing is about since several decades have 
elapsed since judaism had been practiced 
according to figures released wednesday by the central bureau of 
statistics israels jewish population grew by 39 percent the past 
year swelled by 115000 new immigrants 88 percent from the 
soviet union 
israels moslem and christian arabs 183 percent of 
inhabitants grew by 31 percent bringing the total population to 
4705000 
during the holiday 2000 more soviet immigrants are expected to 
arrive the hatzofeh daily said 
officials have said up to 2 million soviet immigrants could come 
to israel by the end of 1995 requiring an estimated 30 billion to 
absorb them 
the huge influx has raised questions about what the immigrants 
will mean to israel and prime minister yitzhak shamir was asked by 
the daily hadashot if israel could absorb so many people 
i am not sure that we are able he said but he added we 
will make an effort and try if we dont do it 100 percent then we 
will do it 80 percent or 70 percent 
a growing housing shortage and unemployment problems caused by 
the immigration also were discussed in broadcasts and messages for 
the new year 
president chaim herzog said in a radio address that tenions must 
be avoided between the new immigrants and young people many forced 
from their homes by the spiraling rents resulting from subsidies 
the government gives newcomers

and take a buyout offered as part of a labor settlement to save the 
tabloid union and newspaper officials said wednesday 
the paper had sought only 43 resignations from the 350member 
newspaper guild as part of 19 million in union concessions owner 
peter s kalikow said he needed to make the paper profitable the

collect full severance plus eight weeks shut down pay 
kalikow had improved the buyout offer before guild members voted 
monday on concessions slashing their pay 20 percent as part of a 
fourday work week 
the guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave job and 
wage cuts sought by kalikow kalikow had said he would shut down 
the 189yearold paper if any one union refused the grant 
concessions

in overhead and among the managerial staff will allow the paper to 
be profitable by oct 1 that would be the first profit since the 
1970s

vecsey who had previously told the newspaper he was leaving when 
his contract expired in november he will write a twiceweekly 
sports column for usa today he also recently signed to be a 
reporter on nbcs nba pregame show the insiders

baghdad on wednesday began confiscating all foreign assets from 
countries imposing sanctions on iraq but it allowed another 
planeload of hundreds of american women and children to fly to 
freedom 
international support grew for a proposed air embargo against 
iraq so did worries about the economic fallout from the persian 
gulf conflict 
regrettably events in the middle east have introduced new and 
substantial risks to the outlook federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said in testimony before the congressional joint economic 
committee 
just the enormous uncertainty about how and when the tensions 
in the persian gulf will be resolved undoubtedly is affecting the 
economy in a negative way greenspan said in his first comments 
on the us economy since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the house approved a nearly 1 billion package to assist the 
us military buildup in the gulf deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger however told congress on wednesday that 
washington will increasingly ask allies for money to meet foreign 
policy needs rather than further strain the federal budget 
us fundraising efforts have so far yielded pledges of 20 
billion from persian gulf states japan germany and the european 
community 
defense secretary dick cheney asked congress to let the pentagon 
accept and spend the allied contributions for military operations 
in the gulf without prior approval from capitol hill 
but senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd 
dwva called the administration request an attempt to set up 
in effect a military spending slush fund 
still the economic news wasnt all bad oil prices dropped 
about 1 a barrel after futures traders discovered the united 
states has a bigger supply of gasoline than they thought 
in other developments wednesday 
the chairman of the kgb offered to give the cia intelligence 
about iraq where the soviet government still has 5000 
specialists 
an army paratrooper suffered a superficial leg wound when 
struck by shrapnel from a misguided artillery shell in livefire 
exercises by us forces in the saudi desert he was treated at the 
scene 
jordans king hussein flew to rabat morocco for a summit with 
moroccan and algerian leaders aimed at solving the persian gulf 
crisis 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati indicated tehran 
would open talks with saudi arabia its greatest rival in the 
moslem world to seek a solution to the gulf crisis 
japanese automakers agreed to allow the united states to use 
three auto transport ships to carry vehicles and other goods to the 
middle east 
the army ordered 62 reserve units in 27 states to report for 
active duty and alerted 24 other units to prepare for possible 
callup the navy said it was activating 3 reserve units 
the flow of kuwaitis into saudi arabia slowed four days after 
iraq began allowing citizens to flee only about 30 cars passed 
through the khafji border crossing 
hundreds of american citizens were allowed to flee the iraqi 
capital aboard a uschartered iraqi airways plane the boeing 747 
carried 416 women and children most of them americans on a flight 
to london 
most of the passengers boarded the plane earlier in the day in 
kuwait where another charter flight was scheduled saturday 
so far about 1500 americans have been allowed to leave iraq 
and kuwait on seven chartererd flights but 1000 more remain 
behind iraqi soldiers have captured at least 90 american men as 
well as other westerners and are holding them hostage at unknown 
locations 
many westerners are reported to be hiding in kuwait and iraq 
has threatened to execute anyone sheltering them 
iraq on wednesday began seizing the assets of all countries 
participating in economic sanctions against it the seizure order 
also applied to all companies based in countries enforcing the 
sanctions 
the official iraqi news agency said the ruling revolutionary 
command council ordered the seizure tuesday night under a law 
dealing with the protection of iraqi interests money and rights 
in iraq and abroad 
all assets cash deposits property interest and other 
revenue belonging to the governments institutions companies and 
banks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutions 
against iraq are hereby confiscated said the new law the text 
of which was carried by ina 
the statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets in 
iraq or say how much cash was involved the state department was 
unable to say how much the american assets seized by iraq were 
worth and a spokeswoman condemned the move 
actions like this can only make it more difficult for iraq to 
return to the international community of nations and to restore 
economic relations which are crucial for iraqs longterm 
development spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the clear way 
for iraq to protect its interests is to comply with the security 
council resolutions relating to its invasion of kuwait 
the iraqi news agency text made no mention of kuwait but 
earlier council decisions have stated iraqi law applies to the 
emirate which baghdad annexed six days after the invasion 
the united states and britain froze iraqi and kuwaiti assets 
immediately after the invasion other countries including all 
european community nations quickly followed suit 
in addition the un security council has imposed an embargo on 
trade with iraq choking off its oil exports and blocking the 
import of goods the united states is leading a naval blockade to 
enforce the embargo 
president bush speaking on the campaign trail in california 
reiterated we are prepared to take additional steps if 
sanctions and the quest for a political resolution do not work 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said wednesday the five 
permanent members of the security council the united states 
soviet union britain france and china have agreed to extend the 
embargo to air traffic 
under the resolution all countries would have to close their 
airspace to planes approaching or leaving iraq or occupied kuwait 
planes could not be shot down under the proposed resolution but 
they could be challenged 
soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov has said he 
expected the security council to approve the embargo this week 
we want to toughen up the existing sanctions resolution one 
western diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity and 
make sure it includes aircraft

a judge gave a woman custody of four frozen 
embryos fertilized by a donor after her exhusband objected saying 
if the embryos became children he didnt want to support them 
the custody issue was part of a divorce judgment entered friday 
by circuit judge george lowrey in the case of jerome and wanda 
jenkins of jay a farming town near the floridaalabama line 
lowrey upheld the validity of an agreement the couple had signed 
with the fertility institute of northwest florida that gives mrs 
jenkins first claim to custody of the embryos 
eggs were removed from her body and fertilized at the gulf 
breeze clinic last november 
the ruling was what we wanted said j paul fitzgerald an 
attorney representing mrs jenkins 
lowrey however declined to rule on whether jenkins must pay 
child support if his exwife gives birth from the embryos mrs 
jenkins asked for such an order but the judge said he could decide 
that issue only after a birth takes place 
jenkins had objected to giving his former wife custody to 
prevent the possibility of being ordered to support a child 
fathered by another man the donor he wanted the clinic where the 
embryos are stored to retain them and decide how they should be 
used 
his lawyer allen lindsay said no decision has yet been made on 
whether to appeal the ruling an appeal would have to be filed 
within 30 days of lowreys ruling 
lindsay also said lowreys decision is in conflict with an 
appeal courts ruling in a tennessee divorce case the tennessee 
court of appeals on thursday overturned a judges decision to grant 
custody of seven frozen embryos to mary sue davis stowe 
the threejudge panel gave the woman now living in titusville 
and her former husband junior lewis davis of maryville tenn 
joint custody meaning both must agree before the embryos can be 
used 
that case however differed from the jenkins case because davis 
and mrs stowe both since remarried had not signed a custody 
agreement beforehand fitzgerald said 
the jenkinses were married in 1971 and have no children

a religious cult leader trying to avoid 
the death penalty in the electric chair for killing a family of 
five said wednesday he is a prophet who did only as god commanded 
him 
jeffrey lundgren 40 was convicted last month on five counts of 
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping in the deaths of 
dennis avery his wife cheryl and their three daughters last 
year 
in an unsworn statement during his sentencing hearing he told 
the jury that convicted him and is considering his sentence that 
god told him to kill the averys 
its not a figment of my imagination that i can in fact talk 
to god that i can hear his voice in fact all the prophets 
were commanded to specific acts he said 
in ohio defendants in capital crimes involving a possible death 
penalty have the option of giving unsworn statements 
prosecutors said the murders may have been considered a ritual 
to help other cult members find god during wilderness treks 
afterward 
the victims bodies were found on a farm lundgren rented at 
kirtland 30 miles east of cleveland all five were shot with a 
pistol and they were buried in a common grave under a barn 
lundgren didnt testify during his trial his attorneys admitted 
he fired the shots 
lundgren whose wife and son also were convicted was a lay 
minister of the reorganized church of jesus christ and latter day 
saints in kirtland until he was defrocked in 1988 for inappropriate 
conduct he later formed his own sect at the farm 
lundgren said he began questioning doctrines of the reorganized 
church an early offshot of the mormon church saying he believed 
there could be more than one prophet 
doctrinal issues became more and more a problem with me he 
said 
never did i have a profound experience in worship services in 
church he said 
standing at the defense table lundgren took nearly five hours 
to make his statement he spoke in calm measured tones frequently 
referring to his bible 
his cult he said was preparing for the second coming of 
christ which it believed would occur at the reorganized churchs 
temple in kirtland but first the spiritually unclean had to be 
dealt with he said 
dennis avery tried to lead people to false gods lundgren said 
i abhorred he sin that was in mr avery he said 
lundgren said messages he gleaned from the bible told him to 
kill the avery family passages in the books of isaiah and matthew 
and in the doctrine of covenants of the mormon church told him to 
dig a pit bind the averys kill them and then bury the bodies 
along with stones he said 
there are no plea bargains at the great day of judgment he 
said it is real simple you obey or you perish the word said to 
me that this act had to be done and it was obeyed 
other than the death penalty lundgren could face life in prison 
without parole for 20 years or life without parole for 30 years 
on tuesday his son damon lundgren 19 was convicted on eight 
of 10 counts in the avery deaths and faces a sentencing hearing 
monday he was acquitted of a single count each of aggravated 
murder and kidnapping in the death of cheryl avery 
he also could face the electric chair 
last month alice lundgren 39 was sentenced to five 
consecutive life terms for conspiracy complicity and kidnapping 
the lundgrens were among 13 cult members arrested in the case 
most of the members lived at the kirtland farm some have pleaded 
guilty to reduced charges

us rep denny smith was accused wednesday 
in an ethics complaint of using his office for personal gain in 
transactions involving savings and loan associations 
the complaint against the oregon republican alleging violations 
of house ethics rules was filed by the house democratic campaign 
committee 
it also accuses smith of breaking house rules by using his 
congressional office and equipment on his reelection campaign the 
filing went to the house committee on standards of official conduct 
in washington 
smith said the charges amount to dirty politics by his 
democratic challenger mike kopetski 
he is a politician behind in the polls and will now do 
anything to get back in this race including using dirty political 
tricks to confuse the voters smith said 
kopetski said he hoped the committee will investigate the 
charges and make a judgment prior to the election 
the complaint says that according to news accounts smith 
fervently lobbied the federal home loan bank board for a 
softening of its policies against directors of failed savings and 
loan institutions who had been responsible for their institutions 
bankruptcy smith was a director of a failing thrift american 
federal savings amp loan of salem 
smith also is accused of seeking special treatment for jimmie 
taylor a defendant in a civil lawsuit against former directors and 
officers of state federal savings amp loan of corvallis and a major 
contributor to smiths campaign 
the complaint also alleges federal savings and loan regulations 
appear to have been violated by a 229500 home mortgage loan to 
smith by american federal savings amp loan while he was a director of 
the thrift 
the institution waived a standard 5000 loan fee to smith 
without making a required prior disclosure to federal regulators 
according to the complaint 
the complaint also says ethical questions arise involving 
financing that smith obtained from citizens savings amp loan for an 
industrial park partnership in salem in which he was a coowner 
the thrift lost 14 million on the loan and eventually 
collapsed in 1987 
the complaint also charges that smith violated house rules by 
listing his congressional telephone number on campaign literature 
and using material produced by his congressional staff in a 
campaign mailing 
the campaign committee chairman rep beryl anthony dark 
said during an oregon visit last month that his committee probably 
wouldnt file a complaint because it would seem to be political 
opportunism 
anthony never ruled out that allegations might be filed anthony 
aide howard schloss said wednesday from washington

jordan will lose more than 2 billion this 
year because of the persian gulf crisis and faces economic ruin 
without massive foreign aid the finance minister said wednesday 
unless jordan receives substantial support from the 
international community the economy of jordan will start to face 
very serious difficulties in october or november said finance 
minister bassel jardaneh 
in cairo meanwhile kamal alganzouri the government planning 
minister was quoted as saying wednesday that egypts losses will 
amount to 273 billion 
jardaneh said jordan told the un security council that amman 
will continue to receive oil from iraq until it can make financial 
arrangements to buy oil elsewhere 
i think jordan has a strong and clear justification for doing 
this said jardaneh who denied jordan was breaking the un 
sanctions leveled on iraq after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
you are creating a complete economic dislocation of resources 
in jordan and the economic repercussions of this are substantial 
jardaneh said 
jordan with an annual budget of 37 billion imports about 22 
million barrels of oil a year about 90 percent from iraq and 
kuwait 
under the terms of the contract iraq has guaranteed the price 
of oil will not exceed 1640 a barrel the current world market 
price is about 32 a barrel 
before the gulf crisis jordan relied on iraq and kuwait to buy 
about onethird of its total exports that income was cut off by 
the un sanctions which have brought jordans already troubled 
economy to its knees 
the effect is colossal said ali attiqa resident un 
coordinator in jordan jordan will need massive aid 
jardaneh said losses from exports to iraq and kuwait are 
expected to reach 280 million this year he said the country will 
also lose 185 million in grants pledged by iraq and kuwait 250 
million from port services 230 million in tourism revenue and 
320 million in remittances from jordanians working abroad 
in addition the crisis will cost jordan 160 million in exports 
to other countries and amman may have to pay 169 million toward 
loans it guaranteed for iraq during the eightyear iraniraq war 
jardaneh said 
information minister ibrahim izzeddine said wednesday that if 
the international community wants jordan to observe the economic 
sanctions against iraq it must contribute substantial foreign aid 
jardaneh said that without such aid not only might the economy 
collapse but jordan will not be able to meet payments on its 84 
billion foreign debt 
so far only japan west germany and the european community have 
pledged aid to jordan jardaneh said

the international press institute said wednesday 
it was concerned about the arrest of an editor in turkey and the 
detention of journalists in egypt and syria 
it also said it was concerned about harassment of foreign 
journalists by serbian police in yugoslavia and about what it said 
were plans in romania for new press curbs 
peter galliner director of the institute sent protest letters 
to the presidents of turkey and syria and egypts interior 
minister 
the message to turkish president turgut ozal called for the 
release of dogu perincek editor of the newspaper yozol who was 
arrested last month in diyarbakir in eastern turkey and is awaiting 
trial 
galliner said perincek was jailed after speaking out against 
current government repression in the southeastern region of 
turkey 
the institutes message to gen abdul halim mussa the egyptian 
minister of the interior called for the release of khaled sherif 
a journalist with the newspaper el hakika the institute said it 
had reports sherif had been tortured in tora reception prison 
galliners message to syrian president hafez assad said the 
detention of journalist imad naddaf was a gross violation of 
human rights and that he should either be released or charged 
we understand that naddaf was arrested in 1982 under the state 
of emergency law galliner said he has not been charged 
officially or sentenced is still held in detention and is not 
allowed legal access or visits by his family 
galliner also sent protest letters to the president of the 
yugoslavian republic of serbia slobodan milosevic and to romanian 
president ion iliescu 
he said serbian police had harassed foreign journalists 
reporting recent unrest in the southern province of kosovo which 
serbia formally administers 
there has been continued unrest in the province the past 18 
months as the majority albanian community in kosovo protests 
serbias dominance of the province 
galliner urged iliescu to withdraw a draft law on the press 
if passed he said the measure would seriously threaten 
press freedom in romania and undermine the right to full and free 
reporting discussion and public debate 
he said the proposed law would forbid the publication of false 
or alarming information or comments that might seriously threaten 
or disturb public law and order galliner said it should be 
replaced with a proposal that would affirm the right of the 
romanian people to freedom of speech and of the press 
the institute has offices in london and zurich switzerland and 
is an independent organization of publishers and editors in 60 
countries

yugoslavias mosaic of nationalities 
and republics will soon be allowed to choose whether to remain a 
single country or split into different states the federal 
leadership said wednesday 
yugoslavia may be radically reshaped even if its six member 
republics decide to remain within the country said a statement by 
the collective presidency carried by the state tanjug news agency 
the governments of two republics croatia and slovenia insist 
that the country of 23 million people who belong to numerous 
ethnic groups and religions should become a loose confederation of 
nearindependent states the statement said 
such a confederation would cooperate only if joint interests 
warrant it the presidency said 
communistruled serbia the largest republic insists a 
confederative structure would be too unstable and advocates 
retaining the federal system installed in 1945 said the statement 
it added that the three remaining states bosniahercegovina 
macedonia and montenegro also prefer a federation 
borisav jovic the serb now leading the presidency said in a 
recent interview that a nationwide referendum may be held soon to 
determine the future makeup of the country 
the statement said a consensus has been reached among the 
republics that anyone who would not agree with the future 
constitutional system of yugoslavia would be allowed to secede 
the statement indicated that if the states favoring a looser 
union could not reach agreement with the rest of the country they 
would be permitted to enter into a confederation with the other 
republics that would stay in the current federal structure 
yugoslavia in recent years has been faced with growing 
differences among the republics and rising nationalism that many 
fear could escalate into civil war 
in the first free yugoslav elections in 50 years centerright 
parties won the most votes in slovenia and croatia

kingdoms expatriate labor force 
yemenis have been allowed relatively free entry into the kingdom 
and also conducted trade without needing the saudi sponsor required 
of other foreign nationals

what do you do when an elephant gets 
stuck 
call a tow truck in fact call two tow trucks 
thats what officials at the washington park zoo did wednesday 
when tamba a 7000pound pachyderm was trapped for more than 
three hours in the dry moat that surrounds the zoos elephant 
compound 
the elephants were horsing around in the back yard zoo 
spokeswoman jane hartline said evidently she got pushed in 
the moat is about 8 feet deep and is designed to allow elephants 
who slip into it to walk to a gate at the end of it but 
19yearold tamba has an arthritic leg and couldnt move 
zookeepers didnt see the mishap but responded to the elephants 
squeals and called for two tow trucks 
officials attached air bags to tambas midsection then 
connected them to cables that were hoisted by two tow trucks as 
the cables were lifted more air was pumped into the bags 
after considerable effort tamba was pulled to her feet and she 
walked slowly at first then quickly to the elephant house 
squealing as she moved she was a little stiff but otherwise 
unhurt 
its funny because while they were doing it she was very 
quiet hartline said but after she got out she was talking 
quite a bit she was very happy to get out

two rival palestinian factions the plos fatah 
and the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement announced wednesday 
they have ended their fud and will coordinate efforts in fighting 
the israelis 
the agreement announced in a leaflet circulated in jerusalem 
came 10 days after supporters of the two factions clashed on the 
streets of the tulkarem refugee camp at least 20 people were 
injured in the battles 
the fighting at tulkarem began when supporters of fatah the 
mainstream group of the palestine liberation organization 
reportedly blocked a hamas preacher from speaking at a local 
mosque 
the truce marked at least the third time the rival factions have 
tried to end their dispute since the palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation began in december 1987 in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
also wednesday five masked palestinians entered the home of an 
arab woman tuhfa abu denain 43 in tulkarem and stabbed her to 
death arab reports said they said the woman was a suspected 
informer for israeli authorities 
the military spokesmans office said it had no information on 
the incident 
ms denains death raised to at least 260 the number of 
palestinians killed by fellow arabs in the 34monthold uprising 
most were suspected of collaboration with israel 
a total of 730 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians and 47 israelis have also died in the uprising 
arab reports said another palestinian mujahed hussein sadaa 
from the village of jeib north of jerusalem was reported killed 
wednesday in israels megiddo prison 
an army spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the death and said sadaa was killed by a fellow prisoner 
she did not know the motive 
the leaflet distributed by the fatah and hamas factions called 
on supporters to end their rivalry and improve relations 
we announce an official decision to all our strike forces to 
stop fighting to organize uprising activities together and to 
coordinate efforts in confronting the enemy and its forces the 
leaflet said we believe that national unity is the way to 
victory 
meanwhile two israeli teenagers who sneaked across israels 
closed border with jordan last month were charged wednesday with an 
illegal crossing israel radio said if convicted the youths face 
up to four years in prison 
the two hananel shearyashuv and lior mizrahi both 17 were 
returned to israel by jordanian authorities on sept 6 the two 
countries are technically at war 
dozens of young israelis have tried to dash across the border to 
petra since the 1950s viewing the trip as a test of courage petra

a dallas county commissioner made no apology 
wednesday for remarks suggesting that violence would erupt if the 
city hires a good old boy police chief who is insensitive to 
minorities 
commissioner john wiley price however said he may have been 
irresponsible in making the statements to a newspaper 
i should probably not have said some of the things i did he 
said 
he made the remarks in an interview published wednesday in the 
dallas morning news later he softened his remarks and told the 
newspaper he would advocate violence only in the event of police 
violence against civilians 
if you try to bring in a good old boy in this system were 
going to be in the streets physically literally shooting folks 
were not going to tolerate it price said in wednesdays 
article 
city manager jan hart is seeking a replacement to police chief 
mack vines who was fired sept 12 after his indictment on a 
misdemeanor perjury count 
the dismissal of vines who is white angered some in the citys 
minority community price who is black warned against replacing 
vines with someone lacking the former chiefs sensitivity to 
minority concerns 
i think we ought to be armed and be prepared for whatever 
comes price told the associated press on wednesday were 
going to protect our own and were going to protect ourselves and 
if that means from the police and everybody else were going to do 
that 
price added and i think at some point in time were going to 
have to be more aggressive than we are defensive that could mean 
anything by any means necessary thats what malcolm x said 
at a press conference wednesday price was accompanied by three 
other black leaders in what he called a clarification of his 
earlier remarks 
the call to arms is not an offensive move he said it is 
meant in defense we will try to defend our community we have 
historically had to do that and we must defend our community at 
all costs 
pices comments brought a strong protest from dallas county 
judge lee jackson who apologized on behalf of the county 
commissioners court 
all four of the other members of the other members of the 
commissioners court condemn those comments predicting and even 
appearing to condone violence he said we apologize to the 
rank and file police officers in dallas and their families

an attorney filed a classaction suit wednesday 
on behalf of four houston car buyers who claim a bank controlled by 
republican gubernatorial candidate clayton williams forced them to 
purchase unnecessary insurance as a condition for a loan 
david bragg of austin texas said the lawsuit eventually could 
involve 400 to 1000 claimants who say the bank made them buy 
disability and life insurance before it issued loans 
the lawsuit was filed in travis countys state district court 
against claydesta national bank of midland 
the basics of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff contends that 
claydesta and three other entities required them to purchase credit 
disability insurance and life insurance and that the insurance had 
to be purchased from a certain company in order to secure a car 
loan bragg said 
williams and bank president david n jones repeatedly have 
denied the bank made such requirements for its loans both have 
said they will cooperate with any investigations of the loans 
bragg said attorneys are investigating claims from claydesta 
national borrowers in houston fort worth and dallas he said 
besides the insurance costs that allegedly inflated the loan price 
borrowers also had to pay an undisclosed brokers fee that was 
not figured into the cost of the loan 
the lawsuit follows tuesdays announcement that two state 
agencies have begun investigating claydesta nationals loan 
practices 
rich tomlinson in charge of the texas attorney generals 
consumer protection division in houston said he had not reached 
any conclusions but that could well be a violation of the states 
deceptive trade practices act 
besides the texas attorney generals office the state consumer 
credit commission also is investigating the allegations

authorities in a southern chinese city executed 
65 criminals including murderers rapists smugglers and 
hooligans in one of chinas largest mass executions an 
official report said 
the executions on tuesday in guangzhou or canton comprised the 
largest such occurrence since a nationwide campaign against crime 
began in china a year ago they followed the executions of nine 
people in shanghai for murder theft and pimping last week 
according to a report in tuesdays editions of the yancheng 
evening news published in guangzhou 65 criminals were 
executed in 12 areas of the city the crimes included murder rape 
gun smuggling hooliganism and major crimes which often means 
theft extortion or burglary 
among the executed was a woman the report said 
executions in china usually occur with a bullet to the back of 
the head 
last week amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said more than 500 people have been executed in china 
the past year in the anticrime campaign at least another 600 
people have been sentenced to death it said 
amnesty said the latest round of executions was the most severe 
nationwide crackdown since 1983 the anticrime campaign has 
occurred in the wake of chinas violent suppression of nationwide 
prodemocracy protests last june 
amnesty said that amog those executed were people accused of 
engaging in religious activities deemed counterrevolutionary or 
those who committed acts of violence during the 1989 protests for 
freedom 
china last thursday denounced the amnesty report 
on the question of human rights there are always differing 
interpretations foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said in 
beijing 
despite the controversy china in some areas is facing a crime 
wave 
beijings decade of economic reform has produced serious social 
dislocations and corruption especially in guangdong province and 
the provinces capital guangzhou guangdong borders the wealthy 
british colony of hong kong and is one of the engines of chinas 
modernization drive 
organized criminal gangs from hong kong the triads have moved 
into guangdong and joined local criminals pushing drugs 
prostitution gambling smuggling and other social vices law 
enforcement officials say chinas police appear incapable of 
dealing with the crime boom and in some cases might contribute to 
it 
in may for example two hong kong undercover policemen were 
abducted by chinese security officials who sneaked into hong kong 
waters to smuggle three luxury cars to the mainland the policemen 
were released only after chinas official xinhua news agency 
accused the hong kong government of fabricating the incident 
travelers to guangdong province report that heroin and 
prostitutes are readily available an american reporter who 
recently returned from the area said heroin was for sale at 
numerous locations for 34 a gram

the united states wants continued 
access to the military bases it will leave behind after completing 
a gradual pullout from the philippines the spokesman for us 
negotiators said wednesday 
stanley schrager spokesman for the us panel made the 
statement on the second day of talks on the future of the six 
usrun military bases here their lease expires in september 
1991 
communist rebels offered a nationwide ceasefire if president 
corazon aquino rejects american proposals for continued use of the 
bases 
meanwhile the state department late wednesday in washington 
warned of a possible imminent terrorist bombing by the 
communist new peoples army against us government or other public 
facilities in manila 
in a brief statement attributed to spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler the state department said the danger was in the 
vicinity of roxas boulevard in manila 
several hotels the us embassy and the central bank where the 
bases talks were being held are on the boulevard which runs from 
near the manila airport to the heart of the city 
during talks tuesday the chief us negotiator richard 
armitage hinted that washington would scale down its military 
presence here but hoped to delay a final decision on the fate of 
the bases until the next century 
schrager discussing the period aftr the american soldiers are 
gone said of the military facilities they will be philippine 
bases to which the us would hope to have some access as it has 
with other countries around the world 
this is a far cry from what we have now where we have a large 
military presence in the autonomous kind of situation in our 
particular facilities in the philippine military bases 
the six bases in question which include clark air base and the 
subic bay naval base are among the oldest and largest american 
military facilities outside the united states 
most surveys show a majority of filipinos support them but any 
treaty to keep the bases here after the lease runs out requires 
approval by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition is 
strong the philippine congress could also require the extension to 
be approved in a national referendum 
opponents such as communist rebels believe that the bases 
infringe on national sovereignty 
in a statement to news agencies wednesday the rebel national 
democratic front called for rejection of any us proposal to 
extend its use of the facilities the group said it would

fbi director william sessions has accepted the 
recommendation of a courtappointed panel that he promote 11 
hispanic agents in the aftermath of a discrimination suit against 
the bureau a spokesman said wednesday night 
the panel of three outside lawyers was created last year after a 
federal judge found in 1988 that the fbi systematically 
discriminated against hispanic agents in assignments and 
promotions 
in the classaction suit joined by 311 of the fbis 
approximately 400 hispanic agents us district judge lucius 
bunton iii of midland texas directed the bureau to end its 
unsystematic excessively subjective method of promoting 
special agents 
bunton said the ability of special agents in charge of field 
offices to overrule promotionboard decisions was anathema to 
nearly every reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this 
court to improve the fairness and reviewability of the process 
spokesman mike horton said sessions could have appealed the 
panels selection of the agents for promotion but decided not to 
the new york times first reported the decision 
in earlier rulings the judge found that hispanic agents were 
often relegated to what one hispanic agent has described as the 
taco circuit working in hispanic neighborhoods or doing 
language translations 
bunton concluded that hispanic agents were often assigned to 
such undesirable tasks as monitoring spanishspeaking suspects on 
wiretaps 
after he took office in november 1987 sessions reviewed all fbi 
personnel and recruitment policies saying he would tolerate no 
discrimination

jewish community leaders concerned by a 
rash of antisemitic acts arranged police protection for all 
services marking the jewish new year that began wednesday 
police have reported 23 antisemitic incidents since july 
graffiti has been daubed on synagogues and jewish fraternities and 
sororities and individual jews have reported being insulted on the 
streets 
the brake lines on a school bus parked behind the temple beth 
israel were cut in july by an unknown person police said the 
driver of the bus used to take children to a jewish camp 
discovered the problem before driving off 
police were asked to provide at least one officer for protection 
at services at bnai brith hillel foundation temple beth israel 
and temple beth el during rosh hashanah the jewish new year said 
steven morrison director of the madison jewish community council 
in addition two offduty officers were to be present during 
services at two madison synagogues morrison said 
police capt mike masterson said three uniformed officers 
monitored the the services and no problems were reported 
its sad and outrageous that at this time in this country and 
this city coming down on the side of caution requires having 
police present morrison said madison ironically has a 
reputation as a place where people celebrate difference so 
well morrison said 
its bothersome because you want to be able to feel you live 
in america and dont need police guards to feel secure when you go 
to services said irv saposnik director of a jewish student 
group at the university of wisconsin 
rosh hashanah began at sundown it marks the start of the jewish 
faiths 10day high holidays that end with yom kippur the day of

yes there are some savings said gen bernard galvin but

if you tape bad shows for a collection called 
americas funniest home awfuls boy have you got a treat 
tonight its the twohour premiere of a new cbs series the 
flash 
the series is based on the comic book hero who likes to wear a 
red skintight bodystocking with a mask and a hood that has winged 
ears that look like car door handles you know the sort of guy you 
find in punk rock clubs 
only this one fights crime at incredible speed 
how bad is the cbs effort it makes similar tableaus like 
yesteryears six million dollar man and bionic woman 
resemble high art 
it doesnt help that the shows handsome young star john wesley 
shipp appears to have studied acting at the wooden school of 
tights and drama 
its a shame but shipp just is not believable particularly in 
a crucial early scene when he exceeds 347 mph on a laboratory 
treadmill then asks whats happening to me 
the flash he plays lives in a dark metropolis called central 
city where the streets are always wet with clouds of rising steam 
here and there 
it vaguely resembles the city in the movie version of dick 
tracy are there no tv or movie producers who dont read comic 
books nowadays 
those who dont know the origins of the flash will learn tonight 
that he is a police crime lab ace named barry allen barry is 
transformed into a real whiz when a lightning bolt hits his 
laboratory and sprays a lot of chemicals on him 
a member of a family of cops barry has a girlfriend iris 
paula marshall a computer artist she doesnt want to get 
married yet good thing he also has a dog named earl 
barrys older married brother jay tim thomerson is a veteran 
motorcyle cop heading a task force to wipe out the dark riders an 
extremely evil subterranean motorcyle gang led by an antisocial 
activist michael nader 
the dark riders leader whose face is horribly scarred by bad 
makeup is surprise an excop gone wrong for starters he 
wears a ponytail 
the dark riders like to throw bombs and shoot automatic weapons 
as they roar by in the night they like to do this even when the 
police chief in a speech familiar to new yorkers is telling the 
press 
your police department is determined to give you back your 
streets and rid them of the fear that keeps us all awake at 
night 
after the gang roars in and shoots and bombs the ubiquituous tv 
reporter asks jay for a statement snarls jay were gonna bury 
these guys and you can quote me on that 
er jay she doesnt have to quote you on that shes got that 
on videotape and awww never mind 
meanwhile kid brother barry who long ago promised his mom hed 
never become a street cop starts evolving into the crimefighting 
flash after the lightning bolt alters his body and way of life 
but it is hard he cant figure out why he runs so fast his 
shoes smoke or why he eats more than 10 tv dinners at one sitting 
a good doctor would tell him its because he watches too much mtv 
but this is cbs so he has to go to a secret government lab and 
become the subject of tests by tina mcgee a lovely widowed 
scientist played by amanda pays pays can act and thus stands out 
here 
there is a nifty scene when during a test he breaks the speed 
of sound on a race track then scoops her up and does it again it 
is nifty because she is wearing clothes that endure the speed of 
sound a fashion first 
tina who starts helping him is the only one who knows his 
secret 
this is good because most of the show despite all the 
bombing shooting attempted prison breakouts and highspeed blurs 
of red is strictly from arrrrrrgh 
there is one moment of high drama when the bad excop kills his 
hated foe jay the head of the dark rider task force but all is 
lost when the flash arrives holds his dead brother in his arms and 
emits a loud cry 
the cry is supposed to indicate anguish instead it sounds as 
the flash just suffered a snapped truss 
for the record the script is by the shows executive producers 
danny bilson and paul demeo the show comes from pet fly 
productions which may explain everything 
 
elsewhere in television 
sam donaldson gets his abcs sam donaldson known to bellow a 
question now and then will be roasted in washington next 
tuesday in a dinner to raise funds for the spinal bifida 
association of america the association says former presidents 
jimmy carter and ronald reagan will contribute videotaped barbs for

sometimes the obvious simple question is the 
tough one supreme court nominee david h souter is a judge who 
studies the precedents so he was ready when asked why he wants the 
job hes about to get 
souter told his confirmation hearing that he loves the 
judiciary wants no calling but to be a judge and would seek on 
the high court to serve as a steward of the constitution 
he said it is the greatest responsibility a judge can undertake 
to join with eight other people to make the promises of the 
constitution a reality for our time and to preserve that 
constitution for the generations that will follow us after we are 
gone from here 
thats an unassailable if vague answer to a question that would 
seem elementary for any nominee or officeseeker it isnt always 
answered effectively 
when sen edward m kennedy was asked why he wanted to be 
president as he prepared to run in 1980 his awkward rambling 
attempt to answer became a campaign liability 
robert h bork told the contentious senate hearing on his doomed 
nomination to the supreme court that service there would be an 
intellectual feast he also said he wanted to contribute to 
maintaining constitutional government as he saw it 
bork of course had spelled out the way he saw it in lectures 
writings and rulings as a federal appeals judge that established 
positions on most major constitutional issues of the times 
souter has not 
three days of questioning by the senate judiciary committee 
didnt change that souter talked about himself about his 
experiences about his judicial philosophy about dozens of 
decisions and precedents but he did not telegraph to skeptical 
liberals or to newly wary conservatives just where he would stand 
on the questions awaiting the closely divided court matters 
including abortion civil rights and criminal justice 
souter foreclosed answers to the abortion question early in the 
process declining to discuss the courts 1973 ruling or to express 
his personal opinion on abortion 
at the same time he said that he believes the 14th amendment to 
the constitution does recognize and does protect an unenumerated 
right of privacy that position doesnt fit the conservative 
agenda 
the ruling that legalized abortions was based on the right to 
privacy something bork had said was invented by the court that 
was one contentious point among many at the 1987 hearings on his 
court nomination bork is a formidable legal scholar he showed it 
in disputing critics and at times questioners 
souter was said to have reviewed the bork hearings and to have 
watched videotapes of some points in that testimony as he prepared 
for his own confirmation hearings 
souter was no less the scholar some of his answers came 
complete with footnotes as he cited legal history supreme court 
cases and provisions of the constitution 
at the same time he sought to dispel the notion that a 
51yearold bachelor who still lives in his boyhood home in a small 
new hampshire town he remarked rather proudly that i still 
have a black and white tv is isolated from everyday concerns 
remote a theorist rather than a judge who can understand real 
world concerns 
he worked at countering that impression from the beginning 
saying that his first lesson as a judge was that at the end of 
our task some human being is going to be affected some human life 
is going to be changed in some way by what we do 
he answered some questions by speaking of personal experiences 
a wrenching twohour counseling session with a pregnant woman who 
was considering selfabortion a quartercentury ago when he was a 
freshman adviser at harvard college a boyhood in which he never 
heard a racial slur in his household a contempt for discrimination 
reinforced by seeing antisemitism against his friend sen warren 
rudman of new hampshire 
he was deferential when he declined to answer he said he did 
so with respect not by choice but because he couldnt respond 
without jeopardizing the integrity of the judicial process 
even when the questions took on an edge souter did not 
i think the nation is served well by seeing me and by seeing 
you he told the senators 
in souter people who watched the televised hearings saw a man 
who looks acts and seems to think like a judge on or off the 
bench i have loved the judiciary he said i have been a 
trial judge i have been an appellate judge and i want to be 
nothing else

for two years the powdery soil on david 
langs farm refused to yield a crop this year he finally got rain 
and about 1500 acres of golden wheat but hes stuck with it 
a world wheat glut totaling more than 216 billion bushels is 
holding down prices experts say the us wheat crop alone is 
expected to total a record 276 billion bushels up 35 percent from 
last year 
theres a wheat war going on said neal fisher director of 
the north dakota wheat commission canadians sold wheat to china 
about two weeks ago for something around 250 a bushel the 
european community is selling it for 205 
north dakota farmers like lang are getting about 220 per 
bushel for their wheat at least 1 less than last year and the 
lowest theyve seen in at least five years fisher said farmers in 
north dakota and elsewhere say their costs to produce a bushel of 
wheat are at least three times that much 
many farmers and their congressional representatives want more 
federal export bonuses to increase sales and better loan rates for 
farmers some have asked for a fundamental reevaluation of the 
us wheatprice structure 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter defends the current usda 
policy saying that if us farmers plant less or put more in 
storage their competitors in other countries will only plant more 
he also says the usda has increased its export bonuses at the risk 
of driving the market lower 
prices are down because wheat farmers have had excellent 
yields here and elsewhere in the world at a time when demand from 
some of our major customers has declined unpredictably yeutter 
said recently 
were doing all we can to help move us wheat in the 
marketplace in a sensible way he added 
but for lang and other farmers its a hard blow after two years 
in which nothing would grow strong livestock prices are helping 
him he said he can sell some of his 150 cattle and hell get a 
usda loan on his wheat to help pay bills 
under the loan program at the end of nine months farmers can 
pay back the money and sell their wheat for a higher price or the 
government gets the grain but farmers also say the loan rate 
currently less than 2 per bushel is too low 
gov george sinner has suggested that farmstate governors ask 
their farmers to hold wheat off the market 
north dakota expects to harvest a record 275 million bushels of 
spring wheat and 104 million bushels of durum a wheat variety used 
in pasta as part of a record us wheat crop of 276 billion 
bushels 
the country may face more trouble if farmers cant make a 
profit sinner said 
the evidence is building very rapidly that we will probably 
lose more farmers this year than any year previous he said 
the longrange future is so bleak to many farmers that they are 
simply saying the hell with it

they asked for a show of hands at a meeting this 
week of financial market experts who thinks 24hour market trading 
has already arrived 
a few hands waved affirmatively among the hundred or so 
participants 
then the followup question who thinks it will take lots more 
money and time before 24hour global trading really takes off 
dozens of hands shot up amid a few knowing chuckles 
the scene was a seminar on roundtheclock trading sponsored by 
the information industry association a group of socalled data 
vendors whose job is to disseminate market prices and analysis to 
everyone from newspaper readers to professional traders 
representatives from the various stock and commodities markets 
spoke on their plans for going global a watchdog from the 
securities and exchange commission told how regulators would react 
the vendors themselves outlined the enormous logistical problems 
and huge expense of wiring the world for continuous trading 
few conclusions were reached except that much work remains to 
be done 
the few who said 24hour trading was already a reality were 
right big market players have been burning the midnight oil and 
cutting deals electronically in london and tokyo for some time 
but what theyre talking about now is institutionalizing this 
sort of thing making afterhours trading a regular part of doing 
business in the markets 
they want to set up shop on the moon not just land on it 
whether american astronauts will get back to the moon before 
average american investors trade stocks in the middle of the night 
is anyones guess some of the hurdles left to jump are 
staggeringly high 
the principal concern right now in the middle of a recession on 
wall street is the cost 
everyone with an eye on this future marketplace agrees it cant 
be built without a tremendous capital investment the basic tool of 
a 24hour market is a computer system that never goes down speaks 
all languages executes trades in a wink from point a to point z 
and updates itself while it works 
thats some invention with some price tag 
who will build it mostly joint ventures like the globex 
partnership for trading futures and options being developed by the 
chicago board of trade chicago mercantile exchange and reuters 
holdings plc 
the people who eventually make money on 24hour trading will be 
the ones who commit the money to erecting the framework charles 
lebens chairman of bridge information systems told the meeting of 
data vendors 
the issue of standards is just as critical for the market to 
move efficiently across borders and time zones common formats and 
guidelines must be established for traders 
currently world traders find it difficult to agree on the 
simplest things even ticker symbols 
take volvo explained lebens there are nine different 
symbols for it in nine different markets and some dont even begin 
with v 
there are also different currencies and exchange rates to worry 
about different rules for public disclosure of trades and all 
sorts of technical headaches 
one elementary but nonetheless vexing question is when to 
declare the end of the day for recordkeeping 4 pm eastern 
time 6 pm midnight 5 oclock the next morning pick one 
the regulatory questions are equally sticky how do you police a 
market that never closes and conducts business across international 
borders regulators around the world have begun to consider the 
problem under the leadership of the sec but officials are bound to 
have their hands full keeping files enforcing rules and tracking 
crooks around the world 
the sec mostly known for reacting to the markets needs instead 
of anticipating them will likely need a budget infusion to move 
more aggressively on these fronts that means congress must be 
heard from on the question of 24hour trading before too long 
the consequences of taking shortcuts to the global future will 
be severe the experts agree without adequate standards 
infrastructure and police the action is bound to get rough 
its also bound to push the little guy farther away from the 
market than hes already been shoved 
this move to 24hour business is fundamentally different from 
opening up the supermarket or the cash machine all night its not 
being done for the convenience of the working stiff whod like to 
buy some ibm on the way home from the late shift 
global trading is mainly a business for big guns for instance 
the new york stock exchanges plan for afterhours trading later 
this year is designed for institutional investors who move millions 
of shares of stock by computr 
some might say the disenfranchisement of the small investor is 
inevitable notwithstanding global trading after all few people 
today still sit around the kitchen table picking stocks out of the 
evening paper if theyre in the market at all theyre buying 
generic shares of it through mutual funds or through contributions 
to pension funds 
despite this trend the rocket to the investing moon will lose a 
valuable passenger if it takes off without mr and mrs america 
the challenge for those now mulling plans for a global market will 
be to make it safe and accessible for everyone 
unless the market that never closes is truly open the builders 
may find it wasnt worth the investment

the 1991 tracer is lincolnmercurys latest attempt to lure 
smallcar japanese import buyers back into its showrooms 
we looked at what people are paying for their vehicles 
equipped said ian mcallister general marketing manager at 
lincolnmercury we find people buying japanese products for 
about 1200 to 2000 more than what they could be paying for a 
tracer thats comparing median prices 
surveys show that car buyers know about the companys bigger 
models the sable grand marquis and cougar and they give us 
credit for cars that are wellmade mcallister said 
but lincolnmercury isnt so readily on consumers lists when 
they shop for small wellbuilt cars 
the 1991 tracer is designed to change that built on the same 
platform as the 1991 ford escort the tracer line includes a 
station wagon version to appeal to young families who increasingly 
are deciding against hatchbacks the previous tracer design 
introduced in 1986 was a hatchback 
the 1991 tracer lts test car also had standard sport handling 
suspension offering good road feel without a punishing ride 
exceptionally long wheel travel in the strut suspension helped ease 
road imperfections a feature normally found on larger heavier 
vehicles 
the car featured a standard rear decklid spoiler and cast 
aluminum wheels that when added to the minimum of chrome on the 
tracer made for a modern sporty look 
standard equipment included a fourway adjustable driver seat 
rear window defroster tilt steering and fourwheel disc brakes 
base price for the lts was 11219 though the least expensive 
model the tracer sedan begins at 8969 plus destination charge 
the test car came with a 18liter fourcylinder engine and 
fourspeed overdrive transmission the dualoverhead cam 16valve 
powerplant is also used in the escort gt and produces up to 127 
horsepower 
power was adequate in city driving but less so on the highway 
there were occasional jerks in my demanding pedaltothemetal 
drives as the transmission shifted especially when the air 
conditioner was on 
still i averaged about 28 miles per gallon commendable 
considering all the unkind maneuvers i put the car through the epa 
rating is 23 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway 
the tracer lts is fairly roomy for a compact front and rear 
seats were wellcushioned though rather flat legroom in back was 
admirable even with the front seats all the way back i could tuck 
my feet under them and not hit my knees on the front seatbacks 
three children might manage ok in the rear seat but three adults 
might find it to be a tight squeeze 
the tracer is imported from ford motor cos factory in 
hermosillo mexico but the company says 75 percent of the cars 
components are americanmade 
lincolnmercury expects the new design to attract slightly 
younger buyers and more families with children 
consumer reports magazine ranked the 1988 version average in 
owner reports of trouble

twentyfive years ago the second vatican council 
issued a document that spurred a transformation in jewishchristian 
relations 
called nostra aetate latin for in our time the 
declaration has been followed by a proliferation of guidelines and 
understandings on ties between christians and jews 
religious scholars gathered at fordham university last week to 
assess the impact of the document among the comments it 
represents one of the true success stories of the 20th century 
it was a turning point a reconsideration of the soul now 
it is possible to dream realistically 
something irreversible and irrevocable has happened in our 
nearly 2000yearlong story said rabbi a james rudin 
interreligious affairs director for the american jewish committee 
he termed the change a rare success story 
calling it reconsideration of the soul on both sides eugene 
j fisher director for catholicjewish relations of the national 
conference of catholic bishops said peace in its fullness in 
the sense of the hebrew word shalom appears to be breaking out 
between us 
he said that we are graced to live in a time when it is 
possible to dream realistically of christians and jews standing 
together in solidarity in mending the world a task to which 
both of our peoples are called by god 
some participants saw such active bonds as essential in 
resisting a galloping secularism of the times 
observance of the 25th anniversary of the vatican document came 
near the jewish new year rosh hashana this past wednesday start 
of judaisms high holy days culminating sept 29 on yom kippur the 
day of atonement 
while jewishchristian dialogues and cooperative approaches have 
multiplied since the vatican councils declaration it staked out 
the grounds for the expanding mutual ties 
the declaration like similar preceding statements by protestant 
and eastern orthodox denominations of the world council of 
churches affirmed these basic principles 
that christianity draws sustenance from roots in judaism 
to which gentiles are grafted that jesus the apostles and most 
his early followers were jews and god has not revoked his covenant 
with jews 
that the church mindful of the patrimony she shares with 
judaism repudiates every form of antisemitism and specificially 
the longfestering deicide charge that blamed jews as a people 
for jesus crucifixion 
christ out of infinite love freely underwent his passion and 
death for the sins of all men the declaration said 
in the fordham conference marking those landmark principles and 
the numerous ties and standards developed since partipants also 
noted strains that have occurred and said further steps are needed 
religion should not be a wall but a door an opportunity to 
meet the other as he or she knows himself or herself said 
nobel laureate elie wiesel a jewish survivor of the nazi 
holocaust 
we are all created in gods image we all bear responsibility 
for one another he added urging joint efforts against hunger 
disease violence drugs crime and social humililiation 
in joining hands i will not be less jewish nor will you be 
less catholic he said each religion is good for its own 
adherents judaism is good for me just as christianity is good for 
you 
in choosing to follow christ future christians left judaism 
and chose christianity just as jews chose to remain jewish is 
that bad not at all rapproachment means diversity not 
uniformity 
remember and we shall learn to respect one another for what 
we are meant to be a mirror to each other i look at you and i 
ask myself not whether you are a good christian but whether i am a 
good jew should not the same be true of you 
monsignor george g higgins a theologian of the catholic 
university of america cited an overprivatization of religion 
and said christians and jews should work together in deepening 
religious values in society 
it is our common calling as jews and christians to make known 
the name of the one god among all nations of the earth in every age 
and jointly to serve the cause of peace and justice among the 
peoples of the earth he said 
concurring with higgins albert vorspan a reform jewish leader 
and vice president of the union of american hebrew congregations 
said religious forces should help shape public values 
separation of church and state does not mean separating 
spirituality and social justice or closeting religion or religious 
politics in the church the synagogue or the mosque he said 
several jewish participants including wiesel and rudin 
stressed the importance to jews of israel and questioned why the 
vatican still withholds diplmatic recognition from the jewish 
state 
rudin also said pervasive irreligious secularism threatens 
to push both judaism and christianity aside in battling such 
pressures he said the sense of solidarity between christians 
and jews is indispensable

as they abandon communism 
east europeans are confronting old nationalist passions that gnaw 
at their nascent democracies and force them to remake their states 
as well as their ravaged economies 
tension between majority czechs and minority slovaks who make 
up about onethird of czechoslovakias 155 million people has 
brought the promise of largescale constitutional reform 
by loudly demanding more independence and even going so far as 
to establish their own ministry for international relations the 
slovaks have won agreements to pass most power from prague to the 
czech and slovak republics 
under arrangements to be completed next year the federal 
government effectively will run only defense foreign policy and 
major economic issues such as regulating the currency 
even foreign affairs will not be pragues sole domain slovakia 
will get its own consulates and cultural centers in countries like 
canada or switzerland with large slovak emigre populations 
yet this may not quell nationalism in slovakia the more rural 
eastern third of the country 
across eastern europe ethnic groups deprived by centuries of 
foreign rule of opportunities to show their identity are seeking it 
with vengeance 
in much of central europe the sense of grievance is real old 
slights can be whipped into collective aversion even hatred 
for centuries slovaks were ruled by hungary which until 1830 
crowned its kings in bratislava then known by the hungarian name 
pozsony independence in 1918 was welcome but union with the 
czechs bred new resentments 
the lack of slovak intelligentsia meant that czechs got hold 
of all the important posts said jan petrik a senior official in 
slovakias secondlargest party the christian democrats 
mutual czechslovak suspicion grew during world war ii the 
czechs were occupied by the nazis while a nazi puppet state was 
established in slovakia 
a federation was devised during the brief prague spring 
reforms in 1968 but the authoritarian rule reimposed after the 
warsaw pact invasion ensured federation was little more than a 
formality 
prague centralism comes between slovakia and the world said 
vitazoslav moric leader of the proindependence slovak national 
party which won 10 percent of the vote in june elections the 
czechs as a nation have nothing to do with it prague as the center 
expropriated certain power and doesnt want to give it up 
president vaclav havel attributes a special role in the 
resurgence of nationalist feeling to the uniformity imposed by the 
soviet union for 40 years 
rid of the uniforms and masks that were imposed on us we are 
looking for the first time into each others faces havel said 
recently he suggested it was a shock to recognize differences 
this shock of otherness havel suggested is enhanced by 
fear that an ethnic rival may be shouting louder and getting more 
attention 
ethnic slights can be felt keenly as people drop the reserve 
that governed casual acquaintance when everybody feared the secret 
police 
little is done to break down stereotypes 
media freed of communist constraints print as they wish but 
slovak dailies are barely available in the czech lands and only 
one czech daily has a correspondent in slovakia 
our nations communicate with one another so insufficiently 
that it is almost frightening said czech premier petr pithart 
communications barriers reinforce the desire of minorities to be 
heard 
if we dont demand nobody is going to give it to us said 
petrik we have to be cheeky 
this fosters defiant gestures such as the appointment of actor 
milan knazko a key havel ally as slovakias minister of 
international relations 
then it is the majoritys turn to feel aggrieved 
pithart repeatedly has reminded the czechs that slovaks are 
not siamese twins or czechs who speak slovak and have a 
case for being treated differently 
he and slovak counterpart vladimir meciar put faith in the 
success of economic reform and the institutionalization of human 
rights to overcome nationalist passions 
if humanitarian values do not become decisive in slovakia 
there will never be stability meciar said 
but the situation is complicated as elsewhere in eastern 
europe by the minoritywithinaminority the 600000 ethnic 
hungarians in slovakia they resent attempts to make slovak 
taught in their hungarianlanguage schools an official language 
the slovaks meanwhile bitterly accuse hungarian media of 
painting a distorted picture of the misery of slovak hungarians 
even if ethnic claims quiet down more bitter battles loom 
slovakias christian democrats for instance are determined to 
stiffen the relatively lax abortion law something unlikely to be 
welcomed in the less religious czech lands

uncertainty in the persian gulf and fears of 
stagflation have scared investors away from the british stock 
market where trading volume is down sharply 
the slow business is depressing for londons already battered 
tradin rooms and might undermine the governments upcoming sale 
of the electric power system 
although prices have held up better in london than in tokyo or 
new york augusts average volume of 312 million shares was 22 
percent lower than a year ago 
analysts say the big investors are standing pat small investors 
are bailing out and dealers have idle hours to contemplate the 
likelihood of more layoffs in the financial district by christmas 
volume is what we earn our living from said robert 
buckland market strategist at county natwest woodmac ltd 
investor caution also threatens to undermine prime minister 
margaret thatchers biggest and most complex privatization the 
sale of britains electric industry beginning in november 
volume became more important to the market following the big 
bang the 1986 deregulation of britains financial markets that 
attracted a lot of new players who now are struggling to make a 
profit 
trading on londons stock exchange came to 3792 million shares 
on tuesday up from 2866 million shares monday but down from 
fridays 418 million shares 
most trading represents reactions to news developments rather 
than longterm investments buckland said 
id say the low volume is no 1 a product of uncertainty in 
the market buckland said investors are unwilling to commit 
themselves to a market which they just cant predict 
these reluctant investors sitting on the sidelines with big 
cash holdings are uncertain about the outcome of the gulf crisis 
buckland said 
the crisis he added also brought forth the horror word that 
everybody is scared to see stagflation 
britain has both ingredients of stagflation slowing economic 
growth under the pressure of 15 percent interest rates and high 
inflation of 106 percent in august 
inflation prospects have worsened worldwide since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait sent oil prices soaring above 30 a barrel 
these problems are occuring simultaneously with another 
disturbing trend in the london market said anthony winnington a 
director of equities trading at the london investment firm hoare 
govett ltd 
generally there has been an exodus of the small shareholder 
from london this last year winnington said theyve become 
more disillusioned with the stock market 
britons appetite for shares will be tested when the government 
begins selling 12 electric distribution companies in two months 
the entire threestage sale including most of britains generating 
capacity could raise more than 38 billion 
its very important for the government that that sale be 
seen as a success winnington said its got to attract into 
the market the people who have been leaving in droves 
that wont happen unless interest rates are cut he said 
the governments sales of nationalized industries over the past 
decade generally have been successful with one notable exception 
the selloff of the governments remaining onethird stake in 
british petroleum co plc which coincided with the october 1987 
stock market crash and flopped with investors underwriters got 
stuck with the stock 
the crash depressed trading volume prompting dealers to pull 
out of equity trading and forcing job cuts 
the number of equity market makers dealers who buy and sell 
shares continuously at posted prices has shrunk to 25 from a 
postbig bang peak of 33 
employment at member firms fell 4 percent to 24400 at the end 
of last year from a peak of 25500 in mid1988 the exchange says 
pretax profit for all the firms fell to 158 million in 1989s 
fourth quarter compared with 312 million in the third quarter it 
sas 
there is still a lot of overcapacity and an awful lot of 
pretty idle dealers in dealing rooms in the city or financial 
district winnington said he said further job losses could come by 
christmas

next spring therell be an 
attictobasement review of federal communications commission 
broadcast regulations to see if changes are needed fcc chairman 
alfred c sikes said 
we will be looking at the structural rules to determine which 
ones promote diversity and which in a new media world might 
threaten it he said in a speech here tuesday 
we must worry about diversity in today and tomorrows world 
not yesterdays sikes told broadcasters attending a lunch held 
by the international radio and television society 
however he didnt specify which areas the fcc will look at a 
review prompted by changes that new technology and markets have 
creted in mass electronic communications 
in a questionandanswer session with those at the lunch he 
suggested that the cable industry worried about proposals to 
reregulate it may get a breather until next year 
the draggedout housesenate negotiations on the federal budget 
may mean therell be no time left this year for a final vote by 
congress on cable legislation he said 
only a month ago he said he would have said he felt there 
was a substantial likeliehood of a final vote by both houses this 
year 
but now i think that in some ways the fate of the cable 
legislation is tied to federal budget negotiations he said 
as talks continue and if negotiators tighten the rules on 
floor action in congress it would seem to me that the cable 
legislation will run out of time for a final vote before the 
current session of congress ends he said 
the house passed a cable bill on sept 10 but action on a cable 
measure in the senate still is pending 
the bush administration strongly opposes the house bill saying 
that congress should instead encourage new forms of competition to 
cable 
the cable industry which according to nielsen estimates now 
serves 589 percent of the nations 931 million homes with tv was 
largely freed of regulation by congress six years ago 
the house bill was passed in response to increasing complaints 
about rising prices and shoddy cable tv service among other 
things it would impose federal price limits on basic cable 
service 
it also would give the fcc power to order price rollbacks on the 
worst offenders and boost competition to cable which now serves 
589 percent of the nations 931 million homes with tv according 
to nielsen estimates 
the fcc in july told congress that it felt the best way to 
benefit the viewing public was to encourage competition to cable 
tv such as satellite broadcasting instead of reimposing 
regulation of rates and services

charles h keating jr whose lavish 
lifestyle and risky investments helped make him a symbol of the 
savings and loan crisis was led away in shackles after he was 
charged with swindling junkbond investors 
keating was taken to the 6700inmate county jail near downtown 
los angeles tuesday where he was being held on 5 million bail 
superior court judge gary klausner in setting the bail noted 
that a 42count grand jury indictment contains serious allegations 
selling securities by false statements or omissions selling 
securities without qualifications and lying to the california 
department of corporations 
the bonds issued by the company keating headed american 
continental corp were sold at branches of its subsidiary 
irvinebased lincoln savings they became virturally worthless when 
lincoln was seized and american continental wound up in bankruptcy 
court 
prosecutors told klausner that the 20 listed victims typify 
22000 investors who lost 250 million on the bonds that were far 
riskier than they were led to believe 
it was the first criminal case filed against keating 66 of 
paradise valley ariz the cost of bailing out lincoln has been 
estimated at 2 billion 
district attorney ira reiner declined to describe in detail how 
the bonds were misrepresented 
at a press conference tuesday after a special grand jurys 
indictment was unsealed reiner said only 20 victims were named to 
simplify the case and avoid confusing a jury 
we tried to have this be a very tightly focused case reiner 
said i think we have put together a case that can be prosecuted 
and prosecuted successfully 
keatings codefendants were held on 1 million bail each 
they are judy elizabeth wischer 42 of paradise valley former 
president of american continental ray charles fidel 32 of 
newport beach former president of lincoln and robin scott symes 
37 of malvern ohio former chief executive officer of lincoln 
symes attorney don smaltz called the bail amounts 
outrageous saying they were motivated only by hysteria and 
politics of the case 
reiner noted that taxpayers will have to absorb most of the 
losses from the nations savings and loan debacle whose bailout is 
now estimated to cost 500 billion thats because the federal 
government insured thrift accounts up to 100000 
but there was no insurance for the bonds sold at lincoln the 
american continental securities carried high interest rates because 
they were unsecured meaning investors had little recourse if the 
company was unable to pay its debts 
these bonds were sold principally to elderly people who 
typically invested their life savings reiner said 
in limiting the case to 20 defendants reiner cited complicated 
fraud prosecutions that failed in other states but he also 
appeared to be referring indirectly to the byzantine mcmartin 
preschool molestation case 
reiner who is running for reelection suffered career damage 
when the mcmartin case ended without a conviction after years in 
which it became the nations longest and costliest criminal 
prosecution 
keating is under criminal investigation by federal authorities 
in connection with his alleged looting of lincoln the arizona 
developer also faces a slew of civil actions including a 11 
billion racketeering case filed by the federal thrift bailout 
agency an administrative action by the office of thrift 
supervision seeks 409 million connected to soured lincoln deals 
keating says he is broke

the government could save 3 billion to 4 
billion in aid payments to savings institutions bailed out in 1988 
if congress and the administration were willing to spend 22 
billion next year regulators say 
the resolution trust corp said tuesday that the 69 billion 
cost of 96 bailouts in 1988 could be reduced over the next decade 
but only if congress and the bush administration spend the cash up 
front 
l william seidman chairman of the trust corporation refrained 
from offering his recommendation until his agency meets thursday 
with its oversight board headed by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady 
but several members of congress spoke favorably about the idea 
i regard the rtcs report on potential savings as only the 
first cut in a long process to protect taxpayers on the deals 
said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee 
we owe the money one way or another it just seems to me the 
practical thing is to do this and get it over with said rep 
bruce vento dminn who chairs a house task force overseeing 
bailouts conducted since 1988 
however in budget summit talks administration and 
congressional negotiators are having a hard time coming up with the 
cash to provide for the rescue of a continuing flow of failed 
thrifts let alone money for past deals 
the trust corporation created last year by the sampl bailout law 
is spending billions of dollars to wipe out the losses of 
institutions that have failed since 1988 
in the old rescues the bank board was out of money and had to 
keep the institutions afloat with various guarantees and promises 
of future assistance 
the 1988 transactions have come under increasing attack from 
members of congress who complain they amounted to a giveaway the 
house banking committee said last week that acquirers on average 
invested only 1 to receive 78 in assets 
many of the 1988 deals were overly generous and costly to the 
taxpayers agreed peter h monroe president of the oversight 
board 
much of the bank boards assistance took the form of promissory 
notes with a guaranteed return often the bank board promised to 
guarantee profits on the sour loans and other bad assets of the 
rescued thrifts 
if you make deals and you dont have cash then youre 
going to pay more in order to make a deal with the private 
sector seidman said 
under the contracts the government could save money over the 
long haul by paying off the promissory notes or buying the bad 
assets and selling them itself 
however the report cautioned that such action could force 17 of 
the rescued thrifts with 51 billion in assets back into 
insolvency seven of the bailedout thrifts are already back in the 
governments hands 
the report which was required by congress and cost 35 
million was based on research of five groups of private 
accountants lawyers bankers and consultants hired by the trust 
corporation 
in a second report due in november the trust corporation is 
examining whether there is a legal basis to overturn any of the 
1988 deals so far the agency has found no ground for revoking the 
deals seidman said 
tuesdays report dealt only with legal options in the contracts 
with acquirers of bailedout thrifts 
there is no effort to change the contract and the government 
is in no way reneging on its obligations seidman said

two months of hot dry weather have 
devastated georgias peanut crop and could force consumers to pay 
higher prices for peanut butter 
don koehler executive director of the georgia peanut 
commission said the 1990 crop will be the worst in a decade he 
predicted peanut growers will suffer 150 million in crop losses 
he estimated the loss to the states economy at up to 600 million 
georgia is the nations top peanutproducing state accounting 
for nearly half of us production peanuts are also georgias top 
cash crop 
georgia growers are expected to harvest 703000 tons this year 
down 24 percent from last year 
the alabama and florida crops which represent 18 percent of 
us production are down 21 percent but some of the shortfall 
will be made up by producers in virginia north carolina oklahoma 
and texas where growing conditions were better 
the us peanut harvest is expected to total 17 million tons 
down 11 percent from last year but sufficient for domestic needs 
koehler said tuesday offers to farmers have already increased 20 
percent to 760 per ton and may increase further depending on 
weather and crop conditions 
mitch head executive director of the peanut advisory board an 
atlantabased trade association representing southeastern 
producers said retail peanut butter prices could increase from 5 
percent to 10 percent 
head said the drought will leave fewer peanuts for export but 
should not create a shortage for us consumers americans consumed 
155 millions tons of peanut products last year 
emory murphy assistant executive director of the peanut 
commission said consumers should not see the higher peanut butter 
prices until january when manufacturers began turning the 1990 
crop into peanut butter and other products 
the increase will push a peanut butter sandwich cost up 1 cent 
to 165 cents still a nutritional bargain and one of the cheapest 
protein sources in the american diet murphy said

have given the work force a different makeup than it had a decade 
ago 
because of these shifts companies are finding that getting an 
employee to transfer is not as straightforward as it once might 
have been according to the study by the employee relocation 
council a professional association 
still corporations are moving many more single female and 
dualcareer employees than ever before 
but the employees are beginning to recalculate the worth of 
moving said linda k stroh who headed the study conducted at 
the jl kellogg graduate school of management at northwestern 
university in suburban evanston 
this finding contrasts with that of a similar study conducted by 
the school in 1978 the older study concluded that mobile employees 
and their families of that era generally were very willing to move 
and adjusted well to transfers 
now though single employees in particular are much more 
selective about making moves said stroh theyre saying no 
she said in a telephone interview tuesday night 
divorced parents leaving communities where their children live 
can create heartwrenching problems 
one father interviewed by stroh for example said he bitterly 
regrets his decision to make a job move 
i cant tell you the sadness i feel to think ive lost that 
relationship with my son he told her i thught it would work 
i was wrong 
one surprising finding of the new study which surveyed 20 
fortune 500 corporations and more than 1000 of their employees 
was working husbands willingness to follow wives who were being 
transferred 
but stroh said corporations are missing a good bet here because 
married women are asked to move less often than men 
with women making up 18 percent of the managerial work force 
sampled corporations are overlooking a pretty good segment of 
their employees she added 
families with teenage children presented special problems 
the more often a teenager had moved the more difficulty the 
teen had in adjusting the study found yet teens who participated 
in the decision to move were happier about the change than those 
who were not involved 
the study also found that parents were more willing to move with 
male teenagers than with female teens 
based on their interviews the researchers offered some advice 
to corporations they suggested for instance that corporations 
should offer help in finding work for a relocated employees 
spouse such assistance the researchers said should include 
offering job contacts and reimbursements for the cost of 
careerplanning guidance 
a decade of mergers acquisitions and other corporate turbulence 
also has affected the way employees view job moves the study found 
that employees from business units where there had been mergers 
were much less willing to move 
one employee interviewed said takeovers and turbulence erode 
loyalty to a company 
said stroh those in more turbulent companies are more likely 
to act as free agents in managing their careers

defense attorneys cautioned jurors in the fraud 
and conspiracy trial of 10 soybean traders that the prosecutions 
claims of thievery must be backed by evidence 
matt a lydon an attorney for one of the defendants warned the 
16 jurors in us district court on tuesday that assistant us 
attorney tom durkin must prove charges of conspiracy fraud and 
racketeering facing the chicago board of trade members 
durkin spent monday and two hours tuesday morning giving opening 
statements he alleged the futures traders at the bot regularly 
bought and sold contracts outside the open market and set their own 
prices to ensure a profit 
mr durkin threw out words like ripoff and fraud and 
cheating the customers lydon said but remember the 
government must prove these things and prove them beyond a 
reasonable doubt saying it doesnt make it so saying it for six 
hours doesnt make it so 
judge george m marovich is presiding over the third trial 
stemming from a lengthy fbi probe of alleged corruption at the 
worlds two largest futures exchanges the bot and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the soybean traders were among 18 traders and a clerk from the 
bot charged with violating trade regulations the clerk and eight 
traders have pleaded guilty 
durkin one of three lawyers prosecuting the case offered a 
detailed explanation of how soybean futures are bought and sold on 
the market during his opening statement he also displayed enlarged 
examples of documents used to conduct the transactions 
but lydon said the prosecutors explanation of how business is 
done at the exchange differed from reality 
the governments version is a far cry from how it happens down 
at the chicago board of trade said lydon who represents edward 
cox iii 
lydon said durkin failed to tell jurors that prices can vary 
during frenzied trading in the soybean futures pit the area where 
traders gather to trade publicly by shouting bids and orders 
you people dont have to be expert traders to see that there 
is likely to be trading at different prices and there are likely 
mistakes being made lydon told the jury 
an undercover fbi agent who participated in the alleged illegal 
trading is the prosecutions chief witness at least five people 
who have admitted guilt are expected to testify 
the defendants are represented by separate counsel all 10 
attorneys will present arguments on behalf of their clients 
the soybean traders are among 48 people indicted from the two 
exchanges last fall twenty have avoided trial by pleading guilty 
and one pleaded no contest 
trial for 14 japanese yen traders at the merc opened last week 
before us district judge william t hart 
in july a jury convicted two swiss franc traders from the merc 
of relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one of the three 
defendants the men are to be tried again on those charges next 
year

the chicago mercantile exchange says it is 
monitoring indicted traders who ignored the exchanges request to 
refrain from handling customer orders but that is as far as the 
merc can go 
exchange spokesman andrew yemma acknowledged tuesday that some 
traders charged with defrauding customers have not complied with 
the exchanges request that they trade only for their own accounts 
he said the merc has not ordered the indicted traders to stop 
handling customer business because there is a presumption of 
innocence until proven guilty 
you cant penalize somebody who has not pleaded guilty or been 
found guilty yemma said 
ray pace one of 14 merc traders currently standing trial on 
federal fraud and racketeering charges said in an interview monday 
that he and several other traders in the mercs japanese yen 
futures pit have continued to fill customer orders despite the 
exchanges request that they stop 
the chicago board of trade is not aware of any indicted traders 
defying a similar request at that exchange said spokesman michael 
oconnell 
ten soybean futures traders from the bot also are being tried 
in a separate courtroom on racketeering and fraud charges stemming 
from an fbi sting operation at the worlds two largest commodity 
exchanges 
pace said he initially complied with the mercs request which 
was issued shortly after a federal grand jury handed down the 
indictments in august 1989 
he said he traded only for his own account for a few months but 
resumed handling customer orders after learning that three or four 
others who were indicted had not complied with the request 
they never told you not to touch another customer order 
pace said were asking that you refrain from filling customer 
orders was the way they said it 
pace said he never returned to executing the same volume of 
customer orders as before he was indicted which he estimated at 
500 to 2000 per day 
yemma said he did not know how many of the 26 indicted merc 
traders continued to handle customer orders after the exchange 
asked them t stop 
a total of 48 people were indicted as a result of the fbis 
undercover probe twenty pleaded guilty and one pleaded no contest 
yemma said that once a trader has pleaded guilty or been proven 
guilty the mercs disciplinary process begins and the trader 
generally is barred from all trading pending a hearing 
in the first of the three trials stemming from the probe a us 
district court jury in july convicted two swiss franc futures 
traders from the merc of relatively minor trading violations and 
acquitted a third of similar charges 
the jury deadlocked on scores of other charges including a 
racketeering charge against one of the defendants and mail and wire 
fraud charges against all three

2 a barrel for all blends effective wednesday an oil ministry 
official said

government committee charged with reviewing oil prices it includes 
officials from the oil finance foreign and other ministries 
on monday oil minister abdelhady kandil did not even wait for 
pricing committee members to assemble for a review and himself 
ordered the 3 a barrel increase 
egypt previously reviewed export prices every two weeks but 
changed the practice after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait since 
then the reviews have been made at shorter and irregular 
intervals 
egypt produces 870000 to 900000 barrels of oil daily it is 
not a member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
it exports almost half of the output at prices that are set in 
light of world market conditions and opec policies

a 48hour general strike by public and 
private sector employees brought mass transit within greece to a 
virtual standstill wednesday in continued protests at the 
conservative governments austerity measures 
nearly two million people from postmen to actors stayed away 
across the country in the first 48hour strike in 40 years called 
by the general confederation of greek workers the countrys 
largest labor organization 
this was the sixth general strike this year and the fourth since 
the conservatives were elected in april to battle huge deficits and 
a 100 billion public debt 
trains and buses stood still but olympic airways the national 
carrier suffered only slight delays and foreign airlines operated 
normally an athens airport spokesman said 
in cities residents fought for taxis or jammed into already 
crowded streets with private automobiles because of the transport 
strikes in the capital commuters clambered up ladders of heavy 
military trucks ordered by the government to serve bus routes 
traffic lights were knocked out by power cuts adding to the 
chaos in the streets 
hospital personnel school teachers and bank employees also 
stayed away from work state bank employees have been on strike for 
13 days seriously hampering foreign and domestic commerical 
transactions 
following the bank employees others began striking last week in 
protest at the conservative governments costcutting policies and 
its plan to overhaul staterun health and pension schemes 
the weeklong strike by public power corporation employees 
caused periodic blackouts throughout the country with industries 
stopping people being trapped in elevators and food rotting in 
refrigerators 
employees threaten to continue stoppages until the government 
withdraws a bill that the government has presented to parliament 
for debate and a vote next week the government has made some 
concessions but has failed to satisfy the unions 
the government wants to reduce the number of social insurance 
funds increase contributions by individuals tighten eligibility 
requirements and raise the pension age it says that the staterun 
pension funds owe about one trillion drachmas or 67 billion

president corazon aquino signed into 
law wednesday a bill cutting oil taxes by an average of nearly 50 
percent to minimize the effects of an impending oil price increase 
budget undersecretary benjamin diokno said the new law would 
mean a loss in government revenue of 6 billion pesos or 240 
million in 1991 and 15 billion pesos or 60 million this year 
but would benefit consumers 
under the new law taxes on premium gasoline regular gasoline 
and jet fuel were reduced by 30 percent the biggest tax cuts were 
for diesel oil which was reduced by 60 percent taxes on kerosene 
went down by 57 percent 
the tax on liquefied petroleum gas used by millions of 
filipinos for cooking was scrapped 
the tax revisions now pave the way for an expected increase in 
fuel prices requested by the countrys three oil companies 
petroleum prices are governmentcontrolled and have not risen 
despite increases in crude prices brought about by the gulf crisis 
finance secretary jesus estanislao said last week that the 
government cannot continue subsidizing fuel prices at current 
rates 
labor unions have threatened nationwide work stoppages if prices 
are increased and the government appears reluctant to risk another 
round of instability amid continuing threats by communist and 
rightist rebels

users of next computers and industry 
analysts welcomed new models of the sleek black cube saying steve 
jobs has eliminated most of the shortcomings that plagued what he 
once called the best computer in the world 
i think its revolutionary within the industry bill edney 
a computer analyst at los alamos national laboratory said of the 
new next hardware and software unveiled tuesday by jobs 
its not that you cant buy these things on other computers 
the key to what next has done is a vision of where things ought 
to go he said 
jobs at the same symphony hall where he introduced the next 
machine two years ago unveiled faster more powerful and cheaper 
versions of the computer and new applications software all 
intended to answer critics and boost disappointing sales 
the new products also would make next computer inc an industry 
leader this decade by linking individual users through 
sophisticated networks of machines he predicted 
the mission of personal computers was to improve individual 
productivity it was largely achieved in the 1980s jobs said 
whats going to happen in the first half of the 90s we feel is 
interpersonal computing and we think were going to be ahead 
there 
jobs who cofounded apple computer inc and led the development 
of apples macintosh introduced next to a standingroomonly crowd 
at davies symphony hall in october 1988 he predicted it would 
revolutionize the personal computer industry 
the black machines won praise for their sharp graphics 
highquality sound and nextstep builtin software that makes it 
easier to use the complex unix operating system and write programs 
for it 
but next users and other critics complained next was too slow 
and too expensive at 9995 and lacked a floppy disk color monitor 
or adequate software it was a year before shipments started and 
sales were slow only about 7000 machines were sold by june 
according to an estimate by international data corp 
well we listened jobs said of the complaints 
the new models are powered by motorolas new 68040 
microprocessor at least three times faster than the 68030 chip 
used in current models jobs said 
the new next sports floppy disks builtin networking color and 
video monitors and a price ranging from 4995 for an entrylevel 
computer with a blackandwhite monitor to 13999 for a 
bestofbreed colorandvideo system floppy disks are 
standard the optical disks standard on earlier versions are an 
option 
optical discs offer vastly more storage than floppy discs but 
were criticized for being too slow 
shipments of the blackandwhite products are expected in 
november and the others are planned for the first quarter of 1991 
more than 100 new software programs from a variety of companie are 
promised by the end of the year including improv a new financial 
modeling program by lotus development corp famous for its 123 
spreadsheet 
customers in turn have listened to next jobs said the company 
received 15000 orders for the new models during a twomonth period 
in which prospective customers tested prototypes he said 
if we can do that in 60 days you can do the math he 
smiled the orders exceeded his expectation he said but he would 
not reveal that figure 
users and analysts who attended the presentation and product 
fair said jobs was moving in the right direction 
i think from a technical point of view in terms of product 
features hes overcome the great majority of objections said 
david bayer an analyst for montgomery securities in san francisco 
john nguyen an analyst with sutro amp co inc in san francisco 
was pleased with the number of new applications as well as the 
hardware and jobs pricing strategy 
theres quite a fair number of software packages available 
today and i think they have come a long way in addressing that 
particular criticism he said

us petroleum imports rose 41 percent in 
august compared with a year ago a leading industry group said 
today in the first comprehensive look at the nations oil supplies 
for the month in which iraq invaded kuwait 
the invasion on aug 2 threw world oil markets into chaos and 
fears of supply shortages sent crude prices skyrocketing 
the american petroleum institute said in its monthly report that 
imports of crude oil and petroleum products rose to 888 million 
barrels per day in august compared with 853 million barrels a day 
in august 1989 
the august imports were down slightly from july imports api 
said 
analysts had said it would take more than a month for the trade 
sanctions against iraq to start having a real impact on the 
nations energy supplies 
with shipping lags of a month or more from the middle east 
shipments loaded before the iraqi invasion continued to arrive 
during august with some scheduled to continue arriving through 
september api said the government is allowing the iraqi and 
kuwaiti crude to be delivered through oct 1 
the nations stockpile of crude oil and petroleum products was 
up 29 percent from the previous august at 11 billion barrels at 
the end of the month api said that was about the same as july 
but by the end of august crude prices had risen by b70 
percent and more than 100 percent above their levels in mid june 
api said 
analysts had said the actual effects of the boycott might not be 
felt in the united states until mid or late september although 
speculation about coming supply shortages has been enough to drive 
up the price of crude gasoline and heating oil api in its weekly 
report said late tuesday that crude imports were down for the week 
ending sept 14 helping to bring down the nations stockpile of 
crude oil 
deliveries of gasoline stayed at about the same level in august 
compared with a year earlier according to the monthly api report 
retail gasoline prices went up about 20 cents per gallon during 
august when compared with levels earlier in the summer api said 
on an inflationadjusted basis that put pump prices about 20 
percent higher than they have been over the past four years but 
lower in real terms than they had been in the early 1980s when oil 
prices rose in the wake of the iranian revolution 
deliveries of distillates which include heating oil were up 
28 percent in august compared with august 1989 
the nations refineries were operating at 929 percent of 
capacity in august up 4 percent from the previous august but 
domestic crude production fell for august by 48 percent from a 
year earlier api said

baghdad today began confiscating the 
assets of all countries participating in economic sanctions against 
iraq the seizure order also applies to all companies based in 
countries enforcing the sanctions 
the official iraqi news agency said the ruling revolutionary 
command council ordered the seizure tuesday night under a law 
dealing with the protection of iraqi interests money and rights 
in iraq and abroad 
all assets cash deposits property interest and other 
revenue belonging to the governments institutions companies and 
banks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutions 
against iraq are hereby confiscated said the new law the text 
of which was carried by ina 
the statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets in 
iraq or say how much cash was involved 
four days after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the un 
security council imposed an embargo on trade with iraq choking off 
iraqs oil exports and blocking goods heading for the nation most 
countries including the united states have followed the 
sanctions 
iraq will also collect any interest accumulated by the sezied 
assets the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in nicosia 
the council headed by president saddam hussein is iraqs 
highest policymaking body it is the only body that can override 
iraqs national council or parliament 
the text made no mention of kuwait but earlier council 
decisions have stated that iraqi law applies to the emirate which 
baghdad annexed six days after the invasion 
the united states and britain froze iraqi and kuwaiti assets 
immediately after the invasion other countries including all 
european community nations quickly followed suit 
president bush said in a televised message to the iraqi people 
on sunday that saddams invasion of kuwait was going to cost the 
nation an average of 20 billion a year in lost oil revenue 
iraq piled up a foreign debt of 60 billion to 70 billion 
about half of it owed to arab states during its eightyear war 
against iran which ended in 1988 iraq has unilaterally canceled 
its debt of about 10 billion to kuwait 
the rest of the money is owed to japan italy britain france 
and the soviet union most of for arms bought on credit during the 
war 
the new iraqi law said foreign governments that froze iraqi 
assets after the invasion of kuwait are responsible for 
safeguarding the cash and the assets and for protecting any revenue 
coming from accumulating interest on investments 
banks it added were fully responsible for protecting iraqi 
cash plus the interest revenue and any other rights owed to 
iraq 
iraqi companies private and government are not responsibile 
in any way for losses resulting from any delay by foreign firms in 
fulfilling contracts in iraq but these firms are held responsible 
for for any damge inflicted on the iraqi side 
iraqi courts have also been ordered to reject any application 
for any case against iraqi firms private or government and 
declared any ruling by foreign courts against iraqi firms null 
and void

general motors corp is ready to spend more than 
4 billion over the next three years to shut unprofitable plants 
without argument from the united auto workers 
under the threeyear tentative contract the unions bargaining 
council approved tuesday the worlds largest automaker will make 
the money available to assure workers will be paid in full if they 
are laid off by plant closings 
analysts say gm will have to close at least four assembly plants 
and lay off tens of thousands of people in an industry threatened 
by a sluggish economy and foreign competition 
the union made job security its top priority and said its 
objective was reached in the agreement reached early monday after 
41 hours of nonstop talks the contract covers 300000 workers in 
29 states 
gm has closed four assembly plants in the last three years 
putting about 9000 employees out of work 
under the latest pact gm will pay dearly to close a plant it 
guarantees workers laid off for up to 36 weeks 95 percent of their 
wages by supplementing their unemployment benefits anyone laid off 
for more than 36 weeks will be guaranteed full pay for the duration 
of the contract 
the next step for the union is to get the contract ratified a 
process expected to take until the end of the month 
the union would then bargain new contracts with ford motor co 
and chrysler corp where negotiations have been suspended since 
aug 28 when the uaw concentrated on gm 
in all more than 450000 active workers are covered by uaw 
agreements with the big three automakers 
the union probably would prefer to take the pattern to ford 
next but that may depend on whether a canadian auto workers strike 
of fords operations there has been resolved the strike enters its 
fifth day today 
the gm deal calls for a 3 percent pay increase in the first 
year lump sum payments of 3 percent in each of the next two years 
and annual costofliving adjustments 
but job security was a priority the unions ranks have dropped 
to 1 million from 15 million in 1979 
chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell said today the company 
and union may be able to reach an agreement similar to gms without 
a strike but cautioned the healthcare and jobsecurity provisions 
would be expensive 
on the surface it looks expensive job security is something 
you cant legislate he said 
chrysler repeatedly has called for lower healthcare costs but 
bidwell declined to say how stubborn the automaker would be in 
talks on the issue reaching satisfactory healthcare provisions 
with the uaw would be excruciatingly difficult for us without 
shattering the concept of pattern he said

financial adviser james douglas donahue had the 
golden touch and the track record to prove it 
for about a decade he made hundreds of clients happy by 
grabbing doubledigit returns through aggressive trading of stock 
options all the while promising to always hedge his bets 
thats why many of his clients were shocked to learn last month 
that donahue had lost more than 100 million belonging to 1500 
investors in a limited partnership run by his company hedged 
investments associates inc he had gambled big on ual inc stock 
equally as surprising was the way they received that news 
through an 18minute videotape broadcast during a meeting called by 
donahue at a denver hotel sans donahue 
words arent adequate to express my regret and sorrow over the 
impact ive had on your lives donahue said in a choked breaking 
voice i have affected your lives and my life many of you have 
been my friends for 20 years and i feel terrible remorse for the 
things ive done to you 
the investors ranged from the founders of gates rubber co and 
samsonite co both based in denver to retirees who entrusted 
donahue with their life savings 
i suppose i should be just as angry as angry can be said 
bert johnson a 58yearold insurance broker from evergreen colo 
but im not at the point where im bitter as much as im just 
frustrated we dont know what went on my guess is that he broke 
his own rules 
johnson declined to say how much he lost 
as the investors try to uncover just out how donahue lost their 
money hedgedinvestments based in englewood has filed for 
chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in us bankruptcy court 
claiming about 2 million of the 100 million remains 
in addition hedgedinvestments subsidiary aeroturbine energy 
corp in california has filed a petition for chapter 11 
reorganization 
donahue and his firm already have been named in at least four 
lawsuits alleging he was negligent breached his fiduciary 
responsibility and failed to allow access to records 
attorneys and investors agree it could take more than a year 
just to sort out the complex case 
donahue was known as an aggressive trader in stock options 
which are contracts to buy or sell stocks for a specified price in 
the future aides say donahue lived by two rules never take an 
excessive position in any one stock and always hedge a technique 
to ensure potential losses are minimized 
the thing that attracted not only me but obviously bigger 
hitters than i was was the concept that this is a hedged fund 
operation client johnson said you cover all your options so 
that it doesnt matter if the stock market goes up and down you 
have yourself covered in both directions that was the major 
selling point 
in the past several months donahue gambled that the stock of 
ual united airlines parent would rise but a failed employee 
buyout plan coupled with the drop in stock prices after iraq 
invaded kuwait caught him by surprise 
he wasnt able to cover his position quickly enough he has told 
investors 
he basically acknowledged he broke the promise that hed 
always hedge said chesley culp iii a denver attorney 
representing several small investors its intentional 
misrepresentation 
attorney harry hobson whose client union texas petroleum 
corps pension fund lost an estimated 8 million said there was 
no inkling that the firm was in trouble the fund invested because 
it appeared at the time i think that he had a good earnings 
record he said 
robert dill donahues attorney said investors were aware of 
the risk involved nonetheless he said donahue was very 
depressed and upset and concerned about the effect this had on many 
friends and associates 
donahue received a bachelors degree in business from the 
university of denver in 1959 and earned a masters degree in 
mathematics from stanford university the following year 
in july 1960 he joined the research department of martin 
marietta corp in denver as a statistician and computer systems 
analyst he became part owner in falcon research development co in 
may 1966 then joined the staff of science applications inc a 
specialist in statistical and computer research in 1974 
intrigued by the stock options trading industry donahue 
developed and refined his own theory which he detailed in a 
newsletter called options strategies that was published from 1974 
to 1976 
in 1977 donahue opened hedgedinvestments using his computer 
software program to assess stock risks 
he kept the number of limited partners in each venture to fewer 
than 100 to avoid registering with the securities and exchange 
commission but some of the partners like company retirement 
funds were comprised of 100 or more investors 
donahues concept attracted investors of all financial 
backgrounds from retirees to denver business leaders and pension 
retirement funds including weyerhaeuser co of tacoma wash 
which lost 35 million in hedgedinvestments 
as the years passed donahue reportedly earned 15 percent to 20 
percent annually for his clients 
he really was very impressive from the standing of seeming to 
know what he was doing said johnson who described donahue as 
friendly and intelligent its no secret that he was showing for 
approximately 10 years fantastic returns on money that people were 
investing with him 
some investors said they were skeptical about the ualblamed 
losses noting that donahue never provided them with the results of 
a company audit and as of june 30 hedgedinvestments had informed 
clients that their investments still showed an increase several 
have said 
attorney harvey sender who has been appointed trustee of the 
chapter 7 liquidation process said the case is complex because of 
the amount of money and documentation involved 
since the announcement was made late last month union texas 
weyerhauser paradigm partners inc of northbrook ill hampw hedge 
fund of california and denverbased debt investment inc have sued 
donahue hedgedinvestments or aeroturbine to recoup losses 
among the investors listed in documents filed in bankruptcy 
court are charles gates owner of gates rubber several members of 
the shwayder family former owners of samsonite dianne ingels a 
former director of the failed silverado banking savings and loan 
and laurence demuth jr secretary and general counsel of u s west 
inc 
johnson said he knows several retirees who lost so much they 
will be forced to return to work but he notes donahue too is 
suffering 
hes a broken man himself when all this stuff shakes out 
hell lose everything he had johnson said he might keep his 
house but his reputation is gone

as hammers and saws drone in the 
background george varga spins his vision of how general electric 
co will boost its tiny western european light bulb business by 
leveraging the newly opened markets of the east 
the beachhead is tungsram a collection of 12 light bulb plants 
once owned by the hungarian government ge took control of tungsram 
in january for 150 million in the largest us investment in that 
nation since world war ii 
from an aged factory complex in budapest varga is directing 
ges efforts to revitalize tungsram and make it the hub of its 
europewide light bulb expansion efforts 
for ge a key attraction of tungsram is its lowcost labor 
workers earn 2000 to 3000 a year on average varga says the 
company can produce bulbs for the lowest cost of all major light 
bulb makers 
but for the longtime ge executive the lure was more personal 
born in hungary varga fled in 1956 when soviet tanks rolled in 
returning to run one of the nations largest and bestknown 
companies has been a triumphal homecoming said the 53yearold 
stanford university graduate 
this is a turn of events i never expected he said in a 
markets after the communists took over but 40 years of 
state control left a bloated payroll and outdated plants run by 
political appointees 
however varga said he was pleasantly surprised when he arrived 
in february at tungram headquarters by and large we expected 
something worse than we got he said 
both the condition of the machinery and the skill level of 
tungsrams 18000 workers was better than anticipated 
varga also says some of the beliefs about workers in formerly 
communist countries have not been borne out 
people work he said one of the myths is the communist 
worker is lazy im amazed at how they hustle 
he believes the stereotype had its basis in the fact that many 
plants in communist countries were chronically short of raw 
materials so there was little for the workers to do 
but despite these promising signs much hard work lies ahead for 
varga and his small crew of western managers 
among the more pressing concerns is paring costs varga said he 
wants to eliminate 2500 jobs this year through attrition and 
about 2000 more next year that must be done without raising the 
ire of the workers union 
at the same time ge plans to spend at least 20 million this 
year modernizing tungsrams plants and 30 million more over the 
next four years 
my private opinion is it will be a lot more said varga who 
has managed ge plants in several other nations but never a light 
bulb factory 
not all of tunsgram is begging for an overhaul on the top floor 
of one of the factory buildings at the headquarters complex lies a 
highly automated headlight assembly line installed by the japanese 
the equipment pumps out topquality bulbs that end up in toyotas 
and nissans varga said 
varga also says tungsrams incandescent bulbs are up to world 
standards they are sold throughout europe and in the united states 
at the ikea housewares chain and other outlets he said 
but tungsram is behind in making gasdischarge lamps such 
as fluorescent bulbs its fluoresent tube assembly lines need to be 
altered because they break too much glass and waste raw material 
he said 
aside from trimming the payroll and updating plants varga said 
he must break down the autocratic culture of tunsgram under the 
communists 
everything was done through rules procedures and orders no 
questioning of this he said 
varga said he has dispatched about 20 key hungarian managers to 
ges us plants for training in western ways and has sent about 
50 others to a western management course in hungary 
varga also has taken to strolling through the plants to chat 
with workers and let them know hes aware of their concerns the 
walks have startled employees used to distant communist factory 
bosses he said 
on the other hand workers are aware that if they dont do the 
job i can fire them something that was difficult for managers 
to do under the communists 
im sure that frightens them he said 
varga said the attitude of employees about ges plans has 
changed from pessimism to skepticism 
first they thought there were going to be massive layoffs 
he said then they wondered whether we knew what we were doing 
a continuing source of friction with the workers is pay the 
union is pressing for raises that at least keep pace with hungarys 
rampant inflation about 35 percent this year 
varga has raised wages about 20 percent so far this year he 
said hes told the workers that tungsram cant afford any more 
he also has instituted a merit pay system anathema to the 
communists under this much of a workers pay increase is based on 
an evalutation by his supervisor 
varga said ge is under no illusion about what it will take to 
modernize tungsram though it was profitable when ge bought 
control the us company doesnt believe it will recoup its 
investments for some time and is more concerned with building 
market share in the meantime 
aside from meeting ges goals varga said he feels pressure to 
become a model for turning around a former communistrun operation 
this is more than just a job he said a lot of people are 
watching this

the mustang ranch nevadas oldest and most 
infamous legal brothel shut down after filing for bankruptcy 
liquidation a trustee says the us government will try to operate 
the business until it can be sold 
a lawyer for owner joe conforte said wednesday that internal 
revenue service harassment killed a 5 million deal to sell the 
bordello more than 100 bedrooms on a 440acre ranch and forced 
it into liquidation in federal bankruptcy court 
officials said conforte owes 13 million in federal taxes 
conforte has said the debt is no more than 7 million 
the mustang ranch has frequently been in the headlines as an 
illegal operation then the states first legal bordello one man 
was killed on its premises at least one wedding was held there 
the bordello 10 miles east of reno has been under chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection since 1982 under chapter 11 a business is 
allowed to operate under court supervision to pay off creditors 
under chapter 7 its assets are liquidated and the proceeds 
distributed among creditors 
two attempts to sell the business through public stock offerings 
failed including a 10 million offering last year 
prostitutes fled the scene after tuesdays bankruptcy court 
filing out of fear the irs was about to raid the place 
everybody just grabbed everything called taxis and their 
boyfriends and got out said a woman who identified herself as 
sheila 
on wednesday four women who had worked there returned to get 
belongings and talk they sat in red velvet chairs in the lobby and 
complained about events and about conforte 
one woman who identified herself as beth said joe cleared 
out the bar the cashier everything and walked out with a bag of 
money then somebody called and told us all to leave 
assistant bankruptcy trustee bill knudson said the bankruptcy 
court plans to supervise the business and watch the money he 
added thats what our goal is to keep it in operation until 
they can sell it 
knudson said plans to immediately reopen the brothel were 
blocked by state health rules which require any prostitute who 
leaves the premises to be retested for sexually transmitted 
diseases that can take three days 
conforte attorney pete perry declined to name prospective 
purchasers who had agreed to pay 5 million for the property in the 
deal that fell through 
we assured the irs it wasnt conforte but they wanted to 
create problems and they did perry said they want a 
background investigation of the buyers and they have no right to 
do that it was an attempt to harass and intimidate the new 
purchasers 
ron smith chief of special procedures for the irs in nevada 
said he is required by the federal tax code to do a background 
investigation in any case involving sale of a tax debtors 
properties 
conforte and his wife sally began operations at the ranch in 
the late 1950s when prostitution was tolerated but illegal in 
nevada the operation was burned down in 1960 by local authorities 
who contended it was a public nuisance 
in 1971 conforte won storey county approval for the brothel 
pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in most 
nevada counties now prostitution is allowed in 11 of nevadas 14 
rural counties but forbidden in the counties where reno las vegas 
and carson city are located 
prostitutes rented their rooms at the ranch which also got half 
their earnings they accepted credit cards in advance 
a prospectus for one of the unsuccessful attempts to sell stock 
listed gross revenues for the brothel of 56 million in 1986 down 
from 59 million the year before but a 1986 profit of 917000 
compared with 848000 in 1985 
in 1976 heavyweight boxer oscar bonavena was shot to death at 
the gates of the mustang after he demanded to see conforte a 
conforte bodyguard willard ross brymer served 18 months after 
pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter 
conforte fled to brazil in 1981 after being convicted of tax 
evasion but returned in december 1983 in a deal with prosecutors 
to testify against us district judge harry claiborne of las 
vegas conforte claimed claiborne took 85000 in bribes 
after a hung jury resulted in a mistrial justice department 
prosecutors dropped charges related to conforte and won a 
conviction against clairborne 
claiborne was convicted of hiding more than 100000 in income 
from the irs he was later impeached

the economy may be sliding into a recession and 
atlantas mid1980s boom may be over but economists say the 1996 
olympic games will give the area an economic shot in the arm that 
could last into the 21st century 
atlanta will be a pocket of prosperity in a dismal national 
scene said jeffrey rosensweig an assistant professor of finance 
at emory university business school 
this could not have come at a better time we had no other 
engine for growth this will be a catalytic event restarting the 
metro atlanta economy 
the olympics will have a 35 billion financial impact on metro 
atlanta including 12 billion in direct spending by the atlanta 
organizing committee said university of georgia economist jeffrey 
m humphreys 
another 400 million is expected to be spent by visitors to the 
area and 19 billion in indirect spending is projected said 
humphreys who is director of the universitys economic forecasting 
project 
the games are expected to generate 85000 new jobs 
if youre working for a construction firm youll obviously 
feel the impact directly humphreys said if youre not you 
will feel the impact indirectly as people working for these firms 
spend their money in your business 
humphreys projects 96 million in direct spending by the aoc in 
1990 and 18 million in 1991 mostly for architecture planning 
and consulting services but as activity accelerates from 
construction of facilities to ticket sales and preolympic cultural 
events the impact will soar to 2787 million in 1994 and 453 
million in 1996 he said 
the money will come primarily from television revenues ticket 
sales and corporate sponsorships 
its a great shot in the arm agreed donald ratajczak 
director of the economic forecasting center at georgia state 
university but he called the 35 billion economic impact a 
monkey number because the aoc study did not deduct the 
undetermined amount of business displaced 
also downplaying the economic benefits to metro atlanta tuesday 
was l phillip humann senior executive vice president of suntrust 
banks inc humann said the olympics might not be the economic 
bonanza that some initial reports predict because those reports 
estimate the games impact by assuming that hotels and restaurants 
have no business without the olympics 
the areas sagging construction industry will be helped 
although competition to build the needed olympic facilities will 
come from all over the nation and the world humann said 
aw dahlberg president and chief executive officer of georgia 
power co said the exposure gained for metropolitan atlanta by the 
olympics will trigger significant new investment in the area and 
therefore new jobs 
its putting atlanta on the international map dahlberg 
said this creates a whole new sense of where atlanta is and what 
we have to offer the world

few us companies appear to be affected by 
iraqs seizure of assets from countries participating in an embargo 
against it experts and business people said wednesday 
policies that restricted business dealings with nonarabs appear 
to have protected the handful of us companies that have invested 
in the persian gulf nation and neighboring kuwait which iraq 
occupied aug 2 
nonarabs have not been allowed to own land in either iraq or 
kuwait furthermore nonarabs may only hold minority positions in 
joint ventures with either iraqis or kuwaitis according to a us 
commerce department trade specialist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
among the few major us corporations with iraqi ties is general 
motors corp which agreed last year to cooperate in building an 
assembly plant with the capacity to produce 130000 cars and trucks 
in iraq 
gm vice president john rhame said the terms of the deal were 
that gm provides only the transfer of technology and consultation 
assistance we had no financial interest in the plant no 
investment no equity it was entirely their deal 
rhame said a similar arrangement existed between the iraqis and 
the german automaker daimlerbenz ag 
gm hoped to benefit ultimately by shipping usmade parts to 
the plant which was in the early stages of construction but the 
giant automaker was entirely unaffected when iraq moved wednesday 
to seize the assets of all companies in countries enforcing 
sanctions 
david t mizrahi editor of the new yorkbased newsletter 
mideast report estimated that us assets in iraq amount to a 
few hundred million certainly less than a billion dollars 
he noted that since the united states resumed diplomatic 
relations with iraq only five years ago there hasnt been enough 
time to build up a huge position in iraq 
texaco inc has no operations in iraq but the oil company does 
own a refinery that pumps about 50000 barrels of oil a day in 
kuwait near the iraqi border texaco spokesman david dickson said 
that texaco does not know the status of the refinery at this time 
but he added that it is not significant to texacos worldwide 
operations 
michael saba president of gulfamerica an illinoisbased 
international business services firm said there had been between 
15 and 20 major american companies recently operating in iraq 
saba who travels frequently to the middle east and left the 
area a week after iraq invaded kuwait said he had a significant 
amount of money sunk into a conference that was to be held next 
month in bahrain the conference which iraqi businessmen had 
planned to attend has been rescheduled for february and will be 
held in the united states 
pepsico international also had no assets in either iraq or 
kuwait though its soft drinks are sold there through franchises 
with independent arab bottlers spokeswoman anna nerbovig said 
morrison knudsen corp the boisebased general contractor 
was in the early business development stage and had a number of 
potential manufacturing opportunities in iraq but virtually no 
money invested there said spokesman jess hawley 
there are significantly more us business ties to kuwait but 
under similar terms experts said major companies that have 
transferred equipment to the persian gulf most likely have 
insurance to cover its cost they added

grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade as fears of weekend frost in the midwest 
melted away 
on other commodity markets cotton futures soared livestock and 
meat futures were mixed energy futures were mixed and precious 
metals fell 
in chicago wheat futures settled 4 cents to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 269 a bushel corn was 
3 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 222 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 116 a bushel 
soybeans were 9 cents to 15 cents lower with november at 617 a 
bushel 
contracts for september deliveries of grains soybeans soybean 
oil and soybean meal expired at noon cdt 
the soybean and corn markets were hit hardest by waves of heavy 
selling that intensified near the close 
corn and soybean prices had rallied in the previous session 
after some private forecasters predicted frost by monday in the 
midwest where those crops are concentrated 
analysts said tuesdays rally also was stoked by rumors which 
proved unfounded that the agiculture department had revised 
recent soybean supplyanddemand statistics

these things came to pass said gerald zusel manager of balfour 
maclaine corps trading floor operations at the board of trade 
they started selling it and the lower it went the more 
selling you brought in and what you ended up with was a debacle 
he said 
tightsupply concerns helped boost cotton futures on the new 
york cotton exchange where the nearby october contract rose the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound 
ernest simon cotton specialist with prudentialbache securities 
inc said the surge was prompted mainly by the relatively small 
amount of cotton certified by the exchange as deliverable against 
the october contract 1600 bales with another 2500 bales pending 
certification 
that amount compares with october delivery obligations of more 
than 200000 bales as of the end of tuesdays session 
most of those obligations will be canceled by offsetting trades 
prior to the delivery date but simon said cotton merchants will 
seek to take delivery of all the cotton they can get because recent 
rains in the southeast have washed away expectations for an early 
harvest of the new crop 
cotton settled 05 cent to 2 cents higher with october at 7590 
cents a pound

russias parliament wednesday joined the growing 
calls for soviet prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov to resign 
blaming him for the nations economic crisis and saying his reform 
plan cannot rescue it 
the people are living worse each year said ilya 
konstantinov a lawmaker from leningrad 
its obvious that the ryzhkov government could not and cannot 
correct the problem its also obvious that the ryzhkov government 
is opposed to adopting the radical program of economic reforms 
he said 
the russian supreme soviet or parliament voted 1544 with 18 
abstentions to call for the resignation of the national cabinet led 
by ryzhkov as prime minister he heads the soviet government 
bureaucracy that many accuse of impeding reforms 
legislators then went behind closed doors to draft a formal 
resolution to be submitted to the republics parliament and 
adjourned for the day since russia is only one of 15 soviet 
republics the resolution would not be binding however the 
expression of noconfidence is a major blow to ryzhkov who has 
been under fire for months 
the russian action came three days after thousands of 
demonstrators marched in moscow and demanded ryzhkovs resignation 
citing the failing economy many also called for soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to resign 
members of the russian parliament led by russian president 
boris n yeltsin said wednesday they did not believe ryzhkov would 
carry out a proposed plan to create a marketbased economy in 500 
days 
yeltsin who has previously called for ryzhkov to step down 
left the session before the vote an aide said later he was not 
feeling well 
the russian parliament voted overwhelmingly last week to adopt 
the 500day plan the national parliament is now considering 
whether to aprove it or one of two other major proposals ryzhkov 
presented his proposal the most conservative to the national body 
last week 
he has acknowledged publicly that his government will not be 
able to implement the more radical 500day plan and he indicated 
he would resign if the national parliament voted for it 
several leading reformers have called for ryzhkovs resignation 
since he presented his plan which envisions continued central 
control of the economy while gradual moves are made toward a 
marketbased system 
by contrast the program adopted by the russian parliament calls 
for switching to a market economy within 500 days 
the 500day plan would return land to private farmers sell 
government enterprises to private stockholders and gradually remove 
statecontrolled prices on many goods it would transfer most 
economic authority from the central government to the 15 soviet 
republics most of which are pushing for greater sovereignty or 
independence 
gorbachev has backed a compromise plan that contains many 
elements of the 500day blueprint but would move more slowly and 
leave the central goverment with strong powers including the 
ability to levy taxes in the republics 
ryzhkov 60 became prime minister in 1985 and he has often 
been seen in public next to the soviet leader 
ryzhkov is one of the architects of perestroika the 
restructuring program gorbachev introduced but mikhail malei a 
moscow lawmaker complained the prime minister has done a poor job 
in his five years in power the country has become poor in 
any other country in the world in such conditions the government 
would resign malei said 
another moscow lawmaker sergei shakrai said the current 
government is not capable of guaranteeing the sovereignty of russia 
or pulling the country out of its economic crisis 
a delegate from the siberian region of yakutsk said the 
parliament should not blame just ryzhkov but also gorbachev for 
the shortageplagued economy the russian parliament did not go 
along with the suggestion 
under soviet law the national parliament could call an 
extraordinary meeting of its parent body the congress of peoples 
deputies which by a twothirds vote has the right to force the 
prime minister and his cabinet out of office

higher heating oil prices led an afternoon rally 
in the oil futures market wednesday after news of large stockpiles 
of gasoline pushed early prices down 
light sweet crude which had lost about 1 by midday closed 
down 23 cents at 3318 per barrel for october contracts on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
contracts for the next three months advanced as traders bought 
later months and sold october crude which has just one more day to 
be traded 
were seeing some desertion of those october barrels said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
heating oil rose 210 cents to 8853 cents for october delivery 
analysts attributed the rise to seasonal demand as well as some 
buying by european traders 
unleaded gasoline fell 171 cents to 8990 cents per gallon on 
october contracts falling also for the next three months but 
rising for later months 
natural gas was down onehalf cent to 1555 per 1000 cubic 
feet for october delivery near months were also down a bit with 
distant months higher 
the markets responded early to the american petroleum 
institutes weekly report issued tuesday night which showed 
gasoline stocks up to 217 million barrels last week from 2111 
million barrels a week earlier 
traders said market players were focusing more on supply and 
demand factors and less on headlines and rumors than they have 
during many sessions since the persian gulf crisis began 
late in the morning api released the first comprehensive look 
at the nations oil supply for august the month in which iraq 
invaded kuwait most of the figures were within expected ranges 
despite fears of shortages caused by the subsequent embargo of 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil us petroleum imports rose 41 percent in 
august to 888 million barrels per day compared with a year ago 
api said the august imports were down slightly from july imports 
analysts had said it would take more than a month for the trade 
sanctions against iraq to start having a real impact on the 
nations energy supplies 
with shipping lags of a month or more from the middle east 
shipments loaded before the iraqi invasion continued to arrive 
during august with some scheduled to continue arriving through 
september api said the government is allowing the iraqi and 
kuwaiti crude to be delivered through oct 1 
the nations stockpile of crude oil and petroleum products was 
up 29 percent from the previous august at 11 billion barrels at 
the end of the month api said that was about the same as july 
but by the end of august crude prices had risen by between 70 
percent and more than 100 percent above their levels in midjune 
api said 
the weekly api report released the night before showed crude 
stocks down for last week

after traders shrugged off disappointment that rising inflation 
might delay a decline in interest rates 
but shortterm interest rates bobbed up due to diminished

market analysts said 
it was another volatile session the market was focusing on 
what chairman greenspan had to say said kevin flanagan money 
market economist at dean witter reynolds inc he pretty much put 
a wet blanket on the market 
greenspan told the congressional joint economic committee that 
the jump in oil prices since iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 had 
increased the threat of both higher inflation and a recession 
he conceded that the oil price spike has made it difficult for 
the central bank to carry out its mission of fostering 
noninflationary economic growth 
flanagan said the market initially reacted negatively to 
greenspans comments speculating that the central bank would 
refrain from easing its monetary policy due to inflation concerns 
lower rates benefit fixedreturn investments such as bonds

housing starts fell 17 percent in august to 
the lowest level since the last recession eight years ago the 
government said wednesday 
although were not technically at a recessionary level i 
would describe the industry as in a recession said martin 
regalia an economist with the national association of savings 
institutions 
recession is a very technical term that gives very little 
solace to an individual who has to live and breathe in a particular 
market he added 
what theyre really talking about are conditions that are 
depressed in such a way that the industry clearly is in a major 
decline added economist thomas holloway of the mortgage bankers 
association 
the industry has declined from a peak of 181 million starts in 
1986 to an annual rate of 113 million in august the commerce 
department reported thats the lowest level since 105 million 
units got under way in august 1982 
the august decline was the seventh consecutive monthly drop the 
first time that has occurred since maynovember 1981 
the last recession lasted from july 1981 to november 1982 and 
slowed housing starts to a low of 106 million units in 1982 
a recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarters of 
decline in the gross national product however the official 
designation comes from the bureau of economic research which uses 
additional economic data to determine when a recession begins and 
ends 
were looking for further erosion in housing starts before 
its over said david f seiders chief economist for the 
national association of home builders echoing projections of many 
of his industry colleagues 
regalia said that while there will be no free fall i expect 
the numbers will drift down at this pace for a few more months to 
the 105 million range but i think thats where the bottom will 
be 
applications for building permits seemed to support a continuing 
decline permits which often are a barometer of future housing 
activity fell 43 percent in august to an annual rate of 108 
million 
robert sheehan an economist with the national apartment 
association attributed the housing weakness to relatively high 
longterm interest rates a slowing general economy waning 
consumer confidence and the perceived further threat to inflation 
and the economy from the military situation in the middle east 
construction of singlefamily units fell 32 percent to an 
annual rate of 840000 units in august following a 24 percent 
decline a month earlier it was the lowest number of singlefamily 
starts since 737000 got under way in october 1982 a month before 
the last recession ended 
multifamily starts rose 29 percent to an annual rate of 
287000 after plunging 70 percent in july 
the overall drop in starts was concentrated in the south where 
they plummeted 107 percent to an annual rate of 441000 units 
starts jumped 82 percent to 119000 units in the northeast 49 
percent to 234000 units in the midwest and 41 percent to 333000 
units in the west

prosecutors in the criminal fraud case 
against charles h keating jr acknowledged wednesday they were 
stunned when a judge set bail at 5 million for keating and 1 
million for three codefendants 
for district attorney ira reiner and his staff the high bail 
set tuesday by superior court judge gary klausner was more than 
just a surprise it was an embarrassment 
in negotiating keatings surrender prosecutors had told the 
defense the bail decision would rest with the judge they had 
indicated though that the amount would probably be far lower and 
said they believed 1 million would be appropriate for keating and 
50000 for the others 
when the judge set it at 5 million we were probably as 
surprised as mr keating said mike botula a reiner spokesman 
keating and the others remained in county jails in the first 
criminal case stemming from the 2 billion collapse of lincoln 
savings and loan of irvine calif they face up to 10 years in 
prison each if convicted 
keating an arizona developer is under investigation for 
allegedly looting lincoln he headed lincolns parent company 
american continental corp in phoenix the other defendants were 
top officials of lincoln and american continental 
a 42count indictment accuses them of misrepresenting the safety 
of american continental junk bonds sold at lincoln branches all 
told more than 20000 investors are believed to have lost 250 
million on the securities 
most buyers were elderly many lost their life savings when 
lincoln was seized and american continental wound up in bankruptcy 
court making the unsecured bonds virtually worthless 
sandi gibbons another reiner aide said discussions began with 
defense lawyers soon after the sealed grand jury indictment was 
handed up last week during those talks prosecutors agreed that 1 
million bail would be appropriate for keating and 50000 for the 
others she said 
however the prosecutors agreed to make no bail recommendation 
at tuesdays hearing in return for the defendants appearing 
voluntarily lawyers for both sides said at that hearing to the 
surprise of everyone klausner set the far higher bail amounts 
the defense received some help wednesday from prosecutors who 
agreed to waive the normal fiveday wait before a bail reduction 
hearing accordingly klausner set the hearing for thursday 
morning 
however the judge indicated he felt the higher bail was 
appropriate 
klausner said he was disappointed with the assumption by the 
district attorneys office that if you get together with the 
defense and agree what you want to do that the courts going to 
automatically accept it 
reiner declined to be interviewed wednesday ms gibbons said he 
had known about the 1 million suggested bail for keating and had 
agreed to it nevertheless he would not publicly ask the judge to 
reduce the bail she said 
he agreed with the 1 million bail and he also agrees with 
the 5 million ms gibbons said 
keating 66 of paradise valley ariz became a prominent 
symbol of the nations savings and loan failures because of his 
lavish personal habits willingness to make risky investments using 
taxpayerinsured money and the estimated 2 billion cost of 
bailing out lincoln 
his codefendants in los angeles are judy e wischer 42 of 
paradise valley former president of american continental ray c 
fidel 32 of newport beach calif former president of lincoln 
and robin s symes 37 of malvern ohio former chief executive 
officer of lincoln 
keating is also under criminal investigation by a federal grand 
jury in connection with his alleged looting of lincoln he also 
faces a slew of civil actions including a 11 billion

chevron claimed pennzoil was planning a takeover attempt or 
forced restructuring of chevron management when pennzoil bought the 
stock last november using 21 billion from its 26 billion 
settlement with texaco over a getty oil co takeover fight 
pennzoil says it hopes to buy another 11 percent of chevron 
stock leaving it just below a 10 percent limit set by the chevron 
board in newly adopted antitakeover provisions but the 
houstonbased company said it intended only a longterm investment 
in chevron and a possible federal tax break 
chevrons suit which sought to force pennzoil to relinquish the 
stock was dismissed without a trial by us district judge samuel 
conti he said chevron had failed to present evidence that pennzoil 
had hidden its intentions from investors or the securities and 
exchange commission 
if the investment were patently irrational as a longterm 
investment the court might be able to infer that pennzoil had some 
other undisclosed purpose conti said in a 23page ruling 
he said pennzoil had offered ample unrefuted evidence that 
the company had considered economic analyses showing that chevron 
stock was substantially undervalued and was a sound investment 
were disappointed with the outcome and were looking at the 
merits of an appeal chevrons chairman and chief executive 
officer kenneth t derr said in a statement 
chevron based in san francisco is the nations fourthlargest 
oil company pennzoil is the 14thlargest
