a judge on monday sentenced the former 
pastor of a faithhealing sect to two years in prison for his part 
in the death of the son of church members saying he wanted to send 
a message to cultists 
jeffrey a siegel 33 of chapel hill nc was convicted of 
seconddegree criminal mistreatment spokane county superior court 
judge john schultheis said circumstances warranted going beyond the 
standard 90day sentence for the crime the maximum the prosecutor 
sought 
i have an obligation to send a message to anyone who might 
be interested in beginning a religious cult schultheis told 
siegel 
siegel was the former pastor of a nameless christian sect that 
eschewed conventional medicine in favor of prayer aaron norman the 
10yearold son of sect members bobby and judith norman died dec 
20 1987 of untreated juvenile diabetes 
bobby norman 43 was convicted last month of firstdegree 
manslaughter for failing to seek medical attention for his son 
charges against mrs norman were dismissed prior to the trial 
why is it that it takes a tragedy for people to realize what 
theyve been doing is wrong asked schultheis medicine has been 
given to us by god as much as the power of prayer 
siegel also was sentenced to serve six months for a charge of 
simple assault stemming from a spanking administered to an adult 
church member in a separate incident that sentence will be served 
concurrently meaning siegel will be eligible for parole in 16 
months schultheis said 
before he was sentenced a tearful siegel told schultheis he was 
absolutely ashamed of his participation in the sect and its 
rigid view of the outside world 
i am absolutely heartbroken for what happened to aaron 
norman siegel said 
testimony during the threeweek trial indicated the gravely ill 
boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and sect 
founder doug kleber while siegel and other church elders watched 
the beatings were believed necessary to get the boy to confess the 
sin of masturbation and be healed 
as pastor siegel knew or should have known that aaron norman 
was vulnerable schultheis said spankings and other discipline of 
the 10yearold manifested deliberate cruelty the judge said 
kleber 34 of champaignurbana ill has pleaded guilty to 
seconddegree criminal mistreatment and is scheduled to be sentenced 
later 
testimony also revealed that members were expected to consult 
with church leaders on matters ranging from buying a car to their 
sex lives the fellowship once claimed 300 adult members in four 
states but disbanded in february

pakistan appears to have finally developed 
atomic weapons increasing the threat of a nuclear war with india 
and representing a major setback to efforts to stem the spread of 
atomic weapons around the globe says a study published today 
after a decade of slow advances pakistan appears to have 
joined a group of three other nations that have nuclear weapons but 
dont admit it according to the review by the carnegie endowment 
for international peace 
the other countries in that category are israel india and south 
africa said the report the fourth such survey published by the 
nonprofit group that specializes in national security studies 
five nations have said they possess nuclear weapons the united 
states the soviet union china great britain and france a sixth 
india exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a 
nonmilitary explosion 
efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have 
focused on the middle east and south asia the report noted 
pakistan and india have been the chief source of concern since the 
two countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were 
created by the separation of colonial india from britain 
the report titled the undeclared bombs was written by 
leonard s spector author of the three previous reports spector 
formerly worked on nonproliferation issues at the nuclear 
regulatory commission and the senate energy and natural resources 
nonproliferation subcommittee 
in the past two years spector said convincing evidence 
emerged that pakistan had crossed the nuclear weapons threshold and 
had acquired the essentials for its first nuclear weapons 
that evidence includes production of highly enriched uranium a 
key component of atomic weapons and european reports of a 
previously clandestine effort by pakistan officials to smuggle 
sophisticated nuclear components out of west germany 
the pakistani program is a dilemma for the united states spector 
said in an interview because pakistan is a prime recipient of us 
aid at the same time us officials are pushing pakistan not to 
develop atomic weapons 
two years ago president reagan certified to congress that 
pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons a certification required 
by capitol hill before the us aid program could go ahead but in 
recent months us officials have been less direct in asserting 
that the pakistanis dont have atomic weapons 
meanwhile india has responded by quietly expanding its atomic 
weapons capability and has also worked on development of delivery 
systems including mediumrange rockets the report said india has 
the ingredients to build between 20 and 50 atomic weapons it said 
for the future spector said most observers are looking for 
some sort of mechanism some kind of regional arrangement to bring 
india and pakistan into negotiations the concept is to find a way 
to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves it will be 
difficult but it may be achievable 
the report also highlighted increasing dangers in the volatile 
mideast particularly in light of the spread of longrange missiles 
and chemical weapons among arab enemies of israel 
israel has refused to admit to possessing nuclear weapons but 
the report said the israelis have a substantial undeclared 
nuclear arsenal of at least 50 to 60 nuclear devices and perhaps 
significantly more some of which are an advanced design 
the risk of nuclear escalation in a future mideast war has 
seriously increased the study said because of the improved 
capabilities of arab nations to inflict damage through missiles and 
chemical weapons 
indeed in 1988 israeli leaders began implicitly referring to 
this possibility by declaring that israel would have the ability to 
retaliate against an anticity missile or chemical attack many 
times over it said 
in latin america the report said a nuclear monitoring agreement 
between argentina and brazil should be the top nonproliferation 
priority for the coming year 
that is because brazil announced last year that it had mastered 
the process of enriching uranium and had begun a pilot program at a 
plant that was not subject to international safeguards argentina 
had a similar capability at least five years ago the report noted 
while both nations have pledged not to produce weaponsgrade 
uranium those pledges need to be enshrined in formal policy the 
study said

millions of transportation workers including 
pilots and truckers will be subject to random drug tests under a new 
federal directive that is likely to be challenged in court before it 
goes into effect in december 1989 
the transportation department announced the broadranging drug 
testing requirements monday and immediately the head of the airline 
pilots union promised to fight the regulation both in congress and 
in the courts 
the testing requirements cover all types of transportation 
including airlines longdistance trucks and urban transit systems 
the american people demand and expect a drugfree 
transportation system these new rules will take us as far as 
practically possible toward that goal transportation secretary 
jim burnley said at a news conference 
he acknowledged the tests likely will be challenged in the 
courts the supreme court already has before it two separate 
drugtesting cases including one involving postaccident testing 
of railroad workers that are expected to be decided next year 
the series of federal regulations announced by burnley call for 
transportation companies airlines trucking companies railroads 
and commercial shipping companies to have comprehensive testing 
programs in place by december 1989 companies with 50 or fewer 
employees including tens of thousands of overtheroad independent 
truckers have another year to comply 
the transportation department estimated the testing will cost 
businesses more than 21 billion during the first 10 years but 
burnley said the testing will save the same companies about 87 
billion in increased productivity accident reductions and medical 
cost savings 
in addition to random tests the regulations call for drug 
testing before employment if there is reasonable cause to suspect 
drug use periodically such as during annual physicals and after an 
accident the drugs covered by the tests are marijuana cocaine 
opiates amphetamines and pcp 
the randomtesting provision which requires that at least 50 
percent of a given work force be tested during a single year has 
attracted the strongest protests especially from unions they argue 
that such tests constitute an invasion of privacy have minimal 
benefit and will subject thousands of workers to the consequences of 
false positive results 
random testing is a counterproductive shotgun strategy that is 
at the same time an unwarranted invasion of privacy and of no 
significant value in the battle against drug abuse said henry 
duffy president of the 40000member air line pilots association 
the required testing programs cover 
nearly 3 million longdistance truckers including independent 
drivers and those who work directly for large trucking companies 
intercity bus drivers also must be tested 
more than 538000 aviation employees including 50000 
commercial pilots 80000 flight attendants and 300000 airline 
mechanics air traffic controllers already are subject to similar 
testing requirements 
about 90000 railroad industry workers including engineers 
brakemen and train dispatchers 
nearly 200000 urban transit workers including subway and 
transit bus drivers and mechanics 
about 200000 merchant seamen and other mariners on commercial 
vessels that carry passengers or cargo fishermen are not covered by 
the rules 
critics question whether the regulations can be enforced at 
least as they pertain to independent longdistance truck drivers 
dot officials said such independents will have to join in 
testing pools or be tested under a program operated by the 
company for which they do business officials acknowledged the rules 
do not require truckers to carry proof that they are participating 
in a testing program 
the big question is how are you going to enforce it in the 
case of the selfemployed independents said david gordon a 
spokesman for the american trucking associations which represents 
the trucking companies 
duffy of the airline pilots union said he fears random testing 
may be used by management as a punitive measure against pilots 
he criticized the dot regulation for leaving the program to be 
administered by management with no requirement for rehabilitation 
burnley said the aim is getting the people with drug problems 
off the jobs he said the issue of rehabilitation will have to be 
worked out through labormanagement negotiations 
dot officials said in the last two years there have been 60 
railroad accidents in which participants were found to have been 
using drugs although drug use was not always directly implicated in 
the accidents 
the worst of these was a jan 4 1987 collision of a conrail 
locomotive and an amtrak passenger train in chase md in which 16 
people were killed and 178 were injured the conrail engineer and 
brakeman admitted having smoked marijuana shortly before the 
accident

the national conference of catholic bishops is 
moving toward a showdown vote on whether to reject a draft vatican 
document questioning the theological authority of such conferences 
the bishops softened the wording of their proposed reply to the 
vatican document on monday but pressed toward a scheduled wednesday 
vote without changing their underlying judgment the draft is not 
suitable 
despite frequent public compliments from both sides relations 
have often been uneasy between the vatican and bishops conferences 
particularly those such as the americans which have seemed to be 
growing in prestige in recent years 
pope john paul ii has publicly supported many of the us 
conferences efforts including national pastoral letters that 
stirred controversy outside the church for their criticism of reagan 
administration policies on nuclear arms and the us economy 
however there also has been criticism from high vatican 
officials who have asked for whom the bishops were speaking in 
commenting on matters of doctrine and on what authority 
also on monday acceding to a vatican request the bishops 
postponed a vote on another controversial item but did so only 
grudgingly and with rare public complaints about the way church 
leaders in rome had handled the situation 
while the bishops gave ground they took pains to say they were 
not knuckling under to vatican pressure 
we have not bowed obsequiously to rome in an untoward 
fashion said archbishop oscar lipscomb of mobile ala objecting 
to a reporters suggestion that that was what had happened 
about 300 us roman catholic cardinals archbishops and bishops 
had been scheduled to vote today on new guidelines for settling 
disputes between theologians and bishops but a letter from the 
vaticans congregation for the doctrine of the faith complained that 
the guidelines would make the theologians and bishops equals in the 
settlement process 
bishop raymond lessard of savannah ga chairman of the bishops 
committee on doctrine said he felt all that was sufficiently 
addressed in the guidelines document however he added that it 
seemed wise to postpone action until the bishops june meeting 
several bishops complained about the timing of the vaticans 
complaint including cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago who said 
the intervention might be perceived as confrontational or as 
belittling the episcopal conference which i know is not intended 
cardinal john oconnor of new york said the vatican agency was 
understaffed a possible explanation for the lastminute nature of 
the objection however archbishop john may of st louis president 
of the us bishops conference said the vatican had had the 
proposal for more than a year 
as for the draft vatican document on bishops conferences a 
number of us bishops apparently had been stung by news stories 
quoting in advance from the proposed rejection notice 
the new version distributed by a committee of past conference 
presidents on monday is considerably toned down from the original 
which had used such phrases as rigid and confusing and overly 
defensive and negative to describe the vatican draft 
however it still calls for the bishops to label the vatican 
effort nonplacet so flawed that it isnt even suitable to be 
used as a basis for revision 
several bishops objected to such a label suggesting it would be 
a slap at the vatican this raised the possibility that the 
conferences objections would have to be softened further if they 
are to win the twothirds majority necessary in wednesdays vote 
in other action monday the bishops 
gave first reading to one proposal that would call for easing of 
a 1986 law and give legal standing to many more undocumented 
hispanic workers and to another resolution calling for acceleration 
of religious freedom and an end to intimidation of worshipers in the 
soviet union and other eastern bloc countries 
postponed action on a resolution calling for movement toward 
normalization of relations between the united states and vietnam 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles said vietnameseamerican 
groups in this country were divided on the issue but he said the 
postponement was merely to give the bishops time to consider 
conditions in southeast asia in general 
heard archbishop pio laghi the vatican representative to the 
bishops as well as to the us government call for greater effort 
in keeping hispanicamericans in the church he did not publicly 
mention the simmering vaticanbishops disputes

women in poor physical shape are three times 
more likely to die at an early age of heart disease than are those 
who keep themselves in good condition according to a longterm 
study 
dr lars g ekelund the principal author of the study said it 
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from 
heart disease just as it does men 
poor physical fitness is almost as important as smoking as a 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women said ekelund a 
researcher at the university of north carolina 
the study was based on a 10year followup of 2802 women who 
ranged in age from 30 to 69 the results were presented monday at 
the annual meeting of the american heart association 
this had been seen in males now it carries over into 
females said dr paul l mchenry of the krannert institute in 
indianapolis this confirms what we all expected 
during the study women walked on treadmills while their heart 
rates were measured those who are physically fit have lower heart 
rates while exercising than do people who are in poor shape 
the researchers divided the women into four groups depending on 
their heart rates during mild exercise those in the most fit group 
averaged 107 beats per minute compared with 152 beats among the 
least fit women 
during the decade of followup 40 women died of heart attacks 
strokes and heart failure the risk of cardiovascular death was less 
than 1 percent among the fit women and 2 percent in those who were 
unfit 
ekelund said that while much of the difference in physical 
fitness may be inherited people can also improve their level of 
fitness by exercise 
it has been shown by many studies that you can improve fitness 
levels by just walking he said many people could benefit from 
this later if they felt like they needed more they could progress 
to jogging but the important thing is to have a regular exercise 
program 
the new findings in women are similar to those reported by the 
same researchers in a study of men 
ekelund said the risk of being out of shape is close to that of 
smoking or high blood pressure 
being unfit may be more of a problem for women than for men he 
said because less than 20 percent of us women say they get 
regular physical activity compared with about a third of all men 
among other studies presented at the meeting 
consumption of fat by americans has fallen substantially since 
the mid1960s dr alison m stephen of the university of 
saskatchewan said people may simply be trimming meat better and 
throwing away more fat she said the dietary change may be a major 
cause of the drop in heart attack deaths that began in the late 
1960s 
doctors report progress in developing a variety of devices that 
clean out clogged heart arteries by shaving sanding and burning 
away fatty deposits all of them are intended to improve or replace 
balloon angioplasty a widely used procedure in which doctors reopen 
clogged arteries by temporarily inflating tiny balloons inside them 
the heart disease death rate is declining dramatically among 
middleaged white men a study by dr lewis kuller from the 
university of pittsburgh showed that in one county in pennsylvania 
the death rate in this group fell 53 percent between 1970 and 1984 
a decline in cardiac arrest accounted for the largest share of the 
drop

risks for cancer or heart disease may be revealed 
through analyzing personality and psychotherapy may be able to head 
off the diseases according to controversial research 
if the research holds up under ongoing scientific scrutiny 
we will be entering a new era of health care and disease 
prevention british psychologist hans eysenck writes in the 
december issue of psychology today 
the thrust of research by eysenck and psychologist ronald 
grossarthmaticek is that repressed emotions and hopelessness may 
lead to cancer and hostility and aggression to heart disease 
grossarthmaticek has developed a sixquestion personality quiz 
to identify people prone to cancer or heart disease eysenck writes 
but in a statement accompanying eysencks article senior editor 
joshua fischman warns that researchers have spotted inconsistencies 
and technical problems in grossarthmaticeks studies 
one psychologist found the studies unable to achieve the level 
of certainty that science demands fischman writes 
the findings right now represent more hope than certainty but 
it is because of that hope and the hope for further debate and 
research that we are presenting them fischman writes 
according to eysenck grossarthmaticeks studies supported the 
theory by predicting disease 10 years or more before people died of 
it 
in that research almost half the people considered cancerprone 
died from that disease and fewer than a tenth from heart disease of 
those considered at risk for heart disease about a third died of it 
but only onefifth died of cancer eysenck wrote 
other studies found the risk could be reduced through 
psychotherapy aimed at the personality flaws eysenck wrote for 
example 45 of 50 people considered cancerprone who went through 
psychotherapy were still alive 13 years later compared to 19 of 
another 50 at risk who did not receive psychotherapy he said 
some studies also suggest similar psychotherapy can help people 
with cancer live longer he said

president reagan told a group of schoolchildren 
that he believes its inevitable that a woman will one day be 
president most likely after first serving as vice president 
the presidents comments came during a questionandanswer 
session with junior and senior high school students from four 
washingtonarea schools 
as a matter of fact the statesman in the world that i have 
met that i respect the most is the prime minister of england 
margaret thatcher and shes done a remarkable job for england 
the president said 
reagan will play host to mrs thatcher for an official visit and 
state dinner at the white house later this week the british prime 
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the western 
alliance during his nearly eight years in office 
reagan said the idea of a woman president would take a little 
getting used to on the part of some people but i think its 
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president 
because theyve come up in so many different fields 
he added its just my feeling that probably rather than one 
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with 
that maybe it would probably start with one of them as we did in 
the election in 1984 running for vice president she didnt 
make it but that might be the start of it and i welcome it 
reagan was referring to thenrep geraldine ferraro dny who 
had the second spot on the democratic ticket headed by former vice 
president walter f mondale

nagging trade problems and preliminary 
maneuvering on a new us farm bill will face the bush 
administrations incoming secretary of agriculture next year 
lobbying for the cabinet post already is in full swing although 
presidentelect george bush and his advisors have been focusing on 
other matters and have dropped no hints about who might get the job 
trade issues will be near the top of the agenda for the new 
agriculture secretary 
little progress has been made in reaching agreement on farm 
provisions of a new 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
gatt agreement despite two years of talks in geneva a us call 
for phasing out farm subsidies by the year 2000 has received a 
chilly reception 
also stalled are talks aimed at reaching a new longterm grain 
agreement with the soviet union 
the most recent fiveyear agreement expired sept 30 and there 
have been no formal talks since oct 24 when the united states 
rejected a soviet proposal calling for a oneyear agreement 
a freetrade agreement that would phase out most tariffs between 
the united states and canada had been approved by congress but is 
running into trouble in ottawa that is not viewed as altogether bad 
among some us wheat producers and potato growers who never had 
much use for the pact anyway 
failure of the agreement however would be guaranteed to make 
life more complex for the next agriculture secretary 
on capitol hill the house and senate agriculture committees plan 
to start talking next year about a farm bill to replace the omnibus 
1985 farm legislation that expires in two years 
the 1985 law is largely a blueprint for a massive cleanout of 
huge grain surpluses that had piled up driving down prices and 
bringing on what came to be known as the crisis in rural america 
huge subsidies were provided to boost exports at clearance sale 
prices as part of the effort to make farm surpluses disappear 
surplus milk and cheese remaining on the shelf were simply given 
away to the poor 
the measure is generally viewed as a success usda analysts say 
net cash income for the farm sector in 1988 should be near and may 
top by a small margin last years record 571 billion despite the 
summer drought 
for that reason many in the agricultural community think there 
will be little change in the thrust of the next bill 
but the secretary is certain to face an array of tough challenges 
as lawmakers set about their work new programs to help specific 
crops are bound to be debated along with plans to reform the 
troubled federal crop insurance program and further tighten 
pesticide regulation 
with the 70yearold agriculture secretary richard lyng saying 
the time for retirement has arrived or at least will when bush is 
sworn in candidates are lining up for the secretarys job 
one who says he does not want to serve in the cabinet and would 
like to return to private industry is us trade representative 
clayton k yeutter the onetime nebraska feedlot operator had long 
been mentioned as a possible future agriculture secretary 
getting a strong boost from congressional republicans is rep tom 
coleman rmo he is a force on the house agriculture committee but 
is not a farmer and thus like lyng might need to have someone 
with experience in production agriculture in the deputy secretarys 
slot 
lyngs deputy peter c myers raised crops and livestock in 
southeastern missouri between 1955 and 1982 when he came to 
washington to become head of the soil and conservation service he 
has become a favorite at usda 
bushs campaign assurances to voters that he is an 
environmentalist might sway him to opt for myers the architect of 
several major soil conservation measures contained in the 1985 farm 
law 
that far from exhausts the list if lyngs lowkey businesslike 
approach captures bushs fancy the new president could turn to bill 
lesher a washington consultant and former lyng business partner 
also being mentioned are former rep cooper evans riowa 
mississippi soybean farmer seymour johnson and american farm bureau 
past president bob delano

the supreme court at least for now is keeping 
out of the continuing national debate over abortion rights 
the justices on monday refused to give husbands legal power to 
prevent their wives from terminating pregnancies 
without comment they rejected arguments by an indiana man who 
said he had fundamental rights and interests in his unborn 
child the action left intact a state court ruling that upheld a 
mothers right to have an abortion 
there has been speculation that an increasingly conservative high 
court is prepared to take a new look at its landmark 1973 ruling 
roe vs wade that legalized abortion nationwide 
the author of the 12yearold court opinion justice harry a 
blackmun has said he believes there is a very distinct 
possibility roe vs wade will be reversed during the courts 
current term 
but on monday the justices gave no signs they are eager to 
tackle an abortion controversy now 
the court let stand a ruling last july by the indiana supreme 
court that said allowing a husband to block a wifes abortion is 
barred by past high court rulings 
the high court in 1976 struck down a missouri law requiring 
spousal consent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the 
first 12 weeks of her pregnancy 
the indiana case stems from an attempt last summer by erin andrew 
conn of elkhart ind to prevent his estranged wife jennifer from 
having an abortion she was about six weeks pregnant at the time 
a state trial judge issued a temporary order barring mrs conn 
from having the operation but a state appeals court threw out that 
order 
erin has no right to veto jennifers decision as such 
decision concerns only her the appeals court ruled 
the indiana supreme court upheld the appeals court ruling 
the injunction prohibiting mrs conns abortion was lifted last 
july 22 and she had an abortion 
the conns are in the midst of divorce proceedings conns 
attorney james bopp of terre haute said a decree is expected 
within days 
the father argued that the 1973 and 1976 high court rulings did 
not preclude state courts from taking a husbands rights into 
consideration on a casebycase basis 
the father has fundamental rights and interests in his unborn 
child which should be judicially considered on the facts of this 
case along with the rights and interests of his wife in aborting 
their child lawyers for erin conn said 
but the indiana courts rejected such a balancing test 
in other action the supreme court 
cleared the way for enforcement of federal court subpoenas 
requiring ferdinand and imelda marcos to turn over financial records 
and other material to a grand jury 
the justices refused to shield the deposed president and first 
lady of the philippines from the subpoenas related to a new york 
case in which they are charged with looting their nations treasury 
of more than 100 million 
ruled 63 in a case from arkansas that states may hold a 
second sentencing trial for a defendant mistakenly sent to prison as 
a habitual offender 
let stand a ruling in a louisiana case that the federal voting 
rights act designed to prevent racial discrimination applies to 
state judicial elections 
agreed to consider the constitutionality of a connecticut law 
aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it 
does in three neighboring states 
agreed to decide in a case from texas whether investors claims 
against brokers must be settled by binding arbitration 
agreed to use a case from arkansas involving truckers and one 
from florida involving a liquor distributor to determine whether 
states must refund taxes collected under laws later declared 
unconstitutional

rep henry b gonzalez says the savings and 
loan industry crisis would be his top priority as chairman of the 
house banking committee but analysts say his expected selection to 
the post may might delay a solution 
with the backing of house leaders the 72yearold texas democrat 
is considered the most likely successor to rep fernand j st 
germain dri defeated last week in his bid for a 15th term 
gonzalez a hottempered outspoken maverick is urging swift 
action before the poor condition of the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp becomes a chaotic crisis 
he advocates establishing a 50 billion line of credit from the 
treasury to be partly repaid from the sale of loans and property 
from failed sampls 
nobody wants a taxpayer bailout but there are limits to 
what the industry can do and theyve reached those limits 
gonzalez told the national association of mortgage brokers on monday 
gonzalez later told reporters if it ever gets around that 
theres nothing insuring those accounts and deposits you could have 
chaos 
some analysts said they believed gonzalez sometimes 
confrontational style could further fragment an already divided 
house banking committee thus complicating congressional efforts to 
find a solution to the sampl industry crisis 
hes bright he understands problems and he can be very direct 
with what he says said bert ely a financial institutions 
consultant in alexandria va but its one thing to be able to 
make cogent comments and its another thing to be able to forge a 
legislative compromise that may be where he has problems 
a new banking chairman is also taking over in the senate where 
donald w riegle jr dmich is expected to succeed william 
proxmire dwis who is retiring 
the new bush administration likely will fill the leadership 
vacuum left by the transition in congress according to r dan 
brumbaugh a savings industry consultant and former chief economist 
of the federal home loan bank board 
but he added its hard not to believe this is going to slow 
momentum 
gonzalez a 27year veteran of congress gets high marks from 
colleagues for personal integrity and a willingness to speak his 
mind they also say he is a likeable man despite a temper that 
caused him two years ago to slug a man who called him a communist 
however many question gonzalezs ability to rein in his own 
views enough to ride herd on a committee with more than 50 members 
and nearly as many factions 
in 1977 gonzalez was appointed to chair a special committee to 
investigate the assassinations of president kennedy and martin 
luther king jr but within weeks he quit in a dispute with the chief 
counsel leaving the committee in turmoil 
as chairman of the banking subcommittee on housing since 1981 
gonzalez has shown a confrontational style he once called housing 
and urban development secretary samuel pierce the only black member 
of the reagan cabinet a stepin fetchit 
he also had advocated the impeachment of former federal reserve 
board chairman paul volcker who was pushing up interest rates in 
the early 1980s to fight inflation 
former rep henry a reuss a wisconsin democrat who preceded st 
germain as banking committee chairman says gonzalez might do better 
in the post than many expect 
under the reagan administration it just has not been possible to 
pass housing legislation reuss said adding that gonzalez has 
shown a capacity to learn and grow and i think that will stand 
congress in good stead 
gonzalez discounted talk that he may be too rigid in his views 
ive never considered myself an ideologue no matter how ive 
been labeled he said you cant last in politics unless 
youre in the traditional american vein of pragmatism 
he said much of the criticisms circulating are hobgoblins 
calculatedly set forth by those who have ambitions themselves

george bush just finished with a 
twomile run bounded across the beach and threw himself into the 
choppy waters he caught a wave bodysurfed in and swam around a 
while later he waded back in shoulderdeep to cast a fishing line 
against the brisk waves 
after an hour or so he took a break to visit his mother and go 
to church then piloted a us customs power boat some 40 miles back 
down the coast and leaped into the water for more fishing afterward 
he played nine holes of golf 
this was a typical vacation day for the 64yearold man who takes 
over the white house next jan 20 
bush showed during his fourday stay in this balmy beach 
community that his idea of relaxation is physical activity he 
enjoys a variety of outdoor sports 
one day he followed his morning jog with a trip out to a coast 
guard cutter 400 yards offshore in a motorized raft he jumped off 
the cutter and swam part of the way in then grabbed a rope off the 
raft for an armnumbing tow to shore against the choppy waters 
white house physician dr rodney savage has pronounced bushs 
fitness exceptional for a man his age and expressed amazement at 
his health and stamina 
his loping walk is that of a younger man and he moves around a 
tennis court with an alacrity that makes up for his unimpressive 
serve 
in an election day match he and son marvin bush played doubles 
with son jeb bush and soninlaw bill leblond in houston just hours 
before bush learned he had been elected president the 
presidenttobe lunged for balls and zigzagged across the court 
energetic and clearly competitive with the younger men 
toward the end of his long presidential campaign bush complained 
of physical fatigue saying he missed having the time to jog which 
he said invigorates him often on the campaign trail he had a 
stationary bicycle brought to his hotel room 
since the election he seems to be making up for the inactivity 
of long airplane rides and motorcades 
bush told reporters in a beachfront news conference that his 
fridaythroughtuesday morning vacation in florida helped him clear 
his mind 
ive been able to run every day he said i love the 
fishing it doesnt matter what you catch its the fact youre out 
there and fishermen know that and so im still of the isaac walton 
school that the days i spend fishing should not be deducted from 
the time i spend on earth

a vegetarian diet quitting cigarettes 
moderate exercise and up to an hour a day of yoga meditation can 
help reverse heart disease symptoms without the use of drugs 
according to a california study 
dean ornish a professor of medicine at the university of 
california san francisco said that instead of using any drugs his 
program forced dramatic changes in lifestyle to bring a significant 
improvement in the health of patients with coronary artery disease 
the program is radical he admits but for the small group 
tested it worked 
for many who have heart disease said ornish the 
conventional therapy which includes drugs or surgery some diet 
revision and exercise may not go far enough 
ornish outlined his research in a paper presented monday at the 
annual meeting of the american heart association 
he devised a strict program that started with a week of training 
and preparation a vegetarian diet that was less than 10 percent 
fat and 16 hours a week of group therapy patients who smoked were 
required to quit a moderate exercise program usually walking was 
devised individually for each patient and to manage stress the 
patients were taught yoga meditation and relaxation exercises 
to test the concept ornish put 50 patients with coronary artery 
disease into two groups all were tested to find the condition of 
their arteries how well their hearts were supplied with blood and 
the amount of cholesterol in their bloodstream cholesterol is a 
fatty material in blood that can lead to clogged arteries 
for those in the first group ornish provided the traditional 
lifestyle care which included some counseling on how to lower 
cholesterol levels controlling high blood pressure and quitting 
smoking 
the second group however was placed on what ornish called a 
very demanding regimen of lifestyle changes 
we were asking them to make huge changes in their lifestyle and 
then evaluated the effects using high technology xray and imaging 
techniques he said 
the program started with a sevenday retreat during which the 
patients were evaluated by a psychologist and by exercise experts 
they were taught how to use yoga to relieve stress and were placed 
on the strict diet 
after the retreat the group met for eight hours two days a week 
for instruction sessions in exercise yoga and food preparation 
we provided the lowfat food for some in takehome 
containers said ornish they found it was not as hard as you 
would think the group support goes a long way 
at the end of a year 29 patients completed the testing analysis 
12 in the lifestyle changes group and 17 in the ordinary care or 
control group 
for the control group the arterial lesions or clogging of 
vessels supplying blood to heart grew worse vessels that were 441 
percent blocked closed further to 462 percent blocked 
for the lifestyle group the progression of the disease was 
halted and some arteries measurably opened up providing additional 
blood flow to the heart they went from an average of 444 percent 
blocked to 408 percent a clear regression improvement in the 
artery health said ornish 
there was a significant decrease in blockages in the lifestyle 
treatment group and a significant increase in blockages in the 
control group he said 
ornish said he used yoga and other stress control techniques 
because earlier studies have shown emotional stress can play a 
role in increasing and reducing lesions 
also he said stress can increase cholesterol in the 
bloodstream regardless of diet ornish said studies have shown 
for instance that cholesterol rates go up for drivers during auto 
races and for students during final examinations 
yoga is an ancient way of managing stress said ornish 
its very practical he said patients were urged to meditate an 
hour a day 
cholesterol counts in the treatment group declined from a median 
of 227 milligrams per decaliter to 135 well below the recommended 
maximum of 200 
patients in the study were aged 40 to 74 he said and those who 
were the sickest seemed to be helped the most 
the blockages that were the most severe seem to improve the 
greatest said ornish 
the california scientist cautioned that though the results were 
encouraging they are preliminary and that the number of patients 
was too small to draw final conclusions on the value of the 
treatment system

andrei d sakharov the nobel laureate and 
soviet human rights activist says soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev is using undemocratic means in attempts to improve 
conditions in their country 
from my point of view this is dangerous sakharov said 
he spoke monday to a group of american intellectuals after 
comparing notes on human rights and the us strategic defense 
initiative with president reagan at the white house 
today sakharov is scheduled to receive the albert einstein peace 
prize and a 50000 award for making an enormous impact on the 
conscience of the world 
a nuclear physicist who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb 
sakharov has long been the principal human rights advocate in his 
country he was confined to virtual house arrest in gorky for six 
years until gorbachev arranged his release in 1986 
the soviet leader also arranged for sakharovs first visit to 
america 
but sakharov at a session monday of the woodrow wilson institute 
for scholars said gorbachev may not have a longrange program for 
reform 
he said gorbachev improvises and often compromises with 
existing forces that negate his efforts 
specifically the soviet nuclear physicist criticized gorbachevs 
consolidation of power the absence of multiparty and freemarket 
systems as well as restrictions on meetings and demonstrations 
there is no clear realization how this system should be 
reformed sakharov said 
in fact he said the partial reforms arranged by gorbachev could 
lead to disequilibrium 
before leaving the soviet union on his first trip to the west 
sakharov leveled similar criticisms at the soviet president 
sakharov supports glasnost a term for openness that has marked 
gorbachevs 3 years in power but complains that the soviet leader 
has accumulated too much power as both president and communist party 
chief 
his tactic seems to be getting democratic reforms through 
undemocratic means sakharov said from my point of view this is 
a dangerous action 
on the human rights front sakharov said some dissidents remain 
in psychiatric institutions along with many more people who were 
chronic critics of their employers 
he called the detention system one of the most acute abuses 
in the soviet union 
earlier sakharov discussed the plight of dissidents with reagan 
at the white house 
the president said until the problem is completely eliminated 
human rights will remain an irritant in ussoviet relations 
the 67yearold sakharov met with reagan for about 20 minutes in 
the oval office they shared a cautious approach to the measures 
taken by gorbachev 
sakharov mindful of reporters at a picturetaking session drew 
reagans attention to two dissidents vazif meylanov and mikhail 
kukobaka who sakharov said still are being held 
he called the detention of meylanov ironic since he was sent 
to prison protesting the removal of sakharov from moscow to gorky in 
1980 im free to travel and he is in prison the human rights 
activist said 
sakharov speaking through an interpreter said kukobaka is in 
prison for refusing to bear false witness against a foreign diplomat 
reagan praised gorbachev as more cooperative than any kremlin 
leader before him but said we can only wait and see if the 
soviet leader makes good on a promise to release all political 
prisoners 
sakharov told the president there are only individuals left 
in jails implying that gorbachev in principle at least does not 
adhere to a policy of detaining dissidents for their views 
sakharov winner of the nobel peace prize also voiced concern 
about the impact that reagans missile defense program known 
popularly as star wars might have on efforts by the superpowers to 
negotiate a cut in longrange nuclear missile stockpiles

the energy department says it overestimated how 
much natural gas american industry has been using a mistake that 
had set off false alarms about the energy efficiency of the us 
economy 
the error arose when a new reporting form confused many of the 
companies that report gas deliveries to the departments energy 
information administration 
eias quarterly publication short term energy outlook for 
october which reached users monday said the previous quarters 
estimates of industrial natural gas consumption in the first half of 
1988 were about 8 percent too high 
the agency started checking its statistics when the july edition 
of its outlook reported a 26 percent firsthalf increase in 
industrial gas use implausibly high 
in fact the first half increase was about 6 percent to 313 
trillion cubic feet 
natural gas is a major source of energy for home heating 
electricity generation chemical manufacture and industrial process 
heat a little less than a quarter of all energy comes frm gas 
industrial gas use is about 8 percent of the total national energy 
bill 
without the exaggerated natural gas changes there would have 
been no significant change in the estimated energy efficiency in the 
economy the closely watched ratio of energy used in producing a 
dollars worth of goods and services 
environmentalists use this as a rough indicator of damage to the 
environment from economic activity policymakers watch it as an 
indication of future vulnerability to interruption of oil imports 
ken brown an eia analyst said the agency distributed new 
reporting forms to gas companies delivering gas to industrial users 
with the start of 1988 the new forms asked for physical deliveries 
of gas no matter who owned it 
the old forms required listing deliveries only of gas owned by 
the reporting company no matter who delivered it 
some companies continued to report the old way which meant some 
gas was counted twice once by the owner once by the shipper 
eia said 43 companies apparently have consistently misreported 
their monthly deliveries resulting in an overstatement of 
industrial consumption in the first six months of 1988 of 05 
trillion cubic feet 
now that the errors have been corrected the agency expects 
industrial gas use of 615 trillion cubic feet for all of 1988 only 
a 44 percent gain instead of the 19 percent increase projected in 
july on the basis of the overestimates 
the energy crises of the 1970s prompted major efficiency 
improvements everywhere in the united states for example autos 
averaged about 13 miles per gallon of gasoline in 1973 congress 
required 275 mpg by 1985 a goal since relaxed to 26 mpg 
more efficient processes have continued to be introduced in 
industry and energy efficiency gains accelerated from an average of 
12 percent per year in the 1970s to 28 percent in 19801986 
but in 1987 for the first time in 11 years efficiency failed to 
improve a stagnation many analysts attributed to the collapse in 
oil prices of 1986 
it took 19960 british thermal units or btu to produce a 
dollars worth of goods and services in 1987 measured in dollars of 
1982 buying power this was roughly the same as the 19950 btu of 
1986 
a btu is a standard unit of energy equal to the amount of heat 
needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree 
fahrenheit 
in july the agency forecast a 1988 ratio of 20180 btu per 
dollar or a 11 percent decline from 1987 and a 1989 ratio of 
20050 a 06 percent improvement from 1988 
the corrected october forecast predicts 19840 btu per dollar an 
improvement of 06 percent from 1987 and improvement of 13 percent 
to 19590 btu in 1989 
one analyst alan durning of the worldwatch institute an 
environmental research group said i could believe an 
improvement of 06 percent 
i would expect gains in the aggregate of about a half 
percent per year just from the technologies and how much room for 
improvement there is almost indefinitely durning said 
but at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in berkeley 
calif analyst lee schipper said that even after the data 
corrections as far as im concerned thats no change theres a 
plateau if i were a policymaker id be worried

a major environmental study today recommended 
that congress set a national goal of reversing the centuriesold 
trend of destroying more wetlands than are created 
the report called on congress to approve legislation encouraging 
the formation of wetlands preservation trusts perhaps by restoring 
some tax incentives for land donations that were restricted by the 
1986 tax law overhaul 
the study group called the national wetlands policy forum is 
composed of state and federal government officials industry 
representatives and environmental interests it was convened by the 
conservation foundation a private washingtonbased research group 
at the request of the environmental protection agency 
the report urged congress to add wetlands restoration and 
creation to the missions of the army corps of engineers the bureau 
of reclamation the soil conservation service the federal highway 
administration the tennessee valley authority and other agencies 
it said these agencies along with the fish and wildlife service 
and the national marine fisheries service should be required to 
organize a major effort to seek out public lands for restoration 
especially where government activity had caused wetlands to be lost 
existing federal and state protective programs are too 
cumbersome and the responsibilities too diffuse to guarantee 
protection of wetlands the report said 
it is a system that allows hundreds of thousands of wetland 
acres to continue to be lost or degraded annually almost unnoticed 
while substantial resources and time often are devoted to 
determining the fate of a few relatively small areas it said 
the fact that the protection of wetlands makes good economic as 
well as environmental sense for society but not necessarily for the 
individual owning them is central to much of the conflict over 
wetlands protection policies the report said 
setting a national goal of reversing the trend toward a shrinking 
wetlands base does not imply that individual wetlands will in 
every instance be untouchable the report said it said the aim 
should be that the nations overall wetlands base reach 
equilibrium between losses and gains in the short run and increase 
in the long term 
no one knows how fast swamps marshes bogs and other wetlands 
are being lost at present although the 200 million acres present at 
the time europeans settled what became the lower 48 states are 
believed to have been cut in half through conversion to farms urban 
settlement and other uses 
one study estimated that in the two decades leading up to 1975 
400000 to 500000 acres were lost every year 
only in recent decades has it become widely recognized that 
wetlands serve important environmental functions by storing flood 
water supporting a third of the nations endangered species 
nursing and spawning 60 percent to 90 percent of commercial fish 
catches reducing erosion recharging groundwater filtering 
sediment and controlling pollution 
at the extreme as in the case of some migratory birds habitat 
functions can extend even to other continents the report said 
the report called on all states to enact wetlands conservation 
legislation if they have not done so and to draft plans showing how 
they would meet goals of the forum report under the clean water 
act the epa could delegate many of its wetlands responsibilities to 
states with approved plans 
the louisiana coast must get priority attention in considering a 
search for public land for wetlands restoration perhaps through 
diversion of mississippi river sediment into the region the report 
said the louisiana coast is suffering extremely high wetlands 
losses from erosion largely as a result of government flood 
control and other water resource projects 
gov thomas kean of new jersey served as chairman of the wetlands 
policy forum with govs carroll campbell of south carolina and 
booth gardner of washington as vice chairmen

the soviet space shuttle buran touched down tuesday 
morning on a concrete runway in soviet central asia flawlessly 
ending its unmanned 3hour 25minute maiden flight radio moscow 
said 
buran had flown twice around earth on fully automatic control 
then landed at the special 27mile concrete runway eight miles from 
its launch pad at the baikonur cosmodrome 
the ussr has successfuly tested its first reusable space 
craft buran radio moscow said interrupting its regular 
programming 
a previous attempt to launch the buran had been frustrated by 
lastminute technical troubles 
an escort plane followed the shuttle as it approached the runway 
tracking the last moments of the flight with special optical and 
television equipment the official news agency tass said the shuttle 
systems of the buran or snowstorm in russian were tested during 
the completely automated flight 
in yellow flame and clouds of steam the deltawinged buran 
lifted off on schedule at 6 am moscow time 10 pm est despite a 
cold rain indicating there had been no hitches in the automated 
countdown and launch 
the engines of buran were fired twice about threequarters of an 
hour later after it had separated from its booster energia and the 
craft reached orbit exactly on schedule soviet media said 
there was no live broadcast of the liftoff but 90 minutes later 
soviet television showed its first film the shuttle attached to 
energia and four firststage rockets lifted slowly off its pad in 
the early morning dark 
controllers were shown applauding the launch and green computer 
screens showed the flight trajectory 
the crafts own engines were fired for the first time at an 
altitude of 99 miles to nudge it into orbit with its left wing 
facing earth 
before liftoff technicians had been concerned that the buran and 
energia might get covered with a coat of ice 
if the wind rises into a squall and the orbital vehicle and 
energia become covered with a crust of ice then launch time will be 
changed again said correspondent sergei slipchenko referring to 
a failed attempt to launch buran last month 
us officials wont launch the american space shuttle if there 
is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter and cold temperatures 
contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the 
challenger disaster in january 1986 
the radio report said the flight would be long enough to check 
out all the shuttle systems and determine when a manned flight is 
feasible 
technicians began fueling the 198foot energia the worlds most 
powerful booster with nearly 2000 tons of liquid hydrogen oxygen 
and kerosene radio moscow reported monday night 
launch had been set for oct 29 but the countdown was halted 
with 51 seconds left when an access arm failed to pull far enough 
away from the space craft officials said monday they redesigned the 
joint and expected no more trouble from it 
the united states flew its first shuttle the columbia in 1981 
and for years the soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and 
unreliable but western space specialists say the soviets began 
planning their space plane in 1982 at the latest 
few technical details have been made public about the buran a 
lookalike to the us shuttle and staterun media have only 
indirectly indicated its cost 
comparing the cost of the buran program and that of the similar 
us shuttle program 10 billion newspapers say they are 
approximately identical tass reported 
the buran can carry up to 10 cosmonauts tass said 
alexander i dunaev chief of the commercial soviet space agency 
glavkosmos told reporters thursday the maiden flight of the 100ton 
buran will show the soviets if they are ready to begin manned 
shuttle missions 
the soviets have cited the jan 28 1986 explosion of the 
challenger which killed all seven crewmembers aboard as an example 
of the hazards they are trying to avoid 
dunaev said the buran and several additional shuttles planned 
by the soviets will have a different role than their us 
equivalents which were designed to ferry payloads into orbit 
the buran and its sister craft will be used to park satellites in 
space only in exceptional cases dunaev said since the use of 
shuttles for that purpose costs tens even hundreds of times 
more than conventional booster rockets 
soviet reusable spaceships will be used first of all for the 
accomplishment of tasks involved in the operation of space 
technology maintenance operations and recovery of wornout 
satellites he said 
the soviets repeatedly have criticized the military uses of the 
us shuttle but the pentagon says the soviet spacecraft could be 
used to deploy killer satellites ballistic missile defense weapons 
and other military uses 
the energia which can lift a 220000pound payload rivals the 
power of americas huge saturn 5 rocket which was scrapped for 
economy reasons after taking apollo crews to the moon

us rep bill nelson says he was thinking of the 
challenger astronauts families not about any coverup concerning 
the shuttle explosion when he intervened in a dispute over the 
astronauts remains 
its the last thing in the wake of an american tragedy that 
there should be a bureaucratic turf fight over whos going to 
possess the remains of the seven dead astronauts nelson said 
monday that simply was not right in the context of the national 
tragedy we were all suffering and it was not right for the families 
of the seven astronauts 
if i had to do it all over again i would do it exactly the 
same way he said at a news conference 
a story published sunday in the miami heralds tropic magazine 
said nelson a florida democrat who chairs the house space science 
subcommittee acted at nasas behest in calling brevard county 
medical examiner laudie mchenry and telling him to drop his offices 
contention that the autopsies should be performed by brevard 
authorities 
the article implied nelsons actions were part of an alleged nasa 
coverup aimed at preventing the public from knowing that the 
astronauts likely were alive until the challenger slammed into the 
ocean on jan 28 1986 autopsy reports from the county office would 
have been public record 
nelson denied the storys report that george abbey head of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations astronaut office 
called him to ask him to intervene in the autopsy dispute nelson 
said he called abbey in march 1986 to tell him he thought the 
dispute was inappropriate and that he would call the brevard medical 
examiner 
in houston on monday the wives of challenger astronauts mike 
smith and ellison onizuka said they werent surprised to read 
speculation that crew members may have been alive during the 
2minute free fall into the atlantic ocean but that the tropic 
article was distressing 
i think i always felt that mike was alive because his peap 
personal emergency air pack was found still attached to his seat 
breathed down threefourths of the way which was the same 
amount of time that it wouldve taken to impact jane smith said 
at a news conference 
it was in the on position and it is used only on demand so he 
had to be breathing in order to receive the air i have known in my 
heart always i felt strongly that he was alive until that time 
added lorna onizuka i dont know if anything was covered up i 
hope not it was an incident that nobody was prepared for or how 
to handle it when it did happen 
nelson an astronaut aboard the last shuttle mission before 
challenger said the astronauts remains had been recovered in 
international waters and taken to the air force institute of 
pathology and as far as he was concerned a presidential executive 
order signed in february gave the independent rogers commission the 
jurisdiction for all aspects of the challenger investigation 
nelson said mchenry agreed with him attributing the dispute to 
an assistant medical examiner mchenrys office said he was 
unavailable for comment monday 
nasa officials denied they were trying to cover up details of the 
astronauts deaths 
weve made every effort to determine the cause and time of 
death but have never been able to pin it down nasa spokesman ken 
atchison said monday in washington 
nelson said that if there were lingering doubts about the 
challenger disaster his subcommittee would hold new hearings but 
he said the possibility that the astronauts were alive until impact 
wasnt new

following are excerpts of the official 
english translation of the declaration of independence which 
was read in arabic by palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat today 
when in the course of modern times a new order of values was 
declared with norms and values fair for all it was the arab 
palestinian people who were excluded from the destiny of all other 
peoples by a hostile array of local and foreign powers 
despite the historical injustice inflicted on the arab 
palestinian people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them 
of their right to selfdetermination following un general 
assembly resolution 181 1947 which partitioned palestine into two 
states one arab and one jewish yet it is this resolution that 
still provides those conditions of international legitimacy that 
ensure the right of the arab palestine people to sovereignty and 
national independence 
by stages the occupation of palestine and parts of other arab 
territories by israeli forces the willed dispossession and 
expulsion from their ancestral homes of the majority of palestines 
civilian inhabitants was achieved by organized terror those who 
remained as a vestige subjugated in its homeland were persecuted 
and forced to endure the destruction of their national life 
the intefadeh arabic for uprising has set siege to the mind 
of official israel which has for too long relied exclusively upon 
myth and terror to deny palestinian existence altogether because 
the intefadeh and its revolutionary irreversible impulse the 
history of palestine has therefore arrived at a decisive juncture 
in pursuance of resolutions adopted by arab summit conferences 
and relying on the authority bestowed by international legitimacy as 
embodied in the resolutions of 1947 
and in exercise by the arab palestinian people of their right 
to selfdetermination political independence and sovereignty over 
their territory 
the palestine national council in the name of god and in the 
name of the arab palestinian people hereby proclaims the 
establishment of the state of palestine on our palestinian territory 
with jerusalem as its capital 
the state of palestine is the state of palestinians wherever 
they may be the state is for them to enjoy in it their collective 
natural and cultural identity theirs to pursue in it a complete 
equality of rights in it will be safeguarded their political and 
religious beliefs and their human dignity under a democratic 
parliamentary system based on freedom of expression and multiple 
parties the rights of the minorities will duly be respected by the 
majority as minorities must abide by decisions of the majority 
governance will be based on principles of social justice equality 
and nondiscrimination in public rights of men or women on the 
grounds of race religion color or sex under the aegis of a 
constitution which ensures the rule of law and an independent 
judiciary 
thus shall these principles allow no departure from palestines 
ageold spiritual and civilizational heritage of tolerance and 
religious coexistence 
the state of palestine is an arab state an integral and 
indivisible part of the arab nation at one with that nation in 
heritage and civilization 
the state of palestine proclaims its commitment to the 
principles and purposes of the united nations and to the universal 
declaration of human rights it proclaims its commitment as well to 
the principles and policies of the nonaligned movement 
the state of palestine herewith declares that it believes in 
the settlement of regional and international disputes by peaceful 
means in accordance with the un charter and resolutions 
therefore on this blessed day november 15 1988 as we stand 
on the threshold of a new dawn we humbly bow to the sacred 
spirits of our fallen martyrs

soviet officials who once criticized the american 
space shuttle as wasteful and unreliable joined the shuttle 
business today with a craft that looks conspiciously like its us 
predecessor 
the official tass news agency even acknowledged similarities 
between the crafts after its space plane the buran made its maiden 
unmanned flight today 
in appearance the buran resembles the us space shuttle which 
has the same streamlined forms and doubledelta wing the laws of 
aerodynamics are international it said 
despite the similarity in appearance and design however the 
soviets seem to have settled on different uses for their shuttle 
named the buran which is russian for snowstorm 
for years the soviets wouldnt even admit they were developing 
their own shuttle though western specialists date the program back 
to at least 1982 
in june 1980 10 months before the united states launched its 
first shuttle the columbia the chief of soviet cosmonaut training 
vladimir a shatalov said soviet officials consider that the 
employment of these spacecraft is not justified for soviet research 
because present tasks can be solved with the welltested methods in 
an economical way 
former cosmonaut konstantin p feoktistov writing in 1984 in a 
soviet newspaper praised the american shuttle as an impressive 
engineering achievement but he added this system is not sound 
economically and technologically 
soviet officials appeared to become believers after settling on a 
different focus for their shuttle than the one nasa chose 
the us shuttle was designed primarily to ferry satellites into 
orbit but alexander i dunayev the head of the soviet space agency 
glavkosmos said in 1987 that shuttles are not as economical as 
singleuse rocket boosters for placing satellites into orbit 
in the clearest hint of the soviet shuttles purpose he said 
such craft are valuable for servicing space stations and satellites 
and recovering objects from orbit 
the reasoning seems sound because ever since they pioneered space 
flight with the 1957 launch of sputnik the soviets have forged a 
proven track record for launching satellites on singleuse rockets 
they put up more than 150 satellites a year more than any other 
country 
in addition the soviets have concentrated on maintaining a 
permanent manned presence in space aboard the orbiting space station 
mir while soviet officials have not said whether the shuttle is 
capable of doing so the shuttle might be able to ferry supplies and 
cosmonauts to mir 
the buran might also have the capability to retrieve and repair 
potentially dangerous satellites in orbit 
the soviets have repeatedly criticized the military use of the 
american shuttle and the next american flight of the atlantis in 
late november is a mission for the pentagon 
but as with the american shuttle the soviets might use the buran 
for military missions the us defense department says the soviet 
shuttle could be used to deploy antisatellite and ballistic missile 
defense weapons 
it isnt clear whether the soviets will try to market their 
shuttles services to foreign customers as they have done with 
their proton rocket boosters if foreign customers are sought 
competition will come not only from the united states but from 
western europe 
the european space agency hopes to have its version of the 
shuttle the hermes on the launch pad in the late 1990s 
the buran clearly has advantages over its american cousin its 
separate booster rocket the energia is powered only by liquid 
fuels which can be extinguished in an emergency it has no 
solidfuel boosters like the one that failed on the challenger 
killing seven crewmembers 
in addition the soviet shuttle can use jet engines in its tail 
giving it more maneuverability in landing than its american 
counterpart 
the buran can also carry far heavier payloads than the american 
shuttle energia can hoist more than 100 tons and the orbiter 
itself can carry about 66000 pounds the us shuttle can carry 
about 55000 pounds 
while soviet officials maintain they did not copy the american 
shuttle the pentagon has a different view 
by using us propulsion computer materials and airframe 
technology and design the soviets were able to produce an orbiter 
years earlier and at far less cost than if they had depended 
solely on their own technology and engineering the defense 
department said in its 1988 report soviet military power

a private latin american collector paid nearly 
25 million at auction for an early pablo picasso painting of a 
mother kissing her sons upturned face setting a record for a 20th 
century work of art 
maternity from the artists blue period sold monday at 
christies for twice its estimate making it the thirdhighest price 
ever paid for a work of art behind vincent van goghs irises 
and sunflowers 
the 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 postimpressionist and 
modern works on sale from the collection of william goetz a 
hollywood motion picture executive and his wife edith the daughter 
of film mogul louis b mayer 
the 28 lots all of which sold fetched 85024500 a record 
for a single owners sale at auction 
this may well be the sale of the century said christies 
president christopher j burge who presided over the auction 
tonights auction was ripe for success unsurpassingly 
beautiful works of art a fiercely competitive market and a 
renowned provenance he said 
earlier burge had predicted that the sale would fetch about 50 
million 
the goetzes built their collection generally considered one of 
the best of its kind during the 1940s and 1950s until this 
summer their paintings hung in their holmby hills mansion in 
california where the couple once entertained lavishly he died in 
1969 she died in june at the age of 82 
after intense bidding maternity sold to an unidentified 
latin american collector whose winning bid was placed by telephone 
the painting was expected to sell for 10 million 
it depicts a bluerobed mother in a highbacked chair with a 
scissors and sewing basket at her feet the child standing next to 
her has a ball in his hands 
the auction house described the painting as a majestic tender 
but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love 
its a great very rare picture burge said it was a 
unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture of 
picassos who painted it when he was 20 he added 
when burge brought the hammer down on the 2475 million bid the 
crowd broke into applause 
irises sold for 539 million in november 1987 a few months 
earlier van goghs sunflowers sold for 399 million 
the secondhighest priced work sold at mondays auction was

criminal acts against blacks asians jews and homosexuals 
nationwide 
two other black men were injured in the attack by three young 
men who had shaved heads and wore military jackets the three 
victims were ethiopian immigrants 
mayor bud clark said in a statement monday he was saddened and 
disturbed by the beatings and urged citizens and public officials 
to find a constructive solution to racial violence 
a cowardly act against any one of our citizens is a cowardly 
act against every one of our citizens city commissioner bob koch 
said at a news conference but let us not react out of hatred let 
us react with love and understanding 
the militant jewish defense organization mailed letters to 
portland synagogues asking them to arm their congregations 
violence will be met with violence said mordechai levy head 
of the 3000member group based in new york 
he said a 10000 reward was being offered for information about 
the beatings or to anyone who physically restrains a neonazi from 
doing violence against a minority group 
police spokesman dave simpson said monday that investigators had 
no leads in finding the men who attacked mulugeta seraw 27 
wondwosen tesfaye 24 and tilahule antneh 31 he said they may be 
skinheads 
seraw was pronounced dead at emanuel hospital amp health center 
where the two survivors were treated and released 
portlands african community planned a memorial service for 
seraw who emigrated from ethiopia seven years ago and worked at a 
car rental agency 
this is really kind of sad for somebody to be looking for 
someone with dark skin said abdi hassan who teaches a course on 
southern africa at portland state university no one is safe 
really and its a scary thought 
about 2000 skinheads are active in 21 states according to a 
report issued last month by the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith which surveys race or religionmotivated crimes 
the northwest coalition against malicious harassment last month 
identified oregon as a hotbed of skinhead activity in portland 
skinheads have been linked to various acts of vandalism and at least 
two assaults including the beating of an asian man in march 
portland and the northwest are ripe for such activity because so 
few members of minority groups live here said herman brame 
executive assistant for the black united fund the northwest has 
been targeted by white supremacist groups as the site for an aryan 
homeland 
asked if portland police were tracking skinhead activity simpson 
would say only that the police intelligence unit is aware of some 
of their activities 
being a gang member isnt against the law we deal with people 
who violate the law he said 
antneh and tesfaye told police they were dropping seraw off at 
his apartment in a primarily white neighborhood early sunday when 
three men and two women pulled up in a car 
the three men beat seraw with a baseball bat and kicked him 
antneh said and beat the other two when they tried to intervene he 
said the attack lasted no more than two minutes 
the women inside the car were shouting they were saying lets 
kill him kick him antneh told the oregonian newspaper they 
the men never said anything they just jumped us 
skinheads were suspected in the beating death last december of a 
41yearold black man in tampa fla and the stabbing death in 
february of a 24yearold white man who took a black friend to a 
party in santa clara county calif

a ballot question that cuts insurance rates 
20 percent should take effect while the state supreme court 
considers insurance industry lawsuits seeking to void it says state 
attorney general john van de kamp 
california voters passed proposition 103 last week but lawsuits 
filed immediately by insurance companies claim the rate rollback for 
car home and business insurance is unconstitutional 
van de kamp asked the court monday to withdraw the order it 
issued last thursday blocking enforcement of the initiative 
residents who voted for the proposition believed they would see 
immediate insurance rate relief he said in papers filed with the 
court 
that expectation should not be frustrated without giving the 
initiative a fair chance to work he said 
the attorney generals brief said insurers are unlikely to win 
their suits against the initiative and have not shown that they 
would suffer irreparable injury if proposition 103 were allowed 
to take effect while the insurance suits were pending 
but if the court did not want to go as far as withdrawing its 
order van de kamp said it should let all proposition 103s 
provisions take effect except for the rate rollback and require 
insurance companies to set aside enough money to lower their 
premiums if they lose their case 
members of voter revolt a group that backed proposition 103 
said monday they didnt have enough money to enter the case now but 
were starting a fundraising drive to pay for a later court 
intervention 
proposition 103 which was fiercely opposed by insurers and 
passed by a narrow margin requires insurance rates to be reduced to 
20 percent below their november 1987 level it also requires a 
freeze at that level until november 1989 when auto insurance rates 
would be cut an additional 20 percent for motorists with good 
driving records 
in addition the measure includes an exemption from the rollback 
for insurers who could show a substantial threat of insolvency 
and conversion of the state insurance commissioner from an appointed 
to an elected office in 1990 
the measure allows the insurance commissioner to consider an 
insurers financial situation in granting exemptions from the 20 
percent rollback and in reviewing future rate increase applications 
insurance companies argue that the rollback violates their 
constitutional property rights by denying them the ability to make a 
fair profit 
insurers spent at least 60 million fighting proposition 103 and 
other rate reduction initiatives on the ballot and promoting an 
unsuccessful nofault auto insurance initiative it was the most 
costly state proposition fight in the nations history 
since the election several insurers said they would no longer do 
business in california in the latest announcement state farm 
mutual auto insurance co the states largest home and auto 
insurer said it has stopped issuing new policies in the state 
meanwhile in massachusetts allstate insurance co said monday 
it would become the third major insurer in two years to stop writing 
new auto insurance policies in that state where insurers say strict 
regulation of rates prevents them from making a profit 
allstate lost 115 million in massachusetts over the past five 
years largely as a result of the unique regulatory environment 
for auto insurance said kevin sullivan director of allstates 
group auto division

attention away but he said other states are facing the same 
fiscal problems im back and rarin to go he added 
during his conference at the massachusetts statehouse dukakis 
appeared rested after his first weekend of rest in months the 
defeated democrat ducked reporters questions about his political 
future 
its too early to tell im back at a job i love im 
challenged by it dukakis said promising to make a decision on 
his plans sometime next year

addressing the annual meeting of 
the organization of american states secretary of state george p 
shultz criticized its members for not doing more to pressure 
nicaragua into democratic reforms 
this organization has not always been out front on issues 
concerning democracy he said in the meetings keynote speech 
shultz said nicaraguas leftist sandinista government had 
promised the oas it would maintain a pluralistic political 
system but that member states had not held the nicaraguans to their 
commitment 
victor hugo tinoco nicaraguas viceminister of foreign affairs 
disagreed 
the general movement is towards discussion towards 
negotiation he said during an informal press conference the 
oas has started to take a political role in ending the central 
american crisis 
tinoco noted that secretarygeneral joao baena soares has agreed 
to a direct role in monitoring a nowstalled peace agreement between 
the leftist sandinista government and usbacked contra rebels 
the meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateral 
truce declared for the duration of the session by leftist salvadoran 
guerrillas opposed to the government of president jose napoleon 
duarte 
duarte in welcoming the delegates condemned the guerrillas and 
called for support for the overall central american peace process 
other topics discussed at the general assembly included latin 
american debt the us concern with drug trafficking and the oass 
own financial straits 
the oas is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behind 
on their dues the united states which provides the oas 
headquarters in washington owes 41 million 
the member governments must decide what they want to do with 
the oas at this critical juncture in the life of the americas 
said baena soares lamenting the organizations critical economic 
condition 
the brazilian was reelected by acclamation to a second fiveyear 
term as oas secretarygeneral 
an oas commission has recommended that the group cut its 66 
million annual budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of about 1000 
staff members 
delegates to the general assembly will decide whether to accept 
that recommendation this week 
shultz who will be replaced by james a baker when 
presidentelect george bush takes office in january said he would 
press for full funding by the us congress 
the us failure to pay its full contribution has been 
interpreted by some latin nations as an effort to reassert its 
dominance over the oas 
the oass original sin is that it was founded to further us 
aims in latin america tinoco said but other countries are 
trying to contribute a little more 
bosco matamoros a contra spokesman who came to san salvador to 
press the rebels case questioned tinocos motives 
they want negotiations on a biblical time scale to last a 
thousand years he told the associated press they only want to 
stretch things out to reinforce their grip 
at a news conference after his speech shultz pointed to the 
exclusion of panama from a meeting of latin american nations last 
month as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could be 
taken by oas nations 
panama shultz noted pointedly was excluded from the group of 
eight because it was no longer a democracy while under gen manuel 
antonio noriegas thumb 
in another speech to the assembly chiles foreign minister 
felipe errazuriz reiterated the intention of gen augusto pinochets 
government to hold elections in 1989 however he said terrorism 
was the major menace to the democratic process in chile

nbc and cbs declared a tongueincheek promo 
war on abcs mammoth world war ii miniseries war and 
remembrance but were nevertheless relieved and surprised when its 
first night didnt do as well as expected 
abc expressed disappointment in the prelminary ratings for 
sundays opening episode even though the first installment of the 
18hour sevenpart first half of the 110 million miniseries won 
the night it only got a 34 share or percentage of the viewing 
audience compared to the 53 share for the winds of war in 
1983 war and remembrance based on herman wouks novel is a 
sequel to the winds of war 
were a little surprised at the first nights viewing levels 
but its quality viewing at its finest and were very proud of 
it abc spokeswoman janice gretemeyer said monday 
abc estimated 50 million people watched the opening installment 
another 14 hours or so of war and remembrance will run on abc 
sometime next year the length of the miniseries was a target of 
nbcs and cbs counteradvertising 
an nbc promo asked viewers to weigh a world war ii movie that 
doesnt end against nbcs lighter fare including a tv movie 
starring vanna white 
the tricky thing is you dont want to use your airwaves to hype 
something on another network in order to say theres an alternative 
we have a couple of spots that weve held back on said nbc 
entertainment president brandon tartikoff 
one of those he described as similar to the old alkaseltzer 
commercials in which gorged americans marveled i cant believe i 
ate the whole thing 
dont be a prisoner of war in your own living room said a 
cbs ad that promoted cbs stars 
i think there are things you can get away with with humor 
said cbs spokesman george schweitzer we were not disparaging the 
competition and we will never belittle or disparage the 
competition but tongueincheek humor is acceptable when it works 
the first part of the epic miniseries was rushed on the air this 
month because the writers strike delayed production on abcs new 
series 
in the 17 largest tv markets war and remembrance had a 
rating of 238 on sunday night nbc ran the hit theatrical movie 
back to the future and got an 181 and a 26 share cbs had an 
114 and 16 with a madefortv comedy western where the hells 
the gold 
the 18hour the winds of war averaged a 386 rating 
the rating is a percentage of all homes with televisions in the 
markets measured the share is a percentage of sets in use 
abc executives said last month that the network stands to lose 
20 million on the miniseries even if it gets the ratings the 
network guaranteed to sponsors if it doesnt meet the guarantee 
the network will lose additional money by having to provide free 
advertising to make up the difference abc wont say what the 
guaranteed rating was 
the network was hamstrung by author wouks contractual 
limitations on the amount and type of advertising that abc could run 
during the miniseries wouk was concerned about inappropriate 
juxtaposition of some type of commercials with the miniseries 
graphic concentration camps scenes 
the unexpectedly low rating for war and remembrance can be 
ascribed in part to nielsens new measurement system that tends to 
produce lower ratings generally but probably owes more to a general 
trend away from network viewing a trend that was exacerbated when 
the writers strike delayed the networks new shows and summer 
reruns extended well into the fall 
but network executives have been saying for the past few years 
that the days of the lengthy bigevent miniseries are probably 
over most miniseries in recent seasons have been no longer than 
four parts and most have been only two amerika the last long 
miniseries at 14 hours also only abc failed in the ratings two 
years ago

inevitable that someone would put the saga to music 
paul candide a new york composer recently sent gov steve 
cowper a tape recording of his song gentle creatures with a 
letter asking cowper to share it with those who helped free the 
california gray whales from the arctic ice last month a sampling of 
the lyrics 
have you heard of the tale of the whales who got stuck 
and the people who helped set them free 
they were swimming alone when they got down on their luck 
underneath the deep blue sea 
eskimos brought saws to open the sea 
as they joined in to set them free 
and the russians brought icebreakers through the sea 
as they joined in to save those three 
candide told cowper that the whales story touched him so that 
i had to put it into words and music

a springfield couple whose dog 
disappeared last week were reunited with the hound after it was 
pictured in news reports with gov james r thompson 
the governors very happy that the dog is back with its 
owners thompson spokesman jim bray said monday anybody who 
owns a dog knows the heartsick feeling when the dog leaves the yard 
for any extended period 
thompson had decided sunday to keep the blackandtan coon hound 
after troopers found it friday tied to a gate of the governors 
mansion with a note that read please give pup a good home we 
cant we will miss him dearly please take care of him 
the governor who already has two dogs named his newfound pet 
trooper in honor of the state police guards who found him 
bray speculated that when the dog left its owners home it may 
have come into the hands of someone else who left it at the mansion 
rather than taking it to an animal shelter 
maybe they thought there would be plenty of room at the 
mansion he said 
the dogs owners asked not to be identified bray said but there 
was no doubt that it was their pet 
one of the owners described the 4yearold dog in detail 
including a scar on its right ear and a scar on its left hip and 
when she called the dogs real name maximilian he came running and 
jumped into her arms bray said

dead after she was shot beaten and left in a burning house is one 
of the bravest strongest little girls i know says the county 
sheriff 
the girl brook rottinghaus finally sneaked from the burning 
house which contained the bodies of her mother and stepfather and 
was able to get help early sunday authorities said 
okanogan county sheriff jim weed said the girl awoke about 2 am 
sunday to the sound of gunfire she called downstairs from the loft 
where she slept and a man she later identified as lawrence r 
sullens told her the noise was a propane stove popping weed said 
weed said the child saw her mother double over from a wound to 
the abdomen 
the man then climbed the stairs leading to the loft shot the 
girl kicked her in the face and went back downstairs and started 
two fires police said 
brook went downstairs and hid but the man found her pulled her 
into the living room and kicked her in the face again 
when she landed that time she played dead with fires going on 
each side of her weed said 
brook apparently waited a few minutes to be sure the man would 
not come back then ran about a quarter mile through snow in the 
rural area in northcentral washington for help 
this little gal was just exceptionally brave and had 
unbelievable presence of mind in dealing with this situation weed 
said 
the girl was listed in good condition today at north valley 
hospital in tonasket said okanogan county undersheriff mike murray 
he said she was shot in the upper right arm then the bullet grazed

some have taken teddy bears 
i spent an hour with her shes pretty upset but i dont think

the 102 antiabortion activists 
arrested for trying to block the doors of a womens clinic may end 
up paying the police department for costs incurred in handling the 
protest the police chief said 
police chief joe gerwens said monday he had asked city prosecutor 
scott walker to try to recover the estimated 3800 the nov 4 
protest cost the department 
they chose civil disobedience to make a point and they should 
be willing to pay the consequences gerwens said they planned 
on being arrested 
demonstrators planted themselves before the entrance to the sigma 
womens center which advertises abortions waiting to carried to 
paddy wagons and booked on trespassing charges 
it took 26 fort lauderdale police officers plus eight from 
nearby oakland park and the broward county sheriffs office to 
quell the disturbance gerwens said 
in addition to the officers time police cars had to be diverted 
from their assigned zones to handle the protest other costs 
included transportation two portable toilets film for booking 
prisoners an emergency medical truck and an ambulance he said 
bonnie callahan a spokeswoman for the antiabortion organization 
rescue south florida which was among several groups at the protest 
called the plan to seek reimbursement unfair 
ms callahan whose 13yearold daughter was among those 
arrested said the demonstration was not for the purpose of 
getting arrested or getting publicity our main reason was to save 
babies and save women from being exploited 
all those arrested were charged with trespassing and all but one 
were immediately released and given notice to appear in court 
gerwens said that by seeking reimbursement the city was not 
taking a position on the protest only that taxpayers should not 
have to pay for a deliberate disturbance he said the department 
will further pursue the idea of making those convicted of a crime 
pay the police costs involved

a high school teacher will not be 
disciplined for arranging a field trip in which students were 
stripsearched hogtied and forced to eat fishhead soup in a 
simulation of third world prison conditions officials said 
some of the learning activities that were conducted went beyond 
what was really necessary to accommodate the objectives of the 
program said denie young spokeswoman for the wheatonwarrenville 
school district at a school board meeting monday 
superintendent richard short supports the program the prison 
simulation she said the administration just feels that parts 
of it were carried to an extreme 
last months voluntary field trip to wheaton college by 34 
juniors and seniors from wheaton north high school was intended to 
give students a taste of criminaljustice systems included one that 
might exist in a third world country ruled by a despot 
the field trip included stripsearches a meal of potato soup 
with a fish head floating in it blindfolds handcuffs and nude 
duckwalking involving some of the boys ms young said 
the students who participated had no complaints but afterward 
some parents said they were outraged by the field trip and the 
school board asked short to evaluate the program 
short told about 50 parents that there would be no disciplinary 
action against wheaton north teacher david oliphant a popular 
american government instructor who arranged the field trip 
but short said the consent form parents were asked to sign was 
inadequate 
we would want to see to it that the communication with parents 
would be a lot more effective in the future he said there was 
a need for parents to have a greater understanding of what they were 
signing 
the field trip was supervised by don smarto director of the 
colleges institute for prison ministries who acted as the 
warden two college students were guards

the soviet space shuttle buran orbited the earth 
twice today and landed eight miles from its launch pad in soviet 
central asia ending with flawless precision its unmanned 3hour 
25minute maiden flight 
the successful flight puts the soviets into the shuttle program 
alongside the united states a major success for the soviet space 
program it comes after a series of problems including the near loss 
of cosmonauts on a joint sovietafghan mission to the mir space 
station in september 
the buran snowstorm in russian touched down on a 28mile 
concrete runway with a puff of dust from its rear wheels and rolled 
to a halt as three parachutes opened at its rear 
the ussr has successfully tested its first reusable space 
craft buran official radio moscow said interrupting regular 
programming two minutes after touchdown 
the flight originally was scheduled for oct 29 but computers 
stopped that countdown with only 51 seconds left when an access arm 
failed to pull far enough away from the rocket officials said they 
had since redesigned the joint 
within 30 minutes of todays landing soviet television showed 
the fully automated approach and touchdown of the deltawinged us 
shuttle lookalike in the middle of the barren brown steppe 
radio moscow said the flight which had been in jeopardy because 
of cold rainy weather went according to schedule and all onboard 
tests were completed 
pointing to the january 1986 explosion of the us shuttle 
challenger that killed its seven crewmembers soviet officials say 
they will not make a manned flight until all the shuttles systems 
are fully tested in unmanned flight 
they have not said when that might be 
tass said president mikhail s gorbachev informed of the 
flights success said the flight was one more confirmation of the 
kind of huge possibilities the soviet union has to solve any 
problem 
buran separated as planned from the liquid fuel energia booster 
minutes after it lifted off from the baikonur cosmodrome in a flame 
of yellow with clouds of white steam lighting up the early morning 
sky 
about threequarters of an hour later burans own engines fired 
twice at an altitude of 99 miles nudging the craft into its two 
orbits 
television film shot from a jet aircraft showed the shuttles 
dark silhouette against a pale bluegray sky as it approached the 
landing site then switched to closer shots as the shuttle landed 
like an aircraft 
the official tass news agency said as it prepared to reenter the 
atmosphere the shuttle turned its tail forward and switched on a 
retrofire engine at an altitude of 24 miles the craft turned again 
and began its approach like an airplane 
the weather service in moscow reported that it had been raining 
in baikonur three hours before the launch and the temperature was 
39 degrees the weather at the exact launch time was not known 
soviet television said the launch was in jeopardy because of 
rising wind and the danger of ice coating the shuttle and its 
booster 
us officials will not launch the american space shuttle if 
there is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter and cold temperatures 
contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the 
challenger disaster which halted the us space shuttle program for 
2 years 
the last us shuttle mission began sept 29 and nasa plans to 
announce its next launch date on wednesday 
soviet space officals have said their ability to control the 
shuttle entirely from the ground makes it safer than the us space 
shuttle program and after the soviet shuttle program begins in 
earnest fully automated ground control will allow cosmonauts more 
time for scientific research they say 
the united states flew its first shuttle the columbia in 1981 
and for years the soviets criticized the craft as wasteful and 
unreliable but western space specialists say the soviets began 
planning and building their space plane in 1982 at the latest 
tass said buran is 36 yards long and has a wing span of 24 yards 
like the us shuttle it is covered with 38000 heatproof ceramic 
tiles to protect it from the searing heat of reentry 
soviet officials say their shuttle has a bigger payload capacity 
than the us shuttle and that several more are under construction 
it can hold up to 10 cosmonauts and mission specialists 
but the soviet officials say only two to four flights are planned 
yearly and that the soviet space program still will depend on 
singleuse spacecraft for the bulk of its work in the cosmos 
including putting satellites into orbit

prime minister yitzhak shamir entrusted with 
forming israels next government said today that he will try to 
coax the leftleaning labor party into his rightistreligious 
coalition 
labor leader shimon peres accepted shamirs invitation to attend 
coalition talks today but expressed doubts his party would join a 
shamirled government labor and shamirs rightwing likud bloc are 
sharply divided on how to end the arabisraeli conflict 
shamir issued his invitation to peres after being told by 
president chaim herzog that the presidents office had been flooded 
with thousands of calls urging a laborlikud government 
i said many times that i prefer a broadbased government 
including the two large parties shamir said on israel television 
im looking for a way to bring this about 
a unity government would blunt the power of shamirs other 
coalition partners four religious parties that seek to impose 
changes on israels secular majority and three extreme rightwing 
parties that demand annexation of the occupied lands 
the public is worried there is a wish for unity to confront 
the dangers from outside and the separation threatening us from 
within herzog told shamir on monday after asking him to form the 
next government 
shamir has six weeks to form a ruling coalition and is expected 
to get the needed 61seat majority in the 120member parliament 
in the nov 1 elections likud won 40 seats labor 39 and the 
religious parties 18 putting the smaller parties in the position of 
kingmaker 
in issuing his invitation to labor shamir ruled out an equal 
partnership such as the uneasy one formed between labor and likud 
after the inconclusive elections of 1984 shamir also hinted labor 
could help formulate a peace strategy if it joined the government 
but peres appeared skeptical i dont think there are many 
chances for it a national unity government peres said on israel 
radio without elaborating 
labors secretary general uzi baram said his party would not 
accept a junior position and demanded parity in the distribution of 
cabinet posts including senior jobs for peres and labors no 2 
defense minister yitzhak rabin 
but israel radio quoted rabin as saying labor should join the new 
government even as a junior partner to prevent a narrow 
rightistreligious coalition

the israeli foreign ministry today rejected a 
plo declaration of independence for palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip as double talk 
similarly prime minister yitzhak shamir rejected the plo 
announcement of a palestinian state as another step in the war by 
arab terror organizations to destroy the jewish state 
despite moderate language implictly recognizing israel the plo 
document approved monday in algeria was also rejected by foreign 
minister shimon peres leader of the leftleaning labor party 
there is no chance that any declaration of theirs will be 
accepted before negotiations said peres our problem now is not 
solving the palestinian issue but how to open negotiations because 
without negotiations there will be no solution to the problem 
hours after the declaration was announced israels official 
response came in a foreign ministry statement that criticized the 
algiers declaration as double talk employed to excuse plo 
support for violence and terror 
no gimmick can mask the tragedy inflicted upon the palestinian 
people time and again by the absence of reasonable realistic and 
peaceseeking leadership said the statement which called on 
other nations not to recognize the plo state 
shamir addressing his remarks to palestinians in the occupied 
territories predicted there would be political war with the 
palestinians over international recognition of the plo state 
iraq saudi arabia algeria kuwait and malaysia have already 
recognized the palestinian state declared in algiers 
this is not the way to a life of peace security and 
coexistence with the jewish people in the land of israel shamir 
said this is another step in the war of arab terror organizations 
against israels existence and independence and we shall respond 
accordingly 
both peres and shamir spoke at the negev desert communal farm of 
sde boker where israeli leaders gathered to pay tribute to israels 
first prime minister david bengurion on the 15th anniversary of 
his death 
leftwing israelis welcomed the more moderate language of the plo 
and the declarations recognition of the jewish state 
but hardline politicians called for annexation or a massive 
drive to settle jews in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where 
15 million arabs and 70000 israels live 
trade minister ariel sharon a leading member of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc called the declaration a dangerous 
development and said israel should assert its claim by annexing 
part of the occupied land in response 
he said the security situation in the occupied lands could 
further deterioriate at least 312 palestinians and 11 israelis have 
been killed in the 11month uprising 
in an interview with the daily yediot ahronot shamir called for 
negotiations under the ussoviet sponsorship as an alternative to 
a unsponsored international conference favored by the arabs 
negotiations would take place with egyptian jordanian and 
palestinian delegations but not the plo yediot ahronot reported 
israels major dailies headlined the plos new political program 
announced in algiers focusing on its acceptance of un security 
council resolution 242 that implicitly recognizes israel

the leader of southern sudans rebels has 
agreed to a ceasefire in his 5year rebellion and to allow relief 
to reach starving war refugees the official sudan news agency 
reported today 
in return the agency said renegade army col john garang 
expects a national state of emergency to be lifted and a 
constitutional conference convened 
the agreement was reported in dispatches from the ethiopian 
capital of addis ababa where it was to be signed today and from 
nairobi kenya it does not commit the government but prime 
minister sadek mahdi gave the talks his blessing and said he would 
follow up on any agreements reached 
garang negotiated the agreement with mohammed osman mirghani 
patriarch of the democratic unionist party the second partner in 
mahdis governing coalition 
garang organized the sudan peoples liberation army in early 1983 
and began his fight for southern autonomy and political economic 
and administrative reforms thenpresident gaafar nimeiris 
proclamation of islamic law exacerbated the war six months later 
and garang has vowed not to lay down arms until sudans civilian 
government abrogates sharia 
traditionally the countrys moslem majority dominates the 
central government most of the southerners are christian or animist 
relief workers say the accumulated effects of more than five 
years of war have brought widespread famine to much of the south 
this year they estimate that 13 million of the regions 6 million 
inhabitants have fled this year alone with starvation killing more 
than 250000 people 
there was no immediate reaction to the agreement from the 
government foreign minister hussein suleiman abusaleh attended the 
talks as a member of the democratic unionist leadership 
defense minister abdulmaguid hamid khaleel has said the military 
would welcome any peace agreement 
we are the people most concerned about peace because we suffer 
more than the others from war khaleel said we are with the 
strategy of peace but will continue defending the territorial 
integrity of sudan 
the addis ababa talks have drawn fire from another coalition 
partner the fundamentalist national islamic front which saw them 
as a ploy to force the moslem party from the government any 
agreement between mirghani and garang would make future talks 
involving the government ineffective the fronts political affairs 
secretary ali haj said 
the sudan news agency gave few details on the agreement the 
agency said mirghani described his discussions with garang as 
serious and frank

a pediatricians group is calling on parents to 
restrict the time their children spend watching rockmusic videos 
because the images contain too many depictions of sexism violence 
and drug use 
the american academy of pediatrics said monday that it rejects 
censorship but called on producers and programmers to demonstrate 
good taste in their choice of the images shown in videos on 
television 
music videos may represent a new art form but we believe it is 
one that contains an excess of sexism violence substance abuse 
suicides and sexual behavior the academy said in a statement 
dr victor strasburger an author of the statement said the 
academy is not against rock music but listening to rock is one 
thing and watching images on television is another 
teenagers who may not hear or understand rock lyrics cannot 
avoid the often disturbing images that characterize a growing number 
of videos the academy said 
the 34000member academy is based in suburban elk grove village 
mtv spokesman barry kluger defended his music video cable 
channel saying all videos are screened for their depictions of 
women children and drug and alcohol abuse before being allowed on 
the channel 
kluger said he agreed with the academy that parents should more 
actively control what is watched by their children 
were not urging parents to use mtv as a baby sitter he said 
strasburger said the doctors are concerned about the number of 
women who are sexually abused adding that we cant show small 
children images where women are being raped or chained or beat up 
and that is what happens in rock videos he said with one study 
finding that 75 percent of the music videos telling a story contain 
sexually suggestive material and 56 percent of them containing 
violence often against women 
strasburger said parents should watch music videos with their 
children to influence the childrens reaction to the images 
the academy has also criticized soap operas primetime situation 
comedies childrens programming and commercials for displaying 
unhealthy images strasburger said

american females born today can expect to live 
healthier longer lives than those born a quarter century ago but 
the aids epidemic and limited access to the health care system pose 
a serious threat says a status report on todays woman 
citing recent surveys and national statistics the study suggests 
that although women make up a small proportion of those who have 
been diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the 
beginning of the deadly epidemic women are the fastest growing 
group of people with aids 
a separate study on womens health care notes that of the 37 
million americans without health insurance women are most 
vulnerable 
the poverty rate is higher among women especially older women 
and they must rely on inadequate public programs the study said 
women classified as nonpoor are less likely to work than men and 
therefore are less likely to be covered by an employers health 
insurance plan 
the studies are contained in the american woman 198889 a 
status report a 443page collection addressing issues ranging 
from the presence of women in politics to basic health care to 
womens progress in law enforcement 
the report was prepared by the womens research amp education 
institution and was being released today the womens organization 
considers the report a challenge to the new administration of 
presidentelect george bush 
in a chapter devoted to aids the study cites statistics compiled 
by the centers for disease control which found that in the first 11 
months of 1987 1377 women were diagnosed with the incurable 
disease 8 percent of all aids cases reported during that period 
the disease that attacks the bodys immune system is believed 
caused by an unusual virus now called human immunodeficiency virus 
or hiv the virus is spread through close contact with blood or 
semen from infected persons the disease is spread most often 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
or infected blood or blood products 
the study notes that the centers for disease control estimates 
there are 50 to 80 times as many women who are infected with hiv as 
there are women with active cases of aids 
the status report says that 15 percent of women who acquired aids 
through sexual contact were not aware of their contacts risk factor 
intravenous drug user bisexual or the recipient of possibly 
contaminated blood 
to prevent further spread of the deadly aids virus to women and 
their children it is imperative both to educate the general public 
and to mount aggressive targeted outreach efforts to women at 
highest risk the report said 
the chapter women and health care said girls born in 1975 can 
expect to live an average of seven years longer than boys born the 
same year but death rates for women from lung cancer have 
quadrupled and women suffer more than men from infections and 
respiratory diseases 
life expectancy for women has increased rapidly however the 
life expectancy for females born in 1960 was 731 years for those 
born in 1985 it was 782 years the report said 
the governments national center for health statistics reported 
in august that life expectancy for women was 783 years as of 1987 
the same as the high set the year before 
but the most serious problem is access to health care 
a country as prosperous and ingenious as this one is should not 
tolerate the great disparities that exist between men and women 
between the poor and the nonpoor and between whites and minorities 
in something so vital and basic as health care the report said

authorities today ordered two americans 
who had illegally crossed into laos on a search for us prisoners 
of war to remain in thailand pending an investigation of their 
status 
donna long and james copp both from north carolina returned to 
bangkok on saturday after 41 days of detention in a laotian jail 
the laotian authorities detained them after they sailed across the 
mekong river from thailand to illegally enter laos 
once in laos they passed out offers of a 24 million reward for 
americans they believe are still being held more than 13 years after 
the indochina war ended 
when they returned to bangkok immigration officials at the 
airport let them through but kept their passports because they did 
not bear the stamp given when travelers leave thailand said capt 
apisak phumsvi of immigration police 
that delayed the americans original plans to leave for the 
united states wednesday 
apisak said immigration commander maj gen kriangkrai karnasuta 
must approve the americans request that the charges of an 
immigration violation be waived the process normally takes up to 
three days he said 
their case is not a serious violation of thai immigration 
rules apisak said we are looking at it as if it were 
unintentional 
miss long is a 45yearold writer from jacksonville nc and 
copp is a 44yearold schoolteacher from hampstead nc they said 
they were not physically mistreated in laos but were subjected to 
interrogations and spent 32 days in solitary confinement 
they were released after 1500 in administrative costs was paid 
to the laotian government and a veterans group canceled a protest 
planned at the laotian embassy in washington to demand their release 
miss long said a police colonel told her that if any other 
americans dared enter laos illegally again they would be held 
forever forever 
the reward the two americans were trying to publicize was pledged 
by 21 us congressmen and some private citizens 
laos has repeatedly denied it is holding any americans from the 
war 
the state department on monday praised the release of miss long 
and copp but its spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we reiterate 
our conviction that governmenttogovernment cooperation is the way 
to resolve the the powmia prisoner of war missing in action 
issue and that reward offers are counterproductive to this 
ongoing effort 
there are 547 americans listed as mia in laos

warnings about a rapidly spreading computer 
virus have been issued to students at california state university 
northridge following reports the virus is disrupting functions of 
macintosh computers 
in general this thing is spreading like mad chris sales 
the universitys computer center consultant said monday it 
originated in west germany found its way to ucla and in a short 
time infected us here 
school officials say at least a dozen of the macintosh computers 
at the suburban san fernando valley campus have been affected by a 
virus that was discovered last week 
a computer virus is akin to a living virus and can spread from 
terminal to terminal and even computer system to computer system by 
infected discs it can disrupt such functions as word processing 
and printing 
some viruses can even destroy valuable files but cal state 
officials said the bug found there does not erase data it does 
stall computers though and removal requires hours of 
reprogramming officials said 
students computer discs are being tested for the virus before 
they are able to rent a macintosh at the university bookstore 
earlier this month another virus duplicated itself in university 
and government research computers nationwide slowing the computers 
processing speeds and filled up their memories a graduate student 
is under investigation in that case

endorsed by the arabs wants peace negotiations with palestinians 
and arab states to be under the auspices of the united states and 
soviet union 
zeev hever a settlers leader from hebron said the algiers 
declaration has totally no meaning israel rules over the 
territory and decides what happens 
sheik mohammad abu teir a moslem religious leader criticized 
the declarations implicit recognition of israel and repeated the 
fundamentalist stand that all of palestine should be an islamic 
state 
we have been offering sacrifices for many years and now they 
recognize the state of the jews where is the land of this state 
he said by telephone from umm touba village near bethlehem 
the fireworks graffiti splashed on walls and raising of outlawed 
palestine flags came despite an army announcement that palestinians 
could face prison sentences of five years and fines of 10000 for 
such actions 
in bethlehem a map picturing palestine before the jewish states 
creation was painted on one wall with this slogan 
congratulations palestine the map contradicted the 
independence declaration which was based on a 1947 un plan 
calling for creation of jewish and arab states sidebyside in 
palestine 
the algiers declaration was expected to fuel the revolt against 
israels 21year rule in the west bank and gaza strip the 11month 
uprising has cost the lives of at least 312 palestinians and 11 
israelis 
but the declaration will have little immediate impact on life in 
the occupied lands israeli leaders oppose a palestinian state and 
authorities said they would quash unilateral palestinian steps 
toward selfrule 
palestinian leaders expressed hope the declaration would get the 
stalled peace process moving by implicitly recognizing israel 
this is the beginning of a new era for the palestinians said 
lawyer fayez abu rahme a prominent plo supporter in the gaza strip 
it shows the palestinians are ready to coexist with israel that 
they want a state sidebyside with israel

the supreme court today postponed its 
decision on the extradition of a palestinian wanted by the united 
states for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner 
panayiotis theodoropoulos president of the fivemember panel 
said the decision to extradite mohammed rashid would be issued after 
the united states supplies key documents needed to make a ruling 
the 39yearold palestinian is charged with planting a bomb 
aboard a pan am jumbo jet flying from tokyo to hawaii a japanese 
teenager was killed and 15 other people were injured in the blast 
rashid may also be linked to the bloody july 11 attack aboard the 
city of poros cruise ship off athens that killed nine people and 
injured 98 police theorize the attack may have been a failed 
attempt to take the ship hostage and force rashids release 
on oct 10 a lower court approved the extradition of rashid but 
the decision must be approved by the areos pagos the supreme court 
before todays decision was announced hundreds of police 
officers and sharpshooters with automatic weapons guarded the court 
building near the city center 
rashids defense lawyers contested the postponement arguing that 
lower courts had requested the same documents in the past and failed 
to get them 
the documents have been requested twice in the past what 
makes you think theyll send them now defense lawyer spyros 
fitrakis asked the court 
the high court asked the united states to supply an official copy 
of a japanese visa application allegedly filled in by rashid in 
baghdad iraq in july 1982 
it also asked for official transcripts of testimony given by an 
fbi agent that was used to draw up the extradition request 
these are the documents we need it they cant send them they 
have to explain why theodoropoulos said 
according to the extradition request rashid received a visa in 
baghdad to visit japan 
it is obvious that the judges are not convinced by the american 
evidence if they had the documents they would have sent them 
already rashid told the court 
rashid was arrested at athens airport on may 29 on a tip from the 
us embassy in athens 
us officials have said they view rashids extradition as a test 
of greeces determination to combat international terrorism 
american officials have said rashid was also involved in the 1986 
bombing of a twa jetliner over southern greece that killed four 
americans the blast is not mentioned in the extradition request

accepting the torahs on monday 
police commissioner benjamin ward whose mother was an orphan 
adopted by a jewish family in brooklyn said the ceremony held a 
special significance for him 
today i repay a little bit of a major debt that i always felt i 
owed the jewish community ward said 
davids orthodox congregation rabbinical institute shari torah

researchers have discovered small 
quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from 
savannah harbor about 100 miles downstream from the savannah river 
plant 
cesium 137 a radioactive isotope was found in material taken 
from the harbor and dumped on the south carolina side of the 
savannah river which forms the border with georgia tests found 
tiny amounts of the material insufficient to create a health 
hazard the charleston news amp courier reported today 
the tests were done for the south carolina wildlife and marine 
resources department by researchers at the university of georgia 
the wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants 
because of water quality problems believed to be caused by 
industrial discharges into the river agency officials said 
cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of nuclear fission and is 
generally associated with radioactive waste it emits beta and gamma 
radiation both of which can produce a variety of ill effects 
depending on the dosage 
lou gordell acting director of the us department of energys 
environmental division at the nuclear plant said he had not been 
informed of the study results but acknowledged monday that the 
material probably originated at the savannah nuclear plant 
the complex near aiken produces the radioactive materials 
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons the governmentowned 
plant has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed 
that a series of accidents at the site over the past 30 years went 
unreported to the public 
gordell said sediment tests in savannah harbor for a 1984 study 
showed traces of cesium 137 and that recent monitoring upstream 
found similar traces both in the water and river sediment 
much of the material leaked from srp apparatus in the 1950s but 
some is the result of continued discharge into the river gordell 
said the level of contamination is far below epas maximum 
allowable level for drinking water he said 
savannah and beaufortjasper counties pump water from the 
savannah river for drinking water 
traces of tritium also are found in the river but also are below 
the maximum allowable levels gordell said cesium 137 with a 
halflife of 30 years persists in the environment longer than 
tritium with a halflife of 12 years a halflife is the time it 
takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate 
the savannah harbor is periodically dredged by the us army 
corps of engineers to maintain its depth for the port of savannah

the army opened fire on thousands of 
people protesting the massacre of sinhalese bus passengers by 
suspected tamil rebels killing five and injuring 17 police said 
today 
soldiers began shooting at 3000 sinhalese who were demonstrating 
today in matala 65 miles northeast of colombo after tear gas 
failed to disperse the crowd a senior police official said 
two people were killed and 11 wounded said the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
on monday soldiers and police killed three other people and 
injured six when they broke up demonstrations in the central towns 
of anuradhapura polonnaruawa horawapatana and kekirawa police 
said 
they said the demonstrations were to protest the governments 
failure to prevent a massacre of 27 sinhalese bus passengers by 
tamil rebels 
the rebels ambushed a bus on monday near the village of 
pinkatiya about 140 miles northeast of colombo and killed 27 
sinhalese passengers according to police and military sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
police blamed the largest tamil rebel group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam denied they were responsible 
in a statement issued by their london office and telexed to news 
agencies and newspapers the tigers said this is malicious 
propaganda carried out by the sri lankan government to tarnish the 
image of our organization 
the police and military sources said the killings were part of a 
continued tamil effort to drive away the sinhalese from the 
northeast where the tigers have been waging a fiveyear war for an 
independent homeland 
tamils who form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim they are discriminated against by the majority sinhalese who 
form 75 percent of the population and control the military and the 
government 
the governments peace overtures to the tamils have sparked a 
backlash among radical sinhalese who claim too many concessions 
have been offered to the minority community 
the government has set up local administrative councils to grant 
limited autonomy to the tamils but the tigers rejected the plan in 
1987 because they said it did not meet their expectations 
the tigers have vowed to disrupt a provincial council election 
scheduled for saturday in the northeast 
last week sinhalese radicals called a fourday strike to demand 
the resignation of president junius r jayewardene the government 
ordered soldiers to open fire at antigovernment demonstrators and 
decreed the death sentence for people convicted of starting strikes

a warning by soviet human rights activist 
andrei d sakharov that the west has more to fear from the failure 
of kremlin reforms than from their successes goes to the heart of a 
dilemma facing george bush as he prepares to lead american policy 
the threat of perestroika doesnt consist of its success but of 
its bloody failure this would be a total calamity said sakharov 
conjuring up an image of a newly militant kremlin again embracing 
the totalitarianism and expansionism of the stalin era 
with sakharovs words still ringing bush must ask himself how to 
deal with gditions to cooperative ventures if we 
dont we may one day find ourselves the odd man out economically 
and militarily wrote hough an outspoken gorbachev enthusiast 
other analysts believe gorbachev is already in domestic political 
trouble that there is little the united states can do to help or 
harm him and that he is interested in good relations with america 
as well as with the rest of the west 
the biggest problem that the united states faces now is being 
blamed by our allies if gorbachev fails said john van oudenaren 
a rand corp expert on soviet relations with the west 
while it is true that gromyko is out and dobrynin is down they 
are no less hostile to the united states than the sometimes 
acidtongued yakovlev and falin 
moreover the actual impact that we can have on the soviet 
union is limited said van oudenaren the biggest challenge is 
to avoid being blamed for a failure of gorbachev such blame can 
be avoided by being responsive to his initiatives and having a very 
active diplomacy toward him 
the chances are that gorbachev will fail in some way or enjoy 
at most a partial success the wildest expectations that people in 
the west have for him are not likely to come to pass said van 
oudenaren echoing a view that is widely held by us government and 
academic experts on the soviet union 
the reagan administration had a hyperactive policy toward 
gorbachev said van oudenaren and that policy bore fruit in the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed last december and 
in talks toward a strategic arms reduction treaty 
those negotiations helped convince the presidential electorate 
that a vote for bush was a vote for peace bush may have to keep the 
same pace if he wishes to make the same argument in 1992

a new trial must be held in the aeromexico 
jetliner disaster because the first jury was tainted by speculation 
that the pilot of a small plane may have died before slamming into 
the jetliner a judge ruled 
a pool of prospective jurors was ordered to begin the selection 
process again today in the trial to determine the blame for the 
august 1986 accident that killed 82 people 
i see some prejudice some very genuine prejudice to certain 
parties said us district judge david v kenyon who declared a 
mistrial monday in the civil suit 
the new panel cannot hear any allegations that pilot william 
kramer was dead or incapacitated before the accident ruled kenyon 
its nothing more than a guess he said at one point 
kramers private plane entered restricted airspace and hit an 
aeromexico airliner over cerritos on aug 31 1986 the pilot was 
killed along with his wife and daughter as well as 64 people on the 
jet and 15 on the ground 
in opening statements last week kramer lawyers said the pilot 
may have died of heart failure two minutes before his plane collided 
with the jet 
that suggestion tainted the jury alleged justice department 
lawyer steven j riegel who sought a mistrial riegel is defending 
the government in more than 70 lawsuits 
although kenyon denied the mistrial motion last thursday he did 
rule the kramer family lawyers couldnt raise the death or 
incapacitation issue because it was purely speculative and the 
evidence couldnt support the scenario 
riegel raised the mistrial motion again monday kenyon granted 
the motion after several hours of argument 
the judge noted that the trial had just begun and no evidence had 
been presented 
it seems to me much cleaner this way kenyon said adding he 
didnt want to take objecting parties kicking and screaming into 
the rest of the trial which is expected to last at least through 
january 
the trial will decide how to apportion liability in the crash so 
attorneys representing more than 75 plaintiffs can proceed with 
lawsuits

trim the size of the churchowned paper and drastically cut its 
staff 
katherine fanning and two of her top assistants david anable 
managing editor and david winder assistant managing editor of the 
paper announced their resignations monday 
fanning said her resignation also came after a decision to allow 
business manager john hoagland control over content which she 
said threatens the editorial independence 
the increasing diversion of church funds from the monitor to 
other media the decision to downsize the paper and drastically cut 
its staff means the serious weakening of its editorial substance 
she said after stepping down from her post 
but hoagland said the changes were positive we expect that 
this new alignment plus revenues from our new products will help 
support our daily newspaper he said of the 80yearold paper that 
has a monday through friday circulation of 170000 we continue 
with an unwavering commitment to offer both print and broadcast 
services 
fanning 61 said in a statement that the church had decided to 
cut the daily size of the newspaper to 16 pages from its current 
average of 28 pages and to eliminate advertising 
i leave this superb editorial staff with great sadness and 
profound respect she said 
the paper has lost money for years but is widely respected by its 
readers and by the newspaper industry hoagland said redesign and 
other changes to be implemented in february of next year would be 
revealed in the next few weeks 
directors of the church named richard nenneman general manager 
of print publishing for the church as editor in chief in charge of 
editorial content for the newspaper and all of its print and 
broadcast enterprises richard cattani editor of the editorial 
page was named editor 
fanning became the first woman editor of the monitor in 1983 
after leaving the daily news in anchorage alaska where she served 
as publisher and editor for 12 years after starting out at the 
paper as a 2perhour librarian she and her late husband larry 
fanning bought the news in 1967 
she served as president of the american society of newspaper 
editors from april 1987 to april 1988 
supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the church 20 
million a year while the church seeks to establish a monthly 
newsmagazine radio and television programs

space shuttle managers will set a 
launch date wednesday for a secret military mission to be flown by 
five astronauts aboard the space shuttle atlantis 
the current target is nov 30 but conrad nagel atlantis 
processing director said monday i think were looking real hard 
now at dec 1 because of a few outstanding technical problems 
he said both dates would be submitted as options to shuttle 
managers who began a twoday flight readiness review today 
nagel spoke with reporters following the completion of a 
countdown simulation for the flight the five astronauts who will 
fly the mission climbed aboard atlantis for the final two hours to 
run through launch day procedures 
the exercise was termed very successful by nagel who 
reported the only significant problem involved communications with 
mission control center in houston he said that would take one or 
two days to correct 
he also reported some trouble getting accustomed to a new 
communications system that will be used because the shuttle will be 
carrying a classified military payload 
the mission will be the second for the shuttle program since the 
challenger explosion killed its seven crew members in january 1986 
following a 32month standdown for major modifications the program 
resumed on sept 29 with the successful launch of discovery and a 
fiveman crew 
in contrast to the fanfare surrounding the discovery mission 
most details about the upcoming flight are not being made public 
atlantis will be making the third defense department shuttle flight 
dedicated solely to military experiments 
sources report the astronauts will deploy an 
intelligencegathering satellite intended to fly over 80 percent of 
the soviet union and also conduct tests aimed at trying to define 
mans role as a military observer in space 
the astronauts assigned to the mission are commander robert 
gibson pilot guy gardner and mission specialists mike mullane 
jerry ross and william shepherd

us military officials have 
ordered a bookstore chain catering to american soldiers to stop 
selling adolf hitlers antisemitic book mein kampf an official 
said today 
hitlers book has been banned at the 158 stars and stripes 
bookstores in germany said deane mcdermott circulation manager for 
the us government organization in darmstadt 
mein kampf and other nazi literature have been banned in 
germany for decades mcdermott said but stars and stripes stores 
had been selling about 70 copies a month of the book 
it is against german law even to display the book mcdermott 
said were guests in germany and i think we should show certain 
respect to our hosts 
mcdermott said the subject of nazism has become increasingly 
sensitive in recent days following last weeks 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht and former german parliament speaker philipp 
jenningers controversial speech marking the occasion 
kristallnacht meaning crystal night was a night of terror when 
nazi sympathizers burned and looted jewish businesses and synagogues 
in what is considered the beginning of the holocaust under the 
holocaust 6 million jews were systematically killed 
jenninger was forced to resign as president of the bundestag or 
parliament after an awkward and inflammatory explanation of 
hitlers appeal to the german people jenninger said many germans 
considered hitlers march through europe triumphal and he 
bluntly referred to the widespread antisemitism among germans that 
allowed hitlers repression of jews 
vandalism at jewish cemeteries by presumed neonazi groups also 
has been reported over the past few days in wiesbaden bad buchau 
and berlin 
sales of mein kampf my struggle in english at stars and 
stripes stores came to the attention of american military officials 
in berlin last week when a television program abendschau 
showed one of its reporters purchasing the book at the store in 
berlins truman plaza 
the book is filled with antisemitic outpourings and describes a 
struggle for world domination 
heinz galinski west germanys jewish community leader was 
interviewed during the tv program and expressed dismay that the us 
stores were selling hitlers book 
mcdermott said patrons are supposed to show their military 
identification cards when shopping at the stores he said the german 
tv crew had received special permission from stars and stripes to 
enter the berlin store 
there has been an awful lot of publicity on the kristallnacht 
anniversary and philipp jenningers speech and i think this all 
came about because of that mcdermott said 
about half of stars and stripes 199 bookstores in europe had 
been selling hitlers publication since about 1983 mcdermott said 
the order to remove mein kampf from the stores came on friday 
from gen raymond haddock the us commander in berlin 
on monday about 600 copies of the book were removed from the 
germanbased stores

the doctor who was not identified gave hamadi an injection of 
glucose for circulation irregularities 
she also said hamadi had been eating very little but was not on 
a hunger strike she said medicine he was taking to counter low 
blood pressure may have accentuated his weakened condition

his testimony weber replied my daughter and i felt that it was 
unsafe for us to remain in germany after the testimony

negotiating a return date 
his daughter marypat who was returning from a greek vacation 
with her parents and sister when the jetliner was seized told the

arrest warrants were issued today for former 
union carbide chairman warren anderson and two other officials of 
the us multinational in connection with the 1984 bhopal gas 
disaster 
on dec 3 1984 more than 3100 people were killed and at least 
20000 injured when toxic gas leaked out of a tank at a pesticide 
plant operated by union carbides indian subsidiary 
chief judicial magistrate rc mishra issued the arrest warrants 
today after anderson and the two carbide officials failed to honor 
summonses to appear in the bhopal magistrates court to answer 
murder charges 
the summonses for anderson and the two others were issued last 
december when the murder charges were filed in conjunction with the 
indian governments still unresolved 3 billion damage suit against 
union carbide 
mishra issued the arrest warrants in response to a request by 
government prosecutor us prasad 
they are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law 
prasad said 
the arrest warrants were issued for anderson john macdonald 
assistant secretary of union carbide corp and peter j whitley 
attorney for union carbide eastern inc a hong kongbased 
subsidiary 
earl slack assistant director of corporate communications at 
union carbides danbury conn headquarters said the indian courts 
have no jurisdiction over union carbide or anderson 
union carbide corp is not an indian corporation it has no 
presence in india and under indian law can have no presence in 
india slack said 
macdonald and whitley had not been named individually in the 
summonses issued last december but prasad sought orders for their 
arrests saying they had received the earlier summonses on behalf of 
their companies 
prasad said the indian government may initiate extradition 
proceedings if the three men ignore the arrest warrants 
in issuing the warrants mishra said the trio could be released 
on 1000 bond each after appearing in magistrates court 
as a magistrate mishra is not conducting any actual trial on 
charges filed in the case but his job empowers him to preside over 
some procedural matters such as failure to answer summonses and 
whether to commit a case to trial in a higher court 
the only union carbide representative present today was rajendra 
singh an attorney for union carbide india ltd the subsidiary that 
operated the bhopal pesticide plant 
singh did not speak about the arrest warrants but he argued the 
murder case should be sent for trial without any other accused 
persons appearing in court the indian subsidiary is a defendant in 
the 3 billion damage suit and eight of its officers were named 
when the murder charges filed last december 
prasad however argued that the murder case should not be sent 
for trial unless anderson macdonald and whitley appear in court 
mishra set jan 6 as the date for hearing detailed arguments on 
whether the murder case should be committed for trial 
the damage suit against union carbide was filed in 1986 and is 
still being heard in bhopal district court it has bogged down in a 
series of legal maneuverings a common occurrence in india where 
court cases can drag on for years and even decades 
the indian government has accused union carbide of negligence for 
the gas leak union carbide says the leak of lethal methyl 
isocyanate gas was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee

canada today opened a sweeping general inquiry 
into the use of illegal drugs in athletics after sprinter ben johson 
was stripped of his olympic gold medal for using steroids 
ontario associate chief justice charles dubin appointed by the 
federal government said the investigation would examine drug abuse 
in all canadian athletics except professional sports 
this is not an inquiry merely into the conduct of one or more 
individuals said dubin referring to the issue of whether johnson 
used anabolic steroids as drug tests showed after his olympic 
victory 
johnson maintains that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance 
his performances capped by the world record 979 second 100meter 
race at seoul south korea on sept 24 
dubin said the inquiry also would examine if too much pressure 
was being placed on canadian athletes to encourage them to cheat 
are canadian athletes being exploited by others who would 
risk reputation or health he asked 
canadian euphoria at johnsons victory over carl lewis of the 
united states quickly turned to sadness and disgrace as he was 
stripped of the medal 
i would never embarrass my family my friends my country and 
the kids who love me johnson said after his return from seoul 
some remained loyal and tshirts appeared with the slogan ben 
didnt do it they have slipped out of store display windows as 
the weeks since the olympics passed 
ironically the hearings start at a time when canadians are 
enmeshed in an unusually passionate debate on their national 
identity as part of the campaign for next mondays national election 
at stake is the free trade agreement with the united states 
scheduled to take effect jan 1 
opponents of the pact argue that canada faces a tremendous threat 
to its national identity and could be overwhelmed by the more 
populous and wealthier united states 
they point to a sense of fairness and community as being central 
to the concept of canadian nationality 
in the other incident this year of total national absorption in 
sports hockey hero wayne gretzky abandoned edmonton alberta to 
pursue a more lucrative flashier career in los angeles 
susan butt a sports psychologist at the university of british 
columbia said canadians have that tendency of placing the 
national ego on the line over an athletic event 
hopefully we can all educate ourselves to become more 
realistic and mature about sports she said in a phone interview 
adding that the hearings on drug abuse are a wonderful opportunity 
for canada to lead instead of being burdened with it 
harold minden a psychologist from torontos york university who 
traveled to seoul with the canadian olympic team said he was 
surprised by the tremendous response to johnsons victory and the 
subsequent rush to judge him in public opinion 
they really were a little overwhelmed and ecstatic when he won 
then went down in the basement of emotion when he lost the 
medal minden said 
burt konzak an expert in sports psychology at the university of 
toronto said the hearings should examine the competitive pressures 
put on johnson and the excessive push for canada to win a gold medal 
in a highprofile event 
why were we so lax in testing our own athletes it was because 
we wanted a winner he said 
dubin led a federal inquiry into airline safety several years 
ago he can call witnesses require testimony hire expert advisers 
and take the hearings anywhere in canada or out of the country 
among the most eagerly awaited witnesses are johnson his coach 
charlie francis and dr jamie astaphan the physician who treated 
the athlete 
johnson has been banned from competition for two years by the 
international amateur athletic federation which governs world track 
and field

a man who successfully sued the government for 
medical malpractice blaming it for what he said was near total 
blindness has been convicted of fraud and perjury 
friends and neighbors testified they had seen lowell hedgecorth 
mowing his lawn reading playing cards and even driving a car 
hedgecorth 54 of st ann was awarded 825000 in 1984 when he 
sued the government claiming he lost nearly all of his vision when 
he suffered a stroke in a stress test administered at the john 
cochran veterans adminstration hospital here 
the damage award was later overturned after the judge in the case 
learned of hedgecorths activities hedgecorth was indicted on four 
counts of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of 
perjury stemming from his testimony in the civil suit one charge of 
mail fraud was later dismissed 
in closing arguments monday assistant us attorney james steitz 
noted that hedgecorth had passed a vision test when renewing his 
drivers license 
steitz recounted testimony of a radiologist who testified that 
hedgecorths brain showed no evidence of the kind of stroke it would 
take to blind him 
thomas cotter hedgecorths attorney said his client had simply 
adapted to his impairment he cited the testimony of several blind 
and visually impaired witnesses all of whom said they knew of 
legally blind people who occasionally drove cars 
hedgecorth faces up to 30 years in prison and 15 million in 
fines sentencing was set for dec 23

the rate of jobrelated injuries and illnesses 
increased by 5 percent last year with 351000 more injuries and 
53000 more illnesses reported the government said today 
the bureau of labor statistics said 83 of every 1000 workers 
experienced some kind of jobrelated illness or injury last year 
compared with 79 of every 1000 workers in 1985 and 1986 
meanwhile jobrelated fatalities in surveyed private businesses 
with 11 or more employees dropped from 3610 in 1986 to 3400 last 
year bls officials called the decline statistically 
insignificant 
the increase in injury and illness rates was the first since 1984 
a total of 5843100 workers were injured on the job last year 
compared with 5492000 in 1986 the bureau said 
nearly half of the injuries were so severe that employees lost a 
full day or more of work and the number of work days lost totaled 
488 million compared with 454 million work days lost to injuries 
in 1986 
some 190000 workers suffered new illnesses for the first time 
most of them involving noiserelated hearing losses skin diseases 
and repetitive motion ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome 
prevalent in the meatpacking industry 
that is a 28 percent increase over the 136900 new cases of 
jobrelated illnesses reported in 1986 
the bureau said chronic and longterm latent cases that are often 
difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in 
the illness statistics but are clearly understated 
labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood said the increase 
in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better 
recordkeeping due to new government guidelines and intensive efforts 
to improve the statistics 
the national academy of sciences last year questioned validity of 
the governments job health and safety data because of severe 
underreporting by employers to avoid workmens compensation claims 
or government inspections 
an academy panel said the actual number of jobrelated fatalities 
could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau 
the occupational safety and health administration has placed a 
new emphasis on accurate records levying hundreds of fines some of 
them in the millions of dollars against employers for not reporting 
jobrelated injuries or illnesses 
of the 3400 reported onthejob fatalities last year twothirds 
occurred in the construction manufacturing transportation or 
public utility industries as in previous years the single biggest 
cause was traffic accidents accounting for about onethird of the 
deaths the government said

fire spread for miles today as firefighters spent a fifth day 
battling a blaze that is keeping 25 families from their homes 
this morning when people got up in saratoga springs they 
awoke to clouds of steamy smelly smoke said paul lent saratoga 
county emergency services director 
a temperature inversion kept cloud cover low overnight and smoke 
from the unlicensed landfill about three miles west of saratoga 
springs couldnt dissipate lent said 
the smell that people complained about doesnt mean that its 
getting worse it actually means that were making headway lent 
said 
overnight workers continued their wet and smother strategy 
against the blaze which started thursday night 
water and air sample results should be available later today 
which would determine if the evacuated residents can go home lent 
said while the dump owner has claimed there was nothing toxic in 
the landfill low levels of pcbs were found in the smoke state 
health department officials said the level of the chemicals did not 
exceed federal safety standards 
the city of saratoga springs kept in effect a health alert for 
residents of its west side and lent said all residents bothered by 
the smoke were being advised to stay indoors 
bulldozers and dump trucks dug trenches monday on two sides of 
the smoldering area while acrid smoke poured from about two acres of 
the 17acre landfill 
one trench 30 feet wide by 30 feet deep and 400 feet long was 
filled with dirt monday to form a firebreak similar to those used in 
forest fires lent said the other was to be filled in today he 
said 
it might take days to extinguish the fire he said 
saratoga hospital reported 35 people most of them firefighters 
had been treated for respiratory problems from the smoke no serious 
injuries have been reported 
lent said the dump contains plastic piping gypsum board wood 
and other building materials placed there by its owner john rock

the pilot of a small plane that crashed 
into a shopping mall filled with christmas shoppers and killed seven 
people covered up serious medical problems a jury was told 
about 70 people are seeking 35 million in damages in connection 
with the dec 23 1985 crash at the sunvalley mall in concord 
opening arguments began monday 
beech aircraft which built the plane in 1962 and general air 
services which inspected and maintained it are defendants in a 
civil trial to determine whether they should bear any liability for 
the crash 
beech aircraft corp lawyer william owen said the crash was 
caused solely by pilot error when james graham 67 became 
disoriented in heavy fog graham and his two passengers were among 
those killed in addition more than 70 people were injured 
owen said graham lied to doctors who examined him for annual 
flight physicals in 1983 1984 and 1985 by saying in answer to a 
questionnaire item that he hadnt seen any doctors during the 
previous year 
graham also stated in 1985 that he was not using any medication 
when he was taking bloodpressure medicine that can cause 
drowsiness owen said 
there is no way in the world owen said that graham could 
have passed his 1985 flight physical if he had disclosed his high 
blood pressure 
owen said graham had been taking an amphetamine daily was 
receiving injections of testosterone a steroid at least twice a 
month suffered from a sleeping disorder called early narcolepsy and 
sometimes fell asleep in his car or at his desk

the communist partys chief of legal affairs 
chastised estonian leaders for encouraging nationalism and 
increasing political tension in their tiny republic tass said today 
politburo member viktor m chebrikov said the central committee 
of the estonian party had committed serious miscalculations in the 
areas of interethnic relations the official news agency said 
chebrikov whose visit likely was meant as a message to estonians 
to tread cautiously made the remarks in a speech monday to estonian 
party government and economic officials 
it is necessary to seek what unites rather than divides said 
chebrikov who was head of the kgb until september when gorbachev 
appointed him to his present post 
the growth of ethnic tensions in the baltic republics of estonia 
lithuania and latvia as well as the southern republics of armenia 
and azerbaijan have become a severe test of soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs program of greater openness and economic reforms 
party and government officials in estonia have joined activists 
in demanding greater economic and political autonomy from moscow 
last week they said in a meeting with gorbachev in moscow that 
the soviet leaders intended reform of the political system would 
take away many of their republics rights rather than increase local 
control 
on monday chebrikov assured estonian leaders that the kremlin 
was pleased more people were getting involved in public issues and 
gaining a stronger ethnic identity but he said ethnic feelings were 
going too far 
chebrikov told the estonian officials the situation in the 
republic is characterized by a growing political tension tass 
said 
he described as especially alarming the division of the 
population along ethnic lines tass said 
chebrikov went to estonia on friday the same day two other 
politburo members were sent to the baltic on similar missions vadim 
medvedev the kremlin ideology chief went to the republic of latvia 
and nikolai slyunkov chief of social and economic development 
visited the republic of lithuania 
tass reported the medvedev and slyunkov visits but their 
speeches to officials were not as sharp as chebrikovs in estonia 
where the reform movement has been the most active and organized

the plos parliamentinexile proclaimed 
an independent palestinian state today and plo chief yasser arafat 
said the decision now puts the ball in the american court 
the palestine national council made the declaration early today 
approving a new political program that indirectly recognizes israel 
council delegates broke into applause and the occasion was 
immediately followed by quiet handshakes kisses and an occasional 
tear 
at a news conference later arafat described the council meeting 
as the intefadeh uprising session referring to 11 months of 
unrest by palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
but it could also be the session of peace with the us 
administration and israel he said 
in a more threatening tone he added let it also be clear i 
can always come back to our council and declare that moderation 
does not pay 
our political statement contains moderation flexibility and 
realism which the west has been urging us to show arafat said 
the ball is now in the american court 
earlier today israeli troops sealed off the west bank and gaza 
strip where arab youths took to the streets to celebrate the 
declaration and underground leaders of the palestinian uprising 
called a general strike 
in the west bank town of bethlehem under curfew for the first 
time since 1967 teenagers ignored threats of fines and jail terms 
to run through the streets setting off fireworks and singing a 
nationalist song 
arafat did not describe the new states borders except to say 
that a 1947 un plan that provided for separate jewish and arab 
states in palestine still provides the basis for international 
legitimacy the palestinian territory referred to in the 
declaration presumably meant the west bank and gaza captured by 
israel in 1967 middle east war 
passage of the proclamation could mark a turning point in the 
fourdecade struggle through repeated arabisraeli wars and 
recurrent guerrilla attacks israel gained independence in 1948 
when british rule ended 
the palestine liberation organization declaration will not 
necessarily have any immediate effect because the plo is unable to 
challenge israel for actual control either in the occupied 
territories or in israel proper 
plo leaders consider it rather as a historic step toward creation 
of an independent state in the west bank and gaza 
israel rejected any change in its attitude toward the plo even 
before the new policy was officially approved 
its not a problem of definition and formulations of various 
positions said prime minister yitzhak shamir well not 
negotiate with them because theyre opposed to peace with israel 
the declaration says the palestine national council in the 
name of god and in the name of the palestinian arab people hereby 
proclaims the establishment of the state of palestine on our 
palestinian territory with its capital jerusalem 
a less symbolic but equally important move was the new 
palestinian political program which clearly aims to overcome the 
major objections put forth by the united states as reasons for not 
dealing with the plo 
the council the plos highest policymaking body issued a 
political declaration accepting un security council resolution 242 
which implicity recognizes israels right to exist 
the declaration also rejects terrorism restricting plo guerrilla 
action to military targets in the occupied territories which 15 
million palestinians share uneasily with 70000 jewish settlers 
in washington the initial response was cautious president 
reagan said the plo action could represent progress but added there 
were other problems that remain to be solved 
the united states has demanded the plo recognize israel and 
renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings 
resolution 242 calls for israeli withdrawal from territories it 
seized from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war the plo 
had in the past rejected it because of the recognition of the jewish 
state and because it referred to the palestinian question as a 
refugee problem 
the palestine national councils political declaration calls for 
the convening of an international middle east peace conference under 
un auspicies and with participation of the permanent member states 
of the un security council and all parties to the conflict 
including the plo 
it also calls for a complete israeli withdrawal from the west 
bank gaza and israeliannexed arab east jerusalem and for putting 
the occupied lands under un supervision for a transitional period 
the third item on the agenda of the council was approval of a 
provisional government to be formed at a later stage that 
government would be mandated to negotiate a peace settlement 
for the moment however the government of the newly declared 
palestine is the plo 
the palestine national council is a 450member bicameral 
parliamentinexile with members selected from plo guerrilla 
factions and professional unions it was formed in 1964 by the arab 
league

groups to supporters of the former military government 
although the voting is based largely on local matters political 
analysts say brazilians will also be voicing their opinion on 
sarneys conservativetocentrist brazilian democratic movement

state governors state assemblies and congress will be lucky to 
win the mayoral seats in three of brazils largest cities

a 40 percent dip in workers buying power it has also faced charges 
of corruption and nepotism

canceled a meeting scheduled wednesday of deputy secretary joseph 
salgado and three western governors on lowlevel nuclear waste 
issues because one governor could not be there 
doug elmets spokesman for energy secretary john s herrington 
said the department intends to send lower level officials to meet 
with colorado gov roy romer who insisted on such a meeting 
the governors of colorado idaho and new mexico had been 
scheduled to meet wednesday with salgado in salt lake city 
but gov garrey carruthers of new mexico has to be in washington 
wednesday to meet with members of presidentelect george bushs 
transition team 
elmets said the department will try to reschedule the meeting 
hopefully soon 
herrington sought the meeting after idaho gov cecil andrus 
refused to permit a boxcar of lowlevel waste such as contaminated 
clothes and tools to unload at the departments idaho national 
engineering laboratory on oct 19 
the waste originated from the departments weapons plant at rocky 
flats colo romer allowed the car to come back to rocky flats 
where several carloads have accumulated 
the waste has been stored at the idaho installation for years 
pending opening of an underground storage repository in new mexico

legislation transferring the land from the interior department to 
the energy department 
romer and andrus complained about cancellation of the scheduled 
meeting with salgado with andrus calling it the latest instance 
in a long line of indecision and delay by the energy department 
as i suspected almost a month ago doe in washington doesnt 
have the slightest idea of what they are going to do to solve this 
problem andrus said

time they reached their rally site in south bombay four hours later 
the number had dwindled to about 400 
one marcher rukmanibai bansode 58 complained that some 
prostitutes were starving she said schools refused to admit their 
children and money lenders charged interest rates as high as 50 
percent

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will meet 
with president reagan and presidentelect george bush next month for 
what reagan called a brief gettogether 
thats not going to be anything in the nature of a summit 
meeting the president said 
asked if gorbachev might bring new proposals to the meeting the 
president said 
i have no way of speculating well just have to see what comes 
up 
reagan commented as he posed for photographers before a meeting 
with west german chancellor helmut kohl in the oval office 
we hope we can have a brief gettogether the president said 
of the upcoming meeting which will be his fifth with gorbachev 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said that neither a date nor a site 
has been set although he acknowledged that it would likely take 
place in new york while gorbachev is there to address the un 
general assembly 
other officials requesting anonymity said gorbachev would 
probably meet with reagan and bush on dec 7 
reagan asked today if the december meeting could end up like the 
summit in iceland to which gorbachev brought surprise proposals on 
arms control but from which no agreements flowed the president 
responded that depends on whether you are going by the public 
version of reykjavik or what actually happened there 
he did not elaborate and reporters went on to other questions 
when a reporter noted that bush has said he does not need to get 
acquainted with gorbachev because he already is the president 
replied that the vice president has been involved in the meetings 
that weve had in all these eight years weve been here and he has 
met and is familiar with all the national leaders that weve met 
 
asked then why bush was going to be at the meeting he said 
i think now in his present situation it would be proper for him 
to be present 
fitzwater said reagan and bush would meet probably together 
with gorbachev for what fitzwater said was intended to be a 
cordial meeting between superpower leaders reflecting the friendship 
they have created and the historic change in the relationship 
between the united states and the soviet union he said 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said gorbachev would meet with the us leaders as part of a 
continuation of the ussoviet political dialogue that we believe 
should continue without artificial pause 
fitzwater said the main purpose of the meeting from the us 
standpoint would be to ensure that the momentum and continuity of 
the arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the 
relationship between the general secretary and the new president of 
the united states 
i would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling 
things differences fitzwater said 
fitzwater acknowledged that the kremlin had proposed that 
gorbachev meet with reagan and bush in just the last few days and 
that the administration had quickly approved the request 
gorbachev also will visit britain and cuba the soviet news 
agency tass aid in a dispatch from moscow 
mikhail gorbachev intends to appear in new york at the session 
of the general assembly of the un to set forth the views of the 
soviet union on the most important problems of world development 
tass said 
earlier british prime minister margaret thatcher announced that 
gorbachev and his wife raisa would visit london dec 1214 
buckingham palace said today that queen elizabeth ii also intended 
to meet with gorbachev 
a gettogether would also give the two sides another chance to 
narrow the gap on a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
arsenals and to ease tensions caused by afghan rebel attacks on 
soviet troops in afghanistan and a slowdown in the red armys 
withdrawal from the country 
the treaty is bogged down with several technical problems that 
may not be easily solved but on afghanistan the soviets already 
have pledged to have all their forces out by feb 15 
two weeks ago citing attacks by the usarmed rebels the 
soviets announced suspension of the withdrawal still gorbachev has 
not ruled out adhering to the deadline set in last springs geneva 
accords 
a year ago the soviet leader made his first trip to the united 
states at a washington summit with reagan he signed an 
unprecedented treaty to abolish us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear weapons 
it was the first arms control treaty to actually reduce nuclear 
arsenals but a pact on strategic weapons which are globegirdling 
and far more deadly has continued to elude us and soviet 
negotiators 
reagan and gorbachev have held four annual meetings beginning in 
1985 improving ussoviet relations on a number of fronts bush 
meanwhile said after winning the presidency last week that he would 
like to hold a summit meeting with the soviet leader 
bush has set relatively easy conditions for a summit meeting with 
the soviet leader sometime after moving into the white house in 
january he asked only that it produce progress on arms control 
human rights or regional disputes 
but first bush said he would have james a baker iii whom he 
has named as his choice for secretary of state meet with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and with foreign ministers 
of the north atlantic treaty organization 
bush ruled out a mere getacquainted session i am acquainted 
with him the presidentelect said of gorbachev what i want to 
see is progress ive never supported meetings just for the sake of 
having meetings 
reagan first met with gorbachev in geneva switzerland in 
november 1985 they held their second summit in 1986 in reykjavik 
iceland then met in washington last december and in moscow may 
29june 2 
the two superpowers are close to an agreement to reduce their 
armories of longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 
percent but are wrestling with problems over how to verify some of 
the cutbacks

spraypainted slogans reading aids mormons 
and mormons go home sometimes greet students walking to class at 
the mormon study center on the biblical mount of olives 
the graffiti signals a renewal of antimormon sentiment in 
jerusalem especially among orthodox jews who fear the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints is conducting missionary work at 
its 15 million facility 
mormon officials deny the charge but orthodox leaders vow to use 
the political muscle their parties gained in this months national 
elections to remove the mormons from the holy land 
we want them to leave and now we have room to do something 
about it said rabbi menachem porush whose agudat israel party 
won five seats in the knesset or parliament the mormons are very 
dangerous they have made it unsafe for jews 
porush contends the mormons are trying to systematically 
convert young jews in violation of a lease agreement that forbids 
missionary activities at their jerusalem center for near eastern 
studies 
he said orthodox leaders want the israeli government to buy the 
mormon center and convert it into a religious high school for jews 
we would be more than happy to buy it from them porush said 
we will pay any price 
martin hickman the centers director said the sevenstory 
marble and limestone building is not for sale 
he added that he expects the government to honor the mormons 
49year lease on the property despite the growing influence of 
orthodox parties 
we realize there are certain groups that wish we werent 
here hickman said in an interview but we respect the integrity 
of the government of israel which has made a commitment that we 
intend to keep 
construction of the center began in 1984 after lengthy 
negotiations between the israeli government and the mormonoperated 
brigham young university in utah which runs the center approval 
was given only after the mormons pledged not to proselytize 
the mormon church with headquarters in salt lake city utah has 
some 6500 congregations worldwide with more than 3 million members 
since its completion in january the center has been supervised 
by a fivemember committee of three israeli government officials and 
two mormon representatives 
haim klugman the justice ministry directorgeneral who serves as 
committee chairman said there is no evidence the mormons have 
violated their agreement 
we are here to deal with every complaint but we have had 
none klugman said 
hickman said the centers nine faculty members and 105 students 
are well aware of the conditions of the lease and are careful not to 
do or say anything that could be misinterpreted as missionary work 
some people think were here to convert their jewish state to a 
mormon state said david daines 23 of provo utah a junior at 
brigham young daines is a student at the jerusalem center 
i came here to study and to learn not to proselytize daines 
insisted he said he ignored the graffiti 
students take courses for a fourmonth program that includes 
middle east history archeology and bible studies 
lisa hillyard 20 a native of logan utah and a junior from 
utah state university said israels orthodox jews need not be 
concerned despite the tradition of missionary work among young 
mormons 
i understand that they were a little nervous about letting us 
in she said but we gave our word 
earlier this year the americanborn rightwing rabbi meir kahane 
and about 50 of his supporters marched near the center to demand its 
closure kahane vowed to shut it down if he came to power 
porush contends the mormons use the study center as a cover for 
missionary activities from the mount of olives where christians 
believe christ ascended to heaven 
he said the national elections in which religious parties 
captured 18 of the 120 seats in parliament have put orthodox jews 
in a position to scrutinize mormon activities 
we are not trying to hurt any religion we just want our 
religion to be left alone porush said we will not let them do 
their dangerous missionary work here

china opened an international exhibit of its 
arsenal tuesday complete with scale models and videos of the weapons 
in action 
the china precision machinery import and export corp one of the 
countrys largest arms manufacturers said it was putting six new 
missiles on the market during the fourday asian defense technology 
exposition or asiandex 88 
they included several mediumrange coastal defense missiles 
intended to replace the silkworm which vice president shen rengui 
said used outdated technology and was being phased out 
the silkworm became chinas most famous missile when iran used 
one in october 1987 to attack a kuwaiti oil tanker flying the 
american flag china denied selling silkworms to iran and said it 
did not know where iran bought them 
but western experts said the new missiles and other weapons shown 
at asiandex already were being promoted to potential buyers and 
that the show contained no surprises 
the exhibit demonstrated chinas determination to increase its 
arms sales despite criticism from the united states and other 
western countries that chinese sales to primarily third world 
countries are destabilizing 
china does not release figures on its arms sales but the us 
government estimates china sold sold about 2 billion in weapons 
abroad in 1987 it is the fourthlargest weapons seller to the third 
world after the soviet union united states and france 
china began taking part in international arms shows in 1984 and 
held the first show of its own asiandex 86 two years ago 
nearly 100 foreign companies also had booths at the exhibition 
including the us companies boeing and lockheed britains marconi 
group hungarys technika foreign trading co and chiles cardoen 
arms manufacturers from france west germany italy the netherlands 
and other countries also were represented 
one western manufacturer said his company attended not in hopes 
of making an immediate sale to china but simply to keep up contacts 
with the chinese military weve talked with them and they sent a 
team to tour our plant at one point but nothing he said 
a western source noted china has been uninterested in importing 
large quantities of weapons 
what they want is joint ventures so they can learn the 
technology and reverseengineer and make it themselves he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
many of chinas current weapons were derived in this way from 
1950s soviet models in recent years china has entered into 
agreements with western companies to use their advanced technology 
to upgrade its obsolete arsenal 
aeritalia of italy supplied avionics technology for chinas new 
a5m fighter plane which recently had a successful test flight 
us and british companies also have cooperated in updating chinese 
tanks and planes 
chinas strategy has been to use arms exports to subsidize 
improvements in its domestic arsenal that it could not otherwise 
afford its biggest market has been the middle east where it has 
sold to both iran and iraq during their 8yearold border war

margaret thatcher with at least four more years 
ahead of her as prime minister flew to washington today to bid 
goodbye to president reagan and welcome presidentelect george bush 
to the ranks of western leaders 
the prime minister left heathrow airport under tight security at 
4 pm 11 am est bound for andrews air force base near 
washington 
thatcher who has marched in ideological step with reagan since 
he took office eight years ago thanked him in a speech monday for 
what she said has been his main contribution to the west 
let us above all thank president reagan for ending the wests 
retreat from world responsibility for restoring the pride and 
leadership of the us and for giving the west back its confidence 
confidence not only in the success of free enterprise but also in 
the values which guide our societies speaking at the annual lord 
mayors banquet in the city londons financial area she added 
he has left america stronger prouder greater than ever before 
and we thank him for it 
in the speech mrs thatcher also announced that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev would visit britain dec 1214 around dec 7 
gorbachev is to visit the united nations as well as meet with reagan 
for a fifth time and possibly see bush us officials say 
mrs thatcher also welcomed bush as a worthy successor to 
reagan we know him as a friend we admire him as a man of 
unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all 
that is best in america she said 
reagan said monday that mrs thatcher was the best statesman he 
had met asked by a group of schoolchildren at the white house if he 
thought the united states would ever have a woman president he 
said i am certainly not against a female president 
as a matter of fact the statesman in the world that i have 
met that i respect the most is the prime minister of england 
margaret thatcher and she has done a remarkable job for england 
reagan came to office 1 years after mrs thatcher and together 
they have reinvigorated the longstanding special relationship 
between the two countries 
but while reagan must step down mrs thatcher 63 who is now 
the wests longest serving leader faces no such constraints 
her present tenure lasts another four years and she has said she 
will seek a fourth term in the 1990s if the conservative party 
leader wins that means she will be working with bush right up to 
1992 
reagan and mrs thatcher have shared a deep anticommunist 
ideology distaste for welfarism faith in free markets and belief 
in negotiating from strength 
they have helped each other at critical movements sometimes at 
great political risk reagan by approving arms supplies and 
intelligence to britain in the 1982 falklands war against argentina 
and mrs thatcher by letting reagan use us bombers based in 
britain to bomb libya in 1986 
mrs thatcher played a role in the reagangorbachev thaw she was 
the first major western leader to visit gorbachev after he came to 
power in 1985 and on his way to washington to sign the 
armsreduction treaty in 1987 gorbachev stopped in britain for 
talks with the prime minister 
mrs thatcher arrives in washington tonight and will have talks 
with reagan on wednesday followed by a state dinner on thursday 
she will have talks with bush returning home early friday

the slovak culture minister on 
tuesday called on leaders to correct mistakes that have pushed 
people away from the communist party and into the embrace of 
independent groups and churches 
miroslav valeks unusually critical analysis of czechoslovakias 
political situation was published by the communist party daily 
newspaper rude pravo 
he said the countrys leaders must right mistakes made since the 
1968 prague spring reforms were crushed 
we must analyze the past period properly and expose errors and 
mistakes not only in the economy but also in politics he wrote 
on the one hand there were antisocialist and unrealistic 
tendencies on the other hand there were rational political and 
economic pressures the need for reform and those should have been 
seen and differentiated 
moscow installed the conservative czechoslovak leadership after 
the aug 2122 1968 invasion that crushed the reforms of alexander 
dubcek while embracing some economic reforms it has been reluctant 
to follow moscows example in initiating wideranging political 
reforms 
the slovak official said the purge of 500000 people from the 
communist party was perceived especially by the young as an 
allembracing condemnation of opposition as a political trauma 
this trauma hasnt passed yet and is not going to pass all 
by itself 
an analysis of the past was imperative he said to regain 
peoples confidence 
it is necessary to analyze continuously the cause of the birth 
and development of charter 77 human rights group young peoples 
apathy toward the official communist youth union and increasing 
interest in religion the minister said 
all these are facts to which realistic policy can neither 
surrender nor close its eyes naively valek wrote 
the leaderships apparent unwillingness to reevaluate the spirit 
of 1968 was highlighted by the police quelling of an aug 21 
demonstration to mark the 20th anniversary of the invasion and 
official articles condemning dubcek and his reforms 
last week up to 25 activists were taken into preventive custody 
in prague to stop a symposium to examine czechoslovakias role in 
history 
on tuesday the united states strongly denounced czechoslovak 
authorities for thwarting the symposium and served notice it will 
irrevocably block consensus on any helsinki followup meeting in 
prague 
in a statement to the vienna meeting of the 35nation helsinki 
review conference on human rights us ambassador warren zimmermann 
said the contempt they prague authorities displayed for the 
rights of czechoslovak citizens amounts to contempt for the vienna 
meeting and the process in which czechoslovakia pledged to 
respect those rights 
he said czechoslovkias poor human rights record disqualified it 
from hosting a followup meeting a prospective host should have a 
credible record on the subject to be discussed he said 
the dutch foreign ministry called in czechoslovak ambassador 
frantisek chlad to condemn the crackdown as a violation of the 
fundamental principles of human rights a ministry spokesman said 
tuesday 
the government also stated that it deplores the attitude of the 
police against foreign guests said the spokesman referring to 
reports that one of a dozen western participants in the symposium 
former dutch foreign minister max van der stoel was manhandled by 
czechoslovak police friday

firing chemical shells that caused 
victims to vomit blood soviet and afghan government soldiers 
recaptured a key border post and road link with pakistan from 
anticommunist guerrillas insurgents said 
mohammad shuaib of the jamiateislami rebel group said thousands 
of government and soviet troops were involved and that hundreds of 
guerrillas died in the battle before it ended sunday 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
denied the charge of chemical weapons use saying neither soviet nor 
afghan government forces have such weapons in afghanistan 
in a state radio broadcast the sovietbacked government in kabul 
said security forces had retaken the torkham post on the 
afghanistanpakistan border 
the broadcast monitored in islamabad said 140 guerrillas were 
killed and 150 injured at torkham monday large quantities of 
weapons and ammunition were also captured it said it gave no other 
details 
in another development afghanistan today requested an emergency 
meeting of the un security council to stop pakistans arming of 
antigovernment rebels and warned it may be forced to use military 
force in selfdefense the request was made in a letter from abdul 
wakil afghanistans foreign minister 
western diplomats on monday confirmed the presence of soviet 
soldiers in the battle for the torkham post and the highway linking 
jalalabad in eastern afghanistan to pakistan 
diplomats said soviet soldiers were flown in to join the 
offensive presumably from kabul the afghan capital about 70 miles 
to the west they and most guerrilla informants spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
insurgents who reached peshawar about 30 miles inside pakistan 
claimed soviet and afghan forces used chemical weapons they said 
explosive shells fired by artillery contained a chemical that caused 
victims to blister and vomit blood 
moslem rebels began fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
and the soviet union sent military forces into afghanistan in 
december 1979 in april the soviets accepted a unmediated 
agreement to withdraw their about 100000 troops 
about half the force has gone home but the soviets said last 
week they were suspending the withdrawal and sending new weapons 
into afghanistan because of continuing guerrilla attacks they 
added however that they still intend to complete the pullout as 
scheduled on feb 15 
the usbacked guerrillas captured torkham nov 2 and had 
claimed they were closing in on jalalabad 
both diplomats and rebels said soviet commandos supported by 
helicopter gunships moved out of jalalabad on foot moving along the 
road to torkham according to insurgent sources 
the official afghan radio said high military officials visited 
the post monday 
insurgents and diplomats said the guerrillas retreated into 
pakistan where about 3 million afghan refugees live 
earlier this month the government displayed ss1 scud missiles 
in kabul advanced mig27 groundattack jets and sophisticated 
helicopter gunships have been reported in action against the 
guerrillas 
arrival of the new weapons prompted a guerrilla offensive along 
the strategic salang highway that links kabul with the soviet border 
to the north 
ahmad shah masoud jamiateislamis commander in the panjshir 
valley claims to have closed the highway but shuaib of the jamiat 
said reports from units along the road were sporadic and there was 
no recent confirmation that it remained closed 
the salang highway is the only overland route to the soviet union

a court tuesday banned the last 
temptation of christ from movie theaters in the capital where 
nikos kazantzakis who wrote the book on which the film is based 
lived for more than 20 years 
the ban came after eight orthodox christian organizations claimed 
the movie insulted religious feeling and defamed the head of the 
church said a court spokesman 
the courts injuction orders theaters and the films distributor 
united international pictures to suspend screenings or face a fine 
of nearly 700 for each violation the spokesman said 
last week a court in the northern city of salonica banned the 
film before its first showing 
both injuctions will be appealed in higher court the salonica 
appeal hearing is set for nov 24 no date was set for the athens 
hearing 
we were surprised by the decision of course we will fight 
these kinds of decisions said nick kalogerakis a spokesman for 
the distributor 
the martin scorsese film which opened in athens on oct 23 is 
being shown at four movie theaters in the capital area 
at its first screening hundreds of greek orthodox priests and 
faithful slashed movie screens and clashed with riot police 
the last temptation of christ which has been called 
horrifyingly vulgar by the orthodox church of greece also has 
been denounced by other church groups in europe and the united 
states 
kazantzakis who died in 1957 was threatened with 
excommunication by the orthodox church when the book was published 
in 1954 
kazantzakis studied law at athens university from 1902 to 1906 
he lived in the greek capital for more than 20 years and served in 
athens as a minister without portfolio shortly after world war ii 
his first work was published in athens in 1906

a grand jury has decided against issuing 
indictments in the beating of farm worker leader dolores huerta 
whose spleen was removed after she was injured during a 
demonstration in september 
although the panel found the injuries were not the result of 
criminal wrongdoing by police or protesters it recommended 
extensive changes in police crowdcontrol methods grand jury 
foreman luther jones said monday 
we feel that by better monitoring of the crowd the whole 
situation could have been avoided jones said of the sept 14 
incident that took place outside the st francis hotel where george 
bush was campaigning 
huerta 58 suffered two broken ribs in addition to the ruptured 
spleen and was in the hospital for almost two weeks 
the jury jones said found that police policies were 
inadequate to deal with what happend 
huerta was passing out leaflets about a grape boycott when 
officers ordered a crowd of nearly 1000 people to disperse union 
workers claimed the 120pound woman was struck and jabbed with a 
police baton 
jones said the jurys findings were based on testimony from 
witnesses including huerta and a review of police and television 
videotapes 
it is disappointing that there is apparently going to be no 
serious action on the part of the city to discipline the officer 
responsible for nearly killing dolores huerta said her attorney 
dianna lyons

a planetarium whose original projector made 
viewers dizzy and ill is opening nine years late with a 68footwide 
dome and a projection system intended to simulate space travel 
the arnim d hummel planetarium officially opens wednesday at 
eastern kentucky university 
i always thought it would actually happen but i didnt think 
it would take as long as it did said jack fletcher who was hired 
11 years ago as planetarium director 
equipment installed in 1979 projected images so blurred that 
people who watched test programs became dizzy and nauseated 
the university sued the manufacturer of the projection equipment 
spitz inc of chadds ford pa two years ago spitz agreed out of 
court to replace the original equipment with a new system called 
space voyager 
in most planetariums the same projector produces images of the 
stars and planets that makes the planetariums earthbound only 
able to project the sky as it appears from the earth 
with the space voyager system the projectors are separated 
making possible the illusion of space travel 
the starball projector is 4 feet in diameter and projects 10164 
stars each star has a separate lens there are five planet 
projectors and a sun projector also part of the system are a 
multiimage slide projector and a sixchannel stereo sound system 
the system is the third of its kind in the world the others are 
in paris and singapore 
the planetarium is named for the first chairman of easterns 
physics department during world war ii hummel was instrumental in 
developing a radaractivated fuse 
the universitys planetarium is the 10thlargest of the 985 
planetariums in the united states the largest is the reuben h 
fleet space theater in san diego which has a 75foot dome

the reagan administration today rejected a plo 
proclamation of an independent palestinian state asserting that the 
arabisraeli conflict must be settled by negotiations and not by 
unilateral acts 
spokesman charles redman said the status of the west bank and 
gaza strip cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side 
but only through a process of negotiations 
a declaration of independent palestinian statehood is such a 
unilateral act redman said a similar statement was issued by 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said that despite us opposition to the proclamation 
of an independent palestinian state the administration sees 
positive elements to the palestine national council meeting in 
algiers most notably its support for un security council 
resolutions 224 and 338 these lay the groundwork for a 
comprehensive settlement to the arabisraeli conflict 
redman said the administration has not yet seen the final text of 
the resolution approved by the pnc but promised it would receive 
serious study 
our objective is a comprehensive peace redman said direct 
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process 
palestinian partiicpation is required at every stage of 
negotiations all participants in the negotiations must renounce 
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted 
international basis of un security council resolutions 224 and 
338 
fitzwater said it still is not clear just how specific the 
palestine liberation organization has been about extending an olive 
branch to israel by implicitly recognizing the jewish states right 
to exist 
at the algiers meeting the plos quasilegislature voted to 
accept security council resolution 242 which established the 
principle that all states in the region including israel are 
entitled to exist in peace 
president reagan said monday that plo acceptance of the 
resolution which long has been the cornerstone of international 
efforts to secure a lasting peace in the middle east would be 
some progress 
but reagan said there are other problems that remain to be 
solved before there is a breakthrough in the plos stance toward 
israel he was not more specific 
reagan spoke before the palestine national council proclaimed a 
new independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip with jerusalem as its capital 
apart from accepting the 1967 un resolution us policy 
requires the plo to renounce terrorism and to nullify the provision 
in its covenant calling for the destruction of the jewish state 
otherwise us officials are not supposed to negotiate with the 
plo or support its participation in any mideast peace talks 
the state department on monday released a fact sheet 
detailing attacks on israelis attributed to the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine 
the group which has its headquarters in syria is believed to 
have opposed approval of the un resolution in algiers 
apparently there has been an indication theyre willing to 
abide by 242 reagan said of the palestine national councils 
approach to the un resolution adopted after the 1967 mideast war 
that implicitly recognized israels right to live within secure 
borders 
i hope that is true because that would be some progress he 
said during a picturetaking session in the oval office with andrei 
a sakharov the soviet human rights activist 
the resolution which was adopted by the security council again 
in 1973 at the end of the yom kippur war also calls on israel to 
relinquish territory lost by the arabs in 1967 
asked monday whether an international peace conference on the 
middle east could represent a solution to the arabisraeli dispute 
reagan replied im still not sure that that is the answer 
earlier this year the united states cautiously supported efforts 
to arrange such a peace conference however officials stressed that 
any settlement depended on direct negotiations between israel and 
its arab neighbors

the expensive practice of using balloon 
catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart 
attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary 
and should be abandoned according to a major study released tuesday 
the study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive 
clotdissolving drugs they usually dont need the extra step of the 
common balloon procedure known as angioplasty 
some experts said the results are good news because they mean 
that most heart attack patients can be treated in community 
hospitals where angioplasty is not available 
the study also has an important financial message its authors 
estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart 
attacks it could raise the nations annual medical bills by 704 
million 
this trial has settled one of the most important questions in 
modernday cardiology commented dr j ward kennedy of the 
university of washington seattle 
the study is phase 2 of the thrombolysis in miocardial infarction 
trial or timiii directed by dr eugene braunwald of brigham and 
womens hospital in boston 
the first phase of the study showed that giving people a 
clotdissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator or tpa 
immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances 
of survival 
the latest study presented at the annual meeting of the american 
heart association was intended to see whether people did better 
still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after 
giving tpa 
at 50 hospitals across the united states doctors randomly 
assigned 1636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their 
heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might 
benefit sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure 
which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart 
arteries to squeeze them open 
a comparison group of 1626 also got tpa but they were not 
considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or 
abnormal exercise tests during their recovery 
after 42 days 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had 
died or suffered further heart attacks as did 10 percent of those 
in the comparison group 
a year after the treatment there was no difference in survival 
about 93 percent of both groups were still alive 
there does not appear to be any additional benefit from 
angioplasty braunwald said 
dr thomas j ryan of boston university medical center commented 
we have the answer in this trial to a very important question of 
health care delivery 
while small hospitals can give clotdissolving drugs to heart 
attack patients most of them do not have the sophisticated labs 
where angioplasty is performed 
if the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves 
survival it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would 
need to be established and more doctors trained to give the 
procedure 
the watch word is watchful waiting to see if patients need 
angioplasty this ultimately makes it possible for patients to be 
treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care 
centers if angioplasty is needed said dr howard morgan 
immediate past president of the heart association 
heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the 
heart muscle the purpose of tpa and similar drugs is to dissolve 
these clots before the muscle dies to be effective the drugs must 
be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack 
symptoms 
experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims 
are considered to be candidates for the drugs many people delay 
going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs in others the 
treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery 
or a history of strokes 
balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with 
clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks the 
latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of 
angioplasty

the united states wants to reform world 
agricultural trade beginning with a freeze on all farm price 
supports subsidies and trade barriers in the next two years a 
white house report said tuesday 
the proposal dated nov 7 was made as part of the current 
uruguay round of trade talks under the 96nation general agreement 
on tariffs and trade those talks began in uruguay in 1986 and are 
scheduled to conclude in 1990 
earlier the united states proposed the elimination of farm 
subsidies and other gatt reforms by the year 2000 but has been 
criticized heatedly by the european economic community and japan 
under the latest proposal which was released by the office of 
us trade representative clayton yeutter the united states would 
agree to the freeze in 1989 and 1990 in return for a commitment from 
other countries to eliminate all measures that directly or 
indirectly affect trade and to write new rules that are based on 
free trade principles 
the new us plan is scheduled to be taken up during a midterm 
negotiating session beginning dec 5 in montreal 
according to the proposal the united states also is seeking a 
commitment to undertake specific reforms that would bring all 
agricultural trade into compliance with new gatt rules within a 
period of time agreed upon by the negotiators 
no deadline such as the year 2000 in the previous us plan was 
mentioned in the new version 
yeutter said in october that a shortterm or interim agreement 
for 1989 and 1990 would be desirable for all of the gatt countries 
and get the reform process in motion but yeutter added that the 
united states is not about to embark on this proposition unless we 
also receive a satisfactory commitment to longterm reform 
in seeking the full liberlization of agricultural trade the us 
proposal called upon trade ministers meeting in montreal next month 
to undertake fundamental policy reforms within an agreed upon 
period of time that would bring all countries into compliance 
with freetrade principles 
those principles the proposal said include the elimination of 
all market access barriers and thereby provide treatment for 
imports no less favorable than the treatment accorded domestic 
commodities and products 
further it said the objective would be to eliminate all 
direct and indirect subsidies that directly or indirectly affect 
trade 
however the us proposal would allow some exemptions of 
policies that do not affect trade including 
direct income of other payments to farmers that are unrelated to 
production and marketing including those that provide a safety net 
against natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances 
bona fide foreign and domestic food aid programs 
according to the us plan once the gatt trade ministers agree 
to the proposed reforms the freeze on agricultural support 
subsidies and protection could be worked out for 1989 and 1990 
the freeze would entail surveillance to ensure compliance by each 
country also gatt members would pledge not to introduce or 
undertake any new measures nor any other measures that would 
circumvent the objectives of the freeze

south floridas latin community is reporting a sharp 
increase in antihispanic incidents since the overwhelming passage 
last week of the official english amendment 
amendment 11 which makes english the official language of 
florida but leaves implementation to the legislature received an 84 
percent yes vote in the nov 8 statewide election 
since the election a supermarket employee was suspended for 
speaking spanish to another employee the mayor of coral gables was 
quoted as making derogatory remarks about his hispanic opponent and 
children in a west palm beach high school complained they were 
forbidden to speak spanish in school 
what has happened is that people have taken the law into their 
own hands and are enforcing it as they see fit osvaldo soto 
president of the spanish american league against discrimination 
said monday i knew amendment 11 would bring chaos to miami 
soto said his organization has received calls from dozens of 
people saying some stores refused to help spanishspeaking customers 
supporters of the initiative say it does only what it is supposed 
to do they believe the legislature will implement the law despite 
complaints from hispanics and the opposition of most state 
politicians including gov bob martinez 
miamis cuban community has interpreted the official english vote 
as a direct slap in the face one spanish radio station mockingly 
insisted everyone on a popular talk show speak english the day after 
the election hanging up on spanishspeakers who called in to 
complain about the new law 
jose uzal who led the antiamendment 11 drive in palm beach 
county said many supporters there were open about their reasons for 
favoring the measure 
in a monday talk show on an englishlanguage station uzal said 
callers were telling me this was certainly an antihispanic 
amendment and thats why they voted for it 
two days after the election in the most highly publicized 
incident blamed on the ballot measure a supermarket manager in 
coral gables suspended a cashier for speaking spanish to another 
employee store administrators later apologized for the incident 
the manager is being transferred 
over the weekend coral gables mayor george corrigan was quoted 
as saying he was more qualified than his opponent city commissioner 
raul valdes fauli because his rival is a latin who likes to sleep 
late and misses commission meetings 
on monday parents met in west palm beach met with officials at 
forest hills high school when their children said an assistant 
principal banned them from speaking spanish in the hallways 
uzal said the assistant principal may gamble told him she 
prohibited the language because students had been using profanity 
school principal joe picklesmier however told uzal and the 
parents that the school has no such policy 
mark laporta coordinator of the florida english campaign called 
such incidents meaningless and blamed them on the media 
thats a mistake and an overreaction said laporta there 
is great hypersensitivity now and i think that will go down 
laporta is acutely aware of the hypersensitivity during a 
conciliatory postelection news conference aimed at calming fears 
about the amendment his own supporters interrupted him grabbed his 
microphone and called him a traitor when he said dade countys 
antibilingual ordinance could be scrapped under the new law

attorneys for singer wayne newton and nbctv 
returned to federal court to argue over the scope of a new trial in 
newtons libel suit against the network 
newtons attorney morton galane urged us district judge myron 
d crocker on monday to limit the new trial to damages only while 
nbcs lawyers argued for a complete rerun of the original trial won 
by newton 
floyd abrams nbcs lead lawyer said the jury that gave newton a 
record 192 libel verdict in 1986 failed to pinpoint a reason for 
its action and that a new jury should hear the case 
galane however contended the issue of liability was decided 
fairly in the original trial when the jury ruled that newton was 
defamed by nbc during broadcasts in 1980 and 1981 that linked the 
singer to organized crime figures 
crocker who presided over the first trial reduced the initial 
jury award to 53 million last year and gave newton the option of 
accepting the smaller award or going back to court newton rejected 
the smaller award 
crocker took mondays arguments under submission he has 
scheduled the new trial for may in los angeles 
newton was in court monday flanked by his girlfriend aides and 
bodyguards 
he sued nbc over three broadcasts in which nbc reported that 
sources said newton had gone to a reputed organized crime figure for 
help with a problem newton testified at the 1986 trial that he was 
seeking help in stopping death threats against his daughter 
newton contended the report left the impression that his october 
1980 purchase of the aladdin hotel was linked to organized crime

to understand that if he tries he will be awakening a sleeping 
giant the millions of women who have had abortions both before 
and after the landmark 1973 supreme court decision legalizing 
abortion yard said 
there will be no honeymoon period said eleanor smeal 
president of the fund for the feminist majority and a former 
president of now she said the election results indicate both 
political parties continue to lock women and minorities out 
smeal said politicians who talk family but vote against 
prochoice alternatives and the proposed equal rights amendment to 
the constitution are hypocrites 
yard said the groups activities will turn the spotlight on 
members of congress and state legislators who dont represent the 
views of their constituents as indicated by recent polls showing a 
majority of americans support a womans right to a safe legal 
abortion

solidarity leader lech walesa on tuesday 
promptly agreed to a nationally televised debate on the issue of 
union pluralism with the head of polands official trade union 
alliance 
alfred miodowicz member of the ruling politburo and chairman of 
the opzz the allpoland alliance of trade unions had challenged 
walesa to the debate in an interview in tuesdays edition of the 
communist party daily newspaper trybuna ludu 
in connection with alfred miodowiczs proposal concerning a 
public meeting i state that i accept it walesa said tuesday 
walesa said he had authorized solidarity national spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz and historian adam michnik a veteran adviser to 
the banned union to make the arrangements 
although all the parties involved seemed to agree on the idea of 
holding the debate it was unclear who would take the next step 
all members of the government will be glad to sit in front of 
their tv sets and listen to such a discussion government 
spokesman jerzy urban said at his weekly news conference 
the developments appeared to catch senior television officials by 
surprise 
jerzy slabicki deputy chairman of the state radio and tv 
committee said he knew nothing about the proposal but did not 
exclude the possibility that the debate would take place 
if there is to be a round table in poland such things are not 
out of the question slabicki said referring to talks promised by 
the authorities during the august strikes to discuss the future of 
solidarity the talks are stalled over government objections to the 
proposed participation of michnik and solidarity adviser jacek kuron 
another broadcast official appeared excited about the possibility 
of a tv encounter between walesa and miodowicz 
it would be great two good partners would meet said marek 
tumanowicz deputy news director for state television 
it would be very exciting if we announced for example that on 
friday after the news we were going to broadcast such a debate i am 
sure the streets would be totally empty 
miodowicz has headed the official unions since they were set up 
by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned solidarity 
the soviet blocs first independent trade union 
solidarity and the opzz hold opposing views on the number and 
organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop floor 
solidarity supporters say more than one union should be allowed to 
exist in each workplace because the opzz unions dont adequately 
represent workers interests 
it would be walesas first appearance on state tv since 1983 
when walesa challenged thendeputy prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski during a televised speech at the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
rakowski became prime minister in september 
walesa said a public discussion miodowicz was long overdue 
i do want to talk about trade union pluralism but without any 
adjectives but ive been asking for a public debate for seven 
years please dont attribute this to mr miodowiz its me who 
has been asking for it 
walesa on tuesday told 3000 workers in the lenin shipyard he 
will support management plans to restructure the yard and he is 
satisfied the plans will save most of its jobs 
the government had announced that the shipyard the birthplace of 
solidarity would be liquidated beginning dec 1 but now concedes 
it will take 1 years to close it 
the government has said the closure is needed for economic 
reasons but solidarity has said there should have been greater 
consultations with the workforce and the announcement was a veiled 
attack on solidarity

for more than a decade and to accept the outcome peacefully

mohammed zia ulhaq was killed in a plane crash three months ago 
said his government had done its best to ensure a free and fair vote 
a bomb killed a man tuesday in rawalpindi and police in the 
northern city said another was found unexploded no one claimed 
responsibility and officials would not speculate about whether the 
bombs were related to the election

the energy efficiency of the economy appears to 
be slowly improving again after a year of stagnation despite an 
earlier forecast that it would worsen in the short term the energy 
department said tuesday 
according to the departments energy information administration 
analysts have discovered major errors namely significant 
overstatements of natural gas use by american industry behind the 
previous projection 
correction of the natural gas error means the nations energy 
efficiency is actually improving though more slowly than in the 
past the eia said 
the agencys shortterm energy outlook publication in in july 
projected a worsening of the ratio from 19960 btus per dollar of 
gross national product in 1987 expressed in dollars of 1982 buying 
power to 20180 in 1988 followed by a slight improvement to 20050 
in 1989 
the october revision puts 1988 efficiency at 19840 btus per 
dollar a gain of 06 percent with 1989 efficiency projected at 
19590 a further gain of 13 percent 
many analysts pay close attention to how much energy the economy 
uses to produce a dollars worth of goods and services 
environmentalists use that ratio as an indicator of how much damage 
the environment might be subject to from economic activity 
policymakers take it as a gauge of the vulnerability of the economy 
to future interruptions on oil imports 
last year was the first since 1976 the ratio had failed to 
improve energy price increases of the late 1970s had set off a 
global scramble to boost efficiency and in the united states led 
to average annual rate of improvement of about 11 percent in the 
1970s and 28 percent in the period 19801986 
oil prices though collapsed in 1986 leading many analysts to 
conclude that companies stopped looking so hard for ways to use less 
energy heat electricity petroleum or whatever in producing 
their products 
the eias october report said that 43 companies delivering 
natural gas to industrial users have consistently misreported 
their monthly industrial deliveries following introduction of a 
new reporting form in january 
this resulted in an overstatement of industrial consumption in 
the first six months of 1988 of 05 trillion cubic feet about 16 
percent of nowestimated industrial consumption for the first half 
of the year the eia said 
natural gas accounts for 23 percent of all forms of energy use

a chance remark at a parisian dinner party two 
years ago led to the discovery of a longlost collection of rare 
islamic art that will go on public display sunday at the smithsonian 
institutions arthur m sackler gallery 
the collection assembled by henri vever a turnofthecentury 
jeweler and art collector in paris is perhaps the most important 
purchase in the history of the smithsonian institution says 
smithsonian secretary robert mcc adams 
the 500 items in vevers collection of richly detailed paintings 
manuscripts calligraphies and bookbindings from ancient persia 
india and other major artistic centers of the near east were bought 
for 7 million 
smithsonian officials say their real worth is much much more 
but that the collection is priceless in scope and quality 
drawn from the vever collection are 150 items that will be 
displayed at the sackler many of them for the first time anywhere 
from sunday through april 30 in a show titled a jewelers eye 
islamic arts of the book from the vever collection 
an hourlong smithsonian world television special on vever 
and his collection will be broadcast on public tv stations next 
march 
vevers collection includes almost all of the great classical 
persian texts several important arabic works and previously unknown 
manuscripts and paintings from major artistic centers of the near 
east and india 
the art works some dating to the 11th century reflect the 
reverence for the written word in medieval islam stemming from the 
holy scriptures of the prophet muhammad known as the koran the 
ruling elite built libraries of lavishly illuminated books and 
manuscripts as symbols of their cultural sophistication 
vevers collection includes brilliant paintings in which the 
pigments were ground from minerals precious stones and metals an 
irresistible attraction to the jeweler and his contemporary henri 
cartier 
smithsonian officials say the only comparable collection in the 
world is housed at the chester beatty library in dublin ireland 
vevers collection disappeared in the late 1930s during the 
german occupation of france vever himself died in 1942 and the 
whereabouts of his collection remained a mystery for nearly half a 
century 
then during a small dinner party in paris in november 1984 
laure lowry of williamstown mass found herself seated next to 
francois mautin a wealthy elderly sportsman and naturalized 
american who casually disclosed a momentous secret 
mautin said he was vevers grandson and had inherited a major 
collection of islamic art which was shipped intact from france to 
new york city after world war ii for safekeeping there it remained 
stored in a vault known only to mautin 
mrs lowry telephoned the news to her son glenn d lowry 
curator of near eastern art at the freer gallery of art and the 
yetunbuilt sackler gallery lowry was dumbfounded he and milo c 
beach now acting director of the sackler raced to paris and won 
mautins commitment to sell the collection to the smithsonian 
lowry and beach were the first scholars to see the collection by 
then moved to london in 50 years among the wellpreserved items 
hidden in trunks and stacked against walls was a surprise 39 full 
manuscripts previously unknown to scholars except for a handful that 
were exhibited in london in 1931 
the 7 million purchase was financed by various smithsonian trust 
and acquisition funds and private donors including the late dr 
arthur m sackler chief benefactor of the underground museum that 
opened in september 1987

was vacant several years ago burns said 
in 1982 puente was convicted of drugging and robbing three 
people in a bar and sentenced to five years in prison authorities 
said she was paroled after 2 years said christine may a state 
corrections department spokeswoman 
police said they were uncertain about the cause of death or even 
the sexes of the victims found monday no cause of death was 
determined for the other victims police said 
the list of possible victims lengthened during the day 
there are a lot more than eight names burns said referring 
to the original list of occupants supplied by a social worker 
theres a big list of names weve got detectives scurrying all 
over this city 
puente also ran a boardandcare home up to nine years ago about 
eight blocks away a separate team of investigators was interviewing 
tenants at that address but there were no immediate plans to dig 
there burns said 
police lt joe enloe said investigators believed the elderly 
victims were killed for their social security checks payments 
continued to be sent after the disappearances and someone else 
cashed the checks he said 
police went to the house after neighbors reported a friend had 
been missing since august and a social worker said some of her 
clients were missing 
a social worker familiar with the rooming house described the 
residents as elderly people on fixed incomes and with few relatives 
the case worker peggy nickerson told police puente came to her 
in 1986 offering lodging nickerson said she took up puentes 
offer and during the past two years referred 19 clients to puente 
she was the best the system had to offer nickerson said 
she said she was a widow and had a big house and she said it was 
her time to give back to other people that was her story and i 
didnt have any reason to doubt her 
puentes daughter linda bloom described her mother as someone 
who had a terrible childhood and was raised in orphanages 
bloom of south pasadena met her mother for the first time two 
years ago after being put up for adoption herself at birth she said 
puente was not animated at all and spoke in a monotone 
on sunday police arrested john mccauley a 59yearold resident 
of the boarding house on suspicion of being an accessory after the 
homicides he was being held at the sacramento county jail 
authorities believe mccauley assisted puente after the slayings 
and that she may have arranged for others to dig the graves police 
said

322acre estate in the borough of peapack amp gladstone be reduced 
from 258 million to 73 million that means the kings property 
taxes for 1988 will be lowered from 204591 to 57764

that land said tax board member warren nevins hes produced 
receipts hes entitled to it just like anybody else

a new electronic toll system that will read a 
special automobile tag may help motorists whiz by toll booths under 
an experiment planned by two new yorkarea authorities 
the number of times a vehicle goes through the toll would be 
recorded by computer and a monthly bill charged to a credit card 
the new system called automatic vehicle identification or avi 
uses a radio frequency beam transmitter mounted in each lane that 
will read a unique serial number up to 20 digits from a tag mounted 
on each vehicle 
a similar system now being experimented with in dallas is working 
well officials there said 
the triborough bridge and tunnel authority hopes to experiment 
with the new system at the verrazanonarrows bridge a span between 
staten island and brooklyn that carries about 58 million vehicles a 
year beginning early next year martin gottlieb the tbtas 
project manager for avi said monday 
however the experiment which could cost up to 14 million 
must first be approved by the metropolitan transportation authority 
the tbtas parent agency 
if approved tags would be fitted on vehicles belonging to some 
trucking companies as well as vehicles belonging to tbta employees 
and transit authority buses that use the bridge according to tbta 
spokeswoman catherine sweeney 
the port authority of new york and new jersey which is 
experimenting with a similar system for buses at the lincoln tunnel 
plans to use the same trucking companies for its experiment at the 
goethals bridge according to armando arrastia a port authority 
spokesman the goethals bridge connects staten island and new jersey 
in addition he said the new jersey turnpike the new jersey 
state highway authority and the new york state thruway authority are 
all committed to using the same avi system 
the decision to use the verrazanonarrows and goethals bridges 
was made because a lot of the traffic would be the same sweeney 
said many longdistance truckers cross staten island to avoid 
manhattan 
the speed of proccessing at the toll booths is the main 
advantage of the system gottlieb said it will reduce the need 
to handle cash tickets and tokens 
the new york and new jersey transportation officials are 
optimistic about the system because of good results from a similar 
experiment in dallas by the texas turnpike authority that started 
last summer 
its coming along very well said harry kabler a spokesman 
for the authority 
the dallas experiment is being conducted on the north dallas 
tollway and is currently limited to employees of amtech of texas 
one of two companies that has developed the automated system the 
tollway is a heavily traveled 20milelong highway between downtown 
dallas and its northern suburbs

litmus test of eastwest relations today as he held a farewell 
meeting with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
kohl responding through a translator at a departure ceremony on 
the white house lawn thanked reagan for his efforts to improve 
relations with the soviet union 
any kind of worsening in eastwest relations will be felt like 
an earthquake in our country and of course first of all in 
berlin kohl said 
reagan who will leave office jan 20 said the divided city 
of berlin remains a powerful symbol of a divided europe and a litmus 
test of eastwest relations 
the two leaders who have been close allies exchanged personal 
best wishes along with discussion of issues 
these have been good years said kohl both of us have 
paved the way for a development that will be pursued by your 
successor in office 
kohl met with presidentelect george bush later in the day at the 
vice presidents residence 
on wednesday reagan meets with britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher whom he said monday he respects more than any other world 
leader he has met 
answering a question from a junior high school student as to 
whether the united states would ever have a woman president reagan 
said he thought it was inevitable 
as a matter of fact the statesman in the world that i have met 
that i respect the most is the prime minister of england margaret 
thatcher he said and shes done a remarkable job for england 
in london columnist george walden of the conservative daily 
telegraph wrote we must brace ourselves for a niagara of mutual 
admiration the personal relationship has indeed been special 
mrs thatcher is scheduled to meet on thursday with bush who 
will be sworn in as president on jan 20

nato leaders 
a senior administration official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said we have nothing specific from the british in the 
course of planning this visit that said the prime minister would be 
bringing along a proposal of this kind but we certainly wouldnt be 
surprised if such a proposal came 
april 4 will be the 40th anniversary of the signing of the north 
atlantic treaty and such decade anniversaries have been observed in 
the past by turning the annual spring ministerial meeting of nato 
into a heads of government meeting 
we had heard that as london which is to be the site of the 
spring ministerial considered planning for that spring ministerial 
in the 40th anniversary year that some thought was being given to 
that meeting being a summit the official said 
the meeting will be in late may or early june

anonymity said kohls visit would enable him again to congratulate 
the presidentelect and to see with him what the immediate tasks for

discuss eastwest relations with the president and to report on his 
own meetings with soviet president mikhail gorbachev and other 
kremlin officials last month

sevennation economic summit in toronto last june kohl was last in

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi fell ill during his trial tuesday forcing the judge to 
interrupt emotional testimony by a former american hostage 
the trial was adjourned until monday after a doctor examined 
hamadi and ruled the defendant was unable to follow the proceedings 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 hijacking of twa flight 847 which was 
diverted on an athenstorome route and forced to land in beirut and 
algiers us navy diver robert stethem was killed and 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi told the court he was feeling very exhausted and 
very dizzy 
the session was adjourned for nearly an hour while he was 
examined by a doctor who told the court hamadi was suffering from 
dizzy spells and a headache 
circulation irregularities were blamed for the symptoms and 
hamadi was given a shot of glucose said the doctor who was not 
identified by the court she said hamadi had been eating very little 
and taking medicine to counter low blood pressure 
the session was interrupted during the testimony of burton weber 
a 48yearold american physician who said he was returning from a 
vacation in greece with his wife and two daughters when the twa 
plane was seized 
he described how he got up to go to a restroom and tried to find 
his wife among the passengers 
i looked everywhere on the plane but she wasnt there weber 
said his voice choked with emotion 
first i thought she might have been killed but then a 
stewardess told me she had been released from the plane he said 
some of the passengers were released while the plane was in algiers 
weber also testified how the hijackers robbed his wife of her 
jewelry which he valued in excess of 50000 
weber said one of the hijackers lectured us on the evils of 
america and it went on and on 
like more than a dozen other american witnesses at the trial 
weber also described the brutal beatings of passengers by the 
hijackers 
he said he had given a woman passenger an insulin shot but that 
the hijackers had refused his request to examine two men who were 
severely beaten 
they lay unconscious and looked dead one had blood on his 
shirt weber said 
webers 21yearold daughter marypat who testified earlier in 
the day said she still suffers nightmares more than three years 
after the ordeal 
i have had nightmares and im scared of flying on planes she 
said 
she also told the court she thought hamadi directed the hijacking 
i personally felt that hamadi was more in charge and that he 
was the leader she said 
hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing 
stethem or robbing the passengers he says the hijacking was 
directed by his accomplice fugitive hassan ezzeddine who is at 
large 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 when 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

retail sales shot up 09 percent in october 
the strongest increase in seven months the government said tuesday 
in a report that heightened inflation fears in the financial markets 
boosted by gains at department stores and auto dealerships sales 
rose to a seasonally adjusted 1356 billion the commerce 
department said it also revised its figures for the two previous 
months showing a brisker sales pace than previously thought 
in response bond prices fell tuesday morning traders saw the 
report as a sign of inflation too much consumer demand can strain 
factory capacity causing a shortage of goods and higher prices it 
also could encourage more imports and retard progress on whittling 
the nations trade gap 
however bond traders were hoping for good news on wednesday with 
the release of the merchandise trade deficit for september most 
economists expect a decline in imports to narrow the september 
deficit to 95 billion to 11 billion down from 122 billion in 
august 
in another economic report tuesday the federal reserve board 
said its index of industrial production increased a moderately 
strong 04 percent in october the biggest gain in three months 
these numbers give a much different picture than just a month 
ago some people were betting the expansion would die of old age 
these numbers refute that strongly said david jones an economist 
with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new 
york 
but he said the unexpected strength has rekindled concern about 
inflation which had waned as growth cooled in august and september 
theres the perception that in response the fed will move to 
tighten credit at least modestly pushing up interest rates he 
said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reports 
are both very positive and very encouraging for continued steady 
growth in the economy 
we see no evidence of rekindling inflation he added 
in the latest report the government said retail sales fell 03 
percent in september up from an earlier estimate of a 04 percent 
decline and rose 03 percent in august rather than falling 01 
percent as previously thought 
the october increase of 09 percent was the steepest since march 
when sales shot up 16 percent most economists had been expecting a 
milder rise of about 03 percent last month 
auto sales in october jumped 17 percent to 292 billion after 
falling 22 percent a month earlier however it was only the second 
increase since march 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a consulting 
firm in washington said the pattern of retail buying is shifting 
from hard goods such as autos and appliances to soft 
goods such as clothing as the year winds up 
clothing sales were lackluster earlier this year partly because 
of high prices and partly because women rejected new fashions she 
said 
i think there is some pent up demand out there she said a 
lot of women were just waiting it out through two years of 
merchandise that was not appropriate for work 
excluding the automotive category which is the most volatile 
sales rose 07 percent last month after a 02 percent increase in 
september 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up 
24 percent to 156 billion last month following a 08 percent 
gain in september 
hardware garden and buildingsupply stores reported no change in 
october after a 08 percent rise a month earlier 
furniture stores posted a modest 02 percent gain after falling 
03 percent in september 
food and grocery stores reported a 11 percent gain gasoline 
stations a 12 percent jump specialty clothing stores a 13 percent 
increase and drug stores a 06 percent rise 
the only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars 
down 02 percent after a 13 percent increase in september 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch amp co noting 
that the sales figures are not adjusted for inflation said much of 
the increases for food gasoline clothing and autos can be 
attributed to higher prices 
for the first 10 months of the year overall sales were up 61 
percent over the same period of 1987 barely keeping ahead of the 
inflation rate

a stunning election upset by scotlands 
nationalists illustrates deepening scottish dislike for the london 
political establishment and could breathe new life into the campaign 
for independence 
thursdays election in the govan district of glasgow was to fill 
a vacant seat in parliament and since such byelections are 
traditionally an occasion for registering protest votes the result 
cannot be accurately projected over scotland as a whole 
but it is a spectacular victory for the scottish national party 
which seeks independence for scotland and a humiliation for the 
labor party the opposition in parliament but the dominant force 
north of the english border 
in one of the biggest upsets in 40 years of british politics the 
snps jim sillars won 14677 votes aginst 11123 for labors bob 
gillespie a 38percent swing from the june 1987 general election 
when labor took govan by a massive 19509vote majority 
it was almost a rerun of 1973 when sillars wife margo 
macdonald staged a similar upset in govan for the snp by the 
following year after two general elections the bandwagon effect 
had taken nationalist strength in the 650member house of commons 
from two seats to 11 
by last year however the snp was down to three seats now the 
question is whether the latest result is a freak or the precursor 
of a 1970sstyle revival 
the scottish people will now start marching towards their 
destiny as an independent country with an independent economy 
sillars 51 declared to cheering supporters after the result was 
announced in the heavily bluecollar constituency 
its a pretty substantial blip conceded scottish laborite 
john home robertson he warned prime minister margaret thatcher that 
if shes not careful and if this sort of bandwagon gets going 
she could actually split up the united kingdom 
but the conservatives having harbored no expectations in govan 
felt little disappointment with their paltry 2207 votes preferring 
instead to mock labors defeat 
last night must be the first byelection where the protest vote 
has been against the opposition rather than the government 
taunted tory government minister michael forsyth 
scotlands yen to end its 281yearold union with england ebbs 
and flows right now says professor james kellas a political 
scientist at glasgow university there is a trend of scottish 
nationalism rising 
one reason is a widespread scottish perception of mrs thatcher 
as a thoroughly english prime minister with no understanding of 
scottish concerns theres a general feeling of scottish interests 
being neglected by the london government kellas said 
another reason is a new property tax that has provoked widespread 
hostility in scotland 
the poll tax or community charge will be calculated per head 
instead of on size of property and is central to mrs thatchers 
crusade against leftwing local authorities who tax the welloff to 
finance welfare programs for the needy 
an opinion poll on election night found 21 percent saying the 
poll tax was the most important issue compared with 19 percent who 
cited unemployment 
the snp seized the opportunity where labor opted for legal 
lowkey opposition to the poll tax the nationalists promised to 
organize a nonpayment campaign 
thus says kellas the labor party appears powerless and 
doesnt make enough impact theyre seen as playing the game 
according to the rules through peaceful opposition within the 
confines of parliament 
he says theres no telling whether the snp will capitalize on its 
triumph unlike in 1973 this time no general election is due for up 
to four years and the afterglow of govan may not last that long 
but at the same time the snp believes it has found a winning 
formula independence within europe that means an independent 
scotland living alongside england and united with it through 
membership in the european economic community 
we are talking about freeing scotland from england within the 
context of the european community where england would be no more 
than a friendly partner and there would be no control of scotland 
from england whatsoever says sillars 
with the approach of 1992 and an end to tax barriers and frontier 
restrictions within the eec that notion is looking more palatable 
to people than in the past said kellas 
scottish social commentator tom nairn said scots who in the past 
would shy away from outright secession see the new formula as a way 
of retaining an association with england while going independent 
the formula is appealing he said because it smacks of 
having your cake and eating it

judge abbey boklan 
boklan ordered friedman continued free on 100000 bail despite 
the objections of nassau county prosecutor joseph onorato who urged

sexually abused seven boys ages 9 to 12 at the friedman residence 
in 1986 and 1987 the boys were students at the computer school 
this latest indictment charges jesse friedman with 198 counts of 
sodomy sexual abuse use of a child in a sexual performance and 
endangering the welfare of a child

sexabuse charges in connection with purported child sex orgies at 
the friedman residence in 1986 and 1987 
tuesdays indictment accuses goldstein of 118 counts of 
sexrelated crimes 
friedmans father pleaded guilty last march to 42 sexrelated 
charges involving 13 boys who attended his home computer courses he 
is serving 10 to 30 years in prison the sentence is concurrent with 
a federal sentence that friedman received for sending child 
pornography through the mails

methods of quelling civil disturbances such as tear 
gas and clubs are more dangerous than the public perceives and can 
be lethal physicians said tuesday at the american public health 
associations annual meeting 
the problem we have is that in government and police and 
military actions there are a variety of socalled nonlethal weapons 
that are used said jonathan fine president of physicians for 
human rights theres little public appreciation that some of 
these devices and weapons are in fact lethal 
fine said police and military forces using such things as tear 
gas or guns loaded with rubber bullets should be made aware of their 
potential danger 
it really is important for police and military personnel to get 
a better understanding for the medical consequences so that they be 
used with more caution more restraint and in some cases be totally 
banned he said 
tear gas is a misnomer if ever there was one its actually 
poison gas fine said 
effects of tear gas were documented from observations of the 
effects of tear gas used to control student demonstrators in south 
korea in june 1987 fine said while the common symptoms of crying 
coughing and nausea subside within a few hours people living near 
areas frequently gassed reported getting tear gas cold a 
persistent cough and sore throat for several weeks he said 
while police and government officials say crowd control methods 
are vital to maintaining public security fine said the physicians 
for human rights believe the instruments used should be carefully 
examined and their use should be limited 
other health care professionals at the seminar reported results 
of a february trip to israel observing casualties on the west bank 
and gaza strip 
jennifer leaning director of emergency services for the harvard 
health plan said that of 103 injured people interviewed 72 percent 
had been injured within 24 hours of the interview while gunshot 
wounds accounted for 5 percent of the recently injured the 
remainder were due to rubber bullets tear gas and clubs she said 
many of the beating wounds were broken bones in the arm or hand 
leaning said the israeli government cooperated with the 
physicians visit but the team had difficulty interviewing injured 
israeli soldiers and spoke mainly with palestinians after the team 
reported its findings the israeli government responded mainly by 
pointing to an improved infant mortality rate on the west bank and 
gaza 
velvl greene a professor of epidemiology at ben gurion 
university in beer sheva israel said the reports of injuries 
suffered by palestinians on the west bank were biased because they 
didnt take into account injuries inflicted by palestinians 
theyre not demonstrations theyre attacks he said

israel rejected the palestinian declaration of 
independence tuesday as an exercise in ambiguity and double talk 
that neither renounces terrorism nor clearly recognizes the jewish 
state 
israel was put on the defensive by the move toward moderation 
however and officials concede they face an uphill battle against 
the plo attempt to win recognition for a palestinian state 
the palestine national council acting as the plo legislature 
proclaimed the palestinian state and issued a political declaration 
accepting un security council resolution 242 which implicity 
recognizes israels right to exist the declaration also limits plo 
guerrilla action to military targets in the occupied territories 
only leftist groups in israel praised the plo for moderating its 
antiisraeli language extreme rightwing groups urged the 
government to respond by annexing part or all of the occupied lands 
and establish new jewish settlements 
about 15 million palestinians and 70000 jewish settlers live in 
the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 war 
the foreign ministry which issued the israeli governments 
official reaction said of the plo declaration ambiguity and 
double talk are again employed to excuse its advocacy of violence 
resorting to terrorism and adherence to extreme positions 
ministry spokesman alon liel said they mentioned rejection of 
terrorism outside israel but they did not denounce terrorism inside 
israel so we still see the plo as a terror organization and the 
government decision not to negotiate with the plo stands 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who is expected to lead a new 
rightwing government contended that moderating the plo language 
was merely a tactic part of an overall strategy to destroy israel 
he said the declaration was another step in the war of arab 
terror organizations against israels existence and independence and 
we shall respond accordingly 
us rep james scheuer dny met with shamir and described 
him as very concerned that world public opinion will be taken in 
by syrupy words in a great vast hoax 
foreign minister shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party and shamirs rival said there could be no palestinian state 
without negotiations involving israel and the plo declaration was 
yet another attempt to avoid making unequivocal decisions 
avraham sela an international relations expert at hebrew 
university said it will be seen by israelis as too little and 
not convincing enough the plo needs to do something striking with a 
clear intention 
leil of the foreign ministry said we realize we will have to 
work very hard in order to explain our position in the world 
analysts said the main problem for israel is its lack of a 
credible plan for starting peace negotiations and ending palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories that began nearly a year ago 
asher susser a political scientist at tel aviv university said 
the algiers declaration may cause the world to look more favorably 
on the plo 
israels position does seem to be rather inflexible as opposed 
to what seems to be a softening of the plos position he said in 
an interview 
trade minister ariel sharon a leading member of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc called the declaration a dangerous 
development 
sharon said israel might face economic sanctions and political 
isolation and should assert its own claim by imposing sovereignty 
on part of the occupied lands 
yossi sarid a parliament member was among leftists who welcomed 
the more moderate plo language he praised palestinian acceptance of 
a 1947 un partition resolution that envisioned both jewish and 
arab states 
adoption of the partition principle by the plo indirect 
recognition of israel and readiness for negotiations shows the plo 
has changed he said 
susser of tel aviv university wording of the declaration 
suggested the plo viewed acceptance of a twostate solution only as 
a necessary evil 
its clearly an effort to have your cake and eat it too he 
said thats what the plo has been doing for years

george bush won the presidential election by 
solidifying his support with republicans and successfully convincing 
disaffected voters to back him according to a postelection survey 
released tuesday 
the poll conducted by the gallup organization for the times 
mirror co also said 44 percent of the respondents thought the 
federal budget deficit should be the top priority for the bush 
administration other crucial issues for voters are protecting 
american jobs and increasing programs for families and children 
the telephone poll one of several done for the los angelesbased 
news company in 1988 measured responses from 2022 registered 
voters the margin of error was three percentage points 
bush who defeated democrat michael dukakis by 54 percent to 46 
percent on nov 8 did not entirely recreate the coalition that gave 
president reagan a resounding victory in 1984 the poll found 
but by the second week in september the vice president had put 
together various elements that gave him a victory in november the 
survey indicated 
while our surveys showed a fair degree of offsetting change 
within democratic groups between september and october the overall 
patterns of support first identified in september persisted through 
election day the pollsters said in a statement that accompanied 
the results 
among the trends reflected in the poll are that bush 
bolstered support among core republican groups between may and 
late october 
increased support among young moderate voters during the same 
period 
seized the backing of disaffected voters those 
lowermiddleincome people who feel alienated and tend to be 
disgruntled 
bush could not have won with the disaffecteds said andrew 
kohut gallups president that group is estimated to comprise about 
10 percent of the voting pool 
in may shortly after the end of the primary season the 
disaffecteds were evenly divided between dukakis and bush by 
september their opinions of dukakis had moved from lukewarm to 
highly critical ultimately 68 percent said they voted for bush 
the survey found 
michael traugott a gallup analyst said bush attracted the 
disaffecteds by stressing his tough crime theme and pinning the 
liberal label on dukakis 
in fact the success of the bush campaign was based on 
highlighting the controversies over liberalism the pledge of 
allegiance and the prison furlough program 
among dukakis voters the most important campaign issues were the 
allegations about bushs involvement in the irancontra matter the 
administrations dealing with panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega and the selection of indiana sen dan quayle as the gop vice 
presidential candidate 
voters expressed some discontent with the campaign and the 
candidates the survey said some 63 percent who backed dukakis said 
they were dissatisfied with the candidates while 16 percent of 
those who voted for bush expressed dissatisfaction 
respondents also were asked to rate others participants in the 
political election the news media and campaign consultants were 
given the lowest marks on an a through f rating system one in six 
people gave the press a failing grade 
traugott said he thought the low grade given the press reflected 
in part a lack of understanding of how reporters do their work 
other surveys have shown for instance that the media as an 
institution is evaluated highly

us industrial production rose a moderately 
strong 04 percent in october the best increase in three months 
despite a decline in activity in the nations oil fields the 
government said tuesday 
the federal reserve board said its industrial production index 
last month rose to a seasonally adjusted 1392 percent of its 1977 
base reflecting increases in production of business equipment and 
automobiles 
were not talking anything dramatic here but its a 
comfortable gain said robert g dederick an economist with 
northern trust co in chicago 
noting that retail sales for the month also increased dederick 
said were seeing strength in both the production side of the 
economy and the demand side which suggests that strength on the 
production side can continue 
the october gain in production at factories mines and utilities 
was in line with economists expectations it followed smaller 
increases of 02 percent in september revised up from an earlier 
estimate of no change and 03 percent in august production jumped 
11 percent in july 
the index has not declined since september 1987 a reflection of 
the strength in the manufacturing sector a drop in the value of the 
dollar has triggered a surge in sales of us goods overseas this 
year and a related boom in spending to expand and modernize 
factories 
however economists have become worried that manufacturing may be 
growing too strongly straining production capacity and leading to 
inflation the relatively weak industrial production of august and 
september had calmed those fears somewhat but signs of a rebound in 
october have rekindled the concern 
what is needed is really rather subdued growth and thats 
not what were getting dederick said 
production in the manufacturing sector rose 05 percent in 
october following a 04 percent gain in september the federal 
reserve said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 76 
million units up from 74 million units a month earlier and 70 
million units in august 
production of business equipment jumped 08 percent for the 
second month in a row and stood 94 percent higher than a year ago 
within that category production of manufacturing equipment rose 18 
percent last month and 19 percent in september 
output at mines which includes oil and gas drilling fell 09 
percent in october the third consecutive decline 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa forecasting firm said falling world oil prices have curtailed 
drilling in the united states 
over the last couple of weeks drilling activity has dropped off 
sharply youre going to see that continue he said 
production at utilities rose 04 percent last month following a 
large drop of 38 percent in september which was attributed to the 
decline in electricity use for air conditioners following the summer 
heat wave 
total output at factories mines and utilities was 51 percent 
higher than a year ago

ussoviet arms talks aimed at slashing longrange 
nuclear arsenals adjourned tuesday until next year after a 
fourmonth session and us negotiators said major disagreements 
remain 
the chief us envoy max kampelman said an 11th round of talks 
hoped to move the process forward will begin early next year 
after presidentelect george bush assumes office jan 20 
we are hoping for new progress under the bush administration 
moscows chief delegate alexei obukhov said before a final full 
meeting of both delegations at the soviet diplomatic mission 
kampelman said he assured the soviet delegation of bushs 
commitment to the talks and said the presidentelect would maintain 
continuity in the us position 
we continue to move forward and are encouraged by that 
movement kampelman said after the session but he added major 
disagreements remain we understand each other better and we 
understand the issues better 
it is just beginning it will continue he said of the 
superpowers effort to reduce their giant atomic arsenals 
the latest round of talks began july 12 two areas are involved 
the draft strategic arms reduction treaty aimed at cutting us and 
soviet longrange nuclear forces by half and defense and space 
the talks began in march 1985 and have produced the ussoviet 
agreement to scrap all intermediaterange missiles 
we have significantly reduced both areas where positions are 
starkly contrasting us negotiator s read hanmer said of the 
latest round 
he said differences were narrowed on airlaunched cruise 
missiles where agreed counting rules are being sought and on 
monitoring mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they are 
included in the treaty 
a longstanding disagreement remains over the range an 
airlaunched cruise missile must have to be included in the treaty 
hanmer said 
kampelman indicated no progress was made on sealaunched cruise 
missiles which moscow wants to limit under the pact washington has 
resisted including them saying they cannot be reliably monitored 
kampelman also said president reagans strategic defense 
initiative the program for a spacebased missile defense opposed by 
the soviets remains a serious objective and is not a bargaining 
chip at geneva 
the program popularly called star wars has been a stumbling 
block since negotiations began 
kampelman said he was not aware of plans for soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs fifth and final meeting with reagan that us 
officials say has been set for next month in washington 
the summit would give the two sides another chance to narrow the 
gap on start 
the geneva round formally ends wednesday with a ceremony in which 
the two sides will exchange copies of the start treaty draft 
kampelman 68 said it was too early to talk about whether he 
will remain chief negotiator in the bush administration

george bush returned to the nations capital 
today after four days of sun and surf in florida and held his first 
meeting as presidentelect with a foreign head of government west 
german chancellor helmut kohl 
bush also asked treasury secretary nicholas brady today to remain 
in his current post in the new administration 
brady is a former investment banker who served briefly as an 
appointed member of the senate he is a longtime friend of the 
presidentelect and was a key member of a circle of advisers that 
bush leaned on during his successful presidential campaign 
bush greeted kohl outside the vice presidents residence at the 
naval observatory after the germans leaders lunch with president 
reagan 
asked by reporters if he would give kohl reassurances on the us 
budget deficit bush said the chancellor knows how strongly i 
feel about doing something about that deficit 
kohl agreed in german 
vice presidentelect dan quayle was also on hand to greet kohl 
and two of his cabinet members west german foreign minister hans 
dietrich genscher and defense minister rupert scholz 
bush told reporters who asked what he hoped for from the meeting 
maybe i can get a little advice 
he returned to washington earlier in the day after a fourday 
vacation in gulf stream fla 
off to work bush said as he departed on air force two from 
palm beach international airport after landing at andrews air force 
base outside washington he was flown by helicopter to his residence 
bush was to meet wednesday with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
the white house announced today that bush and reagan would meet 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev next month when he visits 
the united states to address the united nations 
on the eve of his departure for washington bush was joined at a 
beachfront vacation home for dinner by new hampshire gov john 
sununu a top campaign adviser mentioned as a candidate for white 
house chief of staff 
but bush laughingly told reporters not to read too much into 
the visit by sununu who was the only political associate to see 
bush on vacation and who flew back to washington with bush 
asked by reporters about his prospects for the chief of staff 
job sununu said im still governor pressed further he said 
ill do whatever he needs he said he and bush discussed 
things in general he will talk specifics in about a week or so 
bush told reporters in a beachfront questionandanswer session 
that his meetings with kohl and thatcher would focus on talking 
about where we go after i become president but it should be viewed 
as a continuation of existing policy 
bush also sought to reassure a nervous international financial 
community that the us budget deficit will be a top priority at the 
start of his administration 
it is a matter of great urgency and i want to be in the 
forefront of trying to do something about it after i become 
president he said 
bushs campaign promise to reject any tax increases has led some 
analysts to question whether he is serious about reducing the 
deficit he was been dogged by reports of a declining dollar abroad 
and a dramatic drop in the dow jones industrial average after his 
election 
the calming statements had an impact on financial trading monday 
and today however as the dollar rebounded on most international 
financial markets after its downward spiral last week several 
traders credited the statements with calming fears that bushs 
advisers want the us currency to fall further 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which took an 
electionweek loss of nearly 80 points last weeks fell 195 on 
monday to record its fourth consecutive losing session 
in washington the incoming chairman of the house budget 
committee said tax increases will be needed next year to make 
legally required cuts in the deficit 
anybody whos dealt with budget issues knows the size of the 
challenge is too large to exempt any areas said rep leon 
panetta dcalif 
bush however dismissed the financial unrest by saying these 
gyrations happen 
bush said he will tackle the deficit early on in my 
presidency but added i do not want to start acting like i am 
president of the united states yet 
he was expected to name former deputy treasury secretary richard 
darman as budget director and stanford university professor michael 
boskin as white house economics adviser 
bush aides said that a list of three to five names is being drawn 
up for him to consider for each cabinet post 
bush also was asked about a report suggesting that baker his 
choice as secretary of state would wield clout as a deputy 
president 
bush replied you havent heard that here 
on reports that a threeperson chiefofstaff arrangement was 
under consideration bush said stay tuned ill have 
announcements on that pretty soon 
on other topics 
bush sidestepped a question about whether he would name a woman 
to his cabinet coining a new word in the process i will 
anticipate there will be female representation in the cabinet but 
i dont like to put it like that sounds kind of quotaistic 
he rejected allegations that government foreclosure warnings to 
80000 farmers were held up until after the election 
i dont believe theres any political motivation related to 
agricultural policies at all he said

pennsylvania must begin providing autistic 
children with the special education and attention their handicap 
demands a house committee said in a report approved tuesday 
the house select committee to study autism voted unanimously to 
accept a draft report that outlines ways the state can help autistic 
children 
there are about 15000 autistic adults and children in the state 
committee chairman joseph f markosek estimated 
the 32page report will be put into bill form for introduction 
during next years legislative session markosek said the current 
legislative session ends nov 30 
as defined in the report autism is a mental disorder that is a 
severely incapacitating lifelong developmental disability that 
usually appears from birth to age 3 autistic children suffer from 
poor social relationships impaired communication and persistent 
repetitive and restrictive behavior the report said 
the states failure to recognize autism as an illness different 
from other mental disorders results in autistic children being 
placed in educational courses that do not meet their needs markosek 
said 
since there are no formal categories the children are placed 
in the category of being mentally retarded he said adding that 
a lot of times they get training that is inappropriate for them 
yvonne husic a lobbyist for the association for retarded 
citizens of pennsylvania said because autism is not recognized as a 
separate disorder autistic children are falling between the 
cracks 
the report recommends developing inservice training programs on 
autism for professionals who deal with handicapped children 
educating parents on ways to help their autistic children at home 
and implementing programs to help the autistic move into regular 
classrooms vocational training programs or the community 
also included in the report is a longrange recommendation that 
the state set up two regional centers for helping autistic children

a minister is suggesting that various 
congregations could save money and reduce waste by joining forces to 
build a highrise church with one floor for each denomination and 
shared meeting areas 
the rev ronald nevin pastor of episcopal church of the 
ascension in wilmington says such partner congregations could sell 
their land and put the money into a trust fund to help the needy 
nevin 55 doesnt propose all churches move in this direction 
but he estimated that six churches within four miles of his 
church use their sanctuaries no more than 20 hours a week and said 
the issue of underused or wasted space needs to be considered 
it is simply outrageous not to say unchristian and a 
betrayal of the gospel that in those places where unfortunate 
people are most to be found empty buildings and rarely used 
buildings are owned by people who call themselves by the name of 
christ who himself had nowhere to lay his head nevin said 
however he said whenever ive shared it with other clergy 
theyve said yes it is interesting but it will never happen 
they just shrug it off 
george f cora executive director of the delmarva ecumenical 
agency who has worked as a catholic priest in a shared church 
building in columbia md said that sharing a building does 
promote ecumenism to some extent 
it doesnt solve all the problems in the sense that people 
still want to be organized in groups small enough so they can know 
each other cora said 
the rev charles o walter pastor of holly oak united methodist 
church in wilmington said he hoped the proposal would be seriously 
explored 
part of me says its important for historical reasons to 
maintain my church but i would probably agree to it a little 
bit reluctantly to serve the greater good walter said 
the most attractive part of it is youd be able to spend more 
money on missions and not just on taking care of church property

studies of silent episodes of cardiac 
distress show that an absence of pain does not mean an absence of 
heart problems scientists reported tuesday at a meeting of the 
american heart association 
the temporary reduction of blood flow to the heart a condition 
called ischemia can occur with no symptoms and no pain an thus are 
silent yet doctors said at news conference these episodes 
indicate that a patient may be in real danger of serious heart 
disease or even fatal heart attack 
dr carl j pepine of the university of florida said many 
cardiologists now recognize that silent ischemia can strike time 
after time and never leave a trace of pain or discomfort to signal 
that there is a problem 
it can occur in subjects who have never had a symptom of heart 
disease he said yet new techniques of measuring heart activity 
have determined that silent ischemia occurs often and can last for 
hours 
usually a reduced flow of blood to the heart will cause chest 
pain severe pains are called angina pectoris and usually quickly 
send patients to the doctor 
vessels narrowed by disease spasms or blood clots can all block 
or impede blood flow to the heart if its serious enough the 
result is a major heart attack and much pain but even pepine said 
doctors now realize that even when there is no pain the heart may 
be under seige 
dr sydney o gottlieb of johns hopkins university medical 
institutions said tests using ambulatory electrocardigams which 
record activity of the heart for 24 continuous hours are able to 
detect episodes not felt by the patient 
such patients he said can be at very much higher risk of 
subsequent heart attack and should be treated more aggressively 
than their pain symptoms would indicate 
among patients being treated for heart attack and doing well 
said gottlieb the indications of silent attack is a very potent 
marker for those who are at high risk for mortalilty in the 
subsequent year 
gottlieb said it would be impractical to test everyone for these 
silent attacks but he said his experiences suggest it would be 
reasonable to test people such as middleaged men who have a 
number of other risk factors such as a family history of heart 
disease cigarette smoking or high cholesterol readings 
treadmill stress tests he said have been very successful in 
finding silent painfree heart disease that might otherwise have 
not been detected in these tests subjects are attached to sensors 
that monitor heart function while they walk on a treadmill 
even in an individual who is not having pain poor performance 
on a treadmill can identify those relatively well individuals who 
are at high risk for a coronary event gottlieb said 
he said he recently tested a middleaged firefighter who was 
totally pain free and had never been diagnosed with a heart 
condition 
within 2 minutes on the treadmill gottlieb said the sensors 
detected a severely stressed heart later tests using x rays showed 
that one major cardiac artery was completely blocked and another had 
only 10 percent flow 
he was a walking time bomb gottlieb said yet he played 
tennis felt well and said he never had any pain 
pepine said studies have proven that the silent attacks occur 
often and that they are predictive of more serious heart problems 
but studies have yet to demonstrate that treating patients with 
silent ischemia can extend their lives he said such studies are now 
under way 
dr stephen p glasser of the university of south florida college 
of medicine said that though tests have proven that these silent 
attacks occur scientists still dont know why some patients feel no 
pain 
peoples pain thresholds are different he said it might 
be that people with high thresholds might be more apt to have these 
silent episodes

presidentelect george bush today named 
treasury secretary nicholas brady a longtime friend to remain in 
his current post in the new administration 
bush said his appointee for the treasury understands the need to 
keep inflation low and knows that we must resist the policies that 
will impede that effort such as raising taxes or resorting to 
protection 
added the presidentelect he knows weve got to sit down with 
the congress on a deficit reduction agreement and weve got to do it 
soon 
bush fresh from a long weekend of relaxation in the florida 
sunshine appeared with brady outside the vice presidents official 
residence 
for his part brady said he would do my best to help the 
presidentelect serve the people and to build on this the longest 
recovery in the history of the country brady said he had no 
comment on the dollar which has fallen in recent days 
bush said he would make no other appointments during the day he 
said he felt no pressure to name a new chief of staff but added he 
might do so fairly soon 
the presidentelect dined alone monday night with new hampshire 
gov john sununu believed to be a leading candidate for the top 
staff job in the new white house sununu walked off air force two 
just behind the bushes when they arrived in washington earlier in 
the day 
bradys appointment marked the second time that bush has turned 
to a longtime confidante to fill a key post in his administration 
secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii was bushs first 
cabinet appointment announced the morning after his election last 
week 
bush described brady a former chairman of the investment banking 
house of dillon read amp co as a man who brings to his office an 
extraordinary knowledge of financial markets experience in the 
private sector and said he was very well respected both here and 
abroad 
bush announced the appointment of brady after meeting privately 
with visiting west german chancellor helmut kohl 
brady 58 served briefly as an appointed member of the senate 
from new jersey he is a longtime friend of the presidentelect and 
was a key member of a circle of advisers that bush leaned on during 
his successful presidential campaign 
the appointment came as no surprise president reagan appointed 
brady to his cabinet post last summer and it was long expected that 
bush would keep his old friend in the cabinet if he won the 
presidential election 
bush made the appointment in an uncertain international economic 
atmosphere the value of the dollar fell sharply last week dragging 
down stock prices as well because of investor fears over bushs 
economic policies 
to calm jitters bush and brady both acted in recent days to 
reassure investors that the new administration had no secret plan to 
drive down the value of the dollar

president reagan and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl calling each other dear ron and helmut bade 
their farewells on the sunlit south lawn of the white house on 
tuesday after six years of close alliance on the world stage 
reagan reaffirmed the strong american commitment to berlin 
and said that divided city remains a powerful symbol of a 
divided europe and a litmus test of eastwest relations 
kohl thanked the american president for his bold and resolute 
commitment to improving eastwest relations and said any kind 
of worsening of the situation between east and west will by felt 
like an earthquake in our country and of course first of all 
in berlin 
it was an unseasonally balmy day and even warmer weather is 
forecast for wednesday when reagan holds a similar meeting with 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher 
neither reagan nor kohl broke any new ground in their meeting or 
the formal departure statements that followed it 
reagan said that the two countries continue to seek ways to 
share early the risks burdens and responsibilities as well as the 
benfits of our common defense 
we reviewed the difficulties each country faces in doing more 
but pledge we would each do our fair share the president said 
he congratulated kohl on the decision of the european community 
member states to take steps toward closer economic integration by 
the end of 1992 and expressed our concern that this be done in a 
manner that promotes fair trade internationally 
they devoted much of their closing statements however to 
reminiscence and farewell 
helmut this marks my last meeting as president with you 
reagan said six years ago we stood together as i announced the 
formation of a presidential commission to commemorate the 
tricentennial of the first german settlement in the united states 
six years to the day im proud to announce a product of that 
commission the dedication of a garden here in washington as a 
symbol of the friendship between our two countries 
in a few months ill be leaving the white house he said 
but the garden and all it represents will remain to be 
nurtured and sustained by the friendship between germans and 
americans and by the leadership that you have provided 
kohl speaking through an interpreter told reagan i believe 
we can say mr president dear ron we can put it very briefly and 
say these have been good years i think that both of us have paved 
the way for development which will be pursued by your successor in 
office

a convicted teamsters union ghost employee 
testified tuesday that jackie presser set up a 110000 embezzlement 
scheme to pay people who did no work for the union 
federal prosecutors have said presser who at the time of his 
death july 9 faced embezzlement and labor racketeering charges 
masterminded a scheme to issue 700000 worth of union paychecks to 
such people a form of embezzlement known as ghosting 
two other local 507 officials now are on trial in the alleged 
scheme 
john a jack nardi jr a prison inmate and a federally 
protected witness testified he received paychecks of at least 300 
a week from local 507 in cleveland from late 1971 through 1978 
while never reporting for work 
federal labor laws require union leaders to use dues from union 
members for the benefit of those members 
nardi son of the late cleveland teamsters official john a 
nardi last april struck a plea bargain and and entered a guilty 
plea to embezzling local 507 funds and also arranging to accept a 
bribe from presser to cover up the embezzlement sentencing was 
deferred until after the present trial 
he is in prison on a state grand theft conviction 
presser was secretarytreasurer at local 507 and president of the 
international brotherhood of teamsters from 1983 until his death 
from cancer 
nardi testified that his father told him in late 1971 that an 
arrangement had been made for him to work for presser nardi said 
that in a meeting with presser his role was never clarified but 
that his starting pay was set at 300 a week and his checks 
starting coming every week in the mail 
nardi said he never worked even one day for local 507 
he said presser and harold friedman local 507 president signed 
his checks 
john a nardi who was secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 410 
and a reputed organized crime figure was killed in a car bomb blast 
in 1977 nardi jr testified that at his fathers funeral presser 
reassurred him his pay would continue 
he said the paychecks stopped after 1978 when he said presser 
told him about concerns he had with a possible federal investigation 
into the payments 
friedman 66 is still president of local 507 and is one of the 
nations most powerful teamsters officials he has been a teamsters 
international vice president since 1983 and also is president of 
teamsters joint council 41 in northeast ohio and the ohio conference 
of teamsters 
he is charged with two counts of labor racketeering two of 
embezzlement of union funds and two of making false statements to 
the department of labor 
anthony hughes 52 recording secretary at teamsters local 507 
and a business agent at bakery workers local 19 is charged with two 
counts of labor racketeering and one count of embezzlement 
pretrial documents indicated that pressers defense in the 
ghost employee allegation would have been that he was authorized 
by the fbi to hire certain people onto the unions payroll in order 
to preserve his secret status as an fbi informant the socalled 
ghosts were described as being able to provide information 
largely about organized crime activity

a doctor who delivered siamese twins said his 
first indication of the unusual birth was the sight of three arms 
emerging from the incision he made for a caesarean section 
on the fetal monitor there was only one heartbeat and it was 
perfect the baby appeared to be of normal size there was no fetal 
distress said charles kim the obstetriciangynecologist who 
delivered the twins sunday at frederick memorial hospital 
shortly after birth they were brought to university of maryland 
hospital in baltimore 
we were expecting one baby not two babies joined together at 
the chest and upper abdomen kim said 
when kim made the incision three arms came out and i knew 
definitely that something was going on he said i also knew the 
first incision would not work the baby was trapped i was afraid we 
might damage the baby 
kim said he quickly made another incision 
we could see the baby was not in good shape its color was 
poor it was lethargic and not breathing well kim said then i 
had a very big astonishing surprise we didnt have one baby we 
had two that were conjoined after i calmed down i did my surgery 
siamese twins which result when a fertilized egg fails to divide 
completely occur once every 50000 to 100000 live births about 
half of such twins die within 48 hours of birth 
the parents who live in frederick and have one other child have 
asked that their names and details of the twins be withheld 
including their sex and whether dcotors will try to separate them 
i think the parents are still in shock said karen harrop 
university hospital spokeswoman it will be a couple of days 
before our physicians can say whether we can do anything for the 
babies 
kim said he did not perform a sonogram or ultrasound test which 
can detect multiple pregnancies physical abnormalities and 
determine fetal age because the mother did not want one 
in march 1982 siamese twins joined from the chest to the abdomen 
were successfully separated in a 10hour operation at johns hopkins 
hospital 
and 14 months ago hopkins made medical history when patrick and 
benjamin binder of ulm west germany became the first siamese twins 
ever to survive separation at the head

a damp breeze made for poor putting 
weather tuesday but soviet officials touring a golf course similar 
to one being built in their country said it made them feel right at 
home 
this is the reds visiting the greens said robert trent jones 
jr architect of both the sentryworld 18hole course here and the 
course just outside moscow 
the soviets signed an agreement with jones last june during the 
summit between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the five soviet officials touring the wisconsin course laughed as 
they rode in golf carts for the first time and tried their hand at 
putting a few balls 
then they studied both how the course is managed and the 
machinery used to groom it 
too many machines and cars is needed for decoration of the golf 
course said valentin maltsev vice president of techno export 
moscow as he toured the maintenance building where sentry insurance 
keeps about 100 pieces of machinery 
the soviets came to northern wisconsin to see the par72 golf 
course because it was built despite some of the same problems the 
site 35 kilometers west of moscow faces said ivan sergeev of the 
administration for services for the diplomatic corps like northern 
wisconsin the moscow site is relatively flat and forested and the 
trees must be removed and lakes built he said 
the climate in the area of moscow is almost exactly what it is 
here sergeev said through an interpreter 
the soviet course expected to open in 1991 will be the 
countrys first championship course and will be open six months a 
year he said 
in the winter it will not be open because it will be lying 
under a lot of snow sergeev said 
the soviet course will provide an opportunity for visitors and 
diplomats to play golf in moscow he said 
but sergeev said he hoped the soviet course will be a place to 
rest and not to do business on the golf course as is often done in 
the united states 
the quality of rest is a matter of opinion the soviet course 
will not have golf carts 
thats an american way the russian way we walk he said

potato seedlings treated with a genetically 
modified bacteria designed to protect plants from frost damage 
suffered onethird as much damage as unprotected plants a 
researcher reported tuesday 
two years of smallscale field tests proved the procedure to be 
safe and effective according to steven lindow associate professor 
of plant pathology at the university of california at berkeleys 
college of natural resources 
lindow was scheduled to report his findings tuesday at the annual 
meeting of the american phytopathological society in san diego 
similar research by other scientists has shown that genetically 
modified bacteria can protect strawberry plants from frost 
the minor genetic modification was designed to counter the effect 
of common bacteria whose structure triggers frost formation on 
plants at temperatures just below freezing lindow and an associate 
genetically modified a strain of the bacteria so it lacked the 
frostpromoting gene but was otherwise unchanged 
the modified bacteria was applied to potato seedlings before 
naturally occurring bacteria could gain hold monitoring showed that 
the modified bacteria could not be detected beyond the experiments 
93foot buffer zone 
lindows field tests were delayed for almost four years because 
of safety concerns about outdoor experiments using genetically 
engineered organisms 
but lindow said the genetically altered bacteria wont thrive 
outside of the treated area because other bacteria are established 
there 
established frostfighting methods such as sprinklers and wind 
machines can be more effective but they work in a narrower 
temperature range and are more expensive to administer than the 
bacteria strategy lindow said

plo chief yasser arafat said tuesday it 
was up to the united states to make the next move toward middle east 
peace now that the palestinians have formed an independent state 
that implicitly recognizes israel 
the ball is now in the american court arafat said a few 
hours after the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile solemnly proclaimed palestinian independence in 
a ceremony early tuesday 
the declaration accepted un security council resolution 242 
which implicitly recognizes israel when it refers to the right of 
all countries in the region to live within secure and recognized 
borders 
the proclamation topped the list of issues taken up during the 
councils fourday special session in algeria which ended tuesday 
the 450member council also voted to form a provisional government 
at a future date and pledged to restrict guerrilla operations to 
military targets in israelioccupied territories 
the councils move largely symbolic and clearly aimed at 
capitalizing on the 11monthold palestinian uprising in 
israelioccupied lands sought to remove obstacles to us and 
israeli dealings with the palestine liberation organization 
referring to the intefadeh or uprising arafat told a news 
conference it is true that this is the intefadeh session of the 
council but it also could be the session of peace with the us 
administration and israel 
the plo chief said the council had given him a mandate to pursue 
a political settlement but if we are met with a rebuff he 
said only god knows the outcome 
let it also be clear i can always come back to our council 
and declare that moderation does not pay arafat said 
israel immediately rejected arafats declaration calling it 
double talk and denying that it recognized israel or truly 
renounced terrorism 
they mentioned rejection of terrorism outside israel but they 
did not denounce terrorism inside israel said foreign ministry 
spokesman alon liel so we still see the plo as a terror 
organization and the government decision not to negotiate with the 
plo stands 
washington also rejected the move saying that the middle east 
conflict had to be resolved by negotiations not a unilateral act on 
either side 
the united states has demanded the plo recognize israel and 
renounce terrorism before there could be any dealings 
the declaration which arafat read out at a seaside conference 
center west of the algerian capital did not specifically describe 
the new states borders but officials said it was clear the 
palestinian territory referred to was the west bank and gaza 
captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
we are obviously talking about land occupied in 1967 said 
nabil shaath head of the political committee that drafted the 
document of accepting resolution 242 he said its a bitter 
pill but we had to swallow it 
resolution 242 also calls on israel to withdraw from territories 
it captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war in 
the past the plo has refused to accept the resolution because it 
deals with the future of palestinians as merely a refegee problem 
late in the afternoon the plo announced its state had been 
recognized by 12 countries most arab and moslem plo supporters 
arafat accompanied by other plo officials laid the cornerstone for 
the first embassy of the palestinian state in a suburb of algiers 
the algerian government donated the land 
a member of the plos political department who asked not to be 
named said that aside from waiting for the united states to act the 
organization also so plans to launch another diplomatic offensive in 
europe and elsewhere 
we are expecting a new declaration from the european economic 
community said the official adding that discussions would be 
aimed particularly at greece and spain greece is the current 
president and spain steps in next in the rotating common market 
presidency 
its a new era in palestinian political thinking said the 
official in the past we talked about dreams now we are talking 
about realities

defense secretary frank c carlucci warning 
that americas security in the next century will depend upon 
advanced research being performed now said tuesday he wanted to 
increase by 300 million the pentagons support of independent 
corporate research 
carlucci in a speech at american university said he had been 
reviewing pentagon spending on independent research and 
development and that despite the national budget deficit could 
not support cuts in such spending 
this independent rampd program allows corporations full 
flexibility in determining what research and development to conduct 
while at the same time enabling the defense department to identify 
emerging technologies judged to have important defense 
applications carlucci said 
in 1987 the defense department reimbursed contractors for 36 
billion of the more than 7 billion they spent on irampd as a measure 
of this programs effectiveness i want to announce today that i 
will submit a 1990 budget request to the president allotting an 
additional 300 million to underwrite independent rampd 
carlucci described the move as one of four key steps to 
maintaining americas technological lead over the soviet union in 
military weaponry 
the other steps include maintaining effective controls against 
technology theft and espionage more cooperation with western allies 
who also are pushing back technological frontiers and supporting a 
healthy defense industrial base of pentagon contractors 
in his speech a copy of which was released in advance at the 
pentagon carlucci expressed optimism about each of the four steps 
except one the us industrial base 
this i am sorry to say is at present a dark cloud on the 
strategic horizon he said 
there are unmistakable signs that right now our defense 
industrial base is shrinking the result of a defense budgeting 
process and acquisition system that combine chronic instability and 
excessive regulation with predictable results 
we need to put an end to this erosion streamline and stabilize 
the system and create a more hospitable climate for technological 
innovation and growth 
carlucci is expected to step down in january when vice president 
george bush is inaugurated as president and thus the fate of his 
recommendation for increased research spending remains unclear 
however the pentagon had been widely rumored in recent months to 
be considering a cut in such funding and thus carluccis endorsement 
of an actual increase might carry great weight with his successor 
earlier in his speech tuesday delivered before the kennedy 
political union at the university carlucci asserted technology had 
made it possible for the united states to meet its national 
security needs without militarizing society 
rather than engaging in a contest to match potential 
adversaries soldier for soldier ship for ship or tank for tank we 
have sought to turn our technological superiority to our strategic 
advantage to a large extent weve offset quantity with quality

families of 28 men killed in the 
lambiance plaza building collapse and the 16 men who were injured 
will share 30 million under a tentative 41 million settlement of 
all lawsuits a judge said tuesday 
legal experts said the mediation process that led to the 
agreement may have averted years of litigation and was unique 
because of the number of lawsuits and potential lawsuits involved 
us district judge robert c zampano said he and a state 
superior court judge who together mediated talks leading to the 
settlement scheduled a hearing for final approval of the agreement 
for dec 1 
if all parties sign it would end all litigation from the 
collapse of the halffinished apartment building in bridgeport on 
april 23 1987 
i think we have a global settlement of all aspects of the 
lambiance building collapse and i feel very very good zampano 
said all 40 defendants and potential defendants contributed to 
the settlement which speaks of extraordinary cooperation 
no amount of money is going to replace what those people lost 
the only good thing is that it was done speedily said richard 
bieder lead counsel for the plaintiffs 
the proposed settlement didnt resolve the question of who was to 
blame although federal investigators placed the primary blame for 
the accident on three contractors 
lawyers for all sides are reviewing documents drafted to 
implement the settlement federal state and probate judges along 
with two members of the state workers compensation commission also 
will be asked to approve it zampano said 
under the settlement the children of the men who died will 
receive a weekly income until they are 30 years old and money for 
college if they choose to go zampano said the mediators wanted 
them to be taken care of just as if their fathers had lived he 
said 
widows will receive income from annuities until they are 62 to 65 
years old when they will be eligible for social security zampano 
said 
individual payments to victims and their heirs werent released 
several legal experts commended the mediation process zampano and 
state judge frank s meadow organized 
there were 92 attorneys involved representing victims families 
and workers 40 companies involved in the project the city of 
bridgeport and state and federal agencies 
its working concurrently to wrap the whole thing up in one 
package that seems to me to be quite unusual and commendable said 
jl pottenger adjunct professor of law at yale law school 
what is unusual is the size and scope of this case and the 
potential number of parties and complexity of it said james 
stapleton president of the connecticut bar association and a 
stamford attorney 
zampano and meadow determined how much each victim should receive 
by considering such factors as the age and health of the deceased or 
injured past wage history earning capacity age and income of 
heirs severity and degree of personal injuries and life expectancy 
in addition to the 30 million for the workers and their 
families the proposed settlement provides 1125 million to settle 
other claims including those of contractors and insurance carriers 
against one another and to be used as reserve funds 
a portion of the 30 million would be invested in annuities 
which are expected to generate an additional 20 million 
the tentative settlement also includes provisions for the 
rebuilding of lambiance plaza and the distribution to the 
plaintiffs of some profits from the building for an undetermined 
number of years 
still unresolved are 51 million in proposed federal fines 
against five companies that worked on the project and accusations 
that they violated federal safety rules 
terry mikelson an osha spokesman in washington dc said i 
can confirm that osha is in discussion with the court on a possible 
settlement there is no agreement at this point 
zampano and meadow said in their report that if osha demands full 
payment of fines from the five companies it could affect 
seriously the contributions to the settlement fund

in asking nicholas brady to stay on as treasury 
secretary george bush has turned again to a longtime personal 
friend to staff a key cabinet post 
last week bush announced as his first cabinet appointment his 
choice of james a baker iii to be secretary of state 
while baker is the better known because of his service with bush 
in the reagan administration brady is just as close to the 
presidentelect 
earlier this year brady baker and another close bush friend 
houston oil millionaire robert a mosbacher sr were dubbed the big 
three in the bush presidential campaign the longtime friends whose 
counsel bush listened to most often 
there is speculation that mosbacher may become commerce secretary 
with bushs support brady 58 got the nod from president reagan 
to become treasury secretary when baker announced in august that he 
was leaving the administration to formally become chairman of the 
bush presidential campaign brady was sworn in as the nations 68th 
treasury secretary on sept 15 
in his first two months brady has adopted a lowkey approach 
which emphasized keeping the economy on track and avoiding any 
controversy that might stir up financial markets before the nov 8 
election 
with the election over brady is expected to move just as 
cautiously many are looking for baker to continue to play a major 
role in setting the economic as well as the foreign policy course 
for the new administration 
many of bakers major economic initiatives at treasury were in 
the foreign policy area it was baker who three years ago launched 
an initiative with major us allies to coordinate economic policies 
in an effort to lower americas huge foreigntrade deficit 
that coordination had at its heart a sharp devaluation in the 
value of the dollar to stem a flood of foreign products into the 
country by making them more expensive while reducing the cost of 
american products on overseas markets 
while the dollar devaluation has shown results america and its 
allies are now concerned that financial markets might push the 
dollar down too far in value raising the specter of higher interest 
rates and a possible recession in this country 
even the mention last week by sometime bush economic adviser 
martin feldstein that the dollar needed to drop further to cure 
americas trade problems was enough to send the greenback and the 
stock market plunging 
brady issued a statement monday that the administration was not 
abandoning its committment to stabilize the value of the dollar and 
his comments along with those of bush during a beachside interview 
calmed the markets experts are looking for no change from the baker 
policy in this area 
on another international matter brady has voiced support for 
bakers plan to revitalize lending to third world countries 
however the effort has fallen far short of expectations and many 
believe that japan france and other countries will force the bush 
administration to acknowledge next year that more needs to be done 
in the area of debt forgiveness 
events are also likely to force brady to quickly address the 
savings and loan crisis where estimates of the cost of bailing out 
hundreds of insolvent institutions have skyrocketed to between 50 
billion and 100 billion brady has already appointed a treasury 
task force to study the problem 
another treasury study group is looking at the capital gains tax 
and this too is likely to be a priority in the new administration 
bush campaigned on a pledge to cut the capital gains tax which 
is levied on profits from the sale of stocks real estate and other 
investments the top rate is 33 percent the same as for salary 
income and bush proposed cutting it to 15 percent prompting the 
charge from democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis that 
such a cut represented a giveaway to the rich 
brady has discussed capital gains taxreduction proposals with 
top aides and reportedly favors the idea of a slidingscale tax 
that would allow the rate to decline the longer the asset had been 
held 
brady is a millionaire whose upbringing and ivy league education 
closely resemble those of bush 
he entered yale one year after bush graduated he went on to get 
a masters degree in business at harvard and then became an 
investment banker in new york spending an entire career since 1954 
at dillon read amp co where he was known as a rainmaker someone 
who could attract big clients to the firm 
brady was appointed to serve out the senate term of new jersey 
democrat harrison a williams jr who resigned in march 1982 
following his conviction in the abscam scandal 
he did not seek election to the post but he remained active 
politically as a troubleshooter for the reagan administration 
serving in 1983 on three different advisory commissions on the mx 
missile central america and foreign aid 
when the stock market suffered its record plunge last year 
reagan again turned to brady giving him the job of heading a white 
house panel that investigated the market meltdown 
he and the other task force members had only 60 days to figure 
out what went wrong and recommend ways to fix it one of the first 
reports written on the crash the brady report is still widely 
regarded as the best 
the administration however almost immediately distanced itself 
from bradys main recommendation a call for the federal reserve to 
coordinate regulation of financial markets 
but during his confirmation hearing in september brady hewed to 
the administrations freemarket line saying he was satisfied with 
the administrations approach even though his own proposals were 
much tougher 
brady was born in new york city in 1930 and grew up on a large 
estate in far hills nj his familys wealth gave him a substantial 
start in business 
his grandfather who had arrived from ireland during the mid19th 
century potato famine started several electric utilities that later 
became part of the consolidated edison co of new york 
bradys close friendship with bush dates back to the early 1970s 
when the two men became better acquainted through bushs brother 
jonathan when bush left the cia in 1976 brady tried to recuit him 
as a partner at dillon read but bush turned down his friends offer

amnesty international filed a brief with the 
indiana supreme court on tuesday in an effort to prevent the 
execution of paula cooper who was 15 when she was convicted of 
killing a 78yearold bible teacher 
the human rights watchdog group argued in its friend of the 
court brief that putting cooper to death would violate 
internationally recognized standards of law against executing people 
who were younger than 18 at the time of their crime 
cooper was convicted in 1985 of killing ruth pelke 
michael sutherlin coordinator of the indiana lawyers who belong 
to amnesty international said indianas recently revised death 
penalty statute which raised from 10 to 16 the age at which a 
person could be executed should be applied to the cooper case 
any beneficial change in the law that would make punishment 
more lenient should be applied retroactively said sutherlin 
ten juvenile females have been executed in indiana since 1676 
the last in 1912 sutherlin said 
surely we have become a more civilized nation since 1912 he 
said 
the cooper case is in the first stage of review by the state 
supreme court if appeals through the state courts fail to overturn 
her sentence she could pursue an appeal through the federal courts 
no execution date has been set for cooper now an inmate at the 
indiana womens prison in indianapolis

no change will be made in the announced 
requirement that farmers will have to idle 10 percent of their feed 
grain base acreage to qualify for price supports and other benefits 
next year the agriculture department said tuesday 
deputy secretary peter c myers said the 10 percent acreage 
reduction program or arp for 1989 was announced on sept 30 but 
the law also authorizes further adjustments by nov 15 if the 
prospective total supply of corn and other feed grains changes 
significantly 
the 10 percent reduction applies to 1989 crops of corn sorghum 
and barley which carried a 20 percent arp this year the arp for 
oats will be 5 percent unchanged from 1988

there is convincing evidence pakistan has 
finally developed atomic weapons leading to the possibility of a 
nuclear arms race with its longtime enemy india according to a 
study published tuesday 
pakistan has not tested any atomic weapons and continues to deny 
it has built them a public stance similar to three other countries 
which are also believed to have nuclear weapons the study said the 
others are india israel and south africa 
between 1986 and 1988 after a decade of slow advances 
pakistan appears to have become the fourth country to join this 
group of unannounced de facto nuclear powers said the report by 
the carnegie endowment for international peace 
the review was the fourth such recent survey published by the 
nonprofit group which specializes in national security issues it 
was written by leonard s spector author of the previous reports 
spector formerly worked on nonproliferation issues at the nuclear 
regulatory commission and the senate energy and natural resources 
nonproliferation subcommittee 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said he had no 
comment on the findings 
five nations have said they have nuclear weapons the united 
states the soviet union china great britain and france india 
exploded a single atomic device in 1974 but said it was a 
nonmilitary explosion 
efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons generally have 
focused on the middle east and south asia the report noted 
pakistan and india are the chief source of concern since the two 
countries have fought three wars in the 41 years since they were 
created by the separation of colonial india from britain 
the evidence that pakistan has the bomb includes production of 
highly enriched uranium a key component of atomic weapons and 
european reports of a previously clandestine effort by pakistan 
officials to smuggle sophisticated nuclear components out of west 
germany the report said 
pakistan may be capable of producing two to four atomic weapons 
spector said india responded to this challenge by continuing the 
quiet expansion of its nuclear weapons capabilities which far 
overshadow pakistans while maintaining an ambiguous public stance 
concerning its nuclear intentions 
a future war between the two enemies could be devastating the 
report said it has been estimated that a dozen nuclear weapons 
used against military targets in india or pakistan could cause over 
a million casualties 
the pakistani program is a dilemma for the united states spector 
said noting pakistan is a prime recipient of us aid at the same 
time us officials are pushing pakistan not to develop atomic 
weapons 
two years ago president reagan told congress that pakistan did 
not possess nuclear weapons a certification required by capitol 
hill before the us aid program could go ahead but in recent 
months us officials have been less direct in asserting that the 
pakistanis dont have atomic weapons 
presidentelect george bush has shown more of an interest in 
stopping the spread of atomic weapons in south asia spector said 
i think it may get more attention in a bush administration he 
said 
spector suggested us policy should be aimed at developing 
some sort of mechanism some kind of regional arrangement to 
bring india and pakistan into negotiations the concept is to find a 
way to persuade both antagonists to restrain themselves it will be 
difficult 
the report also said israel has a substantial undeclared 
nuclear arsenal which includes more sophisticated weapons than 
previously thought specter explained that there are indications the 
israelis have some bombs based on thermonuclear fusion 
principles which are more powerful than fission weapons 
the israelis have never admitted possessing nuclear weapons

fbi agents in new york city have been given a 
25 percent pay increase more than six times the raise for agents 
elsewhere in an effort to solve a staffing crisis there 
as part of the same fiveyear demonstration project to 
entice agents and staffers to work in new york those who agree to 
move to the nations largest city for specified periods also will 
receive lumpsum bonuses of 20000 
the pay increases were set up by the intelligence authorization 
act for fiscal 1989 which was signed into law sept 29 
the fbi made no public announcement when the project became law 
even though it had been trying for several years to find a mechanism 
to raise salaries in the new york field office 
some 300 jobs are vacant because bureau pay has not kept pace 
with the citys cost of living particularly housing the 
resignation rate in the field office had been running at about 4 
percent annually 
so while fbi agents elsewhere in america receive an average base 
salary of 39000 a year new york agents at that level got raises 
to 48750 on oct 23 fbi spokesman gregory jones said monday fbi 
agents and staffers in other offices will receive the same 41 
percent raise that other federal workers will get on jan 1 
jones said it was too soon to tell whether the lumpsum offer had 
attracted any volunteers to work in new york 
fbi director william sessions said last week he thought the pay 
increase would solve the problem in the new york office the fbis 
largest with more than 1200 agents and 900 support workers the 
pay boost affects all agents and about twothirds of the support 
staff namely those workers who are subject to mandatory transfers 
according to the law

a nurses aide accused of draining 50000 
from an 84yearold patients bank accounts and of neglect that may 
have contributed to his death will keep the money and avoid trial 
because prosecutors say they have no case 
seminolebrevard state attorney norman wolfinger said monday he

withdrew 38000 she withdrew 6000 the next day sheriffs 
reports show detectives say a total of 91000 is missing from

a judge tuesday revoked the bail of 
eight defendants as he prepared to deliver the verdict in a 
threeyear trial of the leaders of south africas biggest 
antiapartheid group 
the 19 black defendants who belong to the banned united 
democratic front have pleaded innocent to charges of treason 
terrorism murder and subversion related to an allegation that they 
sought to promote violence in order to make south africa 
ungovernable 
supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst began delivering a 
summary of the trial and is expected to announce the verdicts in two 
or three days 
sixteen of the 19 black defendants had been granted bail during 
the trial van dijkhorst did not explain why he revoked the bail of 
only eight defendants the three most prominent defendants senior 
leaders of the united democratic front have been denied bail and 
have spent 40 months in jail they are popo molefe 36 who was the 
united democratic fronts national secretary terror lekota 40 who 
was its publicity secretary and moses chikane 40 who was 
secretary of its transvaal province branch 
the united democratic front south africas largest opposition 
group was founded in 1983 and includes more than 600 antiapartheid 
groups with about 2 million members it was banned in february

in black townships south of johannesburg in september 1984 that were 
the start of two years of nationwide unrest in which more than 2500 
people were killed 
treason and murder carry a maximum penalty of death 
van dijkhorst who has presided over the nonjury trial since it 
began in june 1985 has sole responsibility for the verdict and 
sentencing he was initially assisted by two lay experts but one 
was dismissed because he had signed a petition supported by the 
united democratic front opposing constitutional changes that 
excluded blacks from parliament 
van dijkhorst said tuesday the defendants were not being 
prosecuted for their political views he said it was possible to 
commit treason even if one believed a new government would serve the 
interests of a majority of the people 
under south africas policy of apartheid the 26 million blacks 
have no voice in national affairs which are controlled by the 5 
million whites

a special commission created to identify 
unneeded military bases for closure met a congressional deadline on 
tuesday for describing its evaluation process but dropped no 
hints about individual bases that might end up on its hit list 
the commission on base realignment and closure in a 2page 
statement outlined a fivestep process for the evaluation of 
major military installations within the united states its 
territories commonwealths and possessions 
were going to be running everything under the microscope and 
this simply explains how said jim abbee a spokesman for the 
panel 
you cant make any inference from this that any base is or is 
not likely to be recommended for closure youll have to wait until 
dec 31 for that 
legislation signed by president reagan last month authorized the 
12member citizens commission to review the nations military bases 
and to decide which are outmoded and can be closed at a projected 
annual savings of 2 billion to 5 billion 
the panel has until dec 31 to report its findings to defense 
secretary frank c carlucci who may forward the list to congress if 
he wishes should he decide to do so congress can veto the entire 
list but cannot act to protect individual bases as it often has in 
the past 
the allornothing legal procedure is viewed as offering the 
best chance in more than a decade to actually close unneeded 
military bases over the objection of local congressmen 
according to tuesdays statement the commission is first 
grouping together by mission the military facilities across the 
country for example all army depots all air force fighter bases 
all navy submarine ports 
the second step will evaluate bases within the category to 
determine whether additional mission capacity exists beyond current 
future or mobilization requirements the panel added 
after reviewing overall capacity the commission said it would 
begin evaluating each individual base on five factors mission 
suitability including geographical environment and ease of 
deployment the physical facilities in place the quality of those 
facilities the quality of life for personnel such as housing and 
community support 
the bases that rank at the bottom of each mission list will 
then be considered for closure by determining if other bases higher 
on the list are in a position to become receiving bases the 
panel added 
the combination of possible realignments and the closing of the 
base will be considered as a package for cost evaluation the 
statement says 
in the final step the package of a closing base and a 
receiving base will be reviewed for environmental concerns such as 
hazardous waste problems and for socioeconomic impact in the form 
of evaluation of the potential closures impact on local 
employment 
abbee said the commission is in the midst of applying the 
procedure to 871 large military facilities he declined to predict 
how many of them might end up on the recommended closure list

a governmentsponsored panel of diverging 
interests on tuesday recommended a major overhaul of wetlands 
protection with states assuming responsibility for a national goal 
of creating more wetlands than are being destroyed 
the national wetlands policy forum convened by the conservation 
foundation at the request of the environmental protection agency 
said the proposed goal of ending the conversion of wetlands to other 
uses did not mean every single parcel of marshy ground would have to 
be preserved but enough wetlands should be created or restored to 
outweigh the losses 
the federal government has hundreds of wetlands rules but 
there is no guiding principle no overriding goal said new jersey 
gov thomas h kean who served as chairman of the forum the 
result is confusion equal to rush hour on the beltway 
the 20member forum embraced representatives of builders 
industry environmental groups state and local governments and 
federal agencies its recommendations were presented as a consensus 
package and kean and others said the group would oppose attempts to 
pick out particular measures from the more than 100 recommendations 
to support or oppose 
about half the 200 million acres of marshes and bogs fens 
swamps and other wetlands that were present in the lower 48 states 
when european settlement began have been converted to other uses 
farms housing developments shopping centers airports and 
everything else that humans do 
in recent decades though environmental benefits of wetlands 
have been recognized increasingly storage of flood water cleansing 
of pollution protection of wildlife spawning and nursing of 60 
percent to 90 percent of the nations commercial fish catch 
recharging groundwater and controlling erosion 
a major study in the 1970s estimated that losses over the two 
previous decades had proceeded at 400000 acres half the size of 
rhode island to 500000 acres per year no one knows if that still 
holds true epa uses 350000 acres and a recent congressional study 
used 275000 acres 
among major recommendations of the forum 
a national agricultural wetlands reserve which would pay farmers 
to transfer land or easements to wetlands preservation trusts these 
trusts would operate somewhat like the nature conservancy and other 
private groups to hold reserved land the reserve should aim to 
protect 5 million existing acres and restore half as much the forum 
said 
each state should enact wetlands protection plans which if 
approved by epa would qualify the state to take over many though 
not all of epas wetlands protection jobs only michigan has taken 
over epa wetland regulation tasks so far 
states with approved programs might be able to issue regional 
general permits which would allow the conversion of a limited amount 
of ecologically low value wetland areas in exchange for full 
compensatory mitigation 
federal activities would have to be consistent with approved 
state plans just as they now must be in states with approved 
coastal zone management plans 
regulatory authorities should take any necessary action 
including amending existing regulations to prevent the willful 
alteration of wetland characteristics to circumvent regulatory 
jurisdictions 
make the definitions of wetlands uniform some 50 different 
definitions of wetlands are in use throughout the federal government 
a major effort to identify public lands where wetlands could be 
restored with priority attention to the louisiana coasts 
extremely high wetlands losses from erosion and subsidence 
largely as a result of government flood control and other water 
resource projects 
the report noted the fact that the protection of wetlands 
makes good economic as well as environmental sense for society but 
not necessarily for the individual owning them is central to much of 
the conflict over wetlands protection policies and a conservative 
advocacy group singled out that point as one weakness 
property owners have a right to develop their property said 
robin l rivett of the pacific legal foundation of sacramento 
calif adding that there is no mention in this report of the 
fifth amendment problem 
he referred to court rulings that some land use regulations can 
be so burdensome as to amount to a taking of property for public 
use that requires compensation to the owner under the constitutions 
fifth amendment 
tom hookano of the foundation said the group believes major 
wetlands need protection but he said the report does not go beyond 
recommendations of the regulatory task force chaired by vice 
president george bush in 1982 
its irresponsible to recommend a program without a price 
tag he said arguing that the agricultural wetlands reserve could 
cost billions of dollars 
the national audubon society and the national wildlife 
federation whose leaders took part in the study endorsed the 
report but one environmental group that did not participate said it 
had serious concerns about delegating authority to the states 
because state and local governments were more vulnerable to pressure 
from development interests than the federal government 
dave malakoff of friends of the earth said were suspicious of 
state control were not sure the states have the resources to 
regulate in this area

slightly radioactive water spilled at 
the oyster creek nuclear plant tuesday forcing officials to declare 
the lowest of four emergency categories 
nobody was contaminated and no injuries were reported said plant 
spokesman sandy polon 
the water spilled onto a reactor floor when a seal that is 
normally used to cap the flow failed during maintenance polon said 
about six employees were working on the device when the water 
spilled 
the accident prompted declaration of an unusual event 
because water flow exceeded the normal 25 gallons per minute polon 
said estimating the flow at between 25 and 50 gallons per minute 
the declaration the lowest of four emergency categories began 
at 240 am and ended at 430 am polon said 
about 10000 gallons of water were collected before repairs were 
completed polon said the water went into the plants drainage 
system where it was recirculated 
oyster creek has been shut down since sept 29 for maintenance 
and refueling there is no fuel in the reactor

thousands of peasants students 
and workers marched through the capital tuesday to demand that the 
usbacked government negotiate with leftist rebels to end the 
9yearold civil war 
the march coincided with a meeting of the general assembly of the 
organization of american states peace in central america is among 
the topics being discussed during the weeklong meeting of delegates 
from 31 nations 
an estimated 15000 to 20000 people marched in the procession 
that stretched more than 2 miles protesters walked from the citys 
eastern edge to the hotel where the oas meeting is being held in 
western san salvador 
the struggle for peace is the duty of all chanted the 
marchers beneath hundreds of blueandwhite salvadoran flags white 
flags symbolyzing peace and banners with slogans demanding an end to 
the bloodshed 
organizers of the event including dozens of antigovernment 
labor peasant student church and human rights organizations 
called it the great march for peace and a political solution to 
the conflict 
participants represented a crosssection of salvadoran society 
with strawhatted sandaled peasants walking alongside factory 
workers and neatly attired whitecollar workers 
the salvadoran armed forces battling a marxistled insurgency 
had said the march was part of a guerrilla plan to disrupt the 
capital during the oas meeting the army also accused organizers of 
seeking to provoke government forces 
but the march was peaceful as both armed forces and demonstrators 
apparently made efforts to avoid violence 
troops and police took up positions a few blocks from the 
sheraton hotel where the oas is meeting to prevent the marchers 
from reaching the general assembly site instead demonstrators 
gathered at a nearby traffic circle where they sang songs and 
listened to speeches 
the war has killed an estimated 65000 people most of them 
civilians 
the centrist government of president jose napoleon duarte demands 
that the guerrillas lay down their arms and incorporate themselves 
into the democratic process 
the guerrillas and their civilian political supporters contend 
duartes government is a facade for military domination and that 
elections have been a farce 
the guerrillas last week declared a unilateral truce for the 
duration of the oas meeting and renewed a call for negotiations with 
the government 
the army rejected the move as propaganda and on tuesday the 
armed forces press office said the rebels violated their ceasefire 
by shooting at government forces 
in a broadcast over their clandestine radio venceremos the 
rebels charged the army with provocation and said any fighting 
was the result of army offensive action 
three rounds of governmentrebel negotiations in recent years 
have been fruitless 
the government has not demonstrated sincerity in previous 
negotiations said an episcopal church worker taking part in the 
march but negotiation is the only way by pursuing military 
means there will only be more dead 
he declined to be identified activists in el salvador are 
reluctant to be quoted by name in the early 1980s soldiers and 
death squads linked to the military were blamed for the kidnap and 
murder of thousands of suspected leftists 
duarte in his address monday to oas delegates said the 
guerrillas expressed desire to resume negotiations was merely 
tactical he accused the rebels of pursuing a strategic 
maneuver to destroy democracy through democracys own liberties

with aids increasingly striking women those 
women at highest risk of exposure should make extradordinary efforts 
to avoid contracting the deadly disease even if that means possible 
abandonment physical harm or never having children a private study 
said tuesday 
the report from the womens research amp education institution 
the american woman 19881989 noted that aids is growing faster 
among women than among men or children 
figures from the federal centers for disease control show the 
number of aids cases rose 1061 percent for women from 1987 to 1988 
495 percent for children and 314 percent for men 
to combat this rapid increase the new report a compilation of 
existing studies said programs aimed at educating those most at 
risk are imperative even if the consequence of knowledge is the 
serious disruption of lives 
the study said those most at risk are intravenous drug users and 
sexual partners of male intravenous drug users and bisexual men 
yet many of these vulnerable women the report said dont know 
the danger they are in because they do not realize that the behavior 
of their sex partners puts them at high risk of contracting aids or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
and some women trying to avoid contracting aids face additional 
problems 
for a woman to take the steps necessary to avoid sexual and 
perinatal transmission of aids may mean risking rejection 
abandonment even physical harm at the hands of her partner and the 
disruption of sexual andor family relationships the report 
said in some cases it may mean the decision not to have 
children 
to educate these women the report said they often must first be 
persuaded that their lives are worth saving and that it is within 
their power to prevent the deadly disease from infecting them 
only when these women who often feel helpless and depressed over 
their lives believe their actions will make a difference can 
traditional aidseducation programs have a real impact the report 
said 
the cdc estimated that 2839 women were diagnosed with aids 
during the first 11 months of 1988 compared with 1377 for the same 
period a year earlier for men the comparable numbers were 24538 
and 18674 for children 474 and 317 
worse than the numbers themselves the report noted was an 
assessment by the cdc that there are 50 times to 80 times as many 
women who are infected with the precusor virus to aids as have been 
diagnosed with the disease itself 
the 443page book which addresses issues ranging from the 
presence of women in politics to womens progress in law 
enforcement was prepared as a challenge to the new administration 
of presidentelect george bush 
sara e rix the reports editor said she was encouraged by 
bushs vision of a kinder gentler nation 
he can change the dream into reality by supporting the needs of 
women rix told a news conference 
one area needing change the report said is the quality of 
health care offered women with limited choices 
the report said that a country as prosperous and ingenious as 
this one is should not tolerate the great disparities that exist 
between men and women between the poor and the nonpoor and 
between whites and minorities in something so vital and basic as 
health care 
the report also said 
of the 37 million americans without health insurance women are 
most vulnerable 
the poverty rate is higher among women especially older women 
and they must rely on inadequate public programs 
life expectancy for women has increased rapidly from 731 years 
for females born in 1960 to 782 years for women born in 1985 
the book was published by ww norton for the institute which is 
a nonpartisan research arm of the congressional caucus for womens 
issues

palestinian refugees outside the 
israelioccupied territories welcomed the plo declaration of a new 
state tuesday but some criticized the implied recognition of israel 
im as happy as if i had won millions of dinars said 
23yearold ahmed salhi whose family fled to the alhussein refugee 
camp in amman from lydda in what is now israel 
in abu dhabi a persian gulf emirate teacher irtifaa gameel 
khateeb said its lovely to hear the term palestinian state 
but the palestinian is still being beaten up in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
more than 300 palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded 
since an uprising against israeli occupation began in the occupied 
lands dec 8 1987 
one of more than 300000 palestinians who live in kuwait 
economist tewfik abdellatif called the declaration a good 
political step that represents an embarrassment to israel and the 
united states they should now prove their good intentions 
he referred to the us refusal to deal with the palestine 
liberation organization until it endorsed un security council 
resolution 242 which implies acceptance of israel and renounced 
terrorism 
the palestine national council meeting in algiers proclaimed a 
palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital and endorsed the 
un resolution while stressing palestinian rights to 
selfdetermination 
it also said guerrilla actions against israel would be limited to 
military targets in the occupied territories where the palestinian 
state presumably would be established the council serves as the plo 
legislature 
some pessimism was evident 
i think the americans will not recognize the plo regardless of 
what concessions we extend said businessman mohammed hassan in 
kuwait they will now say what the plo did is inadequate we want 
more 
a dentist at the alhussein camp bassam khadra said as a 
political step it means the recognition of israel and we reject 
that his family is from safad in what is now israel 
in damascus syria palestinian groups opposed to plo chief 
yasser arafat said the declaration was dangerous and threatened 
the unity of palestinians involved in the uprising 
in the jebel hussein district of amman saadi dabbour a 
physician from a safad family served palestinian sweets to visitors 
at his clinic to celebrate the algiers announcement 
dabbour said he was full of happiness i have been waiting 
for this for four decades 
asked about recognizing israel he said it is an evil that we 
cannot avoid 
abdulmunim subeihi a butcher in the alhussein camp said his 
family fled lydda in 1948 and he will return someday 
i was prosecuted in jordan on charges of smuggling 
weapons to the west bank he said i will go back to 
palestine i am very happy there is something now i can depend 
on 
shukri ibrahim a taxi driver who came to ammans nuzha camp from 
jaffa in 1968 said all the people i drove today said they are 
celebrating the new beginning a bright one the palestinian state 
long live palestine 
about 26000 refugees are crowded into alhussein camp on the 
slope of a hill in the jordanian capital scores of children played 
in front of simple concrete houses along narrow dirt lanes that 
intersect the main paved road through the camp the main road was 
lined with stalls for the weekly vegetable market and customers 
crowded around them 
more than 100000 registered refugees live in five official camps 
in the amman area and at least 100000 more live in five camps in

meantime the agency said it has ended a fiveyear investigation 
into alleged powerbrake failure in gms 1980 xbody cars finding 
that no defect trend existed 
the allegations of a defect had been cited as contributing to a 
brake problem linked to 1417 accidents 18 deaths and 400 injuries 
nhtsa said 
a federal court after a lengthy trial refused to order a recall 
of 11 million 1980 xbody cars 
nhtsa opened its inquiry into the sundance and shadow vehicles a 
total of 345000 cars as an engineering analysis the second 
highest level of investigation 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said the company was 
cooperating with the investigation the manufacturer in a service 
bulletin on the problem earlier this year described the problem as 
a failure of the engine to return to a lower rate of idle if it were 
driven while cold 
in terms of ever feeling that youre out of control of the car 
and you cant stop it no it is just slightly higher than the 
idle normally would be when the engine is warm stewart said 
she said the company believes no braking problem is involved 
nhtsa also began seven lowerlevel investigations into alleged 
defects involving cars made by general motors corp ford motor co 
and two foreign manufacturers subaru and saab 
one involved three complaints of the wheel and hub assembly 
falling off 19861987 pontiac fieros because of metal fatigue 
the problem resulted in three accidents but no injuries 
according to unconfirmed reports received by nhtsa the preliminary 
evaluation involves 104000 vehicles 
gm the maker of the cars pledged to cooperate with the nhtsa 
investigation but spokesman john anderson added just because 
there is an investigation doesnt necessarily mean there is a 
defect 
nhtsa also opened preliminary evaluations into allegations that 
the powersteering pump on 1987 gm firebirds and camaros 
fractures causing a loss of power steering the investigation 
based on 10 complaints involves 250000 vehicles 
the bracket bolts holding the steering column on the 1988 ford

the reagan administration said tuesday there 
are positive elements in a new palestine liberation organization 
policy statement but it rejected a plo proclamation of an 
independent palestinian state 
state department spokesman charles redman said the status of 
territories under israeli occupation cannot be determined by 
unilateral acts of either side but only through a process of 
negotiations a declaration of independent palestinian statehood is 
such a unilateral act 
the statement early tuesday in algiers by the plos 
parliamentinexile the palestine national council did not specify 
the borders of the new territory but it presumably encompasses the 
west bank and gaza strip which have been under israeli control 
since 1967 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration sees positive elements to the pnc statement 
including its acceptance of un security council resolutions 242 
and 338 
these lay the groundwork for a comprehensive settlement to the 
arabisraeli conflict and implicitly recognize israels right to 
exist 
successive us administrations have conditioned the opening of a 
dialogue with the plo on its acceptance of those resolutions 
the administrations response left ambiguous whether it sees the 
new policy statement as representing a significant shift in the plo 
stance and whether it could provide the basis for a changed us 
policy 
presidentelect george bush told reporters that i think the 
jury is still out if indeed there is specific recognition of 
resolution 242 that would be a very important step forward and i 
have to wait until im sure that that is exactly whats taken place 
but it would be something that weve been encouraging for a long 
long time 
the plo declaration left open the possibility that the incoming 
administration may give high priority to the middle east during its 
early months in office bush himself said he already has talked with 
secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii about it and said 
obviously were going to be concerned about the middle east 
redman said the administration has not seen the final text but 
promised it would receive serious study 
our objective is a comprehensive peace redman said direct 
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process 
palestinian participation is required at every stage of 
negotiations all participants in the negotiations must renounce 
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted 
international basis of un security council resolutions 224 and 
338 
the plo declaration renounces terrorist activities against 
civilian targets but the administration insists that the plo must 
forswear all terrorist activities among other conditions 
the administration was more ambivalent in its attitude toward the 
outcome of the algiers meeting than was israel whose prime minister 
yitzhak shamir ruled out all negotiations with the plo because 
they are opposed to peace with israel 
fitzwater said it was not clear whether the plo initiative 
constituted an olive branch to israel 
reagan added to the confusion about future steps with his 
response to a question on whether the united states was ready to 
talk with the plo 
thats under consideration we do not know exactly what is in 
the agreement he said 
that statement went far beyond what his official spokesmen were 
willing to say but it was not clear whether reagan understood the 
question which a reporter shouted at him at the conclusion of a 
departure ceremony on the south lawn of the white house for visiting 
west german chancellor helmut kohl 
fitzwater quickly amended reagans remark by saying what he 
was referring to was the meeting of the palestine national council 
and the fact that we would have to consider and we are considering 
the results of those meetings but that we have reached no decisions 
on them 
meanwhile sen jesse helms rnc wrote a letter to president 
reagan urging him to withhold recognition of the pnc decisions and 
to encourage us allies to do the same 
the declaration falls short of the statutory standard set by 
congress for contacts with the plo helms said 
he said us policy since 1975 as well as a bill passed by 
congress several years ago states that the plo must expressly 
recognize israel the pnc decision does not do so helms added

negotiators reached tentative agreement tuesday 
on a plan that will bring namibian independence from south africa in 
early 1989 and a cuban troop withdrawal from angola over a 27month 
period us officials said 
the agreement was worked out during five days of negotiations in 
geneva involving officials from south africa cuba and angola it is 
subject to final approval by their respective governments 
us officials insisting on anonymity said current plans call 
for the formal agreement to be signed in early december the accord 
was mediated by us assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
the plan calls for implementation starting in february of a 
un security council resolution designed to end south africas 
73year rule over namibia africas last colony 
under the plan elections for namibias first independent 
government will be held in august and the new regime will take 
office in early 1990 the officials said 
a second part of the agreement envisions the withdrawal of 
twothirds of the more than 50000 cuban troops in angola during the 
oneyear period ending in december 1989 
the agreement also calls for the gradual redeployment of 
remaining cuban troops northward away from the namibian border and 
from the stronghold of anticommunist angolan rebels backed by the 
united states 
in geneva no details were disclosed but south africas chief 
negotiator neil van heerden said all parties have agreed to 
take a document home to their governments 
he said the document would be the basis for a final agreement 
if the parties accept it 
cuba first sent troops to angola in 1975 to help the fledgling 
independent government newly freed from portuguese colonial rule 
fend off military incursions from south africa which was concerned 
about communist penetration of the region 
with the exception of a residual force all the cubans will be 
back home by early 1991 under the timetable agreed to in geneva 
left unanswered is the fate of the usbacked rebel movement 
known by its portuguese initials unita 
south africa has been the principal supplier of the unita forces 
for years ferrying equipment across the namibian border to the 
rebel stronghold in southeast angola 
but with south africa apparently intending on removing its forces 
from namibia that country will no longer be able to continue its 
resupply operation because of logistical problems 
presidentelect george bush has said us support for unita will 
continue but american officials have indicated that the south 
african resupply role cannot be duplicated 
on the other hand the officials said that cuba has played an 
indispensable role in supporting the angolan army and that the 
removal of the cuban troops will shift the military balance in 
unitas favor 
crocker has sought to bring an end to angolas internal conflict 
by calling for national reconciliation negotiations between angolas 
marxist government and the unita rebels 
but the angolan government has rejected negotiations with unita 
calling instead on the rebels to lay down their arms and join in a 
national reconstruction effort

malaysia mauritania turkey and indonesia 
egypt the united arab emirates and morocco stopped short of

arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization and the 
palestine national council which acts as the plo legislature 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt read a statement to 
reporters saying the establishment of a palestinian state is an 
important step toward achievement of a peaceful settlement of the 
middle east crisis through agreement among all parties to the 
conflict 
only egypt among arab countries has signed a peace treaty with 
israel 
britains foreign office called the declaration premature 
norway said it was a step forward in the middle east peace process 
but that a state without territory could not be recognized and the 
netherlands described the declaration as no breakthrough 
in spain foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said the 
step of enormous importance will obligate the united states 
and europe to review their policy stand on the middle east peace 
process 
sten andersson swedens foreign minister said the decision

supporters their most dangerous aspect is that they threaten the 
unity of our people inside the occupied territories and deal a blow 
to the unity of the land palestine 
the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
said this is a black day in our history as they are trying to 
fool our people through declaring an illusion independence to cover 
their renouncing most of the palestinian territory 
jordans official news agency quoted prime minister zaid rifai as 
saying his country has always recognized the palestine liberation 
organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people and the pnc represents their will 
he said the kingdom will continue to support the plo in its 
efforts to insure the national rights of the palestinian people 
including their right to selfdetermination and the creation of 
their independent state on their national soil

president reagan set limited goals tuesday for 
his farewell meeting next month with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev us officials said the administration has proposed the 
session be held over lunch on dec 7 at new yorks metropolitan 
museum of art 
reagan said the meeting in which presidentelect george bush 
will participate will not be in the nature of a summit but mindful 
of gorbachevs escalation of the agenda at their meeting in iceland 
two years ago he said well just have to see what comes up 
at the session reagan plans to seek soviet confirmation that the 
fourpart agenda for superpower relations which included arms 
control and human rights would be carried over to the bush 
administration said us officials 
the two other agenda items for the four reagangorbachev summit 
meetings as well as the talks secretary of state george p shultz 
held with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze were 
regional conflicts such as the war in afghanistan and ussoviet 
bilateral problems 
reagan is likely to seek a reaffirmation from gorbachev of a 
soviet pledge to withdraw all soviet troops from afghanistan by feb 
15 said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the plans for the meeting at the manhattan art museum have not 
yet been approved by moscow the officials said 
they stressed they did not expect reagan and gorbachev to 
complete a new treaty scaling back us and soviet strategic nuclear 
weapons that will be left for the bush administration to pursue 
the officials said 
the meeting is to be held in conjunction with a speech by 
gorbachev to the un general assembly bush who takes office jan 
20 is already committed to pursuing a summit with gorbachev next 
year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the agenda had not 
been set shultz plans to fly immediately after the gorbachev 
session to a meeting with the foreign ministers of the north 
atlantic treaty organization in brussels dec 89 
gorbachev proposed the meeting with reagan and bush through 
soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin the envoy delivered a note to 
shultz on sunday from foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze a 
us official said 
the president told reporters he anticipated a brief 
gettogether with the soviet leader they have held four summits 
in the last three years and improved superpower relations the 
principal achievement was the treaty reagan and gorbachev signed 
last december in washington to abolish us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
reagan asked about seeing gorbachev again said thats not 
going to be anything in the nature of a summit meeting he 
acknowledged however that he had no way of speculating what 
proposals the soviet leader might offer 
other us officials said the agenda would be worked out in 
diplomatic exchanges between washington and moscow likewise the 
nature of the meeting said state department spokesman charles e 
redman 
before reagan and gorbachev met in reykjavik the capital of 
iceland in october 1986 us officials had limited expectations of 
their agenda but the two leaders proceeded to reach tentative 
judgments about wideranging reductions in their nuclear arsenals 
the summit broke up in a disagreement over reagans antimissile 
strategic defense initiative 
asked if the new york meeting could develop the same way reagan 
replied that depends on whether you are going by the public 
version of reykjavik or what actually happened there 
he did not elaborate and reporters quizzing reagan while he posed 
for pictures with visiting west german chancellor helmut kohl went 
on to other questions 
bush has already said he did not need a getacquainted meeting 
with gorbachev having met him during the soviet leaders visit to 
washington the presidentelect has said he would like to hold a 
summit meeting provided it held out promise of progress in any one 
of several areas including arms control and human rights 
but first bush said he would have james a baker iii his 
choice for secretary of state meet with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze and with nato foreign ministers 
what i want to see is progress bush said last wednesday 
ive never supported meetings just for the sake of having 
meetings 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
described the meeting as part of a continuation of the ussoviet 
political dialogue that we believe should continue without 
artificial pause 
at the white house fitzwater said the main purpose from the us 
standpoint was to ensure that the momentum and continuity of the 
arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the 
relationship between the general secretary and the new president of 
the united states 
i would not look to it as a meeting that would be settling 
things he said 
several major issues in the ussoviet relationship are on the 
brink of resolution 
these include a treaty that would reduce by 30 to 50 percent us 
and soviet longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines and 
arrangements for the withdrawal of more than 50000 cuban troops 
from angola 
also the soviets two weeks ago announced a suspension of their 
troop withdrawal from afghanistan while the two sides are 
maneuvering for position on a soviet drive to hold a conference in 
moscow on human rights 
announcing gorbachevs visit the soviet news agency tass said he 
would travel also to britain and cuba and set forth soviet views on 
problems of world development in his speech to the united nations 
reagan first met with gorbachev in geneva switzerland in 
november 1985 they held their second summit in 1986 in reykjavik 
then met in washington last december and in moscow may 29june 2 
at the end of the moscow summit reagan said the two leaders had 
established so deep a relationship they could get together and 
discuss world problems without the necessity of a planned 
agreement fitzwater said 
he said the new york meeting their last will reflect that 
relationship 
moreover the spokesman said this brief meeting will help 
smooth the transition from president to presidentelect it will 
ensure that the moment and continuity of the arms control talks are 
extended it will reaffirm the relations between the general 
secretary and the new president of the united states as we enter the 
decade of the 90s

federal investigators on tuesday called for an 
immediate review of air traffic control procedures in the northeast 
after finding that a string of errors allowed a commuter plane to 
fly alarmingly close to air force one last month 
the incident which had been reported previously without detail 
occurred oct 12 when air force one with president reagan aboard and 
a bar harbor airlines commuter plane flew within 500 feet vertically 
and 15 miles horizontally as both planes were preparing to descend 
to newark nj 
standard separation for aircraft is 1000 feet vertically and 
five miles horizontally at the time of the incident white house 
officials said the president was never in danger 
but the incident prompted a broad investigation by the national 
transportation safety board which said tuesday that numerous 
managerial operational and training deficiencies at four federal 
aviation administration facilities near washington at philadelphia 
and near new york were at fault 
these errors reflected a serious lack of effective management 
and quality assurance said the ntsb it called on the faa to 
conduct an independent investigation of air traffic control 
performance at the facilities involved similar to a probe recently 
concluded after a series of controller errors at chicago 
the board also said it was particularly concerned about its 
findings because the faa on a number of occasions dating back to 
l986 had investigated similar shortcomings at the facilities and 
indicated improvements had been made 
the seriousness and magnitude of the problems justifies the 
highest level of faa attention and action the five board members 
said in a letter to faa administrator allan mcartor 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the agency would have no immediate 
comment on the ntsb findings 
among the findings that raised the ntsbs concerns were 
the controller at the washington air traffic control center near 
leesburg va who was handling the bar harbor plane was never 
aware that air force one was in the same vicinity as the commuter in 
airspace between philadelphia and newark 
a senior controller who was handling air force one was not clear 
on airspace boundaries and allowed air force one to penetrate the 
washington center airspace handled by the controllers near leesburg 
a directive to hold up traffic into newark because of the 
impending arrival of air force one was misunderstood because the 
message was not specific regarding which route air force one was 
using 
two controllers who observed air force one and the commuter 
plane converging did not raise an alarm because they assumed there 
were plans already made to resolve the potential conflict 
an area supervisor involved indirectly in the incident was found 
to have been assigned to a position for which he was untrained and 
uncertified while another air traffic coordinator was given duties 
without receiving formal onthejob training or a briefing on his 
responsibilities 
the board said these and other shortcomings contributed 
directly or indirectly to this incident 
as a result the ntsb said a controller at the washington air 
route center gave the bar harbor commuter pilot permission to 
descend from 11000 feet to 7000 feet while another controller at 
the new york air traffic control center cleared air force one to 
descend from 11000 feet to 9000 feet 
both planes were converging toward roughly the same area 
the two planes were allowed to continue to converge until another 
controller noticed the two aircraft and directed the commuter to 
halt his descent at 10000 feet and directed it away from the reagan 
aircraft the safety board said 
at one point two other air traffic controllers whose primary 
responsibility was to monitor traffic flow realized there was a 
potential conflict when the radar targets representing air force 
one and the commuter plane were about 10 miles apart and at about 
the same altitude the investigators said 
but the two controllers who were not directly handling either of 
the planes did not initiate a warning because they believed 
that some type of separation standard was going to be achieved 
when the incident occurred reagan was on a campaign trip on 
behalf of vice president george bush he had spoken near 
philadelphia and was headed for newark for another appearance 
during the trip officials advised reporters of the incident but 
provided no details and emphasized that air force one was never in 
danger of a collision 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president was not 
aware of the incident until later faa officials said that the pilot 
of air force one had been advised that the bar harbor commuter plane 
was nearby and no evasive action was required 
bar harbor aircraft was flying as continental express flight 3494 
and carried 33 passengers and three crew members on a flight from 
baltimore to newark

the rightwing likud bloc asked the labor party 
tuesday to join a coalition government as junior partner but both 
sides indicated there were too many policy differences 
likud and labor which leans to the left spent four years as 
equal partners in a tenuous national unity coalition after 
indecisive elections in july 1984 
in parliamentary elections nov 1 prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs likud won 40 seats in the 120member knesset and labor led 
by foreign minister shimon peres got 39 
shamir has been negotiating with small rightwing and religious 
parties on monday president chaim herzog asked him to form a 
government 
during a 90minute meeting tuesday shamir said labor could join 
a government under his leadership only if it dropped its insistence 
on an international middle east peace conference 
peres did not respond publicly to the demands but israel radio 
said labor ministers in the caretaker cabinet opposed a coalition 
under such conditions 
after two weeks of negotiations shamir is in a position to form 
a majority coalition with four religious parties and three from the 
extreme right his offer to labor was seen as an attempt to avoid 
growing demands from those potential partners 
i explained to labor that the good of the country demands the 
establishment of a broadbased government a government which would 
include the likud labor and those parties that expressed a 
willingness to join a government under my leadership the prime 
minister said on israel television 
we have heard an invitation peres said some things were 
more explicit some things were more openended we will discuss it 
and then decide 
the 4yearold coalition in the first half of which peres was 
prime minister and shamir foreign minister has been split on how to 
achieve peace with arab nations and end the 11monthlong 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
shamir and likud refuse to trade occupied land for peace have 
called for increased military measures to end the palestiinian 
revolt and oppose an international conference which the arabs 
demand 
peres and his labor party are willing to exchange some of the 
occupied land for peace and favor an international conference 
yitzhak modai of likud said the question is do we have a 
common approach on basic issues after glancing at labors election 
platform i would have to say no

mayorships in brazils 14 largest cities 
more than 75 million registered voters were to choose from 12 
million candidates belonging to 29 parties ranging from two 
communist groups to supporters of the former military regime 
lines at polling places were four city blocks long in many cities 
some results were expected late tuesday but officials said final 
results probably would not be announced until sunday 
voting is mandatory and brazilians who dont vote face trouble 
getting a passport obtaining a government loan or a civil service 
job 
sarney the first civilian president since a 21year military 
regime ended in 1985 called the elections a step toward 
democracy 
dont think democracy is easy to be a democrat its 
necessary to renounce violence and convince by ideas and choose by 
the ballot the president told a nationwide television audience 
monday night 
but recent polls showed voter apathy and distrust of politicians 
were high in rio de janeiro many brazilians took advantage of the 
national holiday and the warm weather to crowd the citys famous 
beaches leaving voting for later 
in recent weeks a campaign begun by a satirical newspaper to 
elect a chimpanzee in the rio zoo as mayor has gained national 
attention as a sign of brazilians lack of confidence in politicians 
in general 
public service announcements on radio and television urged 
brazilians not to throw away their votes by casting blank ballots or 
voting for nonsense candidates 
federal troops were stationed in 15 states and 271 municipalities 
to keep order 
police arrested some campaign workers for violating a law 
prohibiting lastminute campaigning within 300 feet of polling 
stations the workers were trying to hand out sample ballots with 
their candidates name written in 
sarney voted in his northern home state of maranhao then 
returned to the capital of brasilia 
sarney a 58yearold politician and poet gained office as the 
running mate of tancredo neves who was chosen in a 
militarycontrolled electoral college vote neves died shortly 
before taking office 
the elections are viewed as an important indicator of party 
popularity as brazil prepares for presidential elections in late 
1989 the first such election in 29 years

george bush announced tuesday that he was 
asking nicholas brady to remain as treasury secretary and a source 
said the presidentelect also asked new hampshire gov john sununu 
to be his white house chief of staff 
sununu who is retiring as governor had been one of two top 
candidates for the job along with craig fuller who was chief of 
staff for nearly four years in bushs vice presidential office 
bush made the announcement to keep brady after meeting with 
german chancellor helmut kohl the first of a string of sessions the 
presidentelect has scheduled with foreign leaders bush will meet 
wednesday with british prime minister margaret thatcher and will 
confer with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev next month 
bush also said tuesday that his administration would work to 
reduce the budget deficit while resisting higher taxes and trade 
protectionism 
his decision to keep brady 58 in the cabinet was expected 
our most important priority is to keep our economy growing with 
low inflation and he knows that we must resist the policies that 
will impede that effort such as raising taxes or resorting to 
protection bush said 
he said brady knows weve got to sit down with the congress on 
a deficitreduction agreement and weve got to do it soon 
brady a former investment banker and bushs longtime friend is 
the second person chosen for the new cabinet bush last week picked 
james a baker iii his election campaign chairman as secretary of 
state 
an official announcement of sununus appointment was expected 
later 
a source said bush had decided on sununu whom he had invited to 
a private dinner monday night at a vacation retreat in florida and 
who flew back to washington with bush on tuesday 
sununu declined to talk about his future as he arrived back at 
the nations capital 
im still governor said the 49yearold conservative 
republican who was credited with helping bush save a primary 
victory after the vice president lost iowas gop caucuses ill do 
whatever he needs 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate after talking with fuller and 
transition codirector robert teeter said late tuesday that she 
could not confirm the choice 
also mentioned as possible candidates for the post were fuller 
37 codirector of bushs transition office and teeter the other 
codirector 
republican sources involved in bushs campaign and on the outside 
said tuesday night that fuller would not want a white house post 
under sununu there has been widespread speculation that he might 
accept another post such as a cabinet job 
sununu was promoted for the chief of staff job by conservatives 
who felt that he had more of an ideological edge than fuller 
i will make orderly announcements bush said were really 
just beginning to take a look at the cabinet 
bush said he informed kohl of his choice of brady and that the 
west german chancellor was pleased the us dollar has fallen 
sharply in relation to foreign currencies including the west german 
mark 
ill do my best to help the presidentelect serve the people 
and to build on this the longest recovery in the history of the 
country said brady a former senator from new jersey who 
succeeded baker at treasury last august 
he had no comment on the fall of the dollar 
bush said the announcement was not made particularly to calm 
world financial markets but he added i hope to the degree they 
need calming they will have that effect 
he described brady a former cochairman of the investment 
banking house of dillon read amp co as a man who brings to his 
office an extraordinary knowledge of financial markets experience 
in the private sector 
bush cited bradys involvement in the presidential panel that 
studied the oct 19 1987 stock market crash as well as the 
kissinger commission on central america and the packard commission 
on pentagon management 
bush said he and brady will sit down soon to focus on the savings 
and loan industry crisis in which about 900 thrift institutions are 
either insolvent or ailing the federal home loan bank board says it 
may cost the government up to 50 billion to bail them out 
the bushkohl meeting took place at the vice presidents official 
residence several miles from the white house vice presidentelect 
dan quayle and west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher 
sat in on the talks 
bush has said he wants to forge close ties with the western 
allies and the discussions with kohl and mrs thatcher raise the 
possibility of an early meeting with leaders of the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
the presidentelect has vowed to hold an early summit with 
gorbachev but said he wants to see soviet progress on issues such as 
arms control human rights and regional conflicts reagan has held 
four summits with gorbachev and he and bush plan to see him in new 
york next month when the kremlin leader addresses the un general 
assembly 
meantime the rumor mill worked overtime on who might be 
appointed to top jobs in the next administration 
the heritage foundation a conservative think tank planned to 
deliver 2500 resumes to the transition office hoping to place 
people with their views in jobs chase untermeyer the transitions 
personnel director is guiding the selection process for at least 
5000 political jobs 
among those expected to round out bushs economic team are 
richard darman as budget director and michael boskin as head of the 
council of economic advisers 
new jersey gov thomas kean who has been mentioned for a 
possible cabinet post spent the day here tuesday delivering a 
speech to a conservation group his name has cropped up for possible 
secretary of transportation 
sources on capitol hill said bush campaign official janet mullins 
was a leading candidate to serve as chief congressional lobbyist 
loret ruppe the peace corps director has been touted as a 
possible secretary of health and human services as has rep willis 
gradison rohio at the commerce department robert mosbachers 
name has surfaced he is a houston oilman who was the bush 
campaigns finance director 
meanwhile rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss said tuesday 
he had heard that his name is at the top of the list among 
bushs possible choices for secretary of veterans affairs however 
he said bush had not mentioned the new cabinet level post to him 
montgomery as chairman of the house veterans affairs committee 
last year helped push to passage legislation that elevated the 
veterans administration to a cabinetlevel agency he and bush have 
been friends since both were freshman congressmen 22 years ago

the general assembly on tuesday adopted a 
consensus resolution opposing outside interference in the central 
american peace process the united states blamed nicaragua for 
obstructing democracy in the region 
the united states urges the international community to adopt a 
realistic and honest appraisal of the disastrous effects of 
nicaraguan mismanagement and repression upon the search for peace 
and democracy in central america said us ambassador patricia m 
byrne us alternate representative to the world body 
as it did last year the assembly endorsed by consensus a 
resolution supporting the peace plan of five central american 
countries signed in guatemala city on aug 7 1987 the five who 
signed the plan also known as esquipulas ii are costa rica el 
salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua 
but in a change from last year the resolution said the general 
assembly appeals to the countries which are outside the region but 
which have links with it and interests in it to facilitate the 
implementation of the esquipulas ii accords and to abstain from any 
action which may impede such implementation 
the reference appeared aimed at the united states which aides 
the nicaraguan rebels known as contras as well as cuba and the 
soviet union both of which arm salvadoran rebels the peace plan 
prohibits foreign aid to rebels 
byrne told the assembly that the united states shares the desire 
of the central american peoples for democracy but she said some 
troubling developments and antidemocratic trends in nicaragua 
were not addressed in the resolution 
one year ago byrne said the peace plan represented a mechanism 
for moving toward democracy 
now we know that the promise is not yet fully realized and 
that one central american country nicaragua has not lived up to 
its commitments she said 
byrne said that under the peace plan nicaragua promised a free 
press freedom of assembly and free elections it has delivered on 
none of these promises she said nicaraguan elections have been 
postponed the free press is in danger of extinction and political 
opposition leaders are in jail the us envoy said 
she protested that the resolution calls for international 
economic cooperation despite the absence of any progress by 
nicaragua to grant the freedoms that are basic to building a healthy 
economy 
but nicaraguan ambassador alejandro serrano caldera told the 
assembly that us aid to the contras was impeding democracy in the 
region and fulfillment of the peace plan 
he said the us reagan administration was using pressure and 
manipulation of opposition groups in an effort to create 
internal chaos this he said had been orchestrated by the former 
us ambassador to managua 
he criticized the reagan administration which last week renewed 
its economic embargo against nicaragua this embargo was declared 
illegal by the international court of justice in june 1986 he said 
and the general assembly has demanded its revocation since 1985 
meanwhile costa rica on tuesday proposed that neutral observers 
be stationed along nicaraguas and el salvadors borders with 
honduras 
foreign minister rodrigo madrigal nieto made the suggestion 
during his address to the general assembly of the organization of 
american states meeting in san salvador el salvador 
he said stationing un observers would be a procedure of 
verification and control 
the presence of thousands of contras in camps in honduran 
territory is one of the key obstacles to progress in the peace plan

the arizona board of pharmacy on tuesday 
decided it wouldnt act on the american medical associations 
request that it stop distribution of a new smokeless cigarette 
the rj reynolds co is test marketing premier cigarettes in 
phoenix tucson and st louis the ama filed a petition nov 2 
seeking to have the product declared a new and hazardous drug the 
distribution of which then would fall under the auspices of the 
pharmaceutical board 
our obligation is to protect the public health so we feel that 
something needs to be done about this said norma e mcconnell 
president of the board but the board will not in the morning make 
a decision that yes it is a drug or no it isnt but we are 
working toward that she said 
mrs mcconnell said the board hopes to get more information from 
the federal food and drug administration which regulates 
distribution and marketing of drugs in the united states and has 
more facilities and expertise that the state board 
a petition the ama filed with the fda in april is pending 
if the arizona board later decides the cigarette is a drug its 
options include seeking an injunction such as the ama suggested in 
its petition 
also they have the authority as the ama set forth in their 
position to seize misbranded drugs said timothy j agan an 
assistant attorney general 
arizona law empowers the board to regulate drugs or hazardous 
substances sold in arizona but it would have to file a lawsuit to 
enforce any regulation declaring a product a drug agan said 
reynolds said in a news release that premier is a cigarette 
not a drugdelivery system as the ama has alleged its smoke 
reynolds said substantially reduces many of the chemical 
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about 
the company also said at the time it found it difficult to 
understand how the ama can in good faith suggest that premier be 
banned 
dr m roy schwarz an ama assistant executive vice president 
said the product contains nicotine an addictive drug which 
has been implicated in cardiovascular disease

president daniel ortega on tuesday said 
hurricane joan caused more than 828 million in damages to 
nicaragua more than the amount of money spent fighting the 
usbacked rebels 
ortega also suspended the 30day state of emergency enacted two 
days before joan struck on oct 22 he called on workers producers 
and political opposition groups to help reconstruction 
thousands of homes were destroyed bridges collapsed and 
thousands of acres of crops were flooded ortega said 137 people 
died in the hurricane and 119 people still were missing 
he said almost 500000 people were homeless 
ortega said the direct costs of the hurricane were more than 828 
million that figure did not include ecological damages which he 
said still were incalculable the leftist sandinista government said 
in 1987 that direct costs of the civil war which began in 1981 was 
5865 million 
ortega puts total war costs at more than 12 billion including 
loans to nicaragua blocked by the united states and projections of 
what nicaraguan exports could have earned if not for the fighting 
the president in an 90minute speech before the national 
assembly and foreign diplomats called on nicaraguan workers and 
producers to create a fund to aid rural peasants who suffered the 
worst damages in the hurricane 
these peasants lost their homes their work implements their 
harvests ortega said these peasants dont have anything 
ortega lashed out at the united states for failing to offer 
emergency assistance but continuing to fund the rebels known as 
contras 
the only humanitarian aid the yankee government the yankee 
congress has approved is already known to us that which they have 
approved for criminals somoza guards to continue killing the 
people he said 
the reagan administration began funding the contras almost two 
years after the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary 
war that desposed the dictatorship of anastasio somoza washington 
claims nicaragua is a communist beachhead in central america 
the nicaraguan economy has suffered from the war corruption and 
government mismanagement ortega pointed out that when the 
sandinistas assumed power nicaraguas economy already was reeling 
from the revolution and a powerful earthquake in 1972 that 
devastated managua the capital and killed 10000 people 
sandinista measures to right the economy failed inflation runs 
rampant with some analysts putting it as high as 10000 percent 
annually the average worker complains he lacks the income to buy 
basic food staples 
nicaragua ran a trade deficit last year of 520 million the 
foreign debt is estimated at 6 billion 
ortega said the government would enact new economic policies but 
provided no details 
ortega said the threat posed by hurricane joan no longer existed 
in explaining his decision to repeal the state of emergency which 
curbed some constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and 
empowered the government to take over private property if necessary 
it was enacted to confront the phenomenon that was coming to 
be able to make preparations under the best conditions within the 
mark of the law ortega said this reason has disappeared

another visit to the united states in early december and hold a 
fifth and final meeting with president reagan and possibly 
presidentelect george bush us officials said 
the soviet leader also will address the united nations general 
assembly as it winds up its current session 
the meeting with reagan around dec 7 would give the two sides 
another chance to narrow the gap on a treaty to reduce longrange 
nuclear weapons arsenals and to ease tensions caused by afghan rebel 
attacks on soviet troops in afghanistan and a slowdown in the red 
armys withdrawal from the country 
the treaty is bogged down with several technical problems that 
may not be easily solved but on afghanistan the soviets already

women in poor physical shape are three times 
more likely to die at an early age of heart disease than are those 
who keep themselves in good condition according to a longterm 
study 
dr lars g ekelund the principal author of the study said it 
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from 
heart disease just as it does men 
poor physical fitness is almost as important as smoking as a 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women said ekelund a 
researcher at the university of north carolina 
the study was based on a 10year followup of 2802 women who 
ranged in age from 30 to 69 the results were presented monday at

jake steinfeld the highenergy exercise 
instructor and motivator has muscled into the infotainment tv 
market but is playing what he calls that games right field 
this season 
you have to get up at 530 am in most areas of the country to 
catch the 30yearold steinfelds body by jake his entry in the 
crowded infotainment market steinfeld and show coowner samuel 
goldwyn co are hoping the shows format will put it ahead of other 
shows for advancement to better time slots 
its like saying put on a uniform youre on the team and 
you can play right field for now so im in the game now a lot of 
balls arent going to come to me but im out here in right field 
steinfeld a popular figure through his fitness breaks on 
cable news network three exercise videos a book and coaching of 
such hollywood luminaries as steven spielberg harrison ford 
michael j fox and madonna said in a recent interview that he has 
been approached several times to do a television show 
theyve offered me to do exercise shows all over the place 
steinfeld said the reason i refused was because i asked myself 
where is a show like that going to go what are you going to say 
tune in tomorrow and ill count to 60 
the answer is a show that mixes exercise tips pep talks and 
unscripted chats with celebrity guests who talk about health or 
personal care the syndicated show currently is in 115 markets or 
about 86 percent of the country 
the main thing is i dont take myself seriously in the show 
steinfeld said i dont walk around saying well this is how 
things are going to be done in the past exercise people have done 
that and theres a stereotype of that with them jumping up and down 
and screaming at people 
the idea of the show is lifestyle its family you dont want 
to make health training and nutrition a second job said 
steinfeld who peppers his language with invented words such as 
buttissmo for buttocks and abadab for abdominal muscles 
the show has a sevenminute energizer exercise segment along 
with the tips and talk but theres a twist 
instead of featuring a few goodlooking models working out with 
jake the show has a shapely advanced workout model and a guest 
exerciser who is decidedly unfit and that is the person steinfeld 
and the camera give the most attention to 
when you watch these shows everyone looks gorgeous 
steinfeld said here we are in la were very jaded here very 
jaded its a very vain community everybody seems gorgeous here 
whether by naturalness or doctorness 
but if you see a regular person working with jake youll say 
hey i can do that he said 
brooklynborn steinfeld whose oftenrepeated favorite slogan is 
dont quit has described himself as a chubby teenager until 
his parents bought him a weightlifting set when he was 15 he spent 
only one year in college in new york before deciding to move to 
california and become a bodybuilder 
i was living the life of a musclehead eating sleeping and 
drinking bodybuilding sitting in the sun and bouncing at bars at 
night steinfeld recalled 
i entered a mr southern california contest and came in second 
without using steroids the guy who beat me was on the stuff and 
worked half as hard as i did and ate chocolate cake before the 
contest because he was taking thyroid and all this other stuff 
steinfeld said 
he was disillusioned with bodybuilding after that im not even 
close to that world anymore i was mad here i was a kid growing up 
and reading muscle magazines and no one ever said anything about 
steroids it made you think anyone could do it he said 
i just turned 30 when i was 20 nobody was talking about 
steroids and now its finally out there as an issue 
the best advice is do it naturally youll keep the weight you 
want youll keep your strength forever and youll feel a lot 
better about yourself steinfeld said

in the 20 months he said they were moved six times to different 
locations usually a room measuring about 10 by 12 feet with food 
adequare a bath allowed once a week 
our captors listened to our physical and medical needs but they 
did not listen to us as people singh said to be a captive is 
to have nobody to rely upon to give meaning to what you are going 
through except for yourself 
we had no meaning for the jihad kidnappers as individuals 
only as representative figures 
singh a hindu said at one time to endure while very sick and 
weak he reached back to his adolescence in india when he once 
continuously chanted mantras a repetitious prayer form for a week 
so now again in the room i shared with the other captives i 
turned to my mantra wrapping my blanket over my head and chanting 
softly singh relates 
one million mantras i figure i said in that room and as i said 
them i grew grateful for the experience the chance to do again at 
my age what i did in my youth 
it was the process of saying the mantra of thinking of god and 
of myself and the universe that saved me i think he said 
the point i am trying to make is that we as children as 
adolescents as young people should not try to live in a 
materialistic vacuum 
we should develop our reservoirs of strength of power the 
deep moorings of the self to which we can turn and cling for safety 
in time of both adversity and prosperity 
this ability comes out of a way of life a lifestyle and i am 
afraid oh i hope i am wrong that young people today are not 
building these moorings not filling these reservoirs 
singh who taught for l0 years at the university of western 
colorado and for two years and at the university of wisconsin said 
everybody everywhere should press for release of the remaining 
captives 
nine americans are among 14 foreigners still held being held 
prisoners in lebanon 
singh said that during his captivity he and three university 
colleagues kept with him jesse turner alan steen and robert 
polhill worked on future plans and projects all mentally without 
pencil or paper 
in one project singe said he worked in his head on how to solve 
challenges to education in america and india each morning reviewing 
and critiquing his previous days work and in the afternoon 
advancing another step ahead 
he said he now is eager to get to work on the two books he 
already has written in his mind 
in the first two weeks of their captivity singh said jihad 
leaders concentrated on interrogating the three with vigorous 
attempts to get them to admit ties to american intlligence 
agencies 
after that interlude he said boredom became the rule but at one 
point they were told they would be executed at midnight if jihad 
demands were not met release of palestinians held in kuwait and in 
israel 
but the deadline hour passed 
i would not say that i am bitter over what i went through 
singh said through meditation the experience brought me its own 
rewards

with the promise of legal us residency held 
before them thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants are 
emerging from the shadows under which they harvested americas fresh 
fruits and vegetables 
in a last desperate chance to become legal us residents many 
of these farmworkers are using fraudulent documents to prove they 
worked here before thus qualifying for a legalization program that 
ends nov 30 
the immigration and naturalization service and organizations 
working to help the mostly mexican immigrants agree there is massive 
fraud 
but the organizations say the ins has developed a paranoia 
over the problem and has coerced applicants into signing 
confessions that their documents are phony 
immigration authorities deny the allegation 
to qualify for legal residency under the immigration reform and 
control act of 1986 foreign farmhands must prove they harvested 
fruits vegetables or other perishable crops in the united states 
for at least 90 days in a oneyear period that ended may 1 1986 
the ins had estimated that 600000 farm workers would apply 
instead the figure topped 1 million by the first week of november 
and up to 200000 more are expected before the filing period ends 
nov 30 according to aaron bodin who heads the ins special 
agriculture workers program 
under the initial phase of the legalization program which ended 
may 4 temporary residency was granted to more than 17 million 
illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the united states 
since jan 1 1982 
the ins admits the service was illprepared with budget and staff 
because it underestimated the farmworkers demand for legalization 
to complicate matters bodin said many of the farmhands were unable 
to obtain the documents they needed so they turned to labor 
contractors who hire illegal immigrants many of whom wrote letters 
to anyone who asked for a fee 
every time i call the ins theyre screaming fraud fraud 
fraud said christine brigagliano an attorney for the nonprofit 
california rural legal assistance foundation in san francisco the 
ins is going bonkers with this fraud stuff 
the farmworkers are being penalized for fraud when we have 
created a wonderful black market here ms brigagliano said 
mary lopez the californiabased director of the martin luther 
king jr farmworkers fund said she received reports of people 
paying up to 800 for a phony letter with the average about 300 
bodin said the ins concern over fraud is not paranoia but 
suspicion that half the undecided cases that have reached processing 
centers may include phony papers 
nonetheless he said early statistics showed a 92 percent 
approval rate for the first 325000 applications reaching the 
centers where initial decisions are made rejections can be 
appealed to washington 
those qualifying for legalization under the 90day prior work 
provision will receive temporary residency cards which will be 
adjusted to permanent status in most cases on dec 1 1990 the 
immigrants are not required to work in agriculture once admitted 
the program also is available to those who can show they worked 
90 days in each of three years that ended may 1 1986 and have 
resided in the united states for at least six months for each of 
those years they can become permanent residents earlier dec 1 
1989 
the agricultural program was included in the 1986 law at the 
insistence of growers especially in the west who argued they 
needed a pool of legal workers who could be ready to harvest 
perishable crops on short notice 
the real test is yet to come said mike stuart senior vice 
president of the western growers association it will be in the 
number of workers who remain working in agriculture 
stuart suggested that those evaluating the program watch how many 
newly legalized workers show up to pick strawberries in orange 
county calif in january the first harvest after the deadline 
but for thousands of farmhands seeking a better life the test 
begins when they appear at a us immigration office 
theyre being harassed treated without dignity told they will 
go to jail said ms lopez of the martin luther king jr 
farmworkers fund 
bodin described most ins personnel as cordial friendly and 
trying to help but acknowledged their job was to determine the 
credibility of the applicant 
he said farmworkers may find their interviews difficult because 
theyre victims of the labor market theyve been in 
they were paid in cash they rode around in a pickup truck 
they might not know the names of the farms they worked only the 
crew leaders first name he said 
we try to talk to the applicant and try to get a sense of his 
credibility we have gone the last mile but we cannot simply take 
peoples word for it the statute and the regulations require 
documentary evidence

when hbo named its miniseries about the 
revolution in the philippines a dangerous life it wasnt 
supposed to describe the filming 
when i got to manila they gave me a threepage form to fill out 
with very personal information to use in negotiations in case i was 
abducted said gary busey who stars as a journalist in the 
threepart sixhour film airing on home box office this sunday 
monday and tuesday 
a dangerous life as seen through the eyes of a reporter 
tells of the 1986 peoples revolution that brought down the 
government of ferdinand marcos and brought corazon aquino to power 
as president 
during his 5week stay in the philippines busey was accompanied 
by four bodyguards and three trucks 
even so busey and the film company were forced to leave the 
philippines on short notice after juan ponce enrile the former 
minister of national defense obtained a court order halting 
production citing invasion of privacy another prominent military 
officer also filed suit 
all the judges of the supreme court were out of town said 
busey they gave us six hours to get out we left under armed 
guard we went to australia for the interiors then to sri lanka to 
finish the exterior scenes we finally won the case but it took 
months to come to trial 
busey stars as tony oneill in manila on assignment when he 
witnesses the assassination of opposition leader benigno aquino 
mrs aquinos husband marcos righthand man gen fabian ver is 
accused in the murder but his acquittal spurs cory aquino to 
challenge marcos in the presidential election 
marcos wins the election amid charges of fraud most of the 
military sides with aquino and marcos is forced to flee 
the miniseries also stars rebecca gilling as oneills estranged 
wife a fellow journalist tessie tomas as imelda marcos ruben 
rustia as marcos laurice guillen as corazon aquino and joonee 
gamboa as enrile 
a number of filipino actors appear in the miniseries busey said 
they were magnificent they came prepared they were very 
disciplined the focus of the series is a story about their country 
which was very important to them tessie tomas who plays imelda 
used to do a onewoman show on her imelda loved it these are 
actors who are playing people who are still alive who have the 
ability to get back at them 
some members of the cast were promarcos and some were 
proaquino we had a lot of tension my character is a man who gets 
caught up in the passion of the revolution i talked to 
correspondents who covered it they were very emotional about it 
they stayed with the rebel troops thats where the story was 
i thought this was going to be easy but it was like two 
lifetimes doing this i learned an awful lot it was a rewarding 
experience i learned a lot about human nature and how democracy 
works in a third world country 
busey talked about the film on a break from the theatrical 
feature hider in the house he was in his trailer watching the 
soap opera as the world turns while on location in duarte about 
25 miles east of los angeles 
ive been watching this for 25 years he said when i go to 
new york i visit with these guys i started watching when i was in 
college in coffeyville kansas its got everything sex 
blackmail revenge its a great mental catharsis for an actor 
in hider in the house busey plays a demented man who takes 
up residence in the attic of a house being remodeled the film 
company was working at the site of an old house that was due to be 
remodeled the movie also stars michael mckean and mimi rogers

twentyfive years ago ap correspondent mike 
cochran covered the assassination of president kennedy in dallas and 
reported on the slaying and burial of lee harvey oswald and the 
murder trial of jack ruby in this article he explores the 
significance of the 25th anniversary of kennedys death and how the 
events and mysteries of november 1963 still affect us all 
</TEXT>

as air force one began its descent into carswell 
air force base president john f kennedy glanced down through the 
darkness amber lights silhouetted the fort worth skyline and gave 
the city a friendly festive glow 
spectacular kennedy told congressman jim wright 
the date was nov 21 1963 and the presidential party had flown 
to fort worth for the third stop on a whirlwind tour designed to end 
the leftright squabbling among bitterly factionalized texas 
democrats and secure the state for the presidential election the 
following year 
a crowd estimated at 6000 greeted kennedy and his wife 
jacqueline at carswell and thousands more lined the motorcade 
route to the old hotel texas where the president would spend his 
final night 
a 26yearold ap reporter caught his first glimpse of an american 
president that evening and in that era of innocence was every bit 
as excited as a smalltown west texan should have been 
hours later that ap reporter joined other numbed and dismayed 
colleagues in covering the death of his president and the wounding 
of gov john b connally just days later he covered the slaying of 
lee harvey oswald and drafted for the task helped carry his body 
to its grave 
then came the 1964 murder trial of jack ruby the ides of march 
conviction a death sentence and an appellate court ruling that set 
the verdict aside ruby died of cancer before he could be retried 
through the years there were interludes with oswalds widow 
marina and turbulent intriguing bouts with his mother marguerite 
whose favorite pastime was haranguing fort worth reporters 
and always the conspiracy buffs the researchers dedicated to 
proving the warren commissions basic conclusion a lie and not a 
very convincing one at that 
they insisted oswald was not the killer or at the very least 
was not the sole triggerman 
in 1981 the conspiracies peaked with a trip to rose hill 
cemetery to dig up the body buried 18 years before in oswalds 
grave a british author had claimed we had buried an impostor a 
russian spy in fact he was wrong forensic tests at baylor 
university medical center proved it was indeed oswald 
although the echoes of gunfire in dealey plaza grow fainter with 
each passing autumn the events of november 1963 continue to touch 
us all in mystifying ways and to different degrees 
this month there will be network and cable documentaries new 
books an allnight capitol vigil and memorials by former peace 
corps volunteers and pt boat veterans millions of words will be 
written 
still kennedy family members would prefer that remembrances of 
the slain president be changed 
they have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his 
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth says melody 
miller an aide to sen edward m kennedy 
what is the significance of this 25th anniversary and the 
anniversaries that preceded it do we know the legacy of dallas or 
the lessons of 1963 
historians may one day pinpoint all this and more 
but dont bet on it

anyone old enough to read or watch television 25 years ago can 
recite from memory the events of november 22 
kennedy spoke twice in fort worth that morning first to a crowd 
of 5000 who had gathered in the rain in the hotel parking lot vice 
president lyndon johnson and connally joined him but jackie did not 
it takes a little longer to put herself together thats why 
shes prettier than we are the president joked with the cheering 
crowd 
inside kennedy addressed a soldout chamber of commerce 
breakfast in the hotels grand ballroom that group totaled 2050 
with 50 extra tickets allotted at the last minute to the black 
community 
no blacks no breakfast speech the white house said when told 
the president would be addressing an allwhite audience 
it was kennedys final speech but jackie stole the show looking 
lovely and selfassured in a twopiece pink suit with matching 
pillbox hat 
kennedy and his entourage then returned to carswell for the short 
flight to dallas where the president was to address a luncheon at 
the trade mart 
in dallas 200000 people many on lunch breaks jammed the 
streets to see the 46yearold president and his 34yearold wife 
smiling and waving jackie sat at her husbands side as the 
motorcade rolled through the canyons of downtown dallas 
delighted and relieved by the big friendly reception nellie 
connally the governors wife turned from her seat in front of 
kennedy and said 
no one can say dallas doesnt love and respect you mr 
president 
you sure cant he replied 
seconds later the motorcade passed in front of the texas school 
book depository and into a snipers cross hairs

the first year after the assassination was difficult for most 
americans it was a nightmare for texans particularly those living 
in dallas 
a number of publications found much to dislike about texas and 
most were mightily concerned with the socalled mood of dallas 
and the accommodation granted its farright fanatics in the 
conservative mainstream 
in an editorial headlined a year later the dallas morning 
news touched on the scathing and unjust criticism of dallas and 
observed how the city stood alone in the spotlight of unfavorable 
conspicuousness 
the editorial did not mention the small but noisy element of 
rightwingers whose agitation had prompted kennedys visit 12 months 
before 
perhaps it was unimportant what seemed to matter to the 
newspaper was that hysteria and shock had subsided and the city 
could move ahead with new resolve and high purpose 
november 22 that year fell on a sunday and a still sorrowful 
nation remembered kennedy in prayers and memorial services across 
the country 
it had been a year of memorials 
the us space flight center at cape canaveral fla was renamed 
cape kennedy but later was changed back new york changed the name 
of its international airport from idlewild to john f kennedy 
congress authorized construction of a cultural center in 
washington to be named in kennedys honor and harvard university 
announced plans for a kennedy memorial library 
by the end of the year it seemed certain that more american 
streets avenues and boulevards would be named kennedy than main 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the dallas ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the 
assassination was so brief and simple it almost slipped past 
unnoticed 
fifty people gathered for the prayer service near the spot where 
kennedy was slain a city official laid a wreath of red and white 
carnations beside the bronze marker that tells the assassination 
story 
the news was dominated by the vietnam war and the 1968 election 
pain still lingered from the slayings earlier that year of martin 
luther king jr and sen robert f kennedy

by the 10th anniversary in 1973 reporters were getting lathered 
up over watergate in dallas 500 people gathered near the 
assassination site but the top news story of the day was an 
18minute gap in a nixon white house tape recording 
the jfk focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories fed by 
books and a movie called executive action that laid blame for 
the kennedy killing on a group of greedy texas oilmen 
theres nothing new my view is the same oswald did all the 
shooting retired district attorney henry wade said in an 
interview last month i havent seen anything to change my mind i 
feel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought that 
somebody ought to kill him kennedy while in town but there is 
absolutely no proof of anything like that 
fifteen years ago wade who would have prosecuted oswald had he 
lived was less certain 
i find it hard to believe that oswald didnt have help he 
told the ap in 1973 call it a gut feeling on my part i dont 
have any evidence to back it up but i believe there was a 
conspiracy you just dont go downtown one morning and kill the 
president 
the widow of jd tippit the police officer oswald shot after 
fleeing the school book warehouse had remarried by the 10th 
anniversary a lawyer said the 600000 she received from a 
sympathetic public after tippits death went into a trust for their 
three children 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
unlike the spartan fifth anniversary the landmark 20th touched 
all bases 
movies television specials documentaries books magazine 
articles and news stories explored the assassination anew 
in 1963 marina oswald at age 22 was a stranger in a foreign 
land a frightened young woman with few friends no money no job 
no future two infant daughters and a dead husband accused of 
killing the president of the united states 
it was horrible she told the ap 20 years later 
for a while i thought it would all blow over just go away but 
now i accept the fact that i must live with this for the rest of my 
life 
less than two years after the assassination marina married 
kenneth porter a carpenter and they moved to a country house north 
of dallas 
she was then and remains today uncertain of oswalds guilt and 
whether he acted alone she initially agreed with the warren 
commission that oswald was the lone assassin but doubts crept in 
and she later changed her mind 
but she told the ap i dont have any desire to waste the rest 
of my life trying to prove something that cannot be proven 
there are those however who are obsessed with doing precisely 
that 
in 1983 an ap story first pulled together theories about the 
black dog man the umbrella man the mafia con man the tall tramp 
and a man called frenchy the article also looked at publications 
called the continuing inquiry coverups and echoes of 
conspiracy 
those are names and newsletters wellknown to the selfdescribed 
theorists or critics who claim there is a sinister and still 
secret story behind the assassination 
they raise provocative questions but provide few answers 
that brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories 
a british television documentary entitled the men who killed 
kennedy broadcast oct 25 claimed three gangsters from 
marseilles france assassinated kennedy on orders from us 
organized crime 
the twohour documentary on central television identified the 
purported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in mexico 
in 1972 a second was working in colombias drug trade and the third 
was living in marseilles after his recent release from prison 
but the day after the program aired a marseilles newspaper 
assembled records indicating that two of them could not have been in 
dallas on nov 22 1963 one was serving on a minesweeper from oct 
16 1962 to april 16 1964 according to french navy headquarters 
and another was in a marseilles jail cell that day according to the 
justice ministry 
in addition the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran as 
saying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day of 
the assassination 
the program was based on a fouryear inquiry by american writer 
and researcher steve rivele and the programs british director 
nigel turner 
in this country a syndicated television report is reviving the 
theory that kennedys assassination was an act of revenge by 
lousiana mob boss carlos marcello who was deported in 1961 by 
thenus attorney general robert kennedy the program presented by 
reporter jonathan kwitny was broadcast in new york nov 1 and will 
air elsewhere this month 
the report said evidence indicated that oswald and ruby had 
connections to marcello oswald through his uncle who purportedly 
worked for the marcello organization and ruby through drug 
trafficking which would have been controlled by marcello 
in a twohour television special nov 2 columnist jack anderson

back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in dealey 
plaza the media struggled to define the mood of dallas and how the 
citys rightwing tolerance might have figured in the assassination 
they apparently failed 
d magazine a slick dallas monthly unveiled its november 1988 
issue with this cover 25 years later did dallas kill kennedy 
inside there is a story entitled was dallas a city of hate 
the debate goes on 
robert h johnson jr the aps texas bureau chief who directed 
the news agencys assassination coverage wrote the aps first 
startling words 
bulletin 
dallas ap president kennedy was shot today just as his 
motorcade left downtown dallas mrs kennedy jumped up and grabbed 
mr kennedy she cried oh no the motorcade sped on 
johnson recently retired and living in new mexico remained in 
texas for six years after the shootings never once he said did he 
drive past the book depository without getting a prickly feeling 
on the back of his neck 
i still feel it he said after a visit to dallas this year 
the event has got some kind of hold on americans and many 
foreigners as well its hard to explain 
barbara womble cannot explain it either but she vividly 
remembers the look on her fifthgrade teachers face when he 
dismissed his pupils in chicopee falls mass that november 
afternoon 
just by his expression we knew something really big had 
happened she says now 
ms womble 35 now director of marketing at upscale highland 
park village shopping complex in dallas said the whole issue is 
muddled because the case has never been solved 
but to me the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regret 
is to discuss them openly and repeatedly she said they just 
dont vanish

americans rank john f kennedy as the nations 
greatest president remembering him with a striking sense of loss a 
quartercentury after his assassination a media generalassociated 
press poll has found 
but kennedys exalted place in history rests more on his 
potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in 
office in the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma 
than on other attributes 
slightly more than onefifth of the 1125 adults surveyed picked 
kennedy as the greatest us president more than named any other 
only franklin d roosevelt and abraham lincoln came close in 
popularity 
among all respondents a plurality rated kennedy as a good 
president not a great one still a majority said they believed 
that had he lived and served a second term the united states would 
be a better place today 
kennedy at 43 the youngest president elected served nearly 
three years before he was shot and killed in a dallas motorcade nov 
22 1963 twentyfive years later his name is invoked and his words 
are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of popularity 
in more recent years the kennedy image crumbled a bit with 
reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a mafia boss 
in the survey kennedys judgment was rated lower than other 
qualities 
most striking however was the depth of feeling associated with 
the slain president more than six in 10 respondents said they still 
felt a personal loss from kennedys assassination including many 
who were children or were not yet born in 1963 among his 
contemporaries seven in 10 feel a loss 
in another gauge the poll asked if respondents remembered where 
they were when they heard kennedy had been killed of those 30 and 
older now meaning they were at least 5 years old then more than 
90 percent said yes 
to order the pantheon of presidents the survey asked who do 
you think was the greatest american president kennedy was named 
by 21 percent lincoln and roosevelt 17 percent each harry truman 
and ronald reagan 7 percent each kennedy has led similar lists in 
other polls over the years 
kennedy was most popular with 30 to 44yearolds who were 
children or teenagers when he served nearly a third of them called 
him the greatest president in other ratings as well that group 
viewed kennedy especially favorably 
kennedy who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the south 
also was rated particularly highly by blacks eight in 10 felt a 
personal loss from his death and 60 percent of blacks called him a 
great president compared to 31 percent of whites 
overall a third of respondents said kennedy was a great 
president and 40 percent said a good one he did better with 
democrats and the lesseducated and as the first roman catholic 
president he was rated highly by catholics 
kennedy also was more popular with liberals but his standing to 
a great degree transcended ideology he achieved his high ratings 
even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal while only 15 
percent identified themselves as liberals 
to gauge the components of kennedys image the poll took 
measures excellent good fair or poor of his accomplishments as 
president his potential for accomplishments had he not been 
assassinated and his leadership judgment and charisma 
although he was rated highly in all categories kennedy drew far 
and away the best ratings for his charisma 60 percent excellent 
next were his leadership and his potential both rated excellent by 
39 percent 
but kennedys excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments 
and his judgment in both about two in 10 said excellent half said 
good but in his only sizable negative scores more than a fifth 
rated him just fair in both categories 
there was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings fiftytwo 
percent overall said the nation would be a better place had kennedy 
lived and served a second term that included 68 percent of the 
democrats polled compared to 34 percent of the republicans 
doubts emerged on the specific issue of vietnam about a third 
said kennedy would have prevented the united states from becoming 
deeply involved in the fighting there but 44 percent said not the 
rest didnt know 
the survey found considerable familiarity with kennedy more than 
half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal about 
him but such awareness waned among younger adults of those 1829 
only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the former 
president

minus 3 percentage points

in the rugged rogue river valley of southern 
oregon the few people who had contact with irwin lehrer knew him as 
a man of few words 
but when president john f kennedy was assassinated lehrer took 
a pen and with a trembling hand but strong heart wrote a rare 
letter to the first lady 
i am just an old man living by myself way up in the 
mountains he wrote john f kennedy was the best president we 
ever had and you are the most wonderful woman in the world anyone 
tries to tell me different has me to whip twin fawns come in my 
yard to eat feed i put out for them ones name is caroline the 
other john john 
lehrers letter is now in a special file at the john f kennedy 
library created by the national archives from condolences sent to 
jacqueline kennedy 
most of the 300000 pages of letters selected from about 3 
million pages are still being catalogued but the couple hundred 
already on file reveal in simple touching and rarely mawkish 
prose how deeply personal the kennedy presidency and passing was 
for average americans 
there are letters from heads of state and celebrities but most 
are from the likes of a selfproclaimed nobody housewife from 
st louis from a retarded boy in riverside calif who labored for 
an hour to print his 45 words from a woman from ripley tenn who 
said that because of kennedy many southerners no longer accept an 
old saying that a child born of a black mama and a black papa his 
days will always be unhappy 
the most frequent reflections are on jfks vigor and humor his 
efforts on behalf of the mentally handicapped and minorities and 
his handling of the cuban missile crisis 
some letters note special personal connections lewis cagle of 
tennessee for instance whose life sentence kennedy commuted three 
days before the assassination and a crippled woman from boston whom 
kennedy once gave a ride when he spotted her struggling to keep up 
with marchers in a parade in his honor 
several of the dozen letter writers contacted 25 years later had 
only vague recollections of what they had written mrs kennedy but 
memories of the assassination and the president were strong and 
little changed 
deborah lynn dills of fort worth texas had written at the age 
of 12 to mrs kennedy when i heard your husbands speech that 
fatal morning i was glowing with pride because of the nice things he 
said about texans but now i am ashamed that i am a texan i wish i 
was not one 
dills is now a pediatric nurse whos back in love with her home 
state but unremitting in her devotion to a president and a period 
she believes was the last time people really felt proud 
she recalled getting the news of the assassination while in 
physical education class she cried and then i remember a girl 
saying good and my turning around and busting her one 
judy knight of orlando fla wrote as a high school senior that 
she was a bigot until kennedy inspired her with his civil rights 
stands and other programs and the riveting media attention given 
the assassination helped steer her to a career in communications 
now as a producer and writer for a commercial film company in 
washington dc she says this current washington scene is a very 
cruel comparison to what that was were all waiting for 
something like him to come back some part of us that feels if 
the right person would step out wed have camelot again 
virginia chetwynd of melrose mass told the ap this country 
simply turned around and got lousy when the both of them went 
referring to kennedy and his brother robert 
her condolences to the first lady included an account of her 
mother a polio victim once being given a ride by kennedy it was 
the highlight of her life she clipped and cut out everything in the 
papers about him it was like he was her own boy 
the letters to mrs kennedy often include notes like youll 
probably never see this but she read thousands of them and 
notations on some indicate that jbk found this one or that one 
especially touching 
in fact it was mrs kennedy who promised almost 25 years ago 
that such a file expected to be completed and available to 
researchers next year would be created 
she inspired many of the letters actor brian keith for example 
wrote the day after christmas 1963 that her courage had helped him 
and his wife when they lost a son nine days earlier 
the letters also shared with her glimpses of the backyard 
tributes that went on around america 
mrs gw robinson of deerfield ill wrote how her 14yearold 
son returned to a tree house he had long since outgrown he raised a 
flag from a halyard there and every morning in the cold dawn 
before school he raised it lowered it to half staff and in the 
chill afternoon quietly took it down 
cynthia biever of nappanee ind wrote that our neighbor 
children named our favorite shortcut path kennedy lane we 
christened it and everything 
a quarter of a century later and now cynthia montgomery of 
ludington mich she had little memory of the event but she 
believes kennedy was an influence in many of the major things of 
my life such as being active and aware politically 
at peninsula high school in gig harbor wash teacher ruth 
crook wrote the news came just before i was due to teach 
shelleys ode to a skylark you were at the hospital numb 
cold choked i put it to the class what do you do go home 
there was silence and no face registered anything at all then a 
boy very quietly without waiting for recognition said no were 
americans lets do the work we have to do 
an indian chief from sun valley calif offered his sympathy and 
then said he had asked the great spirit of his people to provide 
plenty of soft spruce boughs for his rest at night he also said 
that from now on the gentle breeze will be his touch the 
rippling of running water his smile and the song of birds his 
voice 
a few letters were sent to people in the administration 
reclusive author jd salinger sent a telegram to presidential press 
secretary pierre salinger no relation my wife and i simply ache 
for an effectual way to send mrs kennedy and the children our love 
and to say that we would be inexpressibly grateful for a way to be 
of some comfort or use to them surely everyone in the world must be 
heartbroken tonight 
some of the letters were just dropped off at the gravesite one 
signed by just another american concluded goodbye my chief 
my leader my captain goodbye my president goodbye

oh how the world has changed in 25 years 
then mcdonalds bragged over a billion hamburgers sold from 
coast to coast now its simply billions and billions the 
chrysler theater was on the air the weavers were on their farewell 
performance tour and george lincoln rockwell and his american nazi 
party were peddling hate in those days of the quickening civil 
rights movement blacks still were referred to in newspapers as 
negroes 
in 1963 superb mens suits sold in the robert hall clothing 
chain for 3995 sirloin strip steaks went for 139 a pound a 
quart of dewars white label was 639 snow tires on sale were 
1022 wheel balancing and mounting free joe palooka and terry and 
the pirates were in the funnies and so was pogo condoms were sold 
in gas station restroom vending machines or from under the counter 
in drug stores boys still blushed when they asked for them 
tempus fugit time flies 
it stood still that day in dallas when john f kennedy was 
killed but the world that he knew and that knew him is a 
different world today 
then it cost 950 to send a kid to a state college 1907 to a 
private school room board and tuition now those figures are 
4445 and 11330 
northern rhodesia of kennedys day is zambia southern rhodesia 
is zimbabwe the united nations 113 member states have grown to 
159 the worlds population from 32 billion to more than 5 billion 
americas from 189 million to 244 million 
china then an outcast a technological pygmy now bids to launch 
american satellites the soviet union which rattled the nuclear 
saber and blustered we will bury you in kennedys time is 
working with the united states to reduce the number of horrible 
weapons 
at the time of kennedys cuban missile crisis the united states 
had 5000 nuclear weapons the soviets only 300 now each country 
has over 25000 
kennedy revived depressionera food stamps as a pilot program 
now 19 million people use them the number of farms in the united 
states has fallen by more than 1 million to fewer than 22 million 
baseballs major leagues crossed the border to embrace montreal 
and toronto oakland seattle san diego and atlanta got into the 
majors and so have arlington texas halfway between dallas and fort 
worth and anaheim calif home of disneyland the nations game 
however is no longer played professionally in the nations capital 
if you were shopping for early christmas presents in 1963 you 
could choose from wood tennis rackets home movie projectors 
portable typewriters most of which can still be gotten but who 
needs them in the days of graphite rackets camcorders and laptop 
computers 
you couldnt buy a telephone then you can now 
when people talked about using calculators they meant slide 
rules or adding machines you could take the ss france to europe 
buy a vw bug which everyone thought would be around forever cars 
from japan dont be silly 
in 1963 jack nicklaus became the second golfer ever to make

mary haworth has left the advice column field to ann and abby 
the nash rambler has gone the way of the studebaker the desoto and

desoto in missouri 
lunch counters were still closed to blacks when john kennedy was

1963 and 530 million now there is no change in older folks 
complaints about the younger generations taste in music 
kennedy had committed the nation to going to the moon in the 
decade of the 60s and it did but when he died only six americans 
had gone into space since then 12 americans have walked on the 
moon and in all 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 us space 
flights the soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights they 
have female astronauts and so have we 
in 1963 there was no transplanting of hearts but there was

in fairy tales the beautiful princess marries 
the handsome prince and they live happily ever after 
but jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis fairy tale 
shortcircuited on a warm day in dallas when her pink suit was 
splattered with her princes blood in the ensuing 25 years she has 
had to write her own happy ending 
the plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the 
adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the 
national widow her 1968 marriage to greek shipping tycoon aristotle 
onassis engendered outrage and her penchant for privacy has bred 
some resentment 
but once a year she kneels alone at arlington national cemetery 
and once again she becomes the stoic blackveiled widow who stood 
at that spot in november 1963 to bury her husband president john f 
kennedy 
one must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness she once

it is important to remember what jackie kennedy was to america 
and to the world she was the glamorous whisperyvoiced brunette 
whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husbands so 
much so that he laughingly introduced himself as jackies escort 
she was the fashion plate whose designer dresses pillbox hats 
and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her hatless 
husband wounded the fedora trade 
we are on the threshold of a new american elegance thanks to 
mrs kennedys beauty naturalness understatement exposure and 
symbolism said oleg cassini her official designer 
she was the young hostess of a televised tour of the white house 
the graduate of miss porters school and vassar who said her prime 
responsibility was to take care of the president so he can best 
serve the people she was 34 years old when jfk died a striking 
contrast to her matronly predecessors bess truman and mamie 
eisenhower 
most of all she was mistress of camelot 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
she forfeited that title when she married onassis the aging 
greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant kennedy many said 
she was a golddigger she never explained the marriage publicly 
never responded to such headlines as jackie how could you 
she by surviving and being with him jfk when he died so 
dramatically became a legend in her own lifetime said a friend 
paul mathias and she cannot live up to it because no human being 
could 
the marriage foundered quickly and ari and jackie lived separate 
lives when he died in 1975 he left her 120000 in his will she 
won a 26 million settlement from the onassis family 
at the same time stories about jfks escapades while he was 
president began to spread stories about alleged liaisons with 
marilyn monroe and the mistress of mobster sam giancana and others 
suggested that jfks most lasting legacy was the war in vietnam 
camelot wasnt what it used to be

with her millions jackie onassis could have done absolutely 
nothing enjoying her 14room apartment on upper fifth avenue her 
estate in bernardsville nj and the oceanfront compound on 
marthas vineyard while raising her two children caroline and john 
jr 
instead she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for 
doubleday amp co she works there 3 days a week producing ideas and 
acquiring books from authors and agents then guiding the writing of 
manuscripts 
her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment never 
politics her bestsellers have included michael jacksons 
autobiography moonwalk and ballerina gelsey kirklands 
dancing on my grave 
i think people who work themselves have respect for the work of 
others she has said 
her salary reportedly 4000050000 a year is a pittance of 
her net worth estimated at around 50 million plus 200000 a 
year from a trust fund bequeathed by kennedy 
she has made some public appearances in recent years she has 
supported efforts to save city landmarks like grand central 
terminal attending news conferences but saying little and slipping 
out through freight entrances 
on her infrequent appearances at social galas she often dons the 
designs of carolina herrera her date is usually longtime friend 
maurice tempelsman 58 a belgianborn diamond dealer and 
international businessman 
on autumn weekends mrs onassis sometimes rides with the essex 
hunt club near her bernardsville estate she often is among the 
spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby peapack she does 
not mingle with the locals 
she has been seen sailing and waterskiing off marthas vineyard 
with tempelsman but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a 
scarf and sunglasses her island house is at the end of a 2000foot 
driveway 
the signs out front say no trespassing

mrs onassis battles with paparazzi are legendary she 
repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer 
ron galella first obtaining a court order barring galella from 
coming within 30 feet of her or her children then going to court to 
enforce that order 
she declines all interviews according to her spokeswoman nancy 
tuckerman she would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the 
assassination she will not speak on the quartercentury anniversary 
but occasionally new yorkers catch glimpses one newspaper 
recently showed jackie a still youthfullooking grandmother 
crossing a street while engrossed in a book oblivious to the 
photographer even celebrityimmune new yorkers stare when they spot 
her jogging in central park or shopping on madison avenue 
you have two compartments your private and your public life 
she once explained i think im more of a private person i dont 
really like to call attention to anything

twentyfive years after the assassination after jackies fall 
from grace with a greek after revelations about the kennedy era and 
after her determined efforts to maintain her privacy a poll asked

wives second was nancy reagan whose antidrug campaign was the 
stuff of current headlines

when john f kennedy jr took the podium at the 
democratic national convention in july the national memory drifted 
back nearly 25 years to the minds image of a 3yearold boy 
saluting his fathers horsedrawn caisson 
but this was no johnjohn on the stage in atlanta this was a 
darkly handsome wellspoken law student who would soon be declared 
americas sexiest man by a national magazine this was a 28yearold 
millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with the poor 
more than a quartercentury has passed since kennedy and his 
sister caroline now 30 charmed the nation with their oval office 
shenanigans 
they endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and their 
uncle bobby in 1968 they adjusted when their mother married greek 
shipping magnate aristotle onassis in 1968 
still by all reports john and caroline thrived they did well 
in private schools became proficient in sports made lasting

with varying success new video remembrances of 
john f kennedy reflect the magic and the fears of his 1000 days in 
the white house 
theyre most effective when they show the young president 
speaking for himself in the witty repartee at news conferences 
for instance and when they let realtime recordings register the 
grief at his death a reporters voice breaking as he dictates from 
dallas a waiter sobbing into a starched napkin at the luncheon 
where jfk was headed that day 
onehour biographies can hardly tell a life story like kennedys 
in the end these retrospectives seem to move too fast missing 
milestones 
in presenting his personal life they show the outdoorsman 
sailing or playing touch football the father cuddling his kids the 
dashing husband of a dazzling wife the portrait that made the 
camelot myth the tabloids man of clay is nowhere to be found 
still its nice to hear a president straightforwardly admit a 
big mistake as kennedy does a year or so after the bay of pigs 
its nice to feel the energy of an administration that holds a 
summit with the soviet leader within six months of taking office 
its nice to see again and again that ohsoeasy smile 
here are glimpses of the new videos 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the most personal of the remembrances this one used 200 hours of 
film and at least as importantly 300 hours of voice recordings so 
jfk is heard narrating his life 
at one point as hes seen reviewing troops and meeting with 
advisers the familiar voice confides the responsibilities placed 
on the united states are greater than i imagined them to be and 
there are greater limitations upon our ability to bring about a 
favorable result than i imagined its much easier to make the 
speeches than it is to finally make the judgments 
there are lighter moments in the film which will air on hbo 
cable in november during a televised callin show when hes running 
for the senate a caller suggests his wife would make a better 
senator the smile then i agree with that but in any case i 
have the benefit of her advice so maybe ill improve

david l wolper was executive producer of this documentarystyle 
effort first released the year after the assassination under a 
foreboding musical score it follows the movements of jfk and of lee 
harvey oswald effectively splicing news film with reenactments by 
people who played supporting parts a cab driver who picked up 
oswald the shoeshop owner who spotted the fugitive and tipped 
police 
waiting for the motorcade the camera looks through a scope and 
fixes the crosshairs on passing traffic 
the script is full of detail the secret service had checked the 
table decorations at the luncheon jfk was going to and would select 
his steak at random from 2500 the elegant language of the script 
may seem dated but complements kennedys own rhetoric

for example in civil rights reform he waited until unrest pushed 
him to act halfway through his presidency the new frontier had 
remained unconquered jennings says 
jfk built up troop numbers in vietnam but took the first steps 
toward coexistence with the soviets toward the end he was

behind locked doors at the national archives 
sit hundreds of dusty boxes the product of the house of 
representatives twoyear investigation of the john f kennedy and 
martin luther king jr slayings 
a decade has passed since the house select committee on 
assassinations ended its work by concluding that kennedy and king 
were apparently the victims of conspiracies but the committee 
documents which scholars say would be important research tools 
appear no closer to being opened to the public 
what were talking about is the records of our political 
history two of the most important events of the 20th century 
said kevin walsh a former committee aide who has led a small group 
of private kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records 
this is about the publics right to know 
most of the work conducted by the warren commission which 
concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the kennedy slaying 
has been opened to the public a move that has helped researchers 
evaluate and in many cases strongly criticize that investigation 
but the house committee the only government investigation to 
conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder ran out 
of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents 
without such a vote the materials fell under the houses 
socalled 50year rule keeping congressional documents under 
lock and key for a halfcentury 
the late rep stewart b mckinney rconn a member of the 
select committee had taken up the scholars cause in congress 
fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents but he 
died in 1987 
rep louis stokes dohio the committee chairman originally led 
opposition to that resolution but had a change of heart after 
mckinneys death from aids and said he would work for the 
informations release 
that buoyed researchers but the 1988 legislative session came 
and went without any action on the committee documents 
house counsel steven r ross said he expected stokes to act next 
year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records 
but he declined to provide specifics 
the committee sent shockwaves around the world in december 1978 
when it concluded that kennedys killing in 1963 was probably the 
result of a conspiracy pointing to accoustic evidence that experts 
said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman the committee 
also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the king slaying 
in memphis five years later 
but in 1982 the national academy of sciences concluded that 
there was no evidence of a second kennedy gunman and that the 
independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a 
tape recording made from a motorcycle policemans open microphone 
the experts testimony had been the key to the committees 
conclusion before it the panel had planned to conclude that there 
was no conspiracy 
despite the academy study and the justice departments final 
conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either slaying 
stokes stands by his committees report 
its a difference between scientists stokes said

after 25 years dallas finally has matched courage 
with cash and will open the sixth floor of the texas school book 
depository to the world 
over the decades the old warehouse has survived arsonists and 
calls for demolition for a time all buyers shunned it all this 
ill will because of a new young order clerk named lee harvey oswald 
who perched at a corner window on boxes of rolling readers 
apparently fired two maybe three rifle shots at a motorcade 
passing below 
now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside 
elevator that will carry up to halfamillion visitors a year to the 
infamous sixth floor where they can view an exhibit on president 
john f kennedy and look out that corner window down to dealey plaza 
its a 35 million project 12 years in the making one that 
dallas for a long time never wanted for fear of drawing more 
attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city 
what we are doing is facing up to our history said lindalyn 
adams chairwoman of the dallas county historical foundation who 
has made the exhibit a decadelong personal crusade 
the old saying is time heals all wounds said lee jackson 
the chief of the county commissioners who made completion of the 
kennedy exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech 
its not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover 
over some period of time like gettysburg or the alamo or 
yorktown jackson said its taken dallas 25 years to reach this 
consensus 
every day of the year virtually around the clock a steady 
trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to dealey 
plaza and the grassy knoll they find monuments but then learn they 
honor the citys founders 
they see a 10sentence plaque on the side of the book depository 
the nine sentences noting the spot where dallas was settled are 
followed by this 
on nov 22 1963 the building gained national notoriety when 
lee harvey oswald allegedly shot and killed president john f 
kennedy from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade 
passed the site 
and then they invariably count six floors up 
next feb 20 on presidents day the sixth floor exhibit 
will open to the public 
more than 1 million has been raised privately with 300000 to 
go the fundraising effort took years adams said and didnt really 
pick up until jackson made it a county priority 
its easy to misunderstand what were doing mrs adams said 
there is a feeling among many of us who were living in dallas at 
the time that wed just as soon not be reminded 
to permit construction to begin the county advanced 22 
million which will be repaid through the 4 admission charge 
the exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together 
with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker martin jurow 
terms of endearment waltz across texas breakfast at 
tiffanys 
its far more than an assassination museum adams said 
its about the life of president kennedy and his death its 
about the 60s and what dallas was like it puts everything in the 
context of american cultural history 
the nonprofit exhibit will have few actual artifacts no rifle 
for example only an original of the blackbordered antikennedy ad 
headlined welcome to dallas mr president that appeared in the 
dallas morning news that day along with a reporters notes and an 
associated press teletype machine 
there will be 400 photographs many taken by the 22 people who 
were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired 
the corner window will be sealed by glass panels although the 
actual greenpainted window frame was removed by a previous owner 
the spots where oswalds rifle three spent cartridges and palm 
prints were found will be recreated based on police photos 
the building like dealey plaza is remarkably unchanged from 
nov 22 1963 
the school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for 
eight years after the assassination a nashville tenn promoter 
bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a 
kennedy museum ownership reverted to the previous owner dallas oil 
and real estate mogul d harold byrd who then could not sell the 
building calls for its demolition were turned back because the city 
refused to issue a demolition permit 
in 1977 voters approved a bond package that included 400000 to 
purchase the warehouse and convert it except for the sixth floor 
into county office space 
it is now the dallas county administration building jacksons 
secondfloor office looks out on the spot where kennedy was shot 
no one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck 
by the number of curious visitors jackson said and everyone 
who works here is aware theyre located in a place of unusual public 
interest 
over time jackson said dallas realized the world probably would 
never stop coming to dealey plaza 
over time people finally felt they were able to put the 
experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer 
viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the 
assassination he said 
over time the community has seen that the interest of the 
world is permanent and enduring

it is a novel with an ending dictated a 
quartercentury ago a president is assassinated his purported 
killer gunned down while in police custody 
it also is a union of fact and fiction a work of more than 100 
real and invented characters that teeters on yesterdays headlines 
with its tale of the assassination of john f kennedy the 
labyrinthine network of spies and mercenaries of 
civil servants the brutal underworld of the mob and the lives and 
times of lee harvey oswald and jack ruby 
in libra author don delillo sets up the theory that 
kennedys assassination was part of a cia scheme to rejuvenate the corruption 
the 
anticastro movement in the united states following the bay of pigs 
debacle he futher hypothesizes that ruby killed oswald as part of a 
conspiracy with the mafia to pay off a nightclub debt 
he uses literary roads once traveled by such technicians of the 
nonfiction novel as the late truman capote in in cold blood 
and norman mailer in armies of the night oswald and others are 
not presented to us as mere cardboard shadows of news reports 
delillo sks have been written about 
kennedy and his family according to the john f kennedy library in 
boston the assassination feeds a public hungry for any nugget that 
can explain what to many is still a hideous riddle 
lincolns death was tragic but we remember what he did as 
president kennedy didnt do as much as lincoln he didnt have 
time kennedy chronicler friend and historian william manchester 
has said jacks death was a tragedy and his life was a triumph i 
think we should remember more than the tragedy we should remember 
the triumph 
the kennedy slaying seems to haunt delillos earlier works such 
as running dog and players his americana ends in dallas 
at dealey plaza 
however libra which was oswalds astrological sign is no 
mere assassination theory book its tapestry is richer with threads 
of human frailities fears and desires woven into it it is an 
intricate design of twists and turns and surprises

lee turned up the handle drew the bolt back 
the president reacted arms coming up elbows high and wide 
there were pigeons suddenly everywhere cracking down from the 
eaves and beating west 
the report sounded over the plaza flat and clear 
the presidents fists were clenched near his throat arms bowed 
out 
lee drove the bolt forward jerking the handle down 
the lincoln was moving slower now it was almost dead still it 
was sitting naked in the street 80 yards from the underpass

in a 1983 rolling stone article delillo called the kennedy 
assassination a story about our uncertain grip on the world 
it was a tale he said exploded into life by a homeless man 
who himself could not grip things tightly and hold them fast whose 
soulscarred loneliness and rage led him to invent an american 
moment that echoes down the decades 
after writing the article for rolling stone he spent three years 
researching and writing libra he shoveled his way through the 
government printing offices 26 volumes of the warren commission 
report which concluded that oswald was the sole assassin he also 
visited places in dallas and new orleans where oswald had lived 
delillo has an afterword in libra a disclaimer of sorts 
this is a work of imagination while drawing from the historical 
record ive made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any 
question raised by the assassination

where were you and what was your reaction when 
you heard that president john f kennedy had been shot 
john jovich who was 8 years old when he overheard the school 
principal whisper news of the shooting to his teacher recently put 
that question to 250 celebrities and assembled their responses into 
a book reflections on jfks assassination published by 
woodbine house 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii recalled being near the senate 
chambers and realizing that sen edward kennedy dmass was the 
presiding officer i immediately dispatched a page to tell senator 
kennedy to leave the rostrum for a matter of utmost emergency it 
was then that senator kennedy learned of his brothers shooting 
singer billy joel said he first tried to console an eighthgrade 
classmate who was crying he later took a long walk feeling a 
deep bitterness and a despair i had never before experienced in my 
life 
rona barrett the hollywood columnist remembers being at a 
famous palm springs racquet club people came running out of the 
clubhouse screaming that someone had shot jack kennedy 
roy rogers said the assassination proved to me that we have a 
lot more subversive activists in our country than we realize 
former president jimmy carter said he had walked into his 
warehouse to weigh a load of grain when a group of farmers told him 
of the shooting he said he prayed and wept openly for the first 
time in 10 years for the first time since the day my own father 
died 
novelist isaac asimov said all he could think about was that i 
didnt want johnson but i got him 
burt bacharach said he was working on a song with hal david when 
he found out about the shooting he said he left the building and 
went to a bar where he eventually got into a fight with some 
people who were having a good time laughing etc totally

it came as no surprise to anyone in latin 
america that a novelist poet and essayist mario vargas llosa 
would seek to become president of peru 
for vargas llosa frequently mentioned as a future winner of the 
nobel prize for literature is following a centuriesold tradition 
of an area where cultural figures both classical and pop have also 
played important political roles 
perus vice president luis alberto sanchez himself a writer and 
educator as well as politician says that in latin america 
individuals who have distinguished themselves in literature and art 
can carry their prestige into politics because they live in half 
finished societies that value men of multiple talents 
in societies that have not evolved greatly there is little 
specialization sanchez who is 88 and has written more than 100 
books said in an interview 
the politician can be a writer a priest a military man many 
things 
vargas llosa who once described himself as a specialist in 
fanatasies in dreams stands in sharp contrast to the 
professional politicians and technocrats in many other parts of the 
world 
this is definitely not my calling the 52yearold writer 
said recently if my country were not what it is politics would 
probably be a very secondary concern in my life 
instead the author of such books as the green house and 
conversation in a cathedral finds himself leading a centerright 
political movement that seeks to prevent the election in 1990 of 
alfonso barrantes a declared communist now favored to win the 
presidency 
i am fundamentally a writer but at the same time i am a person 
concerned about the reality of his country and above all its 
future said vargas llosa 
peru is wracked by its worst economic crisis of the century with 
the annual inflation rate surpassing 1200 percent it also is 
bloodied by a savage leftist insurgency that has claimed more than 
12000 lives 
vargas llosa has been traveling into perus remote backlands 
climbing down mine shafts high in the andes and visiting isolated 
indian villages in the amazon forests to spread his message of the 
dangers that await peru if the next presidential election is won by 
communists 
they would impoverish us even more than we are now and little 
by little just as has occurred with other marxist regimes they 
would totally trample our political freedoms he declared at a 
recent rally 
elsewhere jose luis rodriguez latin americas most popular 
ballard singer speaks seriously of running for president of 
venezuela ruben blades one of the regions top singers and 
composers of salsa music talks of one day seeking the presidency of 
panama 
although writers and artists participate actively in politics 
throughout the region only a few have been successful in their bids 
for the presidency of a country 
romulo gallegos venezuelas greatest novelist was elected 
president in 1947 juan bosch regarded as the dominican republics 
finest short story writer was elected president of that caribbean 
country in 1962 
both men were overthrown after only months in office by their 
countries armed forces which viewed them as arrogant and soft on 
leftists 
gallegos had a lot of communists around him and they began to 
flatter him and that is a writers great weakness his vanity we 
are all vain said sanchez a founder of perus populist aprista 
party 
boschs ouster led to a 1965 popular rebellion that ended after 
us troops invaded the dominican republic at 79 bosch is still 
active in politics he received 18 percent of the vote in 1986 but 
polls indicate that if the elections were held today he would win 
against conservative president joaquin balaguer a lawyer and also a 
writer 
in brazil where the national language is portuguese president 
jose sarney has written collections of poetry and short stories 
some of which have been translated into english spanish french and 
russian 
sarney has called his election to the prestigious brazilian 
academy of letters the greatest moment of pure happiness in my 
life 
the list of distinguished latin american writers and artists who 
have sought public office or influenced public policy through their 
political activism is long 
chiles most famed literary figure the poet pablo neruda winner 
of the nobel prize for literature in 1971 was the chilean communist 
partys candidate for president in 1970 but he withdrew to give his 
support to a coalition candidate salvador allende a marxist who 
went on to win and was overthrown in a military coup three years 
later 
the regions best known writer colombias nobel prize winner 
gabriel garcia marquez is a vigorous defender of fidel castros 
cuba 
in mexico the late worldrenowned muralists david alfaro 
siqueiros and diego rivera were leading members of the mexican 
communist party 
mexicos poet and essayist octavio paz and novelist carlos 
fuentes have both won the miguel de cervantes prize the most 
important literary honor for spanishlanguage writers and are 
perennial candidates for the nobel prize both have served in the 
mexican diplomatic service and have been outspoken in their 
political views 
fuentes currently a professor of literature at harvard 
university has been a strong critic of us policy in central 
america 
octavio paz going against the current of leftist sympathy among 
latin american intellectuals says he has little use for marxism 
mexicos leftist intellectuals say they have little use for paz 
although he never served in public office argentinas most 
distinguished writer jorge luis borges was known not for what he 
did in the political arena but what he wrote and said about it he 
frequently expressed his scorn for elected governments in argentina 
and other latin american nations 
you americans are worthy of democracy but we are not borges 
said in an interview before his death last year in this country 
we always find some rascal to vote for 
nicaraguas leading poet is the rev ernesto cardenal a roman 
catholic priest who served for years as culture minister in the 
leftist sandinista government an immediately recognizable figure 
for his black beret cardenal has been criticized for using his 
international prestige to defend the regime 
but vice president sergio ramirez of nicaragua who just 
published his third novel is considered the most influential 
intellectual within the sandinista government 
the venezuelan writer carlos rangel has sharply criticized the 
role of intellectuals in latin american public life in a 
controversial book from the good savage to the good 
revolutionary 
the quality of work of these writers or their academic 
distinction is often mediocre he wrote many of them have 
achieved prominence because they were born into undemanding 
societies 
rangel excepted from his criticism a handful of distiguished 
writers among them vargas llosa 
vargas llosa has unleashed his own criticism of intellectuals in 
politics whom he accuses of irresponsibly urging violent revolution 
in peru

mexicos foremost living writers octavio paz 
and carlos fuentes are among the sharpest critics of mexicos 
system of government under which the same party been in power for 
six decades 
paz charges the longdominant institutional revolutionary party 
which emerged from the 191020 revolution has become corrupt 
fuentes maintains the revolution itself was betrayed and corrupted 
even before it was over 
both writers were born in mexico city and are recipients of the 
prestigious miguel cervantes prize the foremost literary award for 
spanish writers both lived abroad for many years and served as 
mexican diplomats and both resigned for the same reason the 
bloody suppression of student riots in mexico city in 1968 
although they no longer have any direct influence on government 
their works and statements provoke thought and sometimes acrimonious 
debate among their countrymen 
paz once an admirer of marxism now calls himself a 
europeanstyle social democrat and says he has little use for 
marxist ideology 
fuentes has been called a liberal but so far has not 
committed himself to any ideology he has been criticized by pazs 
fans on grounds that he has spent so much time abroad that he 
doesnt know mexico anymore 
even so his influence was demonstrated after the us 
presidential election when his long analysis of the american outcome 
was published on the front page of one of mexicos leading 
newspapers excelsior 
fuentes credited george bushs aide james baker with running a 
brilliant cynical and pragmatic campaign and said bakers 
appointment as secretary of state was a good sign for usmexico 
relations because of what he called bakers pragmatic turn of mind 
pazs most influential work the 1950 booklength essay the 
labyrinth of solitude attacks the notion that the mexican has 
developed a philosophy of his own instead he says the mexican has 
isolated himself from the world and should seek to break that 
pathological solitude 
the whole history of mexico can be regarded as a search for 
our own selves which have been deformed by alien institutions and 
a form that will express them paz says 
in fuentes best known novel the death of artemio cruz the 
reader listens in on the thoughts of the dying hero who reflects on 
the 12 most important days of his life and the events that brought 
on the corruption of the revolutions ideals 
paz was born march 31 1914 and lived in exile in the united 
states for a time as a teenager because of his fathers 
revolutionary activities 
while still a law student he became a protege of the chilean 
nobel prizewinning poet pablo neruda who helped him publish his 
first book of poems inspired him with marxist ideals and sent him 
to spain at the height of that countrys 193639 civil war 
paz joined spains leftist republican forces insisted on being 
sent to the front but was not considered reliable enough to be 
given a rifle 
within a few years he became disillusioned with marxism and had a 
falling out with neruda then the chilean ambassador 
paz joined the mexican foreign service but quit in 1968 when he 
was ambassador to india to protest the suppression of the student 
riots he turned against the institutional revolutionary party in 
power for the past 59 years which he has often called corrupt 
he also raised hackles by equating cubas fidel castro with 
chiles rightist dictator gen augusto pinochet claiming that both 
are equally repressive 
four years ago he caused a furor by calling nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista revolution which mexico supports inconsequential 
the son of a career diplomat fuentes was born on nov 11 1928 
has lived most of his life abroad and is fluent in english he is 
currently a professor of literature at harvard university 
fuentes too joined the diplomatic service but resigned in 1977 
while he was ambassador to france because gustavo diaz ordaz was 
named ambassador to spain diaz ordaz had been president in 1968 
and fuentes said he did not want to be in the same service with the 
man who ordered the mexico city massacre that left at least 36 dead 
fuentes novels include hydra head where the air is 
clear and old gringo the fictionalized story of american 
writer and journalist ambrose bierce who disappeared in mexico 
during the revolution 
literary critics and historian enrique krauze pazs friend and 
colleague have accused fuentes of losing touch with mexico 
in an article he wrote for the new republic last june bitingly 
entitled the guerrilla dandy krauze asked of fuentes is he a 
willing exile from mexico in the united states or a reluctant exile 
from the united states in mexico 
his work simplifies the country his view is frivolous 
unrealistic and all too often false krauze added 
i visit mexico regularly said fuentes in reply i go to 
places where no one goes i talk with the common people more than 
with the intellectuals

caught in a vise between the financial needs of 
children and the care of elderly parents a generation of americans 
is confronted with planning problems that almost defy solution 
they are the sandwich generation age 45 to 55 years with 
collegeage children and parents whose incomes are limited 
unlike the very poor the minorities the elderly and 
disadvantaged this group has little political clout its existence 
barely recognized it is nevertheless destined to grow because of 
biological and sociological factors 
among those factors parents are living longer but their 
incomeproducing years generally are not being extended and young 
marrieds are waiting until the last tick of the biological clock 
before having children 
as a consequence the sandwich generations parents become aged 
and more dependent just as the offspring are preparing for or 
entering college rising tuitions add to the pressure 
to deal with the phenomenon financial planners are seeking 
creative investment techniques for the sandwich generation but in 
almost every instance those techniques require many years to become 
effective 
moreover the old and oncetrusted method of shifting assets to a 
controlled trust and automatically getting them back after the 
demise of the parents does not work any more thanks to the 1986 tax 
reform act 
in addition the tax laws make inefficient the simple direct 
technique of providing support from the checkbook because such 
funding involves aftertax dollars effectively reducing the benefit 
to 72 cents on the dollar 
the tax law does leave two exceptions but many members of the 
sandwich generation may find them inapplicable to them the 
exceptions are 
if you provide more than onehalf of a parents support and the 
parent earns less than 1900 a year you may claim the 1000 
dependency exemption on your tax return 
you may claim your parents medical expenses along with your own 
as long as you provide onehalf of your parents support and in 
this case the 1000 gross income test need not be met 
judy walsh an accounting partner in the san antonio office of 
deloitte haskins amp sells believes a member of the sandwich 
generation should find a way to transfer assets to parents so that 
the parents instead are taxed 
walsh who made a special study of the situation notes that if 
you transferred titled property to your parents particularly 
property with an income you can effectively move income to their 
lower tax bracket 
one approach along this line would be to set up a trust put 
assets in the trust and instruct the trustee to use all income for 
the parents this income then becomes taxed to the parents 
while you lose total control of the funds the trust could be so 
arranged that the assets are distributed as provided in the parents 
wills which means the money could very well revert to you 
ms walsh suggests that a second plan would be to create the 
trust to pay income to the parents for life with the assets to go 
to the sandwich generations children upon the parents death 
this plan might combine support of aging parents at a minimum 
aftertax cost and provide gifts to children for education still 
there is no assurance that the money would be available in time to 
help pay tuition 
another strategy is to have aging parents sell their home and use 
the funds for support they would then live in a residence perhaps 
a condominium purchased by their children who could tap their own 
home for an equity loan 
if all works as intended these might be among the results 
the aging parents could shelter up to 125000 of the gain from 
the sale of their home 
they would have money to live on 
they could pay their children rent 
the sandwich generation members might have tax deductions from 
their equity loan 
the sandwich generation members might be able to deduct rental 
property losses 
they also would have an investment that if it were properly 
selected might earn an excellent return 
none of the solutions is without risk especially in view of 
congress inclination to change tax laws but for those in a very 
difficult financial squeeze they at least offer hope that the pain 
will be reduced

a new computerized hotel reservations system 
being developed by media tycoon rupert murdoch and nine hotel chains 
could allow travelers to book rooms like they book airline tickets 
the new system called ultraswitch will provide a central 
electronic source of hotel room information for the participating 
hotels and for travel agents officials of the venture told a news 
conference monday 
currently only a small fraction of hotel rooms are booked 
electronically using the computer systems provided by major 
airlines to travel agents most hotel bookings are made through 
tollfree 800 numbers or directly with hotels methods which are 
more expensive for the hotels to process 
under ultraswitch the number of electronic hotel bookings made 
by travel agents will increase the officials said the system also 
will provide a central pool of information on rooms available at the 
participating hotels 
by using new computer software ultraswitch will link the five 
existing airline reservations systems in the united states with 
those used by participating hotels 
if a hotel is full for example it will be able to tell travel 
agents what rooms are available at other participating hotels in the 
same city this is the practice followed by the airlines which 
often will book a passenger on another carriers flight if one of 
their own flights is full 
ultraswitch which is expected to serve hotels in the united 
states and abroad is scheduled to be operating before the end of 
next year 
the consumer will now have the best opportunity to get what he 
wants said robert d mcgrail senior vice president of marketing 
for days inns of america 
mcgrail also is chairman of the hotel industry switch co or 
thisco formed by the nine participating hotel chains and murdoch 
electronic publishing a subsidiary of murdochs news america 
publishing inc 
the participating chains are best western days inns hyatt 
hotels la quinta inns marriott corp quality inns ramada inns 
sheraton hotels and trusthouse forte hotels they each will have one 
share in thisco murdoch electronic publishing which is putting up 
8 million to 9 million to finance the project will own a special 
class of stock in thisco 
mcgrail said the group also hoped to attract as shareholders 
other hotel chains and possibly airlines and other companies the 
nine participating hotel chains represent about half of the major 
hotel chains in the united states 
well see a marriage here eventually between airline and 
hotel reservations systems and travel agents said murdoch who flew 
in from london for the news conference 
murdoch said he got involved because some of the magazines he 
publishes are entirely dependent on advertising by hotels and 
airlines the publications include hotel and travel index travel 
weekly official hotel and resort guide meetings and conventions 
magazine official meetings and facilities guide and european 
travel and life magazine 
the software for ultraswitch will be developed mainly by anasazi 
corp of phoenix which has developed programs for the hotel and 
financial services industries

massachusetts insurance officials reacted with 
surprise to allstate insurance cos decision to become the third 
major insurer in two yeras to stop writing new auto insurance 
policies in the state 
we had no advance knowledge peter rice deputy massachusetts 
insurance commissioner said monday i guess our overall 
assessment is we think the company was premature in assessing the 
effect of the recently passed auto reform bill on the market 
allstate officials say frustration and the states regulatory 
climate prompted the companys decision which comes amid a wave of 
anger by insurers nationwide over changing regulatory climates 
allstate has lost 115 million in massachusetts over the past 
five years largely as a result of the unique regulatory 
environment for auto insurance said kevin sullivan director of 
allstates group auto division 
sullivan made his comments during a news conference to announce 
allstates decision not to renew its license when it expires june 30 
we have no intention to return sullivan said 
the announcement came about a week after a number of insurers 
doing business in california promised to leave that market the 
nations biggest after voters approved a measure providing deep 
cuts in auto and other insurance rates 
allstate will continue selling new policies and follow through on 
all its massachusetts policies until they expire sullivan said 
last week a bill was signed into law that will reduce 1989 
insurance premiums in massachusetts by 16 percent or 400 million 
by cracking down on fraud and abuse in the system reducing required 
coverages and limiting the number of auto cases that end up in 
court the legislation came after industry court challenges and rate 
decisions increased rates by nearly one third since 1986 to among 
the highest in the country 
allstate saw some encouraging improvements for consumers in the 
bill but sullivan said it did little or nothing to restore free 
markets to massachusetts 
massachusetts state law requires all companies wishing to sell 
any form of insurance in the state to participate in an open 
highrisk auto insurance pool 
state law also forbids open competition for automobile insurance 
instead the state insurance commissioner annually calculates a 
single statewide rate for each category of compulsory and optional 
insurance only texas has a similar system 
allstate based in northbrook ill has been doing business in 
massachusetts since 1951 the company has 66 percent of the 
massachusetts auto insurance market and 52 percent of the states 
homeowners insurance market 
massachusetts accounts for some 199 million of allstates 
premiums annually or about 2 percent of the companys business in 
the united states 
allstate has 573 full and parttime employees at several 
locations in massachusetts sullivan said allstate will make every 
effort to try to relocate qualified employees and predicted there 
would be few or no layoffs 
in california voters last week approved proposition 103 which 
mandates that property and casualty insurers roll their rates back 
to a level 20 percent below those in effect on nov 8 1987 in a 
addition drivers with good records would get an additional 20 
percent off 
the california supreme court has delayed the start of the law 
while it considers its constitutionality sullivan said allstate was 
confident the insurers would prevail in court 
he also said allstate had no intention to pull out of california 
which he described as quite different from massachusetts in that it 
allows open competition 
more than 100 companies sell auto insurance in massachusetts but 
90 percent of the coverage is written by the top 25 insurers 
allstate ranked fourth in statewide market share 
allstates departure was preceded in the past two years by kemper 
group firemans fund insurance cos and two smaller companies all 
cited millions of dollars in losses in the massachusetts auto market 
for their decisions 
to continue writing other forms of insurance in the state kemper 
group recently won state regulatory and legislative approval to set 
up a spinoff company to assume its auto insurance business 
firemans fund meanwhile agreed to pay a 45 million settlement 
to the state as compensation to the highrisk drivers pool so it 
could abandon the massachusetts market since reaching that 
settlement last year the company has proposed buying a subsidiary 
firm with massachusetts licenses so firemans fund could reenter 
the state and sell other forms of insurance

japanese companies are poised to erode the 
united states lead in the biotechnology race partly by introducing 
biotech lipstick wine detergent and other products that help build 
grassroots support for the field according to a panel of industry 
experts 
the japanese are more unique and more innovative in the use of 
biotech said akihiro yoshikawa a biotechnology research director 
at the university of california at berkeley he also predicted japan 
would be the world biotechnology leader by the year 2000 
yoshikawa made his remarks at a news conference monday marking 
the opening of biotech usa a threeday industry conference and 
exhibition participants called on american business government and 
research leaders to forge a longterm strategy including 
government assistance to help the united states maintain its 
competitive place in the international biotechnology market 
industry watchers fear history will repeat itself and the united 
states will lose its lead in biotechnology as it lost the lead in 
electronics and computer chip manufacturing 
we have a tremendous lead we discovered it and its sort of 
been our baby said sen lawton chiles dfla 
we still have time to do something if we can get our act 
together said chiles who sponsored legislation this year to 
consolidate the governments role in biotechnology we can do a 
hell of a lot better job than weve done in some other areas in 
fact weve got to other countries are not sitting still 
chiles legislation failed but its key elements have been 
implemented he said 
yoshikawa joked that you dont want to try japanese biotech 
wine but nevertheless praised japanese companies for introducing 
household products created through biotechnology 
people are not afraid of trying something new he said 
that may be a key factor for japanese success in biotechnology 
the wine is made with a tissue culture of the slowgrowing 
ginseng root that is produced in a test tube and purplecolored 
biotech lipstick is made with a tissue culture pigment rather than a 
costly plantbased coloring agent he said 
biotech companies cannot survivewithout some systematic 
government protections yoshikawa said mentioning funding 
product protections and other support mechanisms 
japan is the leading threat to americas edge according to 
panelists who said japanese product approval regulations and patent 
laws can slow the introduction of american products in japan 
george rathmann president of amgen a biotech firm based in 
thousand oaks calif said government support could include 
speeding up the us patent process and possibly subsidizing 
research

chubb corp faced a major image problem from 
a minor part of its insurance business but the companys handling 
of controversy over its drought insurance should keep its name 
relatively unclouded analysts say 
they really exhibited the type of concern about the quality of 
their business and their reputation said carol manning an 
analyst at smith barney in new york 
chubb took a major step toward putting the controversy behind it 
last week when it announced a 48 million settlement to a 
classaction suit representing 8000 farmers in 10 midwestern 
states farmers had sued when applications for insurance over this 
summers drought were denied 
us district judge carl rubin in cincinnati still must approve 
the settlement 
chubb based in warren was prepared to offer 40 million in 
insurance for below average rainfall but brokers sold more than 
300 million in coverage enraging the farmers who were denied 
coverage and prompting at least seven state insurance departments to 
launch proceedings against the company 
chubb took steps to repair the damage including granting 11 
million in goodwill payments setting up a crisis center to answer 
questions and taking out newspaper advertisements all in advance of 
last weeks settlement 
i think they as a company want to get this behind them and 
out of the press said jamie guenther an analyst at duff amp 
phelps inc of chicago 
they are a company with a sizable ego to match what is over 
time a pretty darn good company guenther said they have 
nurtured their reputation 
chubb bent over backwards to appease all parties involved 
said michael lewis of dean witter reynolds inc in new york 
weather insurance constitutes less than 1 percent of chubbs

financially costs associated with the insurance and controversy 
could cost investors about 76 cents a share for 1988 chubb has 
estimated jeffrey cohen of goldman sachs amp co in new york 
expects 1988 earnings to be 8 a share excluding onetime tax 
benefits 
chubb earned 345 million or 829 a share in 1987 it is the 
nations 16th largest property and casualty insurer with assets of 
94 billion as of sept 30 
analysts said the drought insurance program was unusual partly 
because chubb had an outside managing general agent good weather 
international design and handle the policy that was a rarity for 
chubb and unlikely to happen again said lewis 
the company has said good weather exceeded its authority in 
offering more than 40 million in insurance 
i think theyll be more careful with how they deal with 
managing general agents said ms manning said 
eventually lewis said wall street will forget about the 
controversy and concentrate on 1989 numbers 
chubb is not contemplating offering a similar type of drought 
insurance next year said company spokeswoman gail devlin she said 
it was not appropriate to discuss plans beyond that

the incoming chairman of the house budget 
committee says tax increases will be needed next year to make 
legally required cuts in the federal deficit despite 
presidentelect george bushs antitax stance 
anybody whos dealt with budget issues knows the size of the 
challenge is too large to exempt any areas rep leon panetta 
dcalif said in an interview once you say this area wont be 
considered you paint yourself into a corner 
panetta said new revenues will have to be part of any package for 
the required reduction of red ink by tens of billions of dollars 
regardless of bushs oftrepeated campaign pledge no new taxes 
under the grammrudman balanced budget law the deficit for the 
1990 fiscal year which begins oct 1 is not to exceed 100 
billion 
last week just two days after bush was elected the reagan 
administrations office of management and budget raised its 1990 
deficit estimate to 132 billion panetta said he believes the 
shortfall will be even higher closer to 140 billion or 150 
billion 
if the deficit target is exceeded the law requires automatic 
spending cuts to pare the red ink to 100 billion 
panetta said bushs wellknown read my lips promise to oppose 
tax increases create a potential for confrontation between 
democrats and republicans 
republicans will feel a commitment was made that cant be 
breached in any way and democrats will say why should we vote for a 
tax increase if he has made that commitment panetta said 
panetta who takes over the budget panel when lawmakers return in 
january said he believes bushs willingness to compromise will be 
apparent when he submits his first budget to congress perhaps in 
february or march president reagan will present his final budget to 
congress on jan 9 but lame duck presidents final budgets can be 
rewritten by their successors 
if reagan submits his budget proposal and if it reflects the 
same reagan priorities that hes submitted time and time again that 
have been declared dead on arrival and if bush replays those same 
priorities that will be a signal that were in for more 
confrontation on the budget issue panetta said 
panetta said he hopes bush will begin seeking congressional input 
early on so his spending plan reflects agreements with capitol hill 
on taxes 
if not i suspect well be fighting tooth and nail to see what 
can be done he said 
on the campaign trail bush proposed a flexible freeze plan 
for balancing the budget under the proposal overall government 
spending would be allowed to keep up with inflation with cuts in 
some programs and increases for others he never provided any 
specifics however 
panetta said that with bush insisting he will not slash large 
chunks of the budget such as defense and social security there 
simply will not be enough vulnerable programs left to yield sizable 
savings from spending cuts 
ive looked at that thing in a dozen different ways and dont 
see how it works panetta said of the flexible freeze plan 
panetta said he believes bush has not yet made it politically 
impossible for himself to agree to tax increases he said that just 
as reagan agreed to several tax increases despite his antitax 
rhetoric bush could shift his position 
the president will have to say to the american people that 
were facing a major crisis in dealing with the deficit and the 
only way to meet the challenge is to sit down and work out a package 
with congress panetta said 
rep william h gray iii dpa is stepping down after four 
years as budget committee chairman under house rules a lawmaker 
can only head the budget panel for four years

officers of west pointpepperell inc denied the 
use of their poison pill takeover defense will have to come up 
with another way to battle a 14 billion buyout bid from farley inc 
us district judge g ernest tidwell granted a temporary 
injunction monday blocking the georgiabased textile maker from 
using the pill against farleys 48ashare takeover attempt the 
judge also refused to grant pepperell two preliminary injunctions it 
sought against farley 
pepperell spokesman donald downs said the company plans to appeal 
tidwells ruling and declined further comment 
pepperell now must fight more aggressively to overcome the bid 
said deborah bronston an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
the ruling weakens their case and it becomes incumbent upon 
west point pepperell managers to come up with their own offer she 
said 
that offer to stockholders could include a leveraged buyout of 
the company a restructuring that would include the sale of 
pepperell assets or a white knight that would make a friendly 
counter offer for ownership of the company ms bronston said 
the west pointbased diversified manufacturer of consumer soft 
goods including arrow shirts and martex towels sought to protect 
itself against a possible takeover by chicagobased farley which 
owns 287 million shares or 98 percent of pepperell stock 
farley a maker of clothing including fruit of the loom 
underwear and precision metal products announced its attempt to 
buy pepperell may 23 
farleys offer is based on 1673 million shares being tendered 
and other conditions and expires at midnight est nov 21 
pepperell stock closed monday on the new york stock exchange at 
42 per share down 87 cents 
pepperells board created the pill in october 1987 to protect 
itself against a possible hostile takeover the pill allowed 
stockholders not involved in a takeover attempt to purchase 
additional shares which would sharply increase the cost of a buyout 
in response to suits by both corporations against each other and 
other defendants over the plan tidwell voided the rights agreement 
the court finds no authority in either the state law or west 
points articles of incorporation which authorize the rights plan 
tidwell wrote he said the plan discriminated among shareholders 
because some were given rights not allowed others in a takeover 
attempt 
william f farley chairman of the company seeking to take over 
pepperell said we are pleased by the courts ruling and believe 
that it will facilitate the successful completion of our offer 
in light of the courts decision we believe that the west 
point board should recommend the acceptance of our offer which is a 
full and fair one 
pepperell had countersued farley and asked for preliminary 
injunctions against the takeover on two grounds that the company 
violated a standstill agreement executed when pepperell acquired 
textile maker jp stevens amp co inc in march and that farleys 
proposed financing package violated federal margin regulations 
another defendant in pepperells suit was drexel burnham lambert 
inc a new yorkbased financial services corporation which was 
involved in the dismantling of jp stevens the standstill 
agreement approved march 13 specified that none of the parties 
involved would assist or encourage any attempt to acquire stevens 
which pepperell now owns 
the suit claimed drexel was providing assistance to farley in the 
takeover attempt in violation of the agreement 
tidwell ruled that neither drexel nor farley were parties to the 
standstill agreement and among other things there has been no 
showing that either drexel or derivatively farley used any 
confidential information obtained by drexel in connection with the 
buyout of stevens in the pepperell takeover attempt 
tidwell conceded the showing made by west point indicates that 
farleys financing is substantially suspect and may be a violation 
of the margin requirements but ruled farley has adequately 
disclosed the potential effect of the alleged margin violations 
and denied the request for an injunction

a federal jury has awarded 38 million to three 
former quasar co employees all over 50 who were fired and whose 
duties were transferred to younger men their attorneys say 
a federal jury monday awarded 19 million between 508000 and 
713000 to each man but the total amount was being doubled to 
38 million because the jury found the discrimination was willful 
the attorneys said 
quasar a sales subsidiary of japaneseowned matsushita electric 
corp of paramus nj dismissed john fortino carl meyers and f 
william schulz during a 1986 company restructuring that affected 
approximately 200 workers in franklin park 
attorney steven l bashwiner who represented quasar declined to 
comment on the verdict 
there were several tipoffs that discrimination might be a part 
of the picture said plaintiff attorney norman berger the 
company continued to hire new people the vast majority of them were 
very young under 40 
they told our clients that their jobs were being eliminated 
but they reassigned those functions to younger people he said 
fortino 58 had been assistant general manager of the 
advertising and sales promotion department at quasars franklin park 
facility since march 1979 he was awarded 508857 or 101 million 
when doubled 
meyers 53 was a nineyear employee and manager of sales 
administration at the site he receives 728223 or 145 million 
when doubled 
schulz 54 had worked for quasar and its former owner motorola 
inc since 1957 when he was forced to leave he was national 
manager of physical distribution he was awarded 713908 or 142 
million 
the jury rejected a claim made by a fourth former worker sophie 
mustachio of franklin park

grand metropolitan plc today extended for the 
third time its 523 billion offer for pillsbury co saying that 
791 percent of pillsbury stock now has been tendered to the british 
conglomerate 
the 60pershare takeover offer which was to expire monday 
night was extended until nov 18 
grand met said that as of the monday night deadline nearly 676 
million shares of pillsbury common stock representing approximately 
791 percent of the outstanding shares had been tendered and not 
withdrawn 
when it extended its second deadline of nov 8 grand met 
reported that about 743 percent of pillsbury outstanding shares had 
been tendered 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg said today the minneapolisbased 
food and restaurant company would have no comment on the latest 
extension 
on oct 4 grand met undertook one of the biggest hostile 
takeover attempts on a company with its offer for pillsbury 
pillsbury later announced a restructuring that included spinning 
off its burger king corp subsidiary as an independent company 
pillsbury and grand met also have been skirmishing in court over 
the validity of pillsburys poison pill takeover defense which 
would make a hostile acquisition prohibitively expensive 
grand met said friday a delaware judge had requested briefs by 
monday from both sides on new motions in the british firms suit to 
quash the pill 
meanwhile the british companys chief of us operations ian a 
martin said he was taking seriously rumors that a group of 
unidentified investors were seeking buyers for all or parts of the 
londonbased distilling gambling and franchise conglomerate 
martin said one of the potential participants might be pillsbury 
part of the reason grand metropolitan might be considered an 
attractive takeover target is the difference between its stock price 
of about 8 a share and its estimated breakup value of between 
1250 and 18 a share 
that degree of discrepancy can invite takeover bids by investors 
who hope to profit by selling pieces of a target company

opec chairman rilwanu lukman called for a higher 
oil production ceiling for the 13nation cartel tuesday and warned 
that a price war would erupt if the groups members did not respect 
their output quotas a published report said tuesday 
oil ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are gathering in vienna for their semiannual meeting on 
nov 21 which has taken on added importance because of a plunge in 
oil price as a result of over production 
lukman quoted in an interview with the daily alwatan newspaper 
did not specify what the new production ceiling should be but he 
excluded a rise to as many as 22 million barrels a day 
current opec output is estimated at just below that figure 
because of overproduction by some cartel members 
opecs current production ceiling is 166 million barrels a day 
this includes a quota of 15 million barrels for iraq which 
rejected this figure when it was set in dec 1986 and is currently 
producing almost double that amount 
kuwait and its sister states in the gulf cooperation council have 
proposed that iraq be given a quota equal to irans 23 million 
barrels per day to raise the opec ceiling to at least 174 million 
barrels per day 
the other gcc states are saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
producer bahrain oman qatar and the united arab emirates 
lukman stressed in the interview that adherence by member states 
to the production quotas was the best way to raise the price of oil 
above the opec benchmark of 18 per barrel 
the current world oil glut has forced the price down to around 
13 per barrel 
as the present opec agreement expires at the end of december 
we have to reach a new accord in vienna but this time we aspire to 
see the agreement signed by all 13 members lukman said 
he warned the agreement would collapse if it was violated by 
anyone he explained that in the past some members managed to go 
on violating the agreement because other members stuck to their 
quotas 
but if the coming agreement is violated by any member all 
members will have to increase their production those violators are 
well aware of this fact he said

british industrialist brian beazer announced a 
refinancing plan that eliminates one of the most contentious issues 
in his hostile 18 billion takeover of koppers co 
beazers company beazer plc plans to acquire the interests of 
its partners shearson lehman hutton inc and national westminster 
bank plc in bns inc bns is the shell company formed to launch the 
takeover last june 
the partners are to be bought out by the end of february matthew 
thorne beazers group investment director said monday 
in a separate development tuesday beazer announced from bath 
england that it has conditionally agreed to sell koppers wolman 
division a leading supplier of timber treatment products and 
services to hickson international plc for 675 million in cash 
the deal depends on approval by the hickson shareholders and 
regulatory clearance it is part of the ongoing program for disposal 
of the koppers chemicals operations 
shearson lehmans ownership of the takeover company bns was 
criticized by koppers and the pittsburghbased companys allies as a 
dangerous precedent in which an investment bank was in effect 
helping take over a company 
bns would then be disbanded and beazer would become fully 
responsible for debt incurred in the koppers takeover 
shearson owns 461 percent of bns and a national westminster 
subsidiary county natwest ltd owns 49 percent beazer owns 49 
percent 
the transfers are part of a refinancing in which a consortium led 
by citibank will lend beazer 23 billion 
about 13 billion of that will refinance debt from the takeover 
and 570 million will substitute for money beazer planned to raise 
by selling highyield junk bonds the british company said in a 
letter to shareholders by not issuing the bonds beazer expects to 
save 25 million in interest expense 
the remaining 400 million will be temporary financing to be 
repaid by future sales from koppers chemical operations

retail sales bolstered by big gains at 
department stores and auto dealerships jumped 09 percent in 
october the biggest increase in seven months the government said 
today 
the commerce department said sales rose 12 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 1356 billion in september they fell by 03 
percent after rising by a similar 03 percent in august 
the october increase was the steepest since march when sales 
shot up 16 percent most economists had been expecting a milder 
rise of about 03 percent last month 
retail sales are closely watched by analysts as a barometer of 
overall consumer demand consumer spending including services 
which are not included in the retail sales report accounts for 
about twothirds of the nations economic activity 
analysts have been divided in recent months over whether economic 
growth is slowing sluggish retail sales in september along with 
weak job growth led many to conclude that the federal reserve 
boards effort to curb growth to noninflationary levels through 
increases in interest rates was working 
however the early indications are that the economy rebounded in 
october in addition to the substantial gain in retail sales the 
unemployment rate dropped matching a 14year low 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the reports on 
retail sales and industrial production which showed a rise of 04 
percent in october very positive and very encouraging for 
continued steady growth in the economy 
we see no evidence of rekindling inflation inflation remains 
low and under control and the economy appears to be on a very sound 
and steady basis he said 
auto sales in october jumped 17 percent to 292 billion after 
falling 22 percent a month earlier it was only the second increase 
since march 
excluding the automotive category which is the most volatile 
sales rose 07 percent last month after a 02 percent increase in 
september 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up 
24 percent to 156 billion last month following a 08 percent 
gain in september august sales had been depressed by 
hotterthannormal weather 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years rose 09 percent last month as did nondurable 
goods sales 
hardware garden and building supply stores reported no change in 
october after a 08 percent rise a month earlier 
furniture stores posted a modest 02 percent gain after falling 
03 percent in september 
food and grocery stores reported a 11 percent gain gasoline 
stations a 12 percent jump specialty clothing stores a 13 percent 
increase and drug stores a 06 percent rise 
the only category reporting a decline was restaurants and bars 
down 02 percent after a 13 percent increase in september 
for the first 10 months of the year sales were up 61 percent 
over the same period of 1987 barely keeping ahead of the inflation 
rate

the securities and exchange commission reportedly is probing 
allegations that a group of former university of pennsylvania 
classmates who work on wall street have traded illegally on inside 
information about corporate takeovers 
the washington post quoting what it called documents and 
unidentified sources familiar with the case said tuesday that the 
subject of sec scrutiny was a group of about a dozen penn graduates 
some of them former fraternity brothers a number of whom are 
professional stock speculators 
the newspaper said the secs new york office began the 
investigation last year after it was tipped by a confidential 
informant that the group was obtaining nonpublic information about 
takeovers from a number of investment banks including drexel 
burnham lambert inc no charges have been filed 
lawrence iason the secs regional administrator in new york 
declined to comment on the post story the enforcement agency 
ordinarily does not comment on pending investigations 
the posts account suggested that at least part of the 
investigation overlapped with some of the other highly publicized 
probes that have stemmed from the ivan boesky insider trading case 
two years ago 
boesky once the bestknown speculator on wall street turned 
states evidence after paying the sec a record 100 million in 
penalties for insider trading he also pleaded guilty to a criminal 
charge of conspiracy to lie to the sec and is serving a threeyear 
prison term 
the biggest target of boeskys cooperation so far has been 
drexel which is battling major civilfraud charges by the sec and 
may face criminal indictments soon drexel has denied any wrongdoing 
the post said one of the penn alumni allegedly under 
investigation is bruce newberg a former drexel trader indicted a 
few months ago in a criminal securities and tax fraud case involving 
a small new jersey investment firm 
the newspaper account did not identify all the other penn alumni 
allegedly subjected to sec scrutiny but said four declined to 
comment and one denied any wrongdoing

early september ramada rejected the 368 million offer as unfair to 
shareholders 
it is our firm conviction that a sale of control of the company 
at this time is not in the best interests of the company its 
shareholders and other affected constituents snell said 
ramada operates tropworld casino and entertainment resort in 
atlantic city the tropicana resort and casino in las vegas ramada 
express in laughlin and eddies fabulous 50s in reno nev 
we have been successful in our efforts to establish the company 
as an innovative and efficient operator in the gaming industry 
snell told shareholders our strategy has been to provide 
something more than gambling the product we strive to offer to 
customers is a complete entertainment experience in a gaming 
environment 
al glasgow a gaming analyst based in atlantic city said the 
casinos had attracted pritzkers attention 
mr pritzker wouldnt have chased ramada a few years ago when 
it was a neophyte in the casino industry glasgow said hes 
chasing it today because its matured into a pretty nicelooking 
product 
the information statement mailed to shareholders monday projects 
operating income from the atlantic city properties at 485 million 
in 1989 and 745 million by 1991 operating income from the nevada 
properties was projected at 296 million next year and 422 
million in 1991 net income was projected by the company at 94 
million in 1989 215 million in 1990 and 368 million in 1991 
ramada reported overall net earnings of 44 million during the 
first nine months of 1988 including a net loss of 26 million for 
the hotel and restaurant operations the four gaming facilities 
posted a profit of 76 million through september the company said 
ramada owns marie callenders restaurants and owns operates 
franchises or has under contract more than 800 hotels under the 
ramada and rodeway brand names 
but snell said ramada remained optimistic about the longterm 
prospects for the hotel and restaurant groups 
we feel confident that they will be attractive to prospective 
purchasers he said both have wellrecognized and established 
brand names and room in their markets for longterm growth

having plowed the financial harvest of 1987 
into this years crop cotton farmers of the texas high plains are 
expecting to reap bountiful results again this fall 
with the harvest in full swing crop observers are forecasting a 
total yield of about 27 million bales from 3 million acres for the 
25county area that stretches from amarillo in the panhandle of the 
state south to midland in west texas 
thats slightly below last years bumper crop of 27 million 
bales from 27 million acres which marked the secondhighest 
peracre yield on record behind 1965 when slightly more than one 
bale an acre was harvested 
texas leads all us states in cotton production and the high 
plains area alone produces more than any state except texas 
the 1987 crop eased financial burdens on many farmers allowing 
them to pay off loans and buy new equipment unlike years past 
during this growing season they had some money to spend on better 
fertilizer more irrigation and pest control 
people were in a better position to invest a little more in 
this crop said cotton agronomist james supak of the texas 
agricultural extension service weve gone through some pretty 
tough ones people are still working largely on borrowed money but 
it was a little easier to finance this crop because of the better 
production last year 
the weather also played a big part in what should be backtoback 
crop successes warm and dry conditions in october improved yield 
prospects by about 10 percent over earlier forecasts say crop 
observers as a result the cotton bolls or seed pods matured 
before a freeze could kill the plants 
area growers could have been tending an even better crop had more 
rainfall soaked fields during the summer 
this could have been an exceptional crop perhaps a record 
crop had we caught a rain in august supak said the dryland 
cotton went through a pretty severe drought stress that will put a 
cap on production 
crops in most areas were spared from severe hail damage which 
all but devastated the 1986 crop but drought conditions will cut 
into the harvest in some areas of west texas 
michael gruber an extension agent in one west texas county 
estimated that farmers in his area would bring in only about 8000 
bales over 55000 acres compared with 22000 bales last year 
scant rainfall and boll weevil infestation in the area where 
dryland farming predominates doomed crops early on 
we didnt have any rain through july august or september 
said gruber the drier it got the worse the bugs got us and 
before we knew it we didnt have any cotton 
still state agriculture officials project that texas cotton 
crop will be the fourthlargest in 10 years down about 7 percent 
from 1987 
while cotton experts say the quality of this years high plains 
cotton has been good so far market prices have edged lower 
it appears that the demand for cotton is somewhat weaker now 
than it was at this time last year especially the export demand 
said don ethridge of texas tech universitys agricultural economics 
department i also see that there is some weakness in the domestic 
demand for cotton and that is certainly affecting the market 
price 
ethridge attributed the weakness in demand to a sluggish economy 
but the high plains economy should pick up as a result of 
consecutive bountiful harvests said lj richardson jr president 
of first national bank in brownfield texas 
since agriculture is the base of the economy in brownfield 
it just has a tremendous impact on our local economy and the 
financial institutions he said 
the influx of deposits from last years crop boosted first 
national to a record 94 million in assets 
we expect that when we get this crop in well reach the 100 
million mark he said 
despite the hopeful outlook weatherrelated misfortunes could 
still befall the cotton before its out of the field later this 
month said supak 
what would tend to hurt us would be weather systems that would 
come in here with ice and snow and moisture he said cotton is 
very vulnerable at this stage to weathering and will lose its color 
if exposed to moisture

because a japanese sees red if handed a 
gift wrapped in white a pair of connecticut entrepreneurs are 
getting a nice reception for their business helping executives 
select and send presents to associates in the united states and 
abroad 
seven months ago lydia v klatsky and partner elizabeth r gray 
invested 40000 to launch corporate american gifts 
klatsky and gray bring crafts to executives offices for 
selection advise clients wrap and ship gifts to domestic or 
foreign locations 
the crafts are oneofakind pieces culled from american artists 
whom the two meet during scouting excursions around the country 
they attend major craft shows and drop in on artists 
we feel its really important that americans give american 
gifts abroad klatsky said 
the gifts which range in price from just under 5 to a 12000 
library oak table designed by craig nutt suit a variety of tastes 
among both givers and receivers 
for conservatives there are handmade leather binders exquisite 
glass paperweights and handcarved wooden clocks tiny executive toy 
boxes filled with bronze toys burl wood boxes with secret 
compartments and lacquered puzzle cubes with several faces appeal to 
the more adventuresome 
very often the person doing the buying doesnt have the time or 
the inclination to go shopping klatsky said 
but more important for the convenience for some giftgivers is 
the knowledge grady and klatsky have of the customs of other 
cultures 
theyll come to your office with appropriate samples after a 
brief phone conversation in which we identify the nationality of the 
recipients and other factors which influence the type and value of 
the gift one wants to provide said k grahame walker president 
of the dexter corp in windsor locks conn 
you have to be careful when purchasing gifts for anyone 
particularly for the japanese walker said noting that even the 
color of certain gift wrapping paper can offend particular cultures 
for example white is a color of mourning in japan and would be 
inappropriate as gift wrap gray said while black or purple 
wrapping paper would be considered offensive in some latin american 
cultures 
klatsky a registered nurse and gray who worked in advertising 
with her husband now have among their clients southern new england 
telecommunications corp cigna corp and gerber scientific inc 
they declined to release sales figures but said they expected to 
make a profit in their first year 
to develop the savvy necessary to advise buyers klatsky and gray 
researched what gifts are appropriate for specific countries but 
such information is scarce 
klatsky said she once turned to the white house for advice her 
quest eventually led to the person in charge of presidential gift 
giving who acknowledged the dearth of information on the subject 
and asked klatsky to forward a corporate american gifts catalog when 
its finished next spring 
there are certain countries where one gift is acceptable and 
another is not gray said 
you dont give the japanese anything with a fox or a badger on 
it the inference is that foxes are cunning and the badger is a 
scavenger 
people of various cultures also react differently to expensive 
gifts 
saudi arabians give very lavishly and you are expected to 
reciprocate but you might run into trouble with that in south 
america where an expensive gift could be perceived as too 
intimate klatsky said 
similarly in some latin american countries handkerchiefs are 
associated with tears and sorrow the women said 
while the concept of fine american crafts appeals to many us 
companies if left to their own devices executives good intentions 
sometimes backfire the partners note 
in one instance recalled by klatsky a major american 
corporation gave clocks to a japanese company thinking they were 
american made only to discover they were made in japan

if the makers of ruffies are accurate in their 
view of america making gains in the garbage bag business is a 
matter of appealing to the nations conscience 
polytech inc of bloomington minn is launching a line of 
degradable plastic trash bags with hopes that us households will 
pay a little extra for ruffies knowing they have the potential to 
turn to dust 
weve gotten just a tremendous response said robert 
doernbach chairman and chief executive officer of polytech a 
company founded in 1958 by flamboyant philanthropist percy ross who 
sold out in 1969 its going to be interesting to see if people 
will go out and buy those products 
its not the first time degradable garbage bags have been 
marketed but doernbach says ruffies is the first nationally 
advertised brand to make the move 
on their part its smart marketing said frank rolfes a 
securities analyst for dain bosworth inc of minneapolis i think 
people like to do the environmentally right thing 
by adding photosensitive material to the plastic compound the 
bags break down when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the 
sun once the chain reaction begins the bags eventually are reduced 
to a fine powder the company says the bags will completely degrade 
in about three months in direct sunlight the company says 
but theres a catch doernbach said bags must be exposed to the 
sun a minimum of about seven days for the breakdown process to begin 
give or take a few days depending on seasons and the bags 
distance from the equator 
given the dark nature of landfills most bags wont degrade 
with the way they are normally used rolfes said 
still degradable bags are helpful in the fight against litter 
and even the darkest landfill cant stop the degrading process of a 
bag once it starts doernbach said 
the technology will add about a dime to the retail cost of a 
package of 30 tall kitchen containersized bags which vary in price 
from 199 to 269 depending on where they are sold 
hopefully theres some profit there but its not a wildly 
profitable thing doernbach said 
ruffies with about 400 employees in bloomington denver and 
battleboro nc controls about 8 percent of the total us 
consumer trash bag market while its two other national competitors 
glad and hefty each has about a 30 percent share doernbach said 
polytech posted 718 million in revenues in 1987 but earned 
just 472000 rolfes said the degradable bags could give polytech 
a small sales edge in some locations but not enough to make a 
nightandday difference because the product could easily be 
duplicated by competitors if it skyrockets 
rick tanner product manager for glad trash bags in danbury 
conn said hes neither surprised nor worried about the change in 
ruffies 
this is not a hot button with consumers tanner said 
polytech is responding to special interests 
tanner and allen gray a spokesman for mobil corp which makes 
hefty bags said its a waste of time and resources to make garbage 
bags degradable 
the degrading process takes far far too long to create extra 
space in landfills gray said the money is much better spent on 
real solutions to the problems 
although plastics only account for an estimated 72 percent of 
the countrys solid waste as measured by weight many experts 
believe plastics pose a much greater problem than the figures reveal 
because they are so light 
about 96 million tons of plastic were discarded in the united 
states in 1984 and the volume is expected to increase 98 percent to 
155 tons by 1990 
recycling garbage incineration and reducing the stream of solid 
waste are environmental causes more worthy of corporate concern 
gray said 
its a matter of taking care of the volume that we generate and 
reducing that volume he said 
still hefty will be keeping an eye on ruffies sales to see what 
consumers want 
mobils position has been if the market demands that the bags 
be made biodegradable well do it gray said

sharon and larry jangula feared this years 
drought would force them off their farm until one of the nations 
largest travel agencies moved 20 computer terminals into a vacant 
local storefront 
her parttime bookkeeping jobs did not earn enough and the 
alternative was driving 60 miles to bismarck each day for a 
fulltime job 
it was becoming reality that we had to do something before 
the philadelphiabased rosenbluth travel agency opened an office in 
linton and hired 40 local farmers and farmwives as data processors 
mrs jangula said 
the 5anhour parttime jobs have helped many families hurt by 
the drought put food on their tables this fall 
its not going to save the farm but it really helps out 
said mrs jangula who was hired as coordinator of the office 
the agency for its part discovered that being a good samaritan 
can sometimes be good business 
by employing farm families to punch customer profile data into 
computers the agency thought it could help the farmers survive 
their misfortune while saving the company money on overtime it was 
paying elsewhere said diane peters the agencys marketing manager 
hal rosenbluth the travel agencys president just decided it 
was our social responsibility to help she said 
the only requirement for employment was that workers be from farm 
families because that was where the greatest effect of the 
drought was going to be felt instantaneously rosenbluth said in a 
telephone interview 
without any prompting from government rosenbluth took it upon 
himself to find out what his successful travel business could do to 
improve the lot of the droughtstricken farmers 
he saw the plight of the people in that area he realized they 
were good business people but that nature had just dealt them a bad 
hand peters said 
he looked at work that needed to be done and said why cant 
those people do it 
the rosenbluth agency is one of the nations top three corporate 
and vacation travel agencies and expects more than 700 million in 
sales in 1988 peters said 
it is the official travel agency of some 1300 major us 
corporations including the eastman kodak co ee du pont de 
nemours amp co general electric co and the nbc television network 
and employs 2000 people at 160 offices in 33 states and abroad she 
said 
to find out where his companys assistance might be most needed 
rosenbluth contacted the us department of agriculture after being 
directed to north dakota the travel agency hooked up with state and 
local officials who led rosenbluth to linton population 1450 and 
ashley and napoleon each with about 1000 residents 
the drought dealt an estimated 21 billion blow to north 
dakotas economy or 10 percent of the states gross business 
volume according to economists at north dakota state university 
the states agricultural sector lost 700 million 
they decided on linton because they had the type of building 
best suited for what they wanted to do said ron leclerc rural 
development coordinator for the states economic development 
commission 
the 40 workers in linton come from seven towns in a 30mile area 
said mrs jangula the only fulltime employee at the office 
the travel agency originally intended to hire 20 fulltime 
workers but when 90 people applied for the jobs it decided to hire 
40 parttime employees instead peters said 
we decided it would be better to impact 40 families she said 
jim weisser president of the linton industrial development 
corp said the extra income is helping many of those families 
survive 
its just in some cases the difference of buying groceries or 
not he said this has really given us a boost in attitude more 
than anything 
the agency flew computers and trainers to linton to open a 
temporary office aug 8 for a threemonth trial weisser said the 
development corportion chipped in 1000 for two months rent and 
coaxed local residents to wage a letterwriting campaign to show 
their interest in keeping the office open he said 
the office did such a good job during the trial period 
rosenbluth quickly decided to make it a permanent addition to the 
company fold 
the travel agency is now the towns fourth biggest employer 
surpassed only by the county school and hospital according to 
weisser 
although the linton office was the first one his agency has 
opened that was not requested by a client it may not be the last 
rosenbluth said 
what we do is very electronic he said it could be in 
linton it could be in maine the key is to be where we have 
some very fine associates

behind his ramshackle wooden counter 
luiz ferreira costa sells anything from toilet paper and cigarettes 
to cooking oil and rice literally for the price of gold 
his prices are calculated in grams of the yellow metal 
onetenth of a gram worth about 2 for a dozen eggs or a half a 
gram for 2 pounds of coffee 
costas customers are part of an estimated 1 million prospectors 
who have invaded brazils vast amazon rain forest to tap its rich 
gold deposits 
fortunes are made but the gold rush also is creating widespread 
violence smuggling tax evasion health problems environmental 
pollution and even the disturbance of primitive indians 
the gold dust which costa carefully weighs on his scale comes 
from the bed of the madeira river that flows past teotonio a small 
prospectors camp 25 miles from porto velho capital of the western 
jungle state of rondonia about 2000 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro 
this is my way of digging for gold said costa a 
58yearold potbellied toothless man who claimed he was too old 
to put up with the roughandtumble life led by most gold diggers 
according to jose altino machado a director of the gold 
prospectors federation there are close to 3000 golddigging sites 
spread out over the 2 million square miles of the socalled legal 
amazon comprised of the states of amapa para roraima maranhao 
goias acre rondonia mato grosso and amazonas 
since the late 1970s close to 600000 newcomers have swelled 
the ranks of the 400000 professional prospectors who have been 
working in the region for years and if you include spinoff services 
such as food equipment transportation and prostitution the number 
of people living off the gold rush jumps to 7 million machado 
said 
most prospectors were poor peasants fleeing brazils 
droughtridden northeast but over the past few years businessmen 
doctors and lawyers have also become gold diggers they make more in 
six months than in five years behind their desks machado said 
he said a prospector extracts on the average at least 50 grams of 
gold worth about 1000 a month 
most work for wellestablished entrepreneurs who take 70 percent 
of the production in exchange for equipment transportation 
medicine and food very few get rich machado said 
but fortunes are made in the jungle about 5000 prospectors have 
earned at least 1 million and some 200 are worth more than 5 
million he said 
most of the gold from the amazon never finds its way into the 
national economy buyers who purchase the gold directly from the 
prospectors hoard it or acquire dollars as a hedge against 
inflation or smuggle it out of the country to evade income and 
mineral extraction taxes 
marcos antonio maron an official of the mines and energy 
ministrys national mineral production department said lack of 
funds and manpower make it almost impossible to police the vast 
expanse of land on which the gold digging sites are located 
in an interview maron said that of the estimated 100 tons of 
gold produced in brazil in 1987 only 35 tons were registered with 
the government for 1988 he estimated a real production of 110 
tons versus a registered production of no more than 55 tons 
ministry figures show that between 1977 and 1986 almost 23 
billion of gold was detoured from the economy 
in terms of real production brazil ranks sixth among the worlds 
largest gold producers coming after south africa the soviet union 
the united states canada and australia 
maron said brazil has known reserves of 1000 tons of gold he 
said geological studies have not been made to pinpoint gold reserves 
in the amazons but all told i would estimate brazil has a 
potential of producing about 30000 tons of gold 
a lot of gold is found inside indian territory this has led to 
several conflicts especially with the yanomami tribe in the 
northern state of roraima near the frontier with venezuela maron 
said 
police and army troops occasionally evict prospectors from indian 
territory but they keep coming back he said 
machado admitted prospectors work near indian territory but 
never invade it it is the indians who enter prospectors camps and 
dig for gold and they are always welcomed 
amazon gold comes from huge openpit mines or is blasted from the 
earth with high pressure water hoses pumped from riverbeds or 
simply panned by solitary prospectors 
the most serious environmental hazard posed is the use of 
mercury a metallic chemical element used to join gold dust 
particles 
the mercury is burned off the gold emitting a highly toxic gas 
that enters the atmosphere and can be inhaled by the prospector the 
toxins can cause nervous disorders and genetic deformations in 
offspring 
maron said 180 tons of mercury enter the amazons ecosystem every 
year affecting the regions flora and fauna and poisoning the 
rivers 
along a 370mile stretch of the madeira river some 5000 dredges 
daily suck up huge amounts of gravel which yield more than 4 tons 
of gold a year 
near the teotonio prospectors camp paulo oliveira employs 16 men 
on his two dredges which operate 24 hours a day seventythree feet 
below hoses acting like giant vacuum cleaners pump up about 6 tons 
of gravel per hour 
on hundreds of small barges competing with dredges for space 
divers plunge into the dark muddy waters handcarrying smaller 
versions of the suction hoses 
joaquim lins 23 dives twice a day air pumped through a tube 
by an engine on the barge allows him to remain underwater for two 
hours at a time 
lins profession is a dangerous one he runs the risk of bursting 
his lungs by getting his air tube tangled with those of other divers 
or with the dredges hoses divers are also known to cut their 
rivals air supplies 
scores die this way each year lins said as he prepared to 
dive 
but its not only divers who die for gold each day at least four 
people are shot dead in teotonio mainly because they didnt obey 
our unwritten code of ethics said oliveira 
here its live and let live and work and let work anyone who 
doesnt follow this rule dies 
machado oliveira and other prospectors interviewed denied 
reports that drug traffickers from neighboring bolivia and colombia 
cross frontiers to exchange cocaine for gold 
but we have information of traffickers buying gold with dollars 
as part of their moneylaundering process machado said 
more than 1000 gold feverstricken prospectors enter the amazon 
each year hoping to strike it rich and according to machado very 
few will leave the jungle because once you come down with the fever 
you never want to recover

the cochairman of the national economic 
commission told oil industry executives tuesday that an increase in 
the gasoline tax could become a reality under the new administration 
robert s strauss a prominent texas democrat said a new tax on 
gasoline had been discussed as one possible way to help reduce the 
federal governments huge budget deficit 
a great many experts feel that if indeed additional revenue 
is needed that a gas tax or a broadbased energy tax is 
something the government should look at very strongly strauss 
told some 1500 participants at the closing session of the american 
petroleum institutes annual meeting 
however strauss declined to say whether he had or would 
recommend a new gasoline tax to the commission a bipartisan body 
formed to make recommendations on reducing the budget deficit 
during the threeday meeting industry leaders have spoken out 
against new taxes arguing that the oil industry is the most heavily 
taxed in the nation 
amoco corp chairman richard m morrow has called the retail 
gasoline tax the single most regressive form of taxation one 
that would tax the low income most heavily and have a harmful 
regional impact 
morrow who also is chairman of the trade group said tuesday 
that while presidentelect george bush had promised not tol 
resources it is more environmentally acceptable than other fossil 
fuels and particularly so in addressing such concerns as ozone 
acid rain and the greenhouse effect morrow said

major us airlines have put off for another week the elimination 
of a popular category of discount air fares the socalled junk 
fare used by major business travelers 
the cuts which represented an industrywide restructuring of 
discount fare programs had been scheduled to take place today 
but officials of several carriers said today they had decided to 
extend the deadline to nov 22 continental airlines which 
initiated last friday the move to eliminate the fares has extended 
them for the same period according to travel agents continental 
spokesmen were unavailable for comment today 
other carriers made that move and we simply matched it said 
al becker a spokesman for dallasbased american 
becker said he could not provide an explanation for the 
postponement however the new york times reported today one reason 
for the change was that some carriers including trans world 
airlines had not yet put the new fares into effect 
i think all the airlines are watching each other said united 
spokeswoman sara dornacker 
bob gibbons a spokesman for northwest airlines said the airline 
had joined in the delay because of confusion among passengers and 
travel agents over elimination of the discount fare 
i think passengers became confused and travel agents and we 
wanted to give time for them to sort these issues out gibbons 
said 
the fare changes involve the discontinuation of most three to 
sevenday advancepurchase fares 
besides having the relatively short advancepurchase requirements 
the socalled junk fares often did not require a traveler to stay at 
the destination on a saturday night they also were between 10 
percent to 35 percent below full coach fare

the united states will need just about as much 
imported steel next year as this year even if an economic recession 
reduces overall steel consumption a leading steel importer said 
the requirement for foreign steel will be a central issue in 
washington dc as debate heightens over the extent to which 
presidentelect george bush should renew steel import quotas due to 
expire next sept 30 
domestic producers cannot sustain production much above 80 
percent of rated capacity and exports are expected to grow said 
fred lamesch president of the importer tradearbed inc of new york 
and past president of the american institute for imported steel 
for this year domestic shipments are expected to reach 83 
million tons imports 21 million tons and exports 2 million tons 
leaving total us consumption of 102 million tons he said monday 
night in new york during an address to members of the association 
for steel distributors eastern region 
lets assume steel consumption drops five million tons to 97 
million tons next year if as widely forecast exports rise by two 
million tons we would still need 20 million tons of imported steel 
in this market and for specific products and regions dependence on 
imported steel is much greater lamesch said 
lamesch said domestic producers can be expected among other 
things to begin filing unfair trade cases as early as spring as 
they lobby for an extension of the trade restraint agreements 
domestic producers prefer a situation in which the sum of their 
own capacity plus imports does not surpass a level that will 
threaten future price stability the importer said in practice 
that translates into an effort first to keep closed domestic 
capacity from being reopened and second to extend and expand 
restraint agreements

small businesses are feeling better about the

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as a late round of speculative 
selling sent soybean and corn prices down sharply 
prices were weak throughout the session amid bearish chart 
signals and disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain 
exports 
the agriculture departments announcement late monday of a 
300000metricton corn sale to the soviet union failed to rally the 
corn market which was expecting a soviet corn purchase of up to 2 
million metric tons 
jerry zusel manager of cbot floor operations for balfour 
maclaine corp in chicago said most of the selling was done by 
speculators while the outnumbered buyers were largely commercial 
traders 
theres just not enough cash business right now to support 
these price levels zusel said and if you cant go up youve 
got to go down 
at the close wheat was 5 cents lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 5 cents lower with december at 266 a bushel oats were 3 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 210 a bushel and 
soybeans were 4 cents to 16 cents lower with november at 743 a

a majority of the nations smallbusiness owners 
believe the federal budget deficit is the no 1 issue facing 
presidentelect george bush and they favor spending cuts to reduce 
the shortfall a poll said tuesday 
the 21000 entreprenuers responding to arthur anderson amp cos 
third annual small business survey also expressed general optimism 
about the economic outlook despite the lingering budgetary problems 
twothirds of those polled said the deficit was the most pressing 
issue of the day fortyfive percent listed tax rates 26 percent 
domestic programs 25 percent foreign policy and 15 percent defense 
spending 
the respondents were asked to pick the two most important 
political issues facing the incoming administration 
spending cuts were picked by 55 percent of those surveyed as the 
best solution to the deficit problem while 44 percent favored both 
spending cuts and increased taxes 
emerging and ownermanaged businesses appear to see taxes as 
both a concern and a reality said james p ohalloran an arthur 
anderson partner 
to reduce our deficit most small businesses prefer a reduction 
in spending by cutting defense spending welfare and foreign aid 
as far as the economy was concerned 60 percent of the 
respondents predicted they would record at least a 5 percent gain in 
sales in the upcoming year with 35 percent foresaw an increase of 
more than 10 percent 
threefourths estimated profits would stay the same or increase 
over last year 
in past studies the executives predictions have been right on 
target because they are aware of their competitive environment and 
the pressures facing small business and are committed to setting 
and reaching optimistic goals ohalloran said

stock prices creaked to a mixed finish today in a 
particularly slow session reflecting widespread reluctance to 
participate ahead of the governments potentially marketjolting 
monthly trade report 
the only thing ive noticed is nothings happened said 
edward p nicoski a technical analyst at piper jaffray amp hopwood 
inc a minneapolisbased investment firm everybodys just 
waiting to see what those numbers are going to do 
the commerce department is due to report the september 
merchandise trade balance wednesday morning and most expectations 
are for a 105 billion shortfall if the deficit exceeds that 
amount some fear it could trigger a selloff in the dollar stock 
and bond markets 
the trade statistics vary widely from month to month but remain 
one of the most sensitive market movers thats largely because the 
huge trade deficits the united states has been racking up over the 
past several years are seen by many economists as a reflection of 
eroding economic might 
wall street strategists said other figures released today that 
showed higher retail sales and industrial production in october 
caused little reaction in the market

35 percent during the period and carter hawley hale stores inc 
reported a 56 percent earnings gain for its first quarter 
penney said its thirdquarter earnings declined to 160 million 
from 171 million in the same period a year earlier penneys 
pershare earnings increased to 117 from 114 as it had 13 
percent fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter 
penney attributed some of the earnings decline to accounting 
changes 
the company said its revenue totaled 361 billion down from 
376 billion a year earlier 
the retail industry has been struggling through a slump that 
began in february 1987 some companies like penney are still 
showing profit declines other companies have showed earnings gains 
but securities analysts caution that the results when compared with 
last years depressed numbers may look stronger than they really 
are 
dayton hudson said it earned 456 million or 54 cents per 
share in the quarter ended oct 29 up from 336 million or 34 
cents per share in the comparable period a year ago 
thirdquarter revenue increased to 287 billion from 254 
billion for the same period in 1987 
kenneth a macke chairman and chief executive officer of dayton 
hudson said sales at its mervyns department stores strengthened 
during the quarter because of improved inventory content 
mervyns has been a trouble spot for dayton hudson in the past 
the company also owns daytons and hudsons department stores and 
target discount stores 
carter hawley hale said it had earnings of 113 million or 52 
cents a share during its first quarter compared with 107 
million or 49 cents per share in the same period a year ago 
carter hawley hale said it had a 4 million operating loss in the 
latest quarter

thalheimers and weinstocks department stores said sales were 
6367 million in the quarter up from 6106 million in the same 
period a year earlier

million or 274 per share compared with 328 million or 218 a 
share in the comparable 1987 period the 1987 results included a 
140 million pretax charge for the relocation of penney 
headquarters to dallas from new york 
revenue during the period totaled 10 billion down from 1039 
billion

falling energy prices and rising profits at many 
oil companies are concealing more serious industrywide problems that 
a national energy policy must address the american petroleum 
institute said tuesday 
the truth is that the state of the nations energy health today 
is perceived as good only because enough inexpensive foreign oil 
is available the industrys main trade group said in a report 
our condition could turn to poor or critical if that supply 
were disrupted 
the report energy security white paper us decisions and 
global trends was issued during the groups annual meeting 
the survival of domestic exploration and production is in 
question as lower crude prices discourage investment in new oil 
development the report said 
dependence on foreign oil primarily from the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has increased us vulnerability to 
the dangers of a supply disruption and price volatility it said 
despite recent huge quarterly profits by major oil companies the 
gains came in downstream sectors such as refining and chemical 
manufacturing said charles j dibona president of the trade group 
but the favorable earnings were offset at least partly by losses in 
upstream production and exploration operations stemming from 
low crude prices 
the paper calls for a national energy policy to ensure an 
adequate and secure supply of oil at reasonable prices while 
reducing vulnerability to a future oil crisis 
the report does not specifically call for tax incentives to help 
offset the crude prices but contends correct government 
decisions could increase domestic oil supply by 2 million barrels 
a day by the end of the 1990s 
only 921 oil rigs are working in the united states compared with 
about 1000 a year ago and 4000 in 1981 the group noted those 
rigs are producing approximately 8 million barrels of oil a day and 
output is falling 3 percent a year while demand is rising about 2 
percent annually the report said 
consequently foreign imports have soared to 43 percent from 31 
percent just three years ago and some economists predict that in 
five years the united states may be importing half of its oil 
the report said dependence on foreign supplies primarily from 
the middle east increased us vulnerability to a supply disruption 
with demand increasing rapidly the current glut of oil on world 
markets could dry up in the 1990s the report said 
then any number of unpredictable developments around the 
persian gulf could directly swiftly and critically affect oil 
supply the paper said 
in addition another steep plunge in oil prices like that which 
occurred in 1986 threatens the survival of smaller oil companies 
damages the economies of oil states dependent on the industry for 
revenue and hurts the countrys longterm energy security the 
report said

a magistrate issued arrest warrants tuesday 
for former union carbide corp chairman warren anderson and two 
other company officials to answer murder charges in the 1984 gas 
disaster that killed 3100 people 
the prosecutor sought the warrants after anderson and other 
executives of the us company failed to respond to summonses issued 
in december 
they are deliberately trying to disobey the court of law 
government prosecutor us prasad said 
a spokesman at union carbides headquarters in danbury conn 
said indian courts had no jurisdiction over anderson or the company 
union carbide corp is not an indian corporation said earl 
slack the companys assistant director of corporate communications 
it has no presence in india and under indian law can have no 
presence in india 
the charges are in addition to a stillunresolved 3 billion 
damage suit filed against union carbide and its indian subsidiary by 
the indian government 
the indian government argues the leak was a result of negligence 
we believe that the energy expended in the pursuit of 
illfounded criminal charges in india to be more productively 
invested in getting aid to the victims or in revealing evidence that 
would confirm that the tragedy was caused by sabotage slack said 
the bhopal pesticide plant where toxic gas leaked out of a tank 
and wafted over nearby shantytowns was operated by union carbide 
india ltd in which union carbide holds a 509 percent stake the 
remaining stock is owned by indian interests 
in addition to 3185 deaths counted by the government more than 
20000 people were injured when they inhaled the lethal methyl 
isocyanate 
the indian government filed its damage suit in early 1986 
last year the government filed the separate murder charges 
against anderson union carbide corp its hong kongbased 
subsidiary union carbide eastern inc and eight officers of the 
indian subsidiary anderson retired in late 1986 after reaching the 
companys mandatory retirement ageof 65 
the only arrest warrants issued tuesday were for anderson john 
macdonald assistant secretary of union carbide corp and peter j 
whitley attorney for union carbide eastern inc 
neither macdonald nor whitley was named in the murder charges 
prasad the prosecutor said he sought warrants for macdonald and 
whitley because they were the people who took receipt of the 
summonses issued to their firms 
prasad also said the indian government might start extradition 
proceedings if the trio ignored the arrest warrants 
in granting the request for arrest warrants chief judicial 
magistrate rc mishra said the three men could be released on 
1000 bail apiece if they appeared in court 
mishra is not hearing any actual trial cases but his job 
empowers him to preside over some procedural matters such as 
failure to answer summonses and whether to commit a case to trial by 
a higher court

some people in the computer industry 
mistakenly blame computer viruses for anything that goes wrong 
an independent computer security consultant says 
out of over 1400 complaints to the software service bureau 
this year in only 2 percent of the cases was an electronic virus 
the cause of the problem chrles wood said people are jumping 
to the conclusion that whenever a system slows down its a virus 
thats responsible 
wood and other panelists at a 15th annual computer security 
conference cautioned that computerdependent companies should focus 
more on the daytoday breakdowns caused by human error than on the 
kind of virus introduced recently into a governmentsupported 
computer network 
robert morris jr a 23yearold cornell university graduate 
student allegedly unleashed the virus in the nationwide 
6200computer governmentsupported network called arpanet he is 
the subject of an inquiry by the fbi and us attorneys in two 
states 
that incident could be a cheap lesson steve irwin president

the farmers home administration began mailing 
thousands of notices tuesday to farmers who are past due on loans 
and members of congress vowed to scrutinize the postelection timing 
of the move 
agency spokesman marlyn aycock said about 83500 letters would be 
mailed through nov 25 
the agency had said earlier that 90000 letters would be sent in 
an effort to collect 88 billion in pastdue loans but aycock said 
some had since been paid up the collection effort comes under rules 
implementing new credit legislation 
sen lloyd bentsen a texas democrat and chairman of the senate 
finance committee accused the fmha of holding the letters back 
until after the nov 8 presidential election for political 
reasons although the agency had the letters in hand well before 
the election 
that is no way to administer a program that is so important to 
our nations farmers and it is no way to treat the 6500 or so 
texans who are getting the letters said bentsen who was the 
democratic nominee for vice president 
the farm credit act of 1987 legislation on which i worked long 
and hard may give us the means to restructure some of the overdue 
loans so that we do not push farmers into foreclosure 
unnecessarily bentsen said that is where i will focus my 
attention in the days ahead i urge the farmers home administration 
to do the same 
fmha is considered the farm lender of last resort because it 
makes loans only to those who cannot qualify at banks or other 
commercial sources 
rep glenn english an oklahoma democrat and member of the house 
agriculture committee said he was certain that the actions of the 
farmers home administration will be scrutinized by both the house 
and senate agriculture committees with an eye toward whether farmers 
home has carried out both the letter and the intent of the 1987 
agriculture credit act 
the letters inform borrowers who are more than 180 days late of 
their options the notices explain that fmha borrowers must notify 
the agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make 
arrangements for settling their debts details regarding the 
options including debt restructuring and writeoffs will be 
provided 
congress in the farm credit act ordered fmha to revise its 
lending practices with the debt writedown considered one of the 
most important parts of the law it allows fmha to reduce a farmers 
delinquent debt to the recovery value of the collateral which is 
usually land or farm equipment depending upon cash flow and other 
factors

a california computer company controlled by new 
york investor bennett s lebow launched an unsolicited takeover 
offer on tuesday for the much larger prime computer inc that values 
prime at 970 million 
mai basic four inc which already owns 41 percent of primes 
485 million outstanding shares is offering shareholders 20 a 
share for the remainder of the stock 
the bid comes about 11 months after natickbased prime launched a 
hostile bid for computervision corp a massachusetts manufacturer 
of computeraided design or cad systems which it eventually 
acquired for 435 million 
primes stock remained below the offering price rising 187 a 
share to 1775 a share in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading mai basic fell 1 a share to 1137 a share 
this is unusual one computer company trying to acquire another 
computer company said bruce jenkins an analyst with daratech a 
cambridge research firm we do not see this as a technological fit 
or a customer fit it has to do with benefit to stockholders 
jenkins also suggested that in making the offer mai basic may 
inspire other offers for prime mai basic based in tustin calif 
may be looking to be acquired by the company itself jenkins said 
john dexheimer an investment banker with broadview associates 
also said mai basics bid appeared to be purely for financial gain 
its a straight smart financial move said dexheimer the 
question now is does he lebow really want to go ahead with it 
lebow owns 43 percent of mai basics stock with an associate 
william weksel lebow also controls western union and liggett group 
inc and recently asked the federal trade commission for clearance 
to buy more than 50 percent of american brands inc 
both prime and mai basic four are manufacturers of midrange 
business computers prime is now a leading supplier of integrated 
computeraided design and computeraided engineering systems having 
recently agreed to acquire general electric cos calma unit a cad 
systems maker that acquisition makes prime second only to 
international business machines corp in the cad market 
the offer is contingent upon mai basic getting at least 67 
percent of primes outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis 
mai basic has said that it has filed a lawsuit against prime and 
its board in delaware chancery court seeking to block primes 
shareholder rights plan a defense against unwelcome takeovers 
the company has also sued prime in a federal court in 
massachusetts seeking relief with regard to certain massachusetts 
state takeover laws 
mai basic said it had lined up financing from canada imperial 
bank of commerce and drexel burnham lambert inc drexel burnham and 
merrill lynch capital markets are the dealermanagers for the offer 
for the nine months ended oct 3 prime earned 334 million or 
69 cents a share on revenue of 116 billion 
for the nine months ended june 30 mai basic had net income of 
187 million or 125 a share on revenue of 3029 million 
lebow informed joe henson president and chief executive officer 
of the bid in a telephone call monday night according to joe 
gavaghan a spokesman for prime

barometers nudged higher 
the commerce department was due to report the september

weakness

strategists said the conditions have been laid for some gains over

i think barring something totally unforeseen in terms of a 
negative trade number were setting ourselves up for a fairly 
significant rally said john conlon executive vice president and 
director of equity research at nikko securities co international in 
new york 
theres been a lot of liquidation over the last week or so by 
traders and a good deal of skepticism in the market he said 
thats a potent combination for stocks to go up 
others were more cautious based on technical analyses that 
showed a lack of demand for stocks 
were oversold enough to give us a pop but based on breadth i 
really dont think well get much to the upside nicoski said

copper futures prices plummeted tuesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange as edgy speculators ignored bullish supplyanddemand 
factors and sold heavily on fears that the market had topped 
on other markets precious metals were mixed grains and soybeans 
were lower livestock and meat futures were mostly higher energy 
futures retreated and stockindex futures advanced 
the miners strike in peru the worlds sixthlargest copper 
producer entered its fifth week with no hint of a settlement but 
most futures traders sold the market anyway 
copper settled 27 cents to 61 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 1299 a pound and the spot november 
contract at 1369 a pound about 17 cents below the record high of 
1538 reached nov 2 
the market is caught in the throes of bearish sentiment said 
george anagnos metals market analyst with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in chicago 
its sort of like a snowball going down a hill anagnos said 
it tends to gain momentum to the downside 
the selloff was sparked by weakening technical signals the 
chart patterns followed by many speculators he said as more people 
sold prices kept falling to levels that triggered further selling 
but anagnos noted that last years extraordinary copper rally 
which saw prices hit 146 a pound on new years eve included a 
20cent correction so the price slide of the past two weeks was not 
unprecedented 
this doesnt indicate the market is incapable of resuming its 
upside move he said the fundamental situation to me still 
portends upward prices 
in addition to the peruvian strike bullish fundamentals include 
tight supplies and strong demand for copper which is heavily used 
for construction and by almost every industry 
gold futures rose slightly but silver prices fell on the 
commodity exchange 
gold settled 40 cents to 60 cents higher with december at 42560 
a troy ounce silver was 5 cents to 52 cents lower with december at 
6393 a troy ounce 
soybean futures prices settled at a 3month low on the chicago 
board of trade on a late round of speculative selling corn also 
finished sharply lower while wheat futures were mixed 
prices were weak all session amid bearish chart signals and 
disappointment over the relatively slow pace of grain exports even 
the agriculture departments announcement late monday of a 
300000metricton corn sale to the soviet union did not rally the 
corn market which was expecting a soviet corn purchase of up to 2 
million metric tons 
jerry zusel manager of cbot floor operations for balfour 
maclaine corp in chicago said most of the selling was done by 
speculators while the outnumbered buyers were largely commercial 
traders 
theres just not enough cash business right now to support 
these price levels zusel said and if you cant go up youve 
got to go down 
wheat settled 7 cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 
413 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 5 cents lower with december at 
266 a bushel oats were 3 cents lower to cent higher with 
december at 210 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 15 cents lower 
with november at 743 a bushel 
cattle futures settled sharply higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange buoyed by improving cash markets and strong buying by 
commercial players analysts said 
pork futures enjoyed some spillover support from the adjacent 
cattle pits but gains were limited by expectations of lower cash 
prices on wednesday and concerns about the rapid buildup of pork 
bellies in cold storage 
live cattle settled 70 cent to 125 cents higher with december 
at 7335 cents a pound feeder cattle were 45 cent to 130 cents 
higher with november at 8205 cents a pound live hogs were 27 cent 
lower to 38 cent higher with december at 4105 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to 40 cent higher with february 
at 4487 cents a pound 
oil futures prices drifted lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange in dull directionless trading reversing the gains of the 
previous session 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 37 cents 
lower with december at 1390 a barrel heating oil was 23 cent to 
69 cent lower with december at 4440 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 55 cent to 120 cents lower with december at 4696 
cents a gallon 
stockindex futures posted modest gains on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for december delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 settled 65 point higher at 26950

a divided federal appeals court on tuesday 
refused to oust us district judge milton pollack from presiding 
over the civil insider trading case against investment giant drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
in a 2to1 decision the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
declined to intervene and remove pollack over an alleged conflict of 
interest the wall street firm did not immediately say whether it 
will appeal further 
but the decision was welcomed by officials at the securities and 
exchange commission which brought the massive civilfraud case 
against drexel more than two months ago 
naturally were pleased said daniel goelzer general counsel 
for the sec in washington we didnt feel that judge pollack was 
required to recuse disqualify himself and the court agreed with 
us 
drexel has claimed that it is playing a key role in financing the 
acquisition of palais royal inc a houstonbased retailing company 
in which pollacks wife moselle is a major stockholder 
although she has no direct relationship with drexel mrs pollack 
stands to gain about 35 million in the transaction 
drexel and other defendants including drexels highyield bond 
financier michael milken have contended that their connection to 
the judges wife creates an appearance of partiality by pollack 
toward them they have requested another judge that would make the 
case free of any possible taint 
in sometimes heated court sessions pollack an 82yearold 
jurist with a progovernment reputation balked at stepping aside 
calling the drexel move an illusionary diversion 
other lawyers familiar with the case have called the drexel move 
a tactical strategy to get another judge because of fear by defense 
attorneys that pollack would rule harshly against the firm 
we conclude that an objective observer knowing and 
understanding all the facts and circumstances could not reasonably 
question judge pollacks impartiality wrote circuit judge richard 
j cardamone with judge lawrence w pierce concurring 
but judge j edward lumbard disagreed in a sharply worded 
dissenting opinion saying it is clear to me that a reasonable 
person knowing these ultimate conceded facts would reasonably 
question judge pollacks ability to supervise such litigation 
impartially 
such a reasonable persons next question would be why hasnt 
the judge stepped aside moreover judge pollacks expressed 
resentment to the suggestion of recusal and his castigation of 
drexel and its counsel has confirmed these doubts he cannot act 
impartially in these cases lumbard wrote 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said we naturally are 
disappointed with todays decision in the us court of appeals we 
have not yet had an opportunity to review it and we will be doing 
so in the next few days 
the sec filed a 184page civil fraud complaint against drexel 
milken and three other employees sept 7 accusing them of trading 
on inside information cheating clients manipulating stock keeping 
phony books and other violations 
the sec also claimed drexel used the organization of convicted 
takeover speculator ivan f boesky as a front for its alleged 
illegal activities 
the defendants have denied any wrongdoing

a virulent form of citrus canker may 
have been detected again in a commercial grove in central florida 
state agriculture commissioner doyle conner announced tuesday 
the area in manatee county already is under restriction because 
of previous discoveries of citrus canker a strain in 1986 the 
announcement read 
the discovery was only the second time the canker has been found 
in a commercial florida grove in recent years 
state and federal plant pathologists are conducting extensive 
tests on suspicious samples taken from navel orange red and pink 
grapefruit and hamlin orange trees said a release by conners 
office 
in the meantime officials are surveying the area around the 
suspect groves to take action if the tests prove positive conner 
said 
there was no response to a telephone call to the agriculture 
department seeking elaboration on the announcement which was made 
late tuesday afternoon 
after canker was detected in florida in 1984 federal authorities 
declared a temporary embargo on citrus shipments and the state 
burned an estimated 20 million citrus trees the state has since 
been ordered to pay the owners of many of the trees who argued that 
agriculture authorities acted too hastily in destroying many groves 
not affected by canker 
a meeting of the joint statefederal citrus canker technical 
advisory committee has been called for friday in palmetto to 
recommend regulatory measures conner said 
the canker tentatively has been identified as the a strain the 
release said 
considered one of the more virulent strains of the disease it 
can spread rapidly producing premature fruit drop as well as stem 
fruit and leaf lesions conner said 
the a strain was discovered in the summer of 1986 on residential 
trees on anna maria island in st petersburg and in one commercial 
grove in manatee since those discoveries movement of citrus in 
manatee pinellas and hillsborough counties has been strictly 
regulated 
a total of 3600 infected trees have been discovered to date in 
those areas conner said

the rate of occupational injuries and disease 
is on the rise again with more than 6 million cases last year 
including 351000 more injuries and 53000 more illnesses than in 
1986 the government said tuesday 
a 5 percent jump in the incidence of jobrelated illnesses and 
injuries from 79 per every 1000 workers in 1986 to 83 per 1000 
workers last year was the first increase since 1984 the bureau of 
labor statistics said 
the aflcio blamed the increase on a lack of enforcement of 
federal safety standards and regulations by the occupational safety 
and health administration 
however directors of osha and the bureau of labor statistics 
said at least part of the increase can be attributed to better 
recordkeeping brought about in part by stiff fines against 
companies that underreport job accidents to the government 
meanwhile jobrelated fatalities in surveyed private businesses 
with 11 or more employees dropped from 3610 in 1986 to 3400 last 
year a decrease that bls officials called statistically 
insignificant 
a total of 5843100 onthejob injuries were reported last year 
compared with 5492000 in 1986 
nearly half of the injuries were serious enough to cost a full 
day or more of work and the number of workdays lost totaled 488 
million compared with 454 million workdays lost to injuries in 
1986 
about 190000 workers nearly 39 percent more than in 1986 
suffered jobrelated illnesses in 1987 most of them noiserelated 
hearing losses skin diseases and repetitive motion ailments such as 
carpal tunnel syndrome prevalent in the meatpacking industry 
the bureau said chronic and longterm latent cases that are often 
difficult to recognize or relate to the workplace are included in 
the illness statistics but are clearly understated 
labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood said the increase 
in the job injury and illness rates may be due to better 
recordkeeping resulting from new government guidelines and 
intensive efforts to improve the statistics 
for example the bls last year trained some 14000 
representatives from companies employing a total of 20 million 
people on keeping accurate injury and illness records 
the training plus a crackdown by osha on recordkeeping violations 
followed several years of complaints that companies were 
underreporting illnesses and accidents as a way of avoiding osha 
inspections 
among others the national academy of sciences last year 
questioned the validity of the governments job health and safety 
data because of severe underreporting by employers 
an academy panel said the actual number of jobrelated fatalities 
could be as much as triple those reported by the bureau 
during the first five years of the reagan administration osha 
targeted its inspectors on plants with higherthanaverage injury 
and illness rates critics said that merely gave employers an 
incentive to underreport them 
however in the past two years osha has levied hundreds of 
fines some of them in the millions of dollars against 
manufacturers for not reporting jobrelated injuries or illnesses 
over the short run improved reporting will mean higher injury 
and illness rates said assistant labor secretary john a 
pendergrass who heads osha but over the long run it should 
improve workplace conditions 
diane factor an industrial hygienist for the aflcio 
acknowledged that part of the increase is likely due to better 
records but she said jobrelated illnesses and injuries are still 
severely underreported particularly in highhazard industries like 
logging and agriculture where osha has not targeted its enforcement 
resources 
workmens compensation data from several states which is not 
dependent on employers recordkeeping also show substantial 
increases in injuries ms factor said in ohio for example 
the workmens comp data show a 15 percent increase last year in 
construction injuries 
the bls data show a decline in construction injuries and 
illnesses from 152 per every 1000 workers in 1986 to 147 per 1000 
last year in every other industry the incidence rate was either 
the same or higher last year 
of the 3400 reported onthejob fatalities last year twothirds 
occurred in the construction manufacturing transportation or 
public utility industries as in previous years the single biggest 
cause was traffic accidents accounting for about onethird of the 
deaths the government said 
the highest incidence of injuries continued to be the lumber and 
wood products industry at 186 per 1000 workers the same rate as 
1986 second was the metal industry with an injury rate of 163 per 
1000 workers up from 133 per 1000 a year earlier

griffin paid 96 million for trumps controlling block of class b 
shares or 135 a share he paid another 201 million for the less 
powerful class a shares or 36 a share 
the transaction will be completed wednesday when griffin pays 
trump 63 million to terminate his management contract with resorts 
sixtythree million for six months work thats not bad 
trump said 
griffin on wednesday also will sell resorts unfinished taj mahal 
casino project to trump for about 273 million 
thats 300 million less than resorts already has put into it 
so as you can see im very happy trump said 
griffin said after tuesdays closing in new york that its been 
a long exhausting process 
in april we felt it was a completed deal but there were so 
many assets involved he said its not just buying a hotel 
its buying an island a surveillance company real estate aircraft 
it has so many pieces that it was almost impossible to put it 
together 
it all came together today though in a stack of paper about 
100 feet high 
asked what advice he has for griffin trump said he has to 
work hard its going to be a very tough deal hes got the problem 
of the tajs debt and hes taking over a facility thats 60 years 
old 
he will have to invest millions in it trump said he also 
is taking over the place in the bahamas that has a brandnew casino 
opening next to it more millions will have to be spent to bring it 
up to date 
it looks like he could lose 50 million a year in this 
transaction trump said 
under terms of the deal griffin will make 25 million in 
improvements to resorts atlantic city casino and another 25 
million to the bahamas operation 
griffin said he believed both parties came out even in the 
deal he acknowledged that the resorts facilities are old but 
they are also charming 
i purchased the most famous house in atlantic city he said 
having the massive taj mahal open next door only benefits us it 
will bring a lot of people 
griffin said his first plan of action will be to start capital 
improvements on the properties so that when the taj opens and 
people taste this end of the boardwalk donald will be content with 
my spillover 
griffin a former big band singer and talk show host has 
developed a number of television game shows including wheel of 
fortune and jeopardy 
he financed the resorts deal through a 325 million bond offering 
and will contribute 50 million in equity into resorts one of the 
conditions that griffin wanted met before securing the deal a 200 
million tax break was granted by the internal revenue service 
trump said he raised 675 million to complete the 1250room taj 
mahal construction will begin again immediately and the doors 
should open in about 15 months he said 
also tuesday resorts international released its thirdquarter 
results showing a 3398 million net loss the bulk of which comes 
from the sale of the taj mahal and the cost of breaking the 
management contract that is compared to a net loss of almost 7 
million in the same quarter in 1987 
revenue for the third quarter totaled 1239 million compared to 
118 million for the same quarter last year 
the net loss for the first three quarters of 1988 was 3574 
million compared to net earnings of 59 million for the first 
three quarters of 1987 
ninemonth revenue rose to 3535 million up from 348 million a 
year earlier 
griffin has hired david p hanlon president of harrahs marina 
hotel and casino to run resorts internationals atlantic city 
gaming hall 
the numerous parcels of property that resorts owns in atlantic 
city will be sold little by little griffin said 
it shouldnt be coveted it should be out there made 
available to people theres a nice 15acre zoned parcel on the 
other side of showboat that would make a very nice spot for 
someone

extended to nov 18 
the offer launched oct 4 is conditioned on the removal of 
pillsburys poison pill defense judges in two states have left 
the pill intact despite lawsuits from grand met and dissident 
shareholders the pill would make a takeover prohibitively 
expensive further court action is pending on the issue 
grand met said 67595940 shares of pillsbury common stock had 
been tendered and not withdrawn by the monday night deadline 
pillsbury which has rejected the bid as inadequate had no 
comment on the extension of the offer 
chairman philip smith has told pillsbury shareholders they would 
be better off keeping their stock in light of the food and 
restaurant companys proposed spinoff of its burger king business 
into a separate public company 
pillsbury shareholders would receive a special dividend and stock 
burger king stock under the planned restructuring the company also 
is considering other moves to enhance shareholder value smith has 
said

with key franchisees a day after ian martin chief of grand mets 
us operations met with the 15member national business council 
the official representative of burger kings 1200 franchises 
a number of franchisees are upset over pillsburys plan to spin 
off burger king on the grounds that corporate support for their

amount of money to renovate existing burger king restaurants build 
more and improve the companys marketing the strategy could lead 
to streamlining and management changes at burger king headquarters 
in miami martin said 
we think burger king is a fantastic brand martin said in an 
interview after the franchisee meeting at the bilmore hotel in coral 
gables you cant have more than 5000 outlets with that brand 
name and not have a tremendously powerful brand names 
im impressed im very impressed with him said manny 
garcia who owns 38 burger king restaurants in central and northern

system forward

rumors that somebody possilby inspired by pillsbury might mount a 
takeover bid for grand met he called the notion that pillsbury 
could take over grand met in a socalled pac man defense against an 
unwanted suitor farfetched 
in such defense a target attempts to thwart a hostile buyout by 
taking over its suitor

the interstate commerce commission on tuesday 
overturned a federal arbitrators ruling that would have reinstated 
union pay rates and work rules that were slashed by guilford 
transportation industries last year in a sweeping costcutting 
reorganization 
the icc on a 31 vote ordered that union and company 
negotiators return to the arbitrators mediation table to try to 
work out new pay rates and work rules for the freight line the 
largest privatelyowned railroad in new england 
last year guilford reorganized its subsidaries boston amp maine 
and maine central putting them under springfield terminal a tiny 
rail line with much lower wage scales guilford officials argued 
that the move was necessary to cut costs and keep the company 
competitive 
in june arbitrator richard kasher ruled that workers transferred 
to springfield terminal must be the wages they received under their 
boston amp maine and maine central contracts and be subject to the 
work rules under those pacts 
but icc chairwoman heather j gradison ruling tuesday on an 
appeal from the company said the arbitrators decision on pay rates 
and work rules failed to give guilford officials management 
flexibility 
she voted with the majority to send the issue back to the 
arbitrator and negotiators for mediation although she noted that 
we have never seen anything to lead us to believe that the two 
sides can or will come up with an agreement 
our objective is we want to see this railroad operate we want 
to see management be fair to labor we want to see labor be fair to 
management she said its tempting to impose a solution here 
today but we believe you understand your business better than 
anybody else 
commissioner karen phillips voting with gradison and 
commissioner frederic n andre said she feared that forcing 
guilford to comply with the old union wage scales and work rules 
would cripple the company and its ability to compete 
guilford transportation the billerica mass company owned by 
timothy mellon a reclusive heir to the mellon banking family of 
pittsburgh reorganized last year saying it could not compete under 
the union wage and rule restrictions 
in a statement released following the commission meeting the 
company said it would wok within the process prescribed by the icc 
in the hope that it will pave the way for the railroad to meet the 
competitive challenges of the new england marketplace while at the 
same time meeting the requirements of the railroads employees 
commissioner paul h lamboley the lone dissenter said it was 
inappropriate to dissect portions of the arbitrators decision 
you cant break out bits and pieces of it he said adding that 
the commission was venturing into an area beyond its expertise 
eugene f lyden international vice president of the united 
transportation union said he was disappointed with the commissions 
ruling on pay rates and work rules but applauded the panels votes 
upholding other sections of the arbitrators decision 
the commission ruled 40 to affirm kashers decision to provide 
boston amp maine and maine central workers not rehired by springfield 
terminal with severance pay and benefits in accordance with the old 
contracts 
and the commission agreed that workers hired by springfield 
terminal must receive the difference between their new salaries and 
their old higher wages for up to six years but the workers would 
be subject to the new work rules that guilford officials say would 
make the company more efficient 
the commission also voted unanimously to require guilford to 
honor the seniority employees built up at boston amp maine and maine 
central

just days after initiating an industry move to 
drop discounts aimed at business travelers continental airlines 
announced a restructured maxsaver program tuesday that is 
expected to boost most remaining cutrate fares 
continental said maxsaver fares which are used by most vacation 
travelers would be based on the length of a flight under the new 
formula 
competition on individual routes not mileage had determined the 
fares in the past 
it was not immediately clear whether other big carriers would 
follow continentals move but the airline has been the pacesetter 
on fares in recent years 
the airline planned to notify travel agents about the new fares 
tuesday night and wednesday spokesman ned walker said in a 
telephone interview from continentals headquarters in houston he 
said the new maxsaver fares would take effect next wednesday 
you will see some maxsavers going up and some maxsavers going 
down walker said we are returning air fares to a more rational 
level 
he said fares for longer flights generally would be raised while 
those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced 
some travel agents told about the changes said they appeared to 
have the effect of raising roughly twothirds of continentals 
maxsaver fares and cutting the remaining third or so 
theyre going to raise it to the level that it should have been 
in the first place said jack bloch the owner of jbs world 
travel in new york 
maxsaver tickets must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance 
and require an overnight stay 
air fare structures have become geographically out of whack 
as a result of airlines frequently matching each others fare 
increases in recent months said robert decker an airline analyst 
for duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
the changes come amid plans by texas air corp subsidiary 
continental and other big us airlines to eliminate another 
category of discount air fares the junk fares available four 
to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business travelers 
in a move initiated by continental and followed by several major 
carriers the junk fares were slated to be eliminated on tuesday 
but the airlines decided to extend the deadline by a week because of 
confusion over the change 
only about 10 percent to 20 percent of all airline passengers use 
the lastminute junk fares according to some analysts estimates 
the popular maxsaver fares by contrast are used by most 
vacation travelers 
more than 90 percent of air travelers use some form of discount 
fare be it lastminute or advance purchase according to the air 
transport association an industry trade group based in washington 
the discounts generally arent available for flights during 
holidays like thanksgiving and christmas 
some examples of changes in continentals oneway maxsaver fares 
are 
between newark nj and houston current offpeak fare 129 
current peak fare 159 new offpeak 139 new peak unchanged 
between boston and dallas current offpeak 149 current peak 
169 new offpeak and peak both unchanged 
between phoenix and tampa fla current offpeak 174 current 
peak 204 new offpeak 159 new peak 179 
between newark and los angeles current offpeak 159 current 
peak 184 new offpeak 179 new peak 199 
between denver and seattle current offpeak 114 current 
peak 144 new offpeak 129 new peak 149

members of a union coalition 
representing 9200 workers at walt disney world voted overwhelmingly 
tuesday to accept a new threeyear contract ending a strike threat 
against the giant tourist attraction 
harvey totzke president of the sixunion service trades council 
reported union members voted 1059677 to approve the agreement 
which provided for immediate pay raises of 35 cents to 50 cents 
asked about two previous rejections of similar offers and 
repeated calls by some union members for a strike totzke said i 
think they finally took a realistic look at the offer i can say it 
now it was a fair offer we got all we could get 
bill ward disney vice president for labor relations said im 
obviously very happy about it we felt that we had a good contract 
rejection by twothirds of the voters would have authorized labor 
leaders to call a strike 
among the workers represented by the service trades council are 
ride operators sandwich makers bus drivers stockroom workers 
hotel housekeepers and clerks animal handlers monorail pilots and 
the people who portray mickey mouse donald duck goofy and other 
characters 
the company has said it was prepared for normal operations in the 
event of a strike disney officials planned to fill park operating 
jobs from among the 13000plus nonunion employees and from among 
management workers who chose not to observe a strike call and any 
people hired after a strike call 
the balloting was the second within four days 
an election last friday was nullified by union bosses who 
discovered some workers voted more than once angry employees 
rejected two earlier contract proposals contending they did not 
offer enough money for pay raises 
the new contract provides pay raises of 50 cents an hour to 
workers now at top scale who earn from 680 to 970 an hour and 
raises of 35 cents an hour for workers below top scale who now make 
485 to 920 an hour 
in april 1990 workers at top scale would get pay hikes of 45 
cents an hour while those below top scale would receive 30 cents an 
hour 
workers rejected an earlier package offering wage increases of 5 
percent in the first year and 4 percent in each of the contracts 
final two years plus other benefits 
dissatisfaction by many union members dates back to 1985 when 
the unions agreed to a twoyear wage freeze and took onetime 
bonuses instead two weeks later the company announced record 
revenue and profit for its 1985 fiscal year union members said 
the service trades council is composed of the service employees 
international union the hotel employees amp restaurant employees 
union the united food and commercial workers the transportation 
and communication union the international brotherhood of teamsters 
and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees

a federal judge has struck down a provision of 
united airlines contract with union machinists ruling the language 
was intended to hinder the pilots unions attempt to buy the 
carrier union and company officials said tuesday 
the air line pilots association sued in april to block two 
provisions in uniteds contract with the international association 
of machinists on the grounds 
the pilots union claimed the provisions were restrictive 
covenants aimed at blocking its more than 4 billion proposal to buy 
the airline said alpa spokesman hank krakowski in chicago 
us district judge james zagel on saturday rejected one 
provision which would have prohibited the pilots union from 
participating in an employee ownership plan unless the machinists 
and other unions agreed to the terms krakowski said 
russell mack uniteds vice president for corporate 
communications said late tuesday the airline would have no comment 
on the ruling 
united spokesman joe hopkins confirmed zagels rejection of the 
provision but said tuesday he did not know the details of the 
lawsuit or of the judges decision 
krakowski said that under the stricken provision any stock 
ownership option tendered to the pilots would have to be offered to 
the other unions and subjected to possible arbitration 
wed be in the position of trying to buy a company and not 
knowing what the price was going to be until after arbitration 
krakowski said 
local 1487 of the machinists which negotiated the contract with 
ual issued a statement confirming zagels rejection of the 
provision but made no further comment 
richard delaney president of the local was in florida on 
tuesday and would not be available for comment until next week said 
a union officer who declined to be identified 
zagel let stand the second provision challenged in the alpa 
lawsuit that provision would give the machinists a choice of 
reneging on their existing contract or extending it for three years 
in the event of any takeover 
in april 1987 the machinists refused to join alpa in its buyout 
attempt citing what union officials called philosophical and 
technical problems with the pilots proposal 
despite that refusal alpa officials said last december they 
considered the possibility of a sympathy strike against united if 
the machinists and the airline failed to agree on a contract 
the machinists pact containing the two provisions challenged by 
alpa was reached nov 15 1987 hours before expiration of a 30day 
coolingoff period 
alpa which has made three offers to acquire the airline has 
enlisted the aid of a syndicate of banks and the investment firm 
salomon brothers inc 
the pilots first proposal for a 45 billion employee takeover 
of united was made in april 1987 and rejected by its parent ual 
corp that same month as inadequate 
two months later in june 1987 alpa came back with a 
recapitalization plan under which ownership of united would have 
been transferred to employees and stockholders the company also 
rejected that proposal

yen in wednesday morning trading while share prices rose to another 
record high on the tokyo stock exchange

exchange dealers said activity was slow as investors waited for

september trade deficit scheduled for later wednesday in washington

bearish said an exchange dealer at a us commercial bank in 
tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the markets 
main price index rose 9921 points from tuesdays record close to 
finish the morning session at 2892862 a record for the early

briefly topped the 29000point mark for the first time but moved 
back slightly due to profittaking 
share prices appear to be as bullish as they can be said a 
dealer at nikko securities co in tokyo financial shares were 
down today but other shares such as construction are leading the 
market 
the dealer said it was a good sign that different types of issues 
were variously leading the market

most of the insurance companies that quit 
selling and renewing policies after last weeks voter approval of a 
ratecutting initiative have returned to the market according to an 
industry survey released tuesday 
but far fewer companies are offering homeowners and business 
liability policies according to the survey by the independent 
insurance agents and brokers of california 
the survey which gauged the market as of monday suggested that 
fears of mass insurer defections from the california market after 
last weeks passage of proposition 103 a ballot initiative that 
would deeply cut insurance rates were exaggerated 
numerous companies suspended policy sales and renewals after the 
initiative passed last tuesday but many have returned to the market 
since the state supreme court acting on an industry lawsuit put 
the measure on hold pending a trial 
as of monday the brokers group found companies making up 81 
percent of the california market were selling new auto insurance 
policies renewals were being offered by companies representing 94 
percent of the market 
for reasons the group has yet to determine the figures were far 
lower for homeowners and business policies 
insurers accounting for 75 percent of the market for homeowners 
policies were selling new policies while renewals were available 
from companies making up 83 percent of the market 
new commercial insurance policies were available from companies 
holding just 54 percent of that market and renewals were available 
in 66 percent of the market 
the figures are based on direct communication with 75 insurance 
carriers that hold more than 90 percent of the market and were 
valid as of monday said joseph annotti spokesman for the agents 
group 
while the high courts stay has returned stability to the market 
the longterm health of the industry and the availability of 
insurance to consumers depends on the outcome of the lawsuit 
annotti said he repeated frequent industry warnings that most 
insurers would incur unacceptable losses if proposition 103 were 
upheld 
the measure backed by consumer crusader ralph nader was 
approved by voters who rejected four other competing initiatives 
proposed by industry or trial lawyers groups 
proposition 103s principal effect would be to roll rates for 
nearly all types of insurance back to november 1987 levels and then 
impose an additional 20 percent cut
