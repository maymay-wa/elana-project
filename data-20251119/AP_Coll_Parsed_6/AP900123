less than a month away from elections prime 
minister toshiki kaifu finds himself with more critics than 
supporters among the public and lukewarm backing in his own party 
kaifu 59 took office in august after two predecessors had 
resigned because of scandals and election losses by the previously 
invincible liberal democratic party opinion polls show disapproval 
outweighing support and anlysts say his situation is worse within 
the party 
the prime minister dissolved parliaments powerful lower house 
wednesday to begin the campaign for the elections feb 18 with 
parliament disbanded kaifu will not be able to deliver a major 
policy speech before the vote or make progress on the budget and 
revising the unpopular sales tax 
inside the ldp kaifu is very very weak said seizaburo 
sato a professor at tokyo university hes not regarded by 
fellow ldp members as the best candidate for prime minister 
his position gives kaifu the final say on dissolving the lower 
house and setting the election date but other leaders in the party 
apparently decided on feb 18 
this demonstrates kaifu is weak he has weak initiative 
sato said 
when kaifu was chosen as party president and prime minister he 
was viewed as an eloquent littleknown reformer party veterans 
saw the former education minister as an untarnished politician who 
could help restore the image of the liberal democrats 
so far he has not been touched by problems that brought down 
his predecessors sousuke uno and prime ministers noboru 
support ratings for kaifu in public opinion polls have ranged 
between 35 percent and 45 percent well above the singledigit 
ratings accorded takeshita last spring 
a poll released tuesday by asahi a major national newspaper 
showed 37 percent of those surveyed supported kaifus government 
compared with 35 percent in december asahi said the slight 
increase probably resulted from kaifus european tour jan 818 
disapproval of kaifu also rose however to 41 percent from 40 
in december the poll was a random survey of 3000 people last 
weekend and asahi did not give a margin of error 
poll results indicate the liberal democrats will have trouble 
keeping a majority in the 512seat lower house where they have 295 
seats the socialists with 84 seats hope to win at least 140 and 
join with other opposition parties to deny a majority to the 
liberal democrats who have governed japan since the party was 
formed in 1955 
the impression that kaifu still is considered an interim leader 
was bolstered by the reports that others chose the election date 
and the fact that former foreign minister shintaro abe led a party 
delegation to moscow in midjanuary to some extent distracting 
attention from kaifus european tour 
analyst kenzo uchida wrote in the japan times that efforts by 
kaifu and abe improve the party image through diplomacy were 
spoiled by the negative image of their personal ambitions and 
rivalry 
oldguard politicians temporarily banished from the limelight 
by the recruit stockdealing and bribery scandal are expected to 
make strong comebacks after the election 
abe 65 and former finance minister kiichi miyazawa 69 
control major party factions and are strong contenders for party 
leader whatever the election result 
although kaifu could continue as prime minister if the liberal 
democrats retain their majority in the lower house analysts say 
his mediocre poll ratings and weakness within the party make it 
unlikely 
he was a surprise choice as party leader after uno resigned to 
take responsibility for the july elections in which the liberal 
democrats lost their majority in the upper house 
kaifu represents one of the weakest party factions and has 
little political clout but leaders of larger blocs were too 
tainted by the scandal to seek the job 
five main factions vie for influence in the party and members 
customarily vote along faction lines in elections for party 
president kaifus group was founded by the late prime minister 
takeo miki who was known as the mr clean of japanese politics 
for his opposition to corruption 
keiichiro nakamura another analyst said kaifu was chosen 
not because of his personal policies or qualifications but 
because of the power of factions

the welldressed dog neednt rely on 
a bulky collar or unsightly tattoo anymore to identify his owner 
the chic pooch of today can wear a microchip tucked neatly under 
his fur 
about 10000 pets in the united states and canada have been 
injected with the infopet identification system said dian street 
the director of operations for the firm based in suburban los 
angeles 
the microchips carry an identification number readable by 
handheld scanners like the ones in supermarket checkout counters 
provided free to animal shelters street said 
the id number is called in to infopet which then retrieves the 
pets ownership records the process costs 40 for the chip 
implantation and 11 a year to keep the records 
in california 23 animals with the chips have been reported 
reunited with their owners 
the tiny chips provide a more reliable means of helping find a 
lost pets home than collars or tattoos that can fade said one 
veterinarian 
this system is virtually foolproof said dr tom carpenter 
of the newport harbor animal hospital which serves as the newport 
beach animal shelter

awaiting an abortion florica poptean 
sat calmly on a bed in polizu hospital and recalled that five years 
earlier she was brought bleeding and unconscious to the same 
hospital after trying to end a pregnancy by herself 
during nicolae ceausescus rule abortion was strictly limited 
in romania and illegal operations led to thousands of deaths and 
injuries each year 
now at polizu the countrys largest maternity hospital doctors 
are performing 80 to 100 abortions daily 
dr gabriel bonceanu who supervises the interns who do many of 
the abortions says 60 of the operations are carried out between 8 
am and noon 
mrs poptean was in a room with four other women who had just 
had abortions or were awaiting the surgery all five women said 
they simply asked to have an abortion and were given an appointment 
we have the liberty now to make our own decisions on when we 
have children said mrs poptean 
the change came with the toppling of ceausescu and the scrapping 
of a law that prohibited abortion for women under 45 unless their 
lives were in danger the law was part of the dictators effort to 
increase romanias population from 23 million to 30 million by the 
end of the century 
mrs poptean said that at age 36 with a 13yearold son she 
felt she was too old to cope with a newborn especially with 
conditions still uncertain in romania 
five years before she said she was afraid to have another 
child because of her familys disastrous economic state and could 
not afford an illegal abortion 
i tried to induce it myself with a rubber tube she said 
i started hemorrhaging and wound up being taken here 
unconscious 
afterwards she said she was questioned by a panel that 
demanded to know who had performed the abortion or if she had done 
it herself the panels decided whether women could have abortions 
and were said to include police and prosecution officials 
i told them i had an accident she said you had to have 
the courage to resist them 
dr bonceanu said that last year more than 4000 women were 
brought to polizu hospital suffering from unsuccessful abortions 
either selfinduced or performed by others in his hospital alone 
he said 17 women died and many others suffered permanent injuries 
an unofficial figure puts the number of women who died from 
failed abortions throughout the country at 800 to 1000 annually 
dr bonceanu said 
one of mrs popteans roommates 23yearold carmen bragadiru 
said she would not have had the courage to have an illegal abortion 
without the change in the law i would have had the baby 
she said 
like most of the dozen women interviewed at polizu mrs 
bragadiru said she could not afford another child she works at the 
post office and lives with her carpainter husband and their 
3yearold son in two rooms 
if they raise salaries id have another child said 
stefania ratoiu a 32yearold mother of two who had just had an 
abortion 
mrs ratoiu said she also had induced an abortion herself with 
an earlier pregnancy i did it because otherwise they would not 
have let me in the hospital 
none of the women interviewed said they had been able to 
practice birth control other than by the rhythm method part of 
ceausescus policy to increase the population was to outlaw family 
planning information and birth control pills and devices 
dr bonceanu said there was an urgent need for other countries 
to provide birth control pills and devices and family planning 
information 
this is a big problem because we in romania do not have the 
money for this he said 
standing in a hallway as one woman after another was guided in 
and out of two small operating rooms dr bonceanu said the 
hospital was short of drugs and medical gear it does not have the 
modern equipment used to carry out suction abortions and depends on 
the traditional curetage method 
nearby a woman was washing rubber surgical gloves and drying 
them on a radiator so they could be used again

china will spend more on defense this year an 
official newspaper said today reversing a trend over recent years 
to give the military low priority and allow its budget to lag 
behind inflation 
the china daily without giving figures quoted state planning 
commission officials as saying defense spending will rise from 
1989 when the budget was officially 522 billion 
it will be the first budget since the military crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters last june 
the government has sought to reward the peoples liberation army 
for carrying out the widely unpopular move by giving it a more 
visible government role and by launching a campaign to boost its 
reputation 
the china daily said defense spending has stayed at about the 
same level since 1986 while the national price index has gone up 
by more than 40 percent 
defense spending last year was 119 percent of the national 
budget down from 1988 when the budget of 46 billion was 122 
percent of the total 
a western military expert said chinas military spending may be 
far larger than reported because great chunks may be included in 
other budgets 
the military was on the losing end of budgetary battles during 
the 1980s as tensions with the soviet union eased and senior leader 
deng xiaoping gave priority to spending for economic development 
deng reduced the size of the peoples liberation army from 4 
million to 3 million and has ordered defense industries to switch 
to producing civilian goods 
the daily said 80 percent of defense industries are now turning 
out civilian products worth almost 425 billion last year 
china does not break down defense spending and such items as 
the major cost of settling and housing retired soldiers and 
military procurement may be listed in other budgets 
the western military expert speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a recent report that the government will cut arms production 
by 45 percent this year while possibly true may not be that 
significant 
china still has many arms factories built in isolated mountain 
regions of the chinese interior during the 1960s when mao tsetung 
feared a soviet invasion they are producing little and could be 
closed without serious effect on the industry he said 
theres an awful lot of fat to be cut he said

the neonazi movement is familiar fodder for 
docudramas so lionel chetwynd decided to try a different approach 
make a tv movie that explores the attraction of nazism for ordinary 
people 
why do good ordinary people become nazis you wont find the 
answer to that on the front page of newspapers chetwynd said 
you cant make a docudrama about how decent people are seduced by 
this dark shadow this is a cautionary tale 
so proudly we hail which cbs broadcasts tonight tells 
parallel stories of three young men and a college professor who 
view the extremist group as the answer to their problems 
in 1923 adolf hitler staged the beer hall putsch in munich 
chetwynd said he was sent to jail where he wrote mein kampf 
he had only a few followers yet within six years the nazis were a 
major force in germany if you can do that with just a brokendown 
telephone system what can be accomplished in this day of 
computers television and fax machines imagine what a 
sophisticated technically aware group could do in this country 
the twohour movie stars david soul as a charismatic white 
supremacist who heads a group called the aryan resurgence movement 
edward herrmann plays a professor who accepts souls offer to 
publish his theory on cultural differences to avoid a threatened 
loss of tenure if he doesnt publish a scholarly work 
chad lowe billy morrissette and peter dobson also star as three 
young drifters recruited as skinheads by raphael sbarge 
there arent enough evil people to accomplish the purposes of 
these leaders said chetwynd who also served as the movies 
executive producer they accomplish their goals by convincing 
ordinary people that the cure for their problems is to get rid of 
people who are not like them they convince them that jews 
coloreds and homosexuals are behind their troubles 
this movie doesnt have a happy ending it has what i think is 
a realistic ending the movement isnt destroyed you cant kill a 
dragon with one blow 
this a story without the obvious victims you tell it in a 
context that separates them from their victims the issues are not 
clear cut it may take viewers a while to see what these people are 
up to the neonazis succeed by addressing issues that frighten 
other politicians theirs is the only voice being heard 
chetwynd said hes concerned that people accept the presentation 
of issues on television as truth 
we say up front that we made this story up he said its 
just one view of what extremism is in this country we didnt 
research it to death it doesnt stand for all extremism in 
america 
chetwynd was born in england and raised in canada when just 16 
he lied about his age and joined the black watch the royal 
highland regiment of canada he later studied at sir george 
williams university and mcgill university law school in canada 
his skill as a champion debater took him to england where he 
was invited to complete law studies at oxfords trinity college he 
began writing stage plays while working for the distribution arm of 
columbia pictures in london 
chetwynd usually is associated with movies that have a point of 
view in 1988 he wrote to heal a nation the story behind the 
vietnam war memorial in washington other movies include evil in 
clear river children in the crossfire and miracle on 
ice his feature films are the apprenticeship of duddy 
kravitz and hanoi hilton 
he also is developing movies on what happens when cocaine and 
crack infect a small middleclass town and on the effect of 
television on college sports along with a theatrical film for 
whoopi goldberg called mommy never told me 
television gives him the latitude to deal with controversial 
issues chetwynd said 
it begins with the idea that television is an extraordinary 
medium and if by happenstance and good fortune im able to do 
quality work thats a great gift he said i cant say i 
wouldnt want to do something profitable like a hit series but 
im quite happy

the labor minister called this months 
unprecedented wave of strikes an expression of democracy but 
condemned the use of violence by strikers and said some could be 
fired 
strikes for higher wages have disrupted major hospitals ports 
transport services and factories across the southern african 
country authorities say six hospital patients in the port city of 
beira died as a result of a walkout by nurses seeking to double 
their pay 
labor minister aguiar mazula at a news conference monday said 
the government accepted the right of workers to strike but would 
insist that proper procedures be followed 
in terms of a decree issued jan 10 a strike is legal only if 
approved by a trade union committee or a mass meeting of workers 
and if 72 hours advance notice is given to the employer and the 
government 
many of the strikers have not taken these steps and mazula said 
they could face dismissal 
mazula said there was no justification for strikerelated 
sabotage much less the deaths of innocent people 
he said most of the strikers demands were reasonable but that 
many employers including the government could not afford to 
meet them 
referring to the nurses demand for a 100 percent pay raise 
mazula said the state cannot grant such claims and i think the 
strike leaders know perfectly well the condition of the country 
we are living on donated food and donated medicine our level 
of productivity is extremely low he said 
since 1977 two years after independence from portugal 
mozambique has been wracked by a hitandrun insurgency waged by 
rebels of the mozambique national resistance 
the leftist government which last year dropped 
marxismleninism as its official ideology has tried to counter 
the economic devastation through a major reform program that has 
included several currency devaluations and a lessening of state 
control over production

the golden arches are up and a crew of 630 is 
standing by ready to begin serving the first moscow big macs 
which must taste the same as those bought at any other mcdonalds 
in the world 
quality control is the responsibility of craig sopkowicz of 
milwaukee who is putting the finishing touches on a training 
program for the soviets hired to man the grills cola dispensers 
and cash registers at the glistening new restaurant on pushkin 
square just blocks from red square 
moscowmcdonalds a joint venture set up by mcdonalds 
restaurants of canada ltd and the food service administration of 
the moscow city council began its search for staff in november 
the response to an ad in moscows youth newspaper was 
overwhelming with 30000 applications for the available jobs 
we had some applications from people who lived two days travel 
time away from moscow sopkowicz said they really wouldnt 
have minded traveling two days to work here 
in the end sopkowicz and other mcdonalds executives personally 
interviewed 4100 applicants before finally deciding on the final 
630 for the restaurant 
we looked for applicants who lived close to the restaurant 
among other things sopkowicz said most of those we hired are 
university students several of them speak english and about 30 
percent have a second language other than russian he said 
the next step for sopkowicz and his crew was the task of 
training the young soviets to provide the kind of fast service 
required of all mcdonalds establishments 
first we used video training tapes dubbed into russian 
then all of our training manuals were translated into russian 
which made it easy for us because we worked alongside of them with 
the same manuals in english he said 
language for the soviet crew will not be a problem this 
restaurant is for the soviet people and not restricted to 
foreigners and tourists with hard currency like most of the other 
foreignoperated restaurants in moscow 
rubles will be the currency for purchasing big macs although 
when 19 other planned mcdonalds restaurants open over the next 
five years about half will be restricted to hard currency 
customers 
as the training neared its end and uniforms were being issued 
to the new employees the work pace of sopkowicz and other 
executives was frantic 
look at my feet he said in an interview on a snowy morning 
i have to wear running shoes to keep up 
sopkowicz has not had time to miss milwaukee not even the 
weather i dont really notice any difference milwaukee can be 
20 degrees below the same as it is here there it also can snow 
every day for a month a lot like here he said 
with the grand opening scheduled for jan 31 the restaurant is 
getting the final distinctive mcdonalds touches 
menus printed in russian offer fewer items than the typical 
us mcdonalds fare the basic menu includes big mac 
filetofish double cheeseburger double hamburger cheeseburger 
milk cocktail milkshake soft drinks french fries and ice cream 
sundaes 
prices which have not been officially posted will be roughly 
equivalent to those in western mcdonalds which will make the the 
big mac a reletively expensive meal for a russian who earns about 
one fifth the average western salary 
but sopkowicz and other mcdonalds executives are expecting 
hordes of customers and are geared up to serve 17000 daily 
in the final days of training the new staff is being drilled on 
the fact that a mcdonalds is a mcdonalds no matter where it is 
we are explaining that they must be polite friendly and say 
things like have a good day and come back soon phrases 
seldom heard in soviet restaurants and shops 
but sopkowicz is optimistic all the people we hired they 
all had a sparkle in their eye they still have it he said we 
had 4100 people to choose from we had the pick of the crop easy 
to train and fully adaptable to our equipment procedure and 
policy

the antics of a lone moose who has 
been trying to court the attentions of dairy cows may be amusing to 
onlookers but a farmer has had enough of the confused creature 
during the weeks he has been circulating around the area of 
western massachusetts the moose has become a minor celebrity 
drawing regular visitors to the farm that frank montague runs for 
his son peter 
theyre all over the place he said of the onlookers the 
first day by that afternoon there were a half dozen cars and 
theyre not happy just to look from the road theres a road 
besides the barn on my property and they go all the way down 
three years ago more than 75000 people visited a shrewsbury 
vt farm where a 700pound moose spent 76 days wooing a hereford 
cow named jessica a song called lovesick moose was written 
about the two 
steven winkler frank montagues nephew said the family has 
asked the state department of fisheries and wildlife to move the 
moose which has been hanging around the farm since jan 10 
hes gotten to be a pain in the neck he hops over the fence 
where the cows feed but for some reason he just cant see the 
fence down in the back near the swamp winkler said 
state wildlife biologist james cardoza said his office has 
monitored the mooses whereabouts since it was first sighted in the 
area in october 
if the moose doesnt move on soon what well try to do is 
herd him to a larger area of forest where he is less likely to get 
in trouble cardoza said

a threedayold strike at the port of 
baltimore ended monday night and dockworkers were expected back on 
the job tuesday union officials said 
were definitely back to work said tim nickel vice 
president of local 953 of the international longshoremens 
association ive been calling people and telling them to report 
to work at 8 am tomorrow 
the tentative proposal was reached monday in new york between 
the longshoremen and negotiators for the steamship trade 
association neither side would release details but said the 
agreement is similar to one that was to have been voted on last 
friday 
the agreement still calls for reduction in the number of jobs 
held by members of local 953 but the new proposal allows the union 
the jurisdiction to get the jobs back should the work return to the 
port 
im certainly disappointed in the fact that the cuts are still 
there but nonetheless we have a foundation established over 
what 953s jurisdiction is and we have to live with it said 
richard hughes president of 953 
gov william donald schaefers press secretary paul schurick 
said a vote on the proposal was scheduled for wednesday 
schurick said the governor was optimisic and pleased with the 
news and said the contract is a step in the right direction toward 
restoring baltimores competitiveness in shipping

education secretary lauro cavazos is still 
drawing mixed reviews from the education establishment 16 months 
into his job but his critics are showing signs of softening 
we grade him somewhere in the c range we changed it from a 
cminus because of his announcement of a report on the reading 
and writing performance of american schoolchildren said jeanne 
allen education policy analyst at the heritage foundation one of 
his harshest critics 
cavazos the former president of texas tech university who 
became the first hispanic cabinet official in the waning days of 
president reagans administration has drawn fire in president 
bushs administration 
opponents call cavazos a government outsider whose lowkey 
management style doesnt provide the vocal advocacy needed for 
education 
i dont think hes hurt by it it comes with the turf said 
lon anderson a cavazos aide the secretary tells us ive had a 
lot of praise too with my style my style has been very successful 
for me it has carried me a long way im a cabinet member 
hell be around for a while said anderson 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater recently dismissed 
reports that cavazos might be on his way out telling reporters 
he has the job as long as he wants it secretary cavazos has done 
an outstanding job 
at the department cavazos has been credited with restoring a 
civil tone after the confrontational tactics that marked the tenure 
of his predecessor william bennett now the national antidrug 
czar 
from the first cavazos reached out to the education 
establishment that bennett repeatedly attacked he says he wants to 
work with teachers and others to solve the problems of the nations 
schools where bennett called press conferences cavazos calls 
private meetings away from the cameras and eyes of reporters 
some education department officials say cavazos approach is 
both a blessing and a curse although bennett was publicly 
badmouthed for his combative style he grabbed attention and made 
education a subject of national discussion 
bennett used the office as a bully pulpit said ms allen 
cavazos should use it in the same way 
she said cavazos national assessment of educational progress 
last year was an example of the effort that should be made more 
often to make sure that the message is getting to the american 
people 
in speeches to education groups all over the country cavazos 
repeatedly has focused on his personal concerns reducing high 
school dropout rates expanding and improving early childhood 
education and broadening opportunities for minorities the 
disabled and the disadvantaged 
cavazos dislikes comparisons to bennett said department 
officials instead he sees similarities with the lowkey terrel h 
bell president reagans education secretary 
i appreciate that bell said in an interview i just think 
each of us has to stand on our own i think hes doing a fine job 
under the circumstances 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee isnt happy with cavazos and has suggested the 
committees ranking republican william goodling of pennsylvania 
is one of at least four others who could replace cavazos 
but goodling believes that cavazos has learned how to work 
inside the government i view his performance as someone who has 
grown dramatically in the job he had no political experience 
before coming to washington and positively no experience within 
the beltway which means you have about 100 strikes against you 
hes not flamboyant doesnt seek publicity said goodling 
the last guy bennett did but didnt do anything for education 
i think its time to just let cavazos alone and see if he can do 
the job give him the opportunity to do the job 
outside washington cavazos receives more positive assessments 
one of the things cavazos has been doing very quietly is 
bringing on good people said leonard britton superintendent of 
los angeles public schools he definitely knows where he wants to 
go in that regard 
cavazos is bringing back credibility i think he said 
he also gets high marks from some educators for emphasizing 
minority education 
rita esquival director of the office of bilingual education and 
minority languages affairs said the secretary of education has 
done more for language minority children than any other secretary 
he comes from a background where he knows firsthand that its 
important and he has allowed us to blossom and flourish 
robert bailey superintendent of the native american school 
district of busby in montana added i feel positive about his 
focus on native americans and bilingual education bennett had a 
different philosophy he felt that minority languages should not be 
supported

the supreme court says the right to be tried 
by an impartial jury does not entitle a white defendant to have 
blacks serve as jurors deciding the accuseds fate 
but the justices sharply divided over the issue indicated that 
in some future case they might rule that excluding blacks as jurors 
does discriminate unlawfully against white defendants 
those seemingly contradictory conclusions were spelled out 
monday in the case of daniel holland a chicagoarea white man 
sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape kidnapping and armed 
robbery 
he was convicted by an allwhite jury after prosecutors barred 
the only two blacks among more than 30 prospective jurors from 
serving on the panel 
in other action the court 
sent a new signal it will permit widespread random drug 
testing for government workers even when public safety is not at 
stake the justices without comment refused to interfere with 
random drug tests for some justice department employees and 
civilian army drug and alcohol counselors 
ruled 63 that lawyers in the nations capital violated 
antitrust law when they went on strike to demand higher pay 
from the city for representing penniless criminal defendants 
agreed to use a north carolina case to decide whether nuclear 
industry whistleblowers who say they were disciplined for 
complaining about lax safety may sue under state personal injury 
laws 
said it will decide in a decadelong haitian refugee case when 
the government must pay legal fees to people who sue it 
successfully the court will hear a bush administration appeal 
aimed at limiting the fees 
voted to study a former high school wrestling coachs 
15yearold libel lawsuit against an ohio newspaper at issue is 
how courts are to distinguish between fact and opinion in 
libel cases 
in the holland case the court voted 54 that his sixth 
amendment right to be tried by a jury representing a fair 
crosssection of the community was not violated 
left unanswered is whether hollands or any other white 
defendants 14th amendment right is abridged when prospective 
jurors are excluded because they are black the 14th amendment 
guarantees equal protection under the law broadly prohibiting 
racial bias 
justice anthony m kennedy who voted with the majority monday 
said he might switch his vote if the issue is 14th amendment 
protections 
i find it essential to make clear that if hollands claim 
here were based on the 14th amendment equal protection clause it 
would have merit he said 
holland had not asked the high court to consider the 14th 
amendment issue in his case 
the justices in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify 
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th 
amendments ban on discrimination but that case involving a black 
defendant and black jurors applied only to instances in which the 
defendant and the jurors are the same race 
the court never has said whether unlawful racial discrimination 
in jury selection occurs when the accused is of a different race 
than the excluded jurors 
the 1986 ruling dramatically curtailed the traditionally broad 
power of prosecutors to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by 
using peremptory or automatic challenges 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court in hollands 
appeal said race as such has nothing to do with the legal issue 
in this case 
hollands sixth amendment claim would be just as strong if the 
object of the exclusion had been not blacks but postmen or 
lawyers or clergymen or any number of other identifiable 
groups he said 
the sixth amendment no more forbids the prosecutor to strike 
jurors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on 
the basis of innumerable other generalized characteristics he 
said 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said the 
majority today insulates an especially invidious form of racial 
discrimination in the selection of juries the elimination of 
racial discrimination in our system of criminal justice is not a 
constitutional goal that should lightly be set aside 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and harry a 
blackmun 
justice john paul stevens in a separate dissent said a jury 
that is the product of such a racially discriminatory selection 
process cannot possibly be an impartial jury within the meaning of 
the sixth amendment 
joining scalia were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor byron r white and kennedy

us officials are assuring the nicaraguan 
contras they can count on additional us humanitarian assistance 
regardless of the outcome of next months national elections in 
that country 
a 50 million aid program is due to expire just days after the 
feb 25 elections but legislative ground rules allow aid 
deliveries to continue through march the upcoming expiration of 
the program has produced speculation that aid to the contras may 
finally end after almost 10 years 
if the opposition coalition led by presidential candidate 
violeta chamorro wins the election it is widely expected the 
rebels will return peacefully to nicaragua from their base camps in 
honduras 
in that event renewed us aid would be designed to help the 
reintegration process said the us officials asking not to be 
identified 
but according to the officials if president daniel ortega and 
his sandinista front win either through a fair process or through 
fraud the contras are expected to continue on as a fighting 
force many are said to be committed to resuming the armed struggle 
against the sandinista army in the event chamorro loses even if 
the process is honest 
whether the contras are able to pose a credible military threat 
is another question they have received no us military aid for 
almost two years and none from any other source so far as is known 
at present the us program of providing food clothing 
shelter and medical services is reaching just less than 10000 
contras based at camps in southern honduras and about 50000 family 
members living there 
the contra leaders have been told there is a political 
consensus in the united states within the administration and the 
congress that the basic needs of contras must continue to be met 
even after the current aid allocation runs out an official said 
the form of any future aid package would be the subject of 
discussions between the administration and the congress over the 
next two months 
members of congress have had little to say on the issue lately 
because they have been in recess for more than a month but it is 
expected democrats will generally insist any new aid program be 
linked to a process of reintegrating the rebels back into 
nicaraguan society the administration on the other hand likely 
will favor providing aid with few strings 
the administration has expressed strong doubts about sandinista 
intentions regarding free and fair elections citing what it claims 
have been repeated instances of violence and intimidation against 
opposition candidates 
the sandinistas argue the incidents have been isolated and 
exaggerated by the administration 
the nature of the contra presence in honduras has changed 
considerably in recent months as many as 3000 contras have 
abandoned the main honduran base location at yamales and headed 
eastward through extraordinarily dense foliage to an area less 
exposed to potential sandinista attacks 
the forces deployed in that forbidding region are being 
sustained by ussponsored airdrops of food and other supplies 
these rebels are worried not only about the sandinista military 
but also about united nations and organization of american states 
officials participating in a commission set up to demobilize the 
contras 
the five central american presidents created the commission in 
august within weeks many rebels began fleeing eastward while 
others up to 2500 redeployed inside nicaragua 
as officials described it these contras want to give up the 
struggle according to their own timetable and not that of an 
international commission they are not convinced it is safe as yet 
to return to nicaragua despite sandinista assurances that the 
current electoral process is genuinely democratic

senate leaders predict a lengthy and at 
times contentious floor battle as congress works on opposing 
plans to clean up the nations dirty and unhealthy air 
a bill to tighten air pollution controls was being sent this 
afternoon to the senate floor where critics are expected to offer 
amendments aimed at lowering the cost to industry and easing the 
impact on automakers 
this debate has been a long time in coming senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine told reporters monday 
predicting long formidable at times contentious debate 
a similar although less stringent clean air bill has yet to 
clear a house committee as congressmen watch the issues progress 
in the senate 
with more than 100 million people breathing air the government 
considers unhealthy and growing concern over the destruction of 
streams and lakes by acid rain there is little disagreement over 
the need for tougher federal air pollution controls 
but there is sharp dissent between senate democrats and 
president bush on how much of a burden industry should be asked to 
assume 
last week bush called the senate bill too expensive saying it 
would cost twice as much as the administrations clean air proposal 
which is similar to the house bill but would not provide 
significantly cleaner air bush said he would only sign a bill that 
balances environmental and economic considerations 
mitchell and key sponsors of the senate bill on monday disputed 
bushs cost figures and maintained the administration plan does not 
provide enough protection from urban air pollution and the health 
effects of toxic industrial releases 
the bush proposal is much weaker and doesnt do the job 
declared sen max baucus dmont chairman of the environment and 
public works subcommittee that crafted the senate legislation 
bush estimated the cost of his plan at 19 billion a year and 
said the senate bill would cost 40 billion a year most of the 
increased cost is attributed to tighter standards after the turn of 
the century for automobile emissions and toxic industrial releases 
mitchell said although the senate plan might be slightly more 
expensive he disputed the white houses estimate a cheaper 
solution is often not the best solution he told reporters 
supporters of the senate bill called it a health bill and 
suggested its costs are dwarfed by the additional health costs the 
nation will face if automobile and industrial pollution is not 
reduced over the next decade 
fran dumelle of the american lung association said the annual 
health costs associated with air pollution five years ago were 
estimated at 15 billion to 40 billion today the 40 billion 
figure has become a middle range and the health toll continues 
to rise she said 
all three proposals call for a 10 million ton reduction of acid 
rain pollutants primarily by utilities in the midwest where plants 
rely heavily on highsulfur coal 
a major battle is expected to involve who will pay for expensive 
pollution controls on the dirtiest plants senators from many 
midwest states where the plants are located have argued in favor 
of a nationwide cost sharing plan but the white house and 
senators from other states oppose any such distribution of costs 
the senate bill also would impose stringent automobile tailpipe 
emission controls beginning in the year 2003 the administration 
says that plan would only marginally improve air quality but be 
costly to the auto industry 
supporters say the administration cost estimates are exaggerated 
and that tougher standards are needed to push manufacturers into 
developing new pollution control technology

here are the major provisions of clean air 
legislation being considered by congress to significantly curb air 
pollution by the turn of the century 
acid rainequals 
the legislation would significantly reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions from coalburning electric power plants at an estimated 
cost of 10 million by the year 2000 when emissions would be 
capped some 107 plants mostly in the midwest would face the most 
severe controls the legislation would also require plants to 
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions utilities would be allowed to 
trade and sell pollution credits to reduce costs incurred at the 
worstpolluting plants 
smogequals 
the legislation provides for tighter automobile tailpipe 
emission controls similar to california standards the senate bill 
also proposes a second phase of emission curbs aiming at a further 
50 percent reduction in such pollution by the year 2003 the 
legislation also provides for controls on pollution from a variety 
of commercial sources including gas stations painting facilities 
and dry cleaners urban areas would have to meet federal air 
quality and health standards in 5 to 15 years depending on the 
severity of the problem los angeles would have 20 years 
toxic chemicalsequals 
the legislation would require that industry install maximum 
achievable control technology to reduce the release of more than 
200 toxic chemicals from industrial sources the environmental 
protection agency would be allowed to impose additional measures if 
it determines a continual health risk existed from toxic releases 
the senate version would also require stage ii healthbased 
standards that direct industry to take additional steps to limit 
residual cancer risks to make them no greater than the risk of 
one cancer for 10000 exposures 
other measuresequals 
the legislation would require for the first time that industry 
obtain federal pollution permits would toughen enforcement and 
penalties for pollution violators would require businesses and 
local governments to promote mass transit car pools and other 
measures to reduce automobile travel in the worst pollution areas 
and would in the senate version call for fleetwide automobile 
mileage of 40 milespergallon by the year 2000 by requiring cars 
to meet new carbon dioxide standards

agriculture department dairy analysts say milk 
production is headed up again after stalling in 1989 and that 
prices are going to cool down 
one effect will be felt at supermarkets where consumer prices of 
milk and other dairy products will rise again this year but not at 
the hectic pace of 1989 says ralph parlett of the departments 
economic research service 
overall he said retail prices of dairy products could rise by 
as much as 3 percent compared with an average gain of 66 percent 
in 1989 
a few weeks ago parlett figured dairy product prices might go 
increase 1 percent to 2 percent this year but now he said monday 
in an interview the increase could be more volatile ranging from 
zero to 3 percent 
consumer food prices generally are expected to rise 3 percent to 
5 percent in 1990 a forecast announced by usda last fall the 1989 
average was up almost 6 percent the sharpest gain since 1981 
parlett said he is sticking by the 3 percent to 5 percent 
forecast at least for now 
in a report by the usda agency economists say dairy markets 
are adjusting after the record prices and chaotic conditions of 
last autumn 
the report said dairy prices at the farm and wholesale will drop 
in the first half of 1990 because of cutbacks in nonfat dry milk 
exports likely increases in milk production and consumer reaction 
to higher prices 
another factor will be seasonal increases in milk output the 
flush season of spring when production is at a peak by then 
the report said most wholesale prices are likely to be below a 
year earlier 
for all of 1990 the report said milk production will probably 
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last years 1453 billion pounds 
which was down fractionally from 1988 
the analysis said government purchases of butter cheese and 
nonfat dry milk under the federal price support program will be 
sizable in 1990 although the milkequivalent total may not reach 
last years nine billion pounds 
although dairy producers could be encouraged by recent high 
prices and the improvement in the feed situation expanded milk 
output may be slowed by continued caution about new investment 
the report said

critics of an agriculture department plan to 
streamline cattle slaughter inspection systems say the program is 
faulty and put contaminated meat into the consumer market 
in remarks prepared for a hearing today by the national academy 
of sciences former usda official carol tucker foreman 
representing a group of consumer and labor organizations said the 
departments streamlined inspection system or sis is rife 
with problems and should be reconsidered 
foreman was assistant secretary for food and consumer services 
from 1977 to 1981 and supported the modernization of federal meat 
and poultry inspection 
but the sis program which is being tested in some pilot meat 
plants would add to the already serious problems affecting the 
system and will reduce public health and safety protection she 
said 
the streamlining which was announced on nov 30 1988 would 
enable some selected cattle slaughter plants assume some of the 
duties now performed by federal inspectors one effect of the plan 
would be a speedup in the line speed thus boosting productivity 
foreman and others contend the sis plan eliminates current 
safeguards without installing a more effective sciencebased 
program to detect diseased and other contaminated beef carcasses 
instead it would create a system that relies on the good 
faith of corporate records to protect public health she said 
this is highly questionable when these same companies have 
received proposed fines from the occupational safety and health 
administration in the range of 1 million each for falsifying their 
records on occupational safety 
tom devine of the government accountability project a private 
nonprofit organization in support of government and corporate 
whistle blowers said in prepared remarks that the sis which he 
noted has been in operation for poultry since 1983 would 
facilitate unrestricted production line speeds by substituting 
systematic federal inspection with a companys own quality control 
the plans major goal is higher industry profits devine 
said usda predicts cattle slaughter productivity will increase 
40 percent through faster line speeds and fewer condemned 
carcasses 
susan turnerlewis of the academys staff said the hearing was 
the opening round of a major study of the usda plan and that it 
might require most of this year to complete the usda awarded a 
164000 contract to the academy last october for the export study

a report by japans international agricultural 
council says foreigners think japanese food is healthful light and 
esthetically pleasing 
the agency said a survey of 121 foreigners living in japan 
showed japanese food is steadily making inroads into the cuisines 
of other nations 
one possible reason for this is that because of its low fat 
content japanese cuisine is sean as healthy the report said 
foreigners in their 20s and 30s from 18 countries were 
interviewed for the survey 
sushi was rated as the favorite japanese food by the foreigners 
followed by tempura or deepfried fish and vegetables and 
sashimi or thinly sliced raw fish served with soy sauce and

federal agents searched a mans 
warehouse salvage business and home monday in the investigation of 
mail bomb slayings of a judge in birmingham and a civil rights 
lawyer in georgia 
fbi special agent chuck archer of mobile said the owner of the 
property wayne oferrell of nearby new brockton was questioned 
and released 
at no time today was anybody taken into custody said archer 
the fbi agent speaking at a brief evening news conference said 
agents were looking for evidence in the prechristmas package bomb 
killings that put civil rights groups and the federal judiciary on 
alert 
oferrell was involved in a case heard by federal appeals judge 
robert vance who was killed when a package bomb sent through the 
mail exploded at his mountain brook home near birmingham last month 
oferrell had sued his former employer gulf life insurance co 
of jacksonville fla over his firing the appeals decision said 
he disputed gulf lifes claim that he was fired because he held 
licenses with other insurance companies and he charged that gulf 
life had failed to pay him renewal commissions due to him after he 
was fired 
but a federal judge in alabama dismissed his lawsuit on june 17 
1988 and on april 17 vance and two other 11th us circuit court 
of appeals judges upheld the lower court ruling in a onepage 
unsigned decision 
archer said agents probably would spend most of the night 
searching the salvage store but the search was called off about 10 
pm and three police officers sealed off the area 
to the best of my knowledge these are the first searches in 
the investigation he said 
he would not say what brought the investigation to the salvage 
shop of oferrell a man in his 50s described by a neighbor as a 
biblereading former baptist preacher who once sold insurance and 
took up the junk business about three years ago 
package bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed vance at 
his mountain brook home near birmingham on dec 16 and a black 
lawyer robert robinson of savannah on dec 18 other mailed bombs 
were found and defused at the 11th circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta the court vance served and the naacp office in 
jacksonville fla 
the fbi has said one or more white racists appear behind the 
mail bomb attacks 
oferrells suit originally was filed in state court 
the man sued gulf life for benefits he thought he was due 
under his employment contract and he wasnt entitled to any 
benefits its that simple charles d stewart an attorney for 
the insurance company told the new york times 
marvin hanigan vice president of administration for gulf life 
was contacted at his jacksonville fla home late monday and 
refused to comment on whether the fbi had contacted the company or 
whether oferrell had been employed by the firm 
fbi agents with bombsniffing dogs along with police and a bomb 
squad from fort rucker army base searched oferrells old salvage 
business and new warehouse in enterprise along with his new 
brockton home 
tina sommerville who lives across the street from the 
warehouse said the fbi questioned her about oferrell who has a 
wife and two daughters 
they are just average people mrs sommerville said of the 
oferrells thats what makes this so strange 
he was always reading the bible she said 
another neighbor jackie loley who runs a carpet business said 
oferrell has had a varied career including a time as a baptist 
preacher he talked quite a bit about christianity said loley 
john cauley oferrells soninlaw said late monday family 
members had not seen or heard from him since monday morning 
my wife is worried sick she is very upset cauley told 
reporters from the porch of the familys small woodframe house 
cauley said he his wife tammy and oferrells other daughter 
danielle were questioned by fbi agents the agents asked them 
about an old typewriter but did not indicate why they were 
interested in it cauley said 
they asked a lot of questions they didnt give a lot of 
information he said 
cauley lives with his wife at oferrells home cauleys wife 
would not speak to reporters 
law officers kept the warehouse under guard monday night mrs 
sommerville said oferrell earlier accompanied officers to the 
warehouse a onestory shiny tin structure about 100 feet lon and 
50 feet wide in a string of several warehouses the business name 
is spelled out on a flashing portable sign new and old surplus 
salvage store 
mrs sommerville said oferrell moved his junk store business to 
the warehouse from a salvage shop downtown about a year ago 
mrs sommerville said the fbi asked me had i ever noticed any 
strange activity at the warehouse or if i had ever noticed any 
unusual number of cars over there or unusual number of people over 
there or if he had ever shown a violent temper i said no i had 
never seen any of that

most states spend widely different sums to 
educate children in different areas within their borders with 
illinois new jersey new york texas and vermont showing 
especially sharp disparities a congressional study shows 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee released the congressional research study on 
monday to support legislation he planned to introduce today that he 
says would give more children a better chance at a quality 
education 
one bill called the fair chance act would require states 
to spend an equal amount of education dollars for each student in 
all areas of a state or face the loss of federal funds 
the other bill the regulatory impact on student excellence 
act would require the education department to determine if the 
nonteaching burdens on teachers and administrators are caused 
by state or federal regulations 
our search for the twin goals of equity and excellence has 
become stalled as a nation as a people hawkins told reporters 
by comparison we are falling behind other major industrialized 
nations 
but education department officials question the 
constitutionality of the fair chance bill and the need for the 
regulatory measure arguing many states already are looking at 
their own regulatory structures for change 
i think there are grave constitutional questions said lon 
anderson an aide to education secretary lauro cavazos this is 
having the federal government which provides 5 percent to 6 
percent funding to essentially control organizations contributing 
94 percent to 96 percent 
this really is a case of trying to make the tail wag the 
dog he said 
hawkins insisted his bills are needed pointing to the crs study 
that found more than half the states spend double in some of their 
school districts what they do in others about onethird of the 
states spend three times more in some districts as others 
for example the study said that in illinois the germantown 
elementary school district spends 1162 per student while salt 
creek spends 7040 in new jersey laurel springs borough spends 
2081 while demarest borough spends 12556 
the new york unified district of corning city spends 3091 
compared with rotterdamdraper unions 15159 texas unified 
district of jasper independent spends 1207 while sundown 
independent spends 7109 and vermonts unified district of 
hardwick town spends 1664 while essex junction spends 8315 
hawkins added large disparities also exist between states in 
their spending for education 
although the supreme court has held there was no right to 
contest state systems of finance under the constitution hawkins 
said courts in 11 states have ruled as unconstitutional disparate 
system of financing education in violation of state constitutions 
these lawsuits take many years to litigate are very costly 
and are especially burdensome for poorer districts challenging such 
unfair schemes of financing said hawkins therefore federal 
action is necessary to address this inequality 
the fair chance bill would require the education secretary 
to review the way each state finances its school systems to make 
sure state and local funding is fairly distributed states would be 
allowed to submit fiveyear plans to achieve equalization but would 
be barred from receiving any funds from the education department 
after jan 1 1996 if found to be uncertified and without a plan 
the legislation also would create a new federal program to 
provide financial equalization between states to improve their 
public schools 
charles kolb who oversees the education departments budget 
stressed it may be an equity issue its simply not a federal 
issue i would think lawyers need to look at that

the soviets may be prepared to offer 
concessions to end the war in afghanistan when secretary of state 
james a baker iii visits moscow next month say administration 
officials and a us lawmaker 
the key is ending soviet support for the afghan leader 
najibullah and kremlin officials hinted at such a shift during the 
malta summit last month and the october meeting between baker and 
his soviet counterpart in wyoming said a state department source 
the soviets at wyoming and to a certain degree at malta talked 
about a transitional period that to us implies moving away from a 
najib regime to whatever comes next said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the no 3 man in the state department robert m kimmitt 
returned saturday from a trip to pakistan saudi arabia and india 
three nations that have played a role in the conflict he found 
wide support in those countries for such a political solution said 
the source 
the trip by kimmitt who as undersecretary of state for 
political affairs is a key administration player on afghanistan 
did not produce any breakthroughs or shifts in the us position 
said the source 
afghanistan is expected to be high on the agenda when baker 
meets again with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on 
feb 67 in moscow other officials said 
the americans say the key to ending the afghan civil war is 
curbing soviet support for najib as well as free elections in 
afghanistan steps that a congressman just back from moscow says 
the soviets are ready to take 
their position was that their world is on the edge of the 
abyss that this is a powerful irritant in relations with the 
united states said rep charles wilson dtexas who recently 
returned from a week of talks in moscow 
senior soviet officials said they were willing to stop shipping 
weapons to najibullah if the united states would cease arming the 
mujahedeen guerrillas a formula the soviets rejected a year ago 
when they began to withdraw their troops from afghanistan said 
wilson 
wilson met with valentin falin a chief of the international 
department of the soviet communist party and with the chief soviet 
envoy for afghan affairs nikolai i kozrev 
their position was in one hour you stop supplying the 
mujahedeen and we will stop supplying najibullah wilson said 
in two hours a ceasefire would enter effect in a month the 
united nations could organize and supervise elections and let the 
chips fall where they may said wilson who has used his post on 
the house intelligence committee to arrange shipments of advanced 
arms to the mujahedeen 
a state department official said the formula presented to wilson 
might not be acceptable because moscow has been shipping an 
estimated 250 million to 300 million in weapons monthly to the 
najibullah government leaving the regime much better armed than 
the guerrillas 
the level of us aid to the mujahedeen is classified but is 
believed to run at about 600 million per year saudi arabia also

wilson a hardliner on the soviet union and the afghan conflict 
said he left moscow more sympathetic to the kremlin position 
the russians had me there to talk about ways to negotiate an 
end to the war in afghanistan presumably on the theory that if 
they could persuade me they could persuade anybody he said 
the talks always froze on one point and that was whether the 
mujahedeen were going to be compelled to negotiate with najibullah 
my position was that najibullah was covered with blood that he was 
the devil that he was hitler that you couldnt ask people who had 
sacrificed everything including most of their relatives for the 
past 10 years to negotiate with the perpetrator of the crime he 
said

if democratic party leaders outside washington 
had to choose now more would be inclined to nominate sen bill 
bradley of new jersey for president than any other potential 
contender a survey suggests 
promising anonymity and seeking the opinions of hinterland 
leaders those living beyond the outskirts of the nations capital 
washingtonian magazine asked the democratic chairmen in 50 states 
and the district of columbia to name the candidates they would most 
like to see the party nominate in 1992 to run against george bush 
and dan quayle 
fortyfive chairmen responded bradley got the most votes with 
13 
bradley a rhodes scholar who was a princeton university 
basketball star and later played professionally for the new york 
knicks is one northeasterner considered acceptable in more 
conservative regions 
in fact bradley drew most of his support away from home 
the magazine said five votes came from the west and three from 
the south one supporter penciled in the observation that bradley 
best could avoid the taint of the partys lunatic left fringe 
two southern chairmen were among those who liked bradley for the 
vice presidential slot 
sen bob kerrey of nebraska a vietnam war hero was the leading 
choice for the vice presidential nomination with the support of 
eight chairmen 
presidential choices after bradley were new york gov mario 
cuomo with eight votes texas sen lloyd bentsen seven tennessee 
sen albert gore five and sens charles robb of virginia and sam 
nunn of georgia three each 
trailing kerrey for the no 2 spot on the ticket were gore with 
six votes bradley and nunn with four apiece and two each for rep 
bill gray of pennsylvania the no 3 democratic leader in the 
house arkansas gov bill clinton sen bob graham of florida and 
bentsen the vice presidential candidate on michael dukakis 1988 
ticket 
the rev jesse jackson a contender for the democratic 
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 had no votes 
most of the potential candidates dismiss questions with a 
variation of the itstooearly theme 
im focusing on reelection gore said in december 
im not running and im not making any plans to run bentsen

census takers will visit shelters flophouses 
and missions in an effort to gauge the number of people who live on 
the streets in the united states but an advocate for the homeless 
says street people should not cooperate 
you cant count all the people in the streets said mitch 
snyder of the center for creative nonviolence experience 
quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as such is to 
risk harassment and abuse 
snyder charged at a news conference monday that both the reagan 
and bush administrations have sought to minimize the problem of 
homelessness in america saying that because many homeless would be 
missed the census results will lead to less money and less 
attention for the needy 
if we were dealing with an honest government and an honest 
administration we would cooperate snyder said 
to demonstrate his refusal snyder burned census envelopes that 
had been used to send him materials about the effort 
im very sorry they feel this way i really am i hope we can 
work with them and get them to feel differently by the date of the 
census said peter a bounpane assistant census director 
the census bureau will make every effort to count the homeless 
and if people obstruct that everybody loses bounpane said 
federal money is distributed on the basis of population 
the special effort to count the homeless nationwide is scheduled 
for march 20 when census takers will visit shelters for the 
homeless flophouses hospitals missions and count people on the 
streets the regular census will begin april 1 
the bureau is recruiting advocates for the homeless and 
homeless themselves to participate snyder said that by refusing 
to participate he hopes to bring public attention the problems of 
the homeless and make people understand why its impossible to 
count them 
there are no accurate figures available of the number of people 
affected by homelessness 
the national alliance to end homelessness a private research 
and assistance group estimates that as many as 2 million people 
are homeless for at least a portion of the year and that the number 
has been growing 
the partnership for the homeless in new york issued a similar 
estimate after a national survey of 46 cities 
a 1984 study by the department of housing and urban development 
estimated the number of homeless at 250000 to 350000 a harvard 
study put the total at 350000 in 1986 an urban institute report 
in 1988 estimated the total at about 600000 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has estimated the total homeless 
at 3 million 
counting the homeless correctly is impossible because people 
move around and fear government officials snyder said 
the key to survival for homeless people is invisibility if 
you are a homeless woman with children you deny being homeless 
because you dont want to lose the children said david hayden of 
the justice house community a shelter in roanoke va 
hayden said he too would refuse to cooperate 
snyder said that other groups will cooperate with the national 
count and that opinion about participation is divided in the 
national coalition for the homeless

a former state lottery director and his 
mistress are picking up the pieces of their ruined lives following 
a scandal that has led the state to investigate the private affairs 
of candidates for top state jobs 
jack f crawford once a rising star in the state democratic 
party said he was seeking help for psychological problems after 
being forced to resign as director of the hoosier lottery last 
month his former girlfriend who was on the lottery payroll as 
human resources director alleged he sexually harassed her 
i just want to be left alone said the 41yearold crawford 
who has a wife and two sons 
his former girlfriend mary l cartwright 49 was fired from 
her job and has faced the difficulty of explaining the affair to 
her family including a father and brother who are baptist 
ministers and were unaware of it until it broke in the media 
i knew a lot of bad things could happen and i was emotionally 
prepared for some of it not for all this but for some of it 
she said my family couldnt be prepared for it 
meanwhile in the wake of the scandal the state plans to 
include questions about extramarital sexual activity in its 
interviews with candidates for top government jobs according to an 
aide to gov evan bayh 
the intent is not to eliminate from state government persons 
that have had affairs that is not a disqualifier for service in 
state government bayhs press secretary fred nation said 
monday certainly having an affair with a subordinate on the 
state payroll would be a disqualifier 
cartwright had worked for crawford in northern indiana 13 years 
as a secretary and office manager first when he was a hammond city 
judge and later when he was lake county prosecutor their sexual 
relationship began in 1980 cartwright said in her formal complaint 
filed with the governors office by some years later however 
cartwright wished to end it 
after bayh named crawford as lottery director last june 
crawford offered cartwright a 48000 job as human resources 
director although she had no college degree 
in a handwritten contract crawford promised her weekly 125 
payments half of crawfords 10000 bonus for launching the 
lottery ticket sales a full month before the nov 15 deadline and 
a promotion to lottery director should crawford become governor 
cartwright claimed crawford also promised to treat her more 
professionally if she took the job and said in the contract that 
he would not harass intimidate or annoy mary l cartwright 
concerning her social activities 
that promise was his undoing proving that sexual harassment 
existed according to state officials 
you dont promise not to do something you havent done said 
d william moreau bayhs chief of staff 
cartwright told of being forced to endure crawfords advances 
having sex in the lottery offices and being threatened with the 
loss of her job if she failed to comply 
on dec 10 about a week after cartwright lodged her complaint 
crawford was confronted with cartwrights allegations aides to 
gov bayh showed him copies of the handwritten contract between the 
two plus a will he had signed bequeathing cartwright half of his 
estate with the other half to be divided between his wife and two 
sons 
he quietly agreed to resign on the condition he said that 
the documents that detailed his relationship with cartwright would 
not be made public 
for nearly a month the documents were held in confidence 
but two weeks ago cartwright told her side of the story to the 
media adding allegations that indiana state police illegally 
entered her apartment to search for documents and that a state 
government official and a state police officer had plotted to kill 
her 
on jan 10 cartwright was fired for making false and 
outrageous statements to the media 
now both she and crawford are trying to recover from the 
scandal 
crawford said he planned to seek medical attention for some 
serious psychological problems 
he planned to move back to lake county in northwestern indiana 
where his wife and sons have retreated 
cartwright said she plans to move back to her family in hammond 
later this month instead of waiting until her teenage daughter 
gets out of school in june 
its just an unbelievable situation for my family she said 
but they are warm they are caring they are there for me and i 
need them now

the head of a house subcommittee says 
allegations a generic drug company bought bulk supplies of a drug 
from an unauthorized distributor are very disturbing 
the allegations involve quantum pharmics inc of amityville 
ny and its antifungal drug nystatin the company recalled 29 
lots of the product in november because of subpotentcy problems 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee said if the allegations are 
true certain firms and individuals may be engaged in the sale 
and purchase of misbranded and perhaps adulterated raw 
materials 
dingells subcommittee has been investigating the fdas handling 
of generic drugs for more than a year 
carol emerling a spokeswoman for american home products which 
owns quantum said the company was unaware of the allegations until 
informed by the subcommittee last week 
we have no idea whether the allegations are accurate she 
said adding the company will cooperate with any investigation 
jeff nesbit a spokesman for the fda said the agency began 
investigating the allegations after getting a letter earlier this 
month from agvar chemicals inc the only us agent licensed to 
sell nystatin made by chinoin pharmaceuticals of budapest hungary 
in the letter agvar attorney frank sasinowski said quantum 
asked agvar to accept return of the subpotent nystatin apparently 
believing the nystatin had originated with chinoin but agvar said 
it has never sold its chinoin nystatin to quantum 
the letter also said quantum told agvar representatives it had 
bought nystatin it believed to be from chinoin from other 
distributors including one who delivered the nystatin from the 
trunk of his car in exchange for cash 
because nystatin must be kept at under 5 degrees celsius 
improper handling can affect the potency of the product the letter 
said

the united states is considering renewing 
diplomatic links with strategicallylocated south yemen despite the 
middle eastern nations marxist ideology and past support of 
terrorist groups 
the issue will be discussed wednesday when president bush meets 
at the white house with the president of north yemen ali abdullah 
saleh said a senior administration official 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said monday 
that us ambassador thomas pickering met with the representative 
of south yemen at the united nations three or four times last fall 
well weve had the discussions were thinking it over were 
talking were going to be discussing the subject with the 
president of north yemen while hes here the official said 
the united states is also discussing the matter with oman and 
saudi arabia two us allies who have clashed repeatedly with 
neighboring south yemen over its support for insurgents in oman and 
other countries in the volatile region said the official 
pickering also discussed with south yemens representative his 
governments support for terrorism the official said 
south yemen is one of six countries under us economic boycott 
for their support of international terrorism the others are libya 
cuba north korea syria and iran 
north yemen which enjoys good relations with both superpowers 
has had diplomatic ties with the united states since 1946 the 
south which was a british protectorate until it gained 
independence in 1967 broke off ties with the united states after 
aligning itself with moscow and adopting a marxist ideology the 
country at the tip of the red sea became a major facility for 
soviet naval units in the indian ocean 
the talks with the united states were prompted by moves toward 
reform in south yemen following upheaval in the governments of 
other soviet allies the reforms have also lent impetus to a 
decadeold effort to unify north and south with the two countries 
agreeing this week to prepare a joint constitution for a referendum 
by nov 30 
but us officials believe the unification process will take 
time and say this does not influence considerations about possible 
diplomatic ties with south yemen 
an eventual union between the two countries would not do any 
damage to us interests the official said

an expensive rug that nancy reagan helped 
design and left behind in the oval office as an attractive 
asset is now relegated to a government storeroom supposedly 
because president bush doesnt like it 
it was not terribly attractive the president bush did not 
like it said larry hokanson president of a houston company that 
made a 28550 rug as a replacement 
the new rug was installed on friday as part of a 62470 
refurbishing of the oval office which also included new draperies 
a chinesestyle mahogany coffee table reupholstered highback 
armchairs and a pair of new threecushion sofas 
the reagan rug two years in the design and making had been 
purchased at a cost of 49625 by an anonymous donor at mrs 
reagans request the first lady had worked with the white house 
curator and white house historical association to design the rug 
and get a donor 
the rug decorated with 40 customdyed colors with a predominant 
theme of peach or coral was installed in june 1988 while the 
reagans were in moscow it replaced a 12yearold rug 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater the press 
secretary for both reagan and bush had said 18 months ago that the 
reagans wanted to leave an asset to the white house and they felt 
this would be an attractive asset 
on monday fitzwater said that bush is pleased with his new 
decorations i think they are beautiful 
most presidents put their own imprimatur on their office 
said alixe glen white house deputy press secretary 
mark weinberg a spokesman for the reagans declined comment 
about the replacement 
the new rug made with the assistance of new york interior 
decorator mark hampton measures 30 feet 10 inches long by 23 
feet 5 inches wide like the old one the new rug is oval 
normally the designing process takes a couple months and the 
normal manufacturing time is about 16 to 18 weeks but because of 
the prestige of this we cut all that back to two weeks on 
designing and 2 months on production hokanson said 
he said every stitch of the allwool rug was done with a 
handguided electricpowered needle and that 20 to 30 people were 
involved in the production and design 
the new rug has a grayblue field that centers the coatofarms 
from the presidential seal delineated in shades of gold on an 
ivory ground there is a border of gold rods tied with blue 
ribbons also on an ivory ground 
the white house statement said the borders design was derived 
from the fasces a classical roman symbol of the governing 
authority which appears as the carved moldings above the oval 
office doorways

energy secretary james d watkins moving to 
restore public confidence in nuclear weapons plants plans to put 
federal workers in place of some private contractors who perform 
environmental investigations of the facilities 
watkins in an internal memorandum made available to the 
associated press on monday wrote that although he was pleased with 
weapons plants investigations completed last fall he wanted more 
federal employees doing the audits from now on 
these assessments form the cornerstone of my overall plan to 
create a new culture of selfassessment and accountability within 
the department and are essential to bringing all of the 
departments facilities into full compliance with regulations 
watkins wrote in the memo to senior aides dated dec 22 
watkins started the audits which he terms independent tiger 
team evaluations last june to gain a fresh view of 
environmental safety and health problems at the plants eight 
weapons plants were audited last year five others will be examined 
this month and seven more will be done later this year 
in his memo watkins asked field offices across the country to 
submit federal candidates for slots on coming tiger team 
audits he did not say how many contractor positions the federal 
workers would replace 
peter brush acting assistant secretary for environment safety 
and health said in an interview monday that watkins wants to use 
more federal workers and fewer contractors partly out of concern 
about possible conflicts of interest among the contractors 
we would like less of a perception of contractors 
overseeing contractors brush said one contractor overseeing 
another contractor of necessity is going to have in the publics 
mind somewhat less credibility 
all 17 major nuclear weapons plants and laboratories are owned 
by the energy department but run by private contractors 
brush was responding to an associated press report that at least 
two contractors used on investigations last fall are on the payroll 
at the facilities they investigated 
the ap also reported others participating in the audits were 
bidding at that time on energy department contracts for related 
work at sites they investigated 
brush said watkins had no alternative to relying heavily on 
contractors for this work 
there is a real shortage of the kind of senior qualified 
environment and safety people we need to do this job right and we 
dont have them on the federal payroll brush said adding 
watkins would ask for more money to hire such experts 
the tiger teams are supervised by federal employees but 
most of the technical work is done by contractors 
department records show one contractor nus corp a consulting 
firm based at gaithersburg md took part in evaluating the oak 
ridge nuclear weapons complex in tennessee last fall at the time 
nus was being paid by the department to help plan a nuclear waste 
management strategy for oak ridge 
brush said he was not familiar with the nus oak ridge contract 
but department spokeswoman catherine kaliniak said later the 
department determined that nus oak ridge work would not bias its 
judgment in the tiger team work 
she said it was determined that a conflict did not exist 
written department guidelines for carrying out the tiger 
team evaluations include a provision aimed at avoiding 
organizational conflicts of interest it defines such a conflict as 
a situation in which a contractor has past present or currently 
planned interests that either directly or indirectly may relate 
to the work to be performed and which may bias its judgment 
another contractor icf kaiser engineers of oakland calif 
which was on a tiger team that evaluated the fernald uranium 
processing plant in ohio last fall also was bidding then for an 
11year contract to design an environmental cleanup plan for 
fernald according to oak ridge and icf kaiser officials 
brush said he was not familiar with this case

housing secretary jack kemp is cracking down 
on federally funded housing authorities in new jersey suspending 
top housing officials in passaic because they accepted grossly 
excessive salaries 
kemp is also serving notice to housing authorities nationwide 
that he will not tolerate the misuse of public housing funds in 
the paying of salaries or in other areas 
the actions of these individuals are a clear violation of the 
public trust and a betrayal of the lowincome families in passaic 
who need housing assistance kemp said in a statement monday 
the department of housing and urban development also set up a 
new jersey strike force to examine the financial management of 
local housing authorities throughout the state 
hud directed the remaining members of the passaic authority to 
prepare to sue for the recovery of excessive compensation paid out 
over several years 
the tough steps are part of kemps attempt to demonstrate he is 
serious in his vows to end to the financial scandals that have 
plagued the department 
huds inspector generals office said in a report that 
investigators found 168 million in ineligible and unsupported 
costs at the passaic housing authority which administers 891 
rented or leased low income units 
the authority is under the control of a local board of 
commissioners but receives millions of dollars in federal 
lowincome housing subsidies from hud each year 
the report said paul marguglio the executive director of the 
passaic authority was paid 245956 in 1988 more than double 
kemps salary as housing secretary the deputy director donald v 
pieri was paid 106868 in 1988 the authoritys attorney august 
michaelis was paid 486327 over three years 
all three were suspended monday morning along with peter 
marrocco chairman of the board of commissioners and william p 
scruggs the boards vice chairman 
the hud inspector general also found alleged abuse of 
governmentfunded travel abuse of credit cards abuse of vacation 
policy and failure to follow federal property management standards 
the report said the authorized salary for marguglio was 84185 
and pieri was authorized a 57970 annual salary 
but the passaic housing authority allowed employees to be 
compensated for multiple job titles gave salary increases paid 
bonuses paid compensatory time paid into the executive directors 
retirement annuity and authorized travel allowances the hud 
inspector general considered compensation 
this occurred because the board of commissioners approved 
resolutions authorizing these payments the inspector generals 
report said by approving the resolutions and allowing 
compensation to exceed the hud approved budget the board did not 
exercise proper oversight 
joseph schiff acting assistant secretary for public housing 
said a bulletin is being sent to housing authorities throughout the 
country serving notice that hud has a clear policy of one person 
one job one salary no matter how many titles a job may carry 
in a formal response signed by marguglio the passaic housing 
authority declared it did nothing wrong and asserted that because 
hud had never objected to the resolutions increasing compensation 
for the officials acceptance of the resolutions by hud 
constituted official and unofficial approval 
our primary mission of providing adequate lowcost housing has 
been performed admirably marguglio declared 
the continuation of this high level of performance should not 
be impaired by findings and recommendations which however well 
intentioned may be inappropriate or improper he said

president bush seeking to avoid the wrangling 
with conservatives that last year cost him a nomination to the 
legal services corp is using a procedural move to fill all 11 
seats on the embattled organizations board 
the white house announced late monday that bush gave nine more 
individuals socalled recess appointments to the board that 
oversees the independent agencys legal aid to the nations poor 
they join two similar appointments he made in december 
under the constitution people appointed by the president while 
the house and senate are in a prolonged recess as they have been 
can serve without senate confirmation until the end of the next 
session of the senate in this case the end of this year 
bush made the appointments at the last possible minute congress 
returns today from a twomonth winter recess 
the move was immediately derided by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
president bush has had a year to choose these nominees 
kennedy said in a statement late monday he should have waited 
another 18 hours and sent them to the senate for confirmation as 
the constitution provides i hope that the senate will make its 
opposition clear to any of these appointees who are not committed 
in good faith to providing legal services to the poor 
a white house spokeswoman alixe glen said bush took the step 
to avoid protracted confirmation battles in the senate over the 
board members as has happened several times in the past last 
year conservatives forced the president to withdraw a nominee they 
deemed as too moderate 
five of the appointments made monday will serve only through 
july 13 thus they can serve out the terms without requiring any 
senate action 
they are howard h dana jr a portland maine attorney luis 
guinot jr of puerto rico currently a washington attorney penny 
l pullen house republican leader in the illinois legislature 
xavier l suarz the mayor of miami and george w wittgraf an 
attorney in cherokee iowa 
four other appointments were made to terms expiring july 13 
1992 they will be subject to senate confirmation if bush resubmits 
their names once their recess appointments expire 
they are john f collins of massachusetts listed only as 
self employed jo bets love of mississippi no occupation 
listed former rep guy molinari rny the staten island ny 
borough chairman and jeannie e wolbeck of minnesota no 
occupation listed 
last month bush gave recess appointments to former rep john 
erlenborn rill and texas attorney j blakely hall to the board 
conservatives have targeted the agency for abolishment since 
1981 
more recently conservatives have sought to limit legal services 
particularly classaction lawsuits against the government over 
welfare and other social programs 
in 1989 conservatives successfully lobbied the white house to 
stop the appointment of former republican rep caldwell butler of 
virginia to the board butler had angered conservatives by saying 
he opposed restrictions on the activities of legal aid attorneys

possession charge flew to florida for treatment monday while

city hall campaign by jesse jackson 
barrys spokeswoman lurma rackley said the mayor had checked

alcoholism she had said the day before that details about his

hanleyhazelden treatment center in florida 
the mayor was arrested thursday night and charged with 
possession of crack cocaine he said on sunday he would take steps 
to heal my body mind and soul barry who did not specifically 
refer to a drug or alcohol problem in his sunday remarks left his 
home at dawn monday accompanied by his wife effi 
later mrs barry and one of the mayors bodyguards returned to 
washington 
the 60bed florida clinic is an affiliate of a minnesota clinic 
that has treated more than 70000 people since 1949 including 
washington redskins football star dexter manley and kitty dukakis 
wife of gov michael dukakis of massachusetts its techniques were 
adopted by the betterknown betty ford clinic in rancho mirage 
calif 
barrys plans to announce his candidacy sunday for a fourth term 
as mayor of the nations capital were abruptly canceled after his 
arrest on the misdemeanor cocaine charge 
meanwhile at the white house monday naacp executive director 
benjamin l hooks met with president bush and then told reporters 
he was concerned about selective enforcement of the law 
hooks said newspaper accounts of barrys arrest in an fbi sting 
operation made it sound like the search had finally paid off we 
spent all of these years trying to find him with a grain of 
cocaine and by god we did it didnt we 
we havent found all the people whove stolen all the money 
from the savings and loan associations and are driving rolls royces 
and jaguars so obviously many of us in the black community will 
have some peculiar feelings as we go further said hooks 
as barry mulled his future over the weekend some of his closest 
political advisers and former assistants were meeting at the home 
of excity administrator elijah rogers to organize plans to get 
jackson in the mayors race 
jacksons move to washington last april fueled rumors that he 
would make a bid for the mayors chair but the twotime 
presidential candidate has repeatedly said he would never run 
against barry a friend and former civil rights colleague 
early surveys of public sentiment in the mayors race gave 
jackson a wide lead over all other potential contenders including 
barry 
ron richardson president of the local chapter of the hotel and 
restaurant workers aflcio said he has had discussions with a 
variety of community activists and organizers about mounting a 
draftjackson campaign 
we are going to plead with him to submerge his personal 
interests and help heal this city which is what we need right 
now richardson said my indications are that people that ive 
been talking to labor leaders ministers others are 
overwhelmingly in favor of trying to get jackson in the race 
at saturdays strategy session were rogers former deputy mayors 
ivanhoe donaldson and alphonse hill former city official courtland 
cox and several others said a source familiar with the meeting 
donaldson and hill have served jail time for felony convictions 
in connection with their city government jobs donaldson once 
barrys top assistant in the government has known the mayor since 
their days in the civil rights movement and is widely credited with 
shaping barrys rise to power 
donaldson spent part of the weekend telephoning other barry 
supporters to ask them to get behind a jackson candidacy said one 
barry aide who received such a call 
eric easter jacksons press secretary said the former 
democratic presidential hopeful has been sick in bed since 
returning to the nations capital on saturday and has met with no 
one regarding a mayoral draft campaign 
meanwhile city administrator carol b thompson who is running 
the government in the mayors absence said at a press conference 
monday that while barry is still mayor of this city she will 
not hesitate to make tough decisions associated with the job 
thompson is prohibited from signing legislation or authorizing 
most city contracts or spending packages she said that she will be 
in daily telephone contact with barry and that the mayor will 
regularly be sent documents and legislation requiring his signature 
weve acted in the mayors absence before weve managed the 
government in the past and were up to that today thompson 
said there will be continued stability and continuity and there 
will be progress 
thompson also was meeting with congressional leaders congress 
has substantial control over policy in the federal district

gov bob martinez has proposed 
investing 32 billion during the next decade to save threatened 
beaches mangrove islands everglades patches and other wilderness 
areas from rampant development 
an environmentalist said the plan would change the face of 
florida 
its time we move forward to safeguard our heritage before 
these special lands are developed or priced beyond grasp 
martinez said monday 
we can greatly increase our landacquisition capabilities or 
we can continue to fall further behind every year 
without the plan only 650 million would be available for land 
acquisition during the next decade martinez said 
he said it was too early to project how much land the 32 
billion might buy 
the plan must be approved by the legislature where the 
republican governor said it has bipartisan support it is being 
sponsored by democratic sen george kirkpatrick and republican rep 
tom drage 
charles lee of the florida audubon society called the plan the 
single most significant proposal yet made to reach to the problems 
that are destroying the environment 
after the next decade when much of florida is paved over in 
subdivisions parking lots and shopping centers there will be less 
and less opportunity to have an initiative such as this lee said 
examples of land environmentalists want saved are the sandy 
beaches and forested tracts in the florida panhandle freshwater 
springs in northern florida river wetlands in central florida and 
mangrove islands in southern florida 
the everglades a subtropical marsh covering much of southern 
florida also is a focus of ecological concern it is bordered by 
an area of unprecedented development in recent decades with the 
coast from miami to west palm beach now estimated to have a 
population of 4 million 
last month president bush signed into law a measure expanding 
everglades national park by 110000 acres bringing it to more than 
15 million acres but about sixsevenths of the everglades 
remains unprotected 
the proposal arose out of recommendations from the 29member 
commission on the future of floridas environment chaired by 
nathaniel reed an environmentalist and former assistant us 
secretary of the interior 
this i think is going to change the face of florida more 
than any single thing that i can think of reed said i think 
theres an enormous amount of broad public support for this 
initiative 
the proposal calls for selling 300 million in bonds each year 
starting with the 199192 budget using expected growth in a tax on 
realestate transfers to repay the debt that growth is expected to 
reach 30 million per year 
no new or increased taxes would be imposed martinez said and 
the bulk of the money would go for land that either would be left 
in its natural state or used for recreation 
the bonds would be paid back over 30 years but martinez said 
the debt was worth it 
this property is for the future land is forever martinez 
said

president bush assured 75000 abortion opponents marching in the 
nations capital he was their ally and demonstrators on both sides 
held rallies around the country on the 17th anniversary of roe vs 
wade 
in a telephone hookup to demonstrators across from the white 
house bush spoke monday of the selfevident moral superiority of 
adoption over abortion and said he opposed the 1973 supreme 
court ruling that legalized abortion 
let me assure that this president stands with you on this 
issue of life he said 
in sacramento calif a state senator prohibited by her bishop 
from receiving communion for her stand in favor of abortion rights 
told a flagwaving rally of 1000 not to be discouraged by the 
presidents stand 
well get our message all the way to the white house where 
barbara bush sits in quiet support said california sen lucy 
killea mr president please read your wifes lips 
mrs bush has refused to answer interviewers questions about 
her views on the abortion issue but a report in this weeks 
newsweek magazine said she disagreed with her husband 
this years commemoration of roe vs wade carried special 
meaning because of a supreme court ruling last summer in a missouri 
case that gave states greater latitude to impose restrictions on 
abortion 
the decision in webster vs reproductive health services upheld 
missouris law banning abortions in public hospitals and stopped 
government employees from counseling women about abortions it also 
required doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus over 
20 weeks old to determine if it could live outside the womb 
it also led to speculation the high court would overturn roe vs 
wade 
in rallies monday from spokane wash to boston foes and 
supporters of abortion rights threatened political retribution 
against politicians who disagree with them 
it will be a cutting edge issue in this years elections 
sen robert packwood rore told abortionrights supporters in 
washington 
sarah weddington the texas lawyer who argued for overturning 
abortion laws in the roe case told a breakfast in dallas we are 
here to say we won 17 years ago today and we will win again 
in atlanta the rev pat robertson the evangelical broadcaster 
who sought the 1988 republican presidential nomination shared the 
podium with roman catholic archbishop eugene marino at a rally 
attended by 10000 people to urge new state restrictions 
this nation is on trial for its soul and men and women and 
children who believe in life had better be concerned and had better 
let their voices be heard marino said 
but rep charles thomas the chairman of the georgia house 
judiciary committee said the prevailing sentiment of most 
legislators is that they do not want to handle the topic during 
this electionyear session 
in nebraska the legislature chose mondays anniversary to begin 
its debate on a bill that would require minors seeking abortion to 
notify their parents lawmakers adjourned for the day without 
voting 
in dallas texans united for life urged abortion foes to send 
thousands of baby rattles to lawmakers to rattle the conscience 
of texas 
in charlotte nc a planned parenthood chapter set up three 
mobile telephones for abortion rights advocates to pay 3 to call 
gov jim martin and bush 
new york gov mario cuomo at a conference of family planning 
advocates in albany said both sides could find common ground in 
promoting sexual abstinence among teenagers 
at the very least young men and women should hear from us it 
seems to me that they are not abnormal because they choose to 
abstain until another and better time cuomo said i think 
frankly that it is a mistake that history has left the alternative 
of restraint behind as a sociological anachronism

thousands of toys gathered as christmas gifts for 
panamanian children are wrapped up instead in government red tape 
but the frustrated organizer of the gift drive is determined to cut 
through it 
in her quest to deliver the toys patricia gehri has even asked 
the military to fly the toys to panama under a law which permits 
airlifting for humanitarian efforts 
they dont take it seriously because its toys and not food or 
medicine she said but a teddy bear is medicine to me 
gehri 45 has amassed almost 8000 teddy bears games dolls 
tea sets and toy trucks to distribute to panamanian children who 
spent christmas in the middle of a military invasion 
we have enough toys for the kids in refugee camps hospitals 
and orphanages said gehri who collected about half the items 
from the public and the other half through the us marine corps 
toys for tots program the toys are just waiting for 
transportation 
military rules prevent certain planes from landing in panama 
where the military has remained since the dec 20 invasion to oust 
former panamanian dictator manuel noriega gehri said 
capt katie haddock deputy director of joint public affairs for 
the marines said interservice negotiations have held up the 
toy delivery because the marines are not the branch of service in 
charge of the military presence in panama 
gehri a former flight attendant who lives in orlando was 
disabled in september 1988 by a severe head injury after 
recovering her speech and other lost functions her therapist 
suggested she take on a project so i could feel good about 
myself she said 
the only gift i want is one picture of one child holding one 
of these teddy bears with a big smile she said if something 
doesnt happen soon well have to start collecting easter 
bunnies 
the marines have stored some 6000 toys in tampa miami and in 
orlando there are also 1500 waiting in atlanta she said 
on monday a marine truck pulled up to gehris house and dumped 
1500 teddy bears in her garage because they had no more room for 
the stuffed animals at marine headquarters 
we are working now to coordinate efforts to get the toys to 
panama said maj john flanagan of the miami marine corp reserve 
where about 2000 toys are stored 
gehri has enlisted the help of us sen connie mack rfla to 
speed the process up because the government is just rumbling 
along she said 
brian riley spokesman for macks washington office said the 
senator is trying to do everything he can on the federal and 
military level

roman vishniac a biologist and photographer 
renowned for his recording of jewish life in eastern europe on the 
eve of the holocaust has died at age 92 
he used to say he took hitler seriously and therefore he took 
the pictures said a relative jesse cherry everything he 
photographed was subsequently destroyed 
vishniac died monday of colon cancer at his manhattan apartment 
he was born in russia and studied zoology and biology in moscow 
in 1918 he immigrated to latvia and soon thereafter traveled to 
berlin as a medical science photographer 
vishniac soon turned his camera on his surroundings and the nazi 
demonstrations he saw because any jew with a camera was suspect 
he often posed as a nazi to take the pictures 
just before world war ii he fled to france and came with his 
family to the united states in 1940 
in 1971 the international fund for concerned photography 
mounted an exhibition of vishniacs photographs that included his 
scientific work such as polarized light shots of microscopic 
creatures 
in an introduction to the exhibition the photographer edward 
steichen wrote roman vishniac came back from his trips to 
eastern europe in the 1930s with a collection of photographs that 
has become an important historical document for it gives a 
lastminute look at the human beings he photographed just before 
the fury of nazi brutality exterminated them the resulting 
photographs are among photographys finest documents of a time and 
place 
vishniacs works are included in the permanent collections of 
the museum of modern art in new york the smithsonian institute and 
library of congress in washington and the jewish museum in new york 
his works also were published in books including a vanished 
world which he authored in 1983

a judge has barred the press and public from 
juvenile court proceedings stemming from an investigation into a 
reported rape at the south dakota governors mansion 
circuit judge marshall young decided monday to close next weeks 
hearings after news organizations covering the case said they could 
not guarantee the names of the three juveniles who have been 
charged would not be published 
i cant let the media in and then have them turn around and 
violate the law by publishing names young said apparently 
theres no middle ground 
officials have said they cannot disclose the names of the 
juveniles or the the charges against them because state law makes 
juvenile matters confidential 
but lawyers for news organizations said a state law barring the 
media from publishing the names addresses and other identifying 
information about juveniles is unconstitutional prior restraint 
that has been prohibited by the us supreme court 
i would imagine somebody is going to appeal this case said 
lawyer jon arneson representing the argus leader and ksfytv both 
of sioux falls others involved are the rapid city journal 
aberdeen american news and the associated press 
on nov 30 police received a report that four boys had raped a 
girl at the mansion on the evening of nov 28 
gov george mickelson and his wife linda were out of town nov 
28 their 17yearoldson david is the only other permanent 
resident of the mansion his whereabouts that evening have not been 
disclosed 
lawyers for the juveniles said court hearings should be closed 
because the matter has received undue news coverage 
an 18yearold also was charged in connection with the case 
high school student david ebach was fined 65 last week after 
pleading guilty to underage consumption of alcohol on nov 28 at 
the governors mansion

the justice department has decided not to 
prosecute felix bloch the american diplomat suspected of spying 
for the soviet union according to a broadcast report 
the department declined to confirm the report monday night by 
abc news 
bloch was the subject of intense fbi surveillance last year 
after it was learned he had been videotaped passing a suitcase to a 
soviet agent in paris 
bloch had been the no 2 official of the us embassy in vienna 
for much of the reagan administration before taking up an 
assignment in washington 
though he was placed on administrative leave in june he 
continued to draw his 80000 annual salary 
the visible agents were withdrawn in december and there were 
reports at the time that the department had all but given up hope 
of prosecuting bloch on an espionage charge 
what has not been reported is what if any secrets bloch is 
supposed to have given to the soviet union the necessary 
ingredient for an espionage prosecution 
bloch is said to have been wiretapped telling his wife that he 
accepted payments from the soviets but such a wiretap might not be 
admissible in an american court analysts have noted 
david runkel spokesman for the justice department said monday 
night he understood that the investigation of bloch was still 
continuing he also said it is my understanding that no 
decision had been made one way or another on whether to prosecute 
bloch

time bombs believed set by leftist radicals 
exploded almost simultaneously on eight trains in the tokyo area 
early today but no injuries were reported police said 
a metropolitan police official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the explosions all small damaged seats on the 
trains 
he declined to discuss further details but kyodo news service 
reported that japans bestknown radical group the chukakuha 
middle core faction claimed responsibility for the explosions 
kyodo said that in a statement sent to news media the group 
declared unlimited war against plans for the formal coronation 
of emperor akihito in november and for expansion of tokyos 
international airport 
the statement called todays bombings retaliation against the 
reckless act of closing one of the huts used as a base by 
protesters opposing plans to expand the airport by expropriating 
nearby farmland police closed the hut one week ago 
japan railway officials said bombings on seven of their trains 
affected at least 21000 people as the company canceled 16 trains 
as a precaution all other trains were delayed by up to 44 minutes 
the officials said 
in chiba prefecture east of tokyo a small explosion occurred 
on a train on the keisei electric railway line a keisei official 
said 
on jan 8 a projectile landed on the home of the emperors 
younger brother prince hitachi causing minor damage and two days 
later the chukakuha radical group claimed responsibility for the 
attack 
the radicals oppose japans monarchy while public opinion polls 
show a large majority of japanese supporting it there is greater 
controversy however over government plans to spend 56 million on 
akihitos formal coronation 
akihito actually became emperor on the death of his father 
emperor hirohito on jan 7 1989

striking musicians have agreed to a new 
contract that virtually eliminates live music in three major 
production shows and limits local musicians work in celebrity 
shows 
the agreement if ratified by union members would end a 
7month strike that disrupted the appearances of bigname 
entertainers along the citys glittering strip while the two sides 
were polarized over issues of taped music and guaranteed work 
the pact allows the resorts to replace 46 live musicians with 
taped music in production rooms and eliminates guarantees of work 
in celebrity showrooms where local musicians are increasingly being 
squeezed out by the use of selfcontained bands by many 
entertainers 
weve suffered the hotels have suffered and the town has 
suffered musicians local 369 president mark tully massagli said 
theres nothing i know of that would make an eightmonth strike 
worthwhile 
musicians were expected to approve the pact in a ratification 
vote on wednesday with some back to work as early as this weekend 
hotel officials who won most of their key initial demands were 
conciliatory in a joint wednesday night press conference where the 
new contract was announced 
these were not just ordinary costofliving negotiations 
said john giovenco president of hilton nevada corp we were 
dealing with dignified artists being overwhelmed by technological 
changes 
the fouryear contract calls for the 46 musicians who lost their 
jobs in production shows at ballys the tropicana and flamingo 
hilton to get severance pay of 28000 
it also provides for a 5 percent annual wage increase in the 
654 weekly scale paid musicians in addition to health insurance 
and pension plan boosts 
the resorts agreed to hire three musicians and a band leader on 
a fulltime basis but are obligated to hire other orchestra 
members only on an asneeded basis 
hotel negotiator larry levien said the hotels still favor 
employing local musicians 
we do not and cannot control the acts themselves he said 
all that we bargained for was our ability to be flexible when we 
cant control what the entertainer places upon us 
many entertainers refused to cross picket lines when the strike 
began but some began to trickle back as the strike wore on 
wayne newton who canceled his first 250000aweek engagement 
at the las vegas hilton returned to the stage after unsuccessfully 
trying to negotiate an end to the dispute 
others most prominently frank sinatra flatly refused to cross 
the lines

interior minister istvan horvath 
resigned today less than a week after a secret police major accused 
the former communists who are still running the country of spying 
on their political opponents 
the danubegate scandal and its political fallout are 
jeopardizing the survival of the ruling socialist party which was 
formed last year from the ashes of the dissolved communist party 
the partys leaders who have promised to turn hungary into a 
parliamentary democracy with free multiparty elections set for 
march 25 still control the government and with it the national 
security apparatus 
horvath told parliament in a speech broadcast live on hungarian 
television that dismantling of the old structure is very 
complicated 
he said that while his ministry was busy reforming the police 
force and the border guards reforming the state security 
apparatus was left for last 
if i am guilty horvath said i am so of not having been 
consistent enough in seeing that the changes are implemented 
horvath served as interior minister since 1980 with only one 
interruption in 1987 
the head of the state security services internal department 
jozsef horvath and ferenc pallagi the deputy interior minister 
and state security chief both resigned recently 
but opposition groups were not satisfied and also called for the 
interior ministers resignation 
on friday maj jozsef vegvari an officer in the state security 
service revealed that he told members of the political opposition 
that his agency had been spying on them on orders of the ruling 
socialists 
the divided opposition groups contend the information obtained 
by the spying could give the socialists a decisive advantage in the 
elections 
the chief prosecutors office has ordered an inquiry into 
political espionage 
the government disbanded part of the security service on sunday 
it has also sealed all state security documents vegvari had 
charged that documents had been sent to the shredder 
draft legislation is expected next month in parliament to 
curtail security service operations

vera english lost her job car and home 
after complaining about safety violations at a nuclear fuel plant 
but the 64yearold woman said she would do it again 
i feel what is good for our community for the people for our 
country should come first mrs english said i was in a 
responsible position and i took it very seriously 
on monday mrs english got a break when the us supreme court 
agreed to review her case and decide whether nuclear industry 
whistleblowers who say they were disciplined for complaining 
about lax safety may sue under state personal injury laws 
spokesmen for general electric mrs englishs former employer 
did not immediately return phone calls 
mrs english worked for almost 12 years as a laboratory 
technician for ge at its nuclear fuels manufacturing plant in 
wilmington in southern north carolina where she pointed out 
violations to management officials and to the federal nuclear 
regulatory commission 
receiving no response she deliberately failed to clean up 
radiation contamination at her work station to prove the 
contamination was not being detected by safety inspectors 
although her efforts led to corrective action she was 
disciplined and eventually fired in july 1984 
ms english sued ge in 1987 under north carolina law seeking 
reinstatement with back pay and damages for wrongful discharge and 
infliction of emotional distress 
but a federal judge and an appeals court ruled that she could 
file only under the federal energy reorganization act which does 
not provide punitive damages awards 
another appeals court has ruled in a separate case that such 
state lawsuits can proceed the supreme court decision to be 
announced by july should clarify the issue 
it will carry a significant practical effect since damages 
often are the most lucrative part of a successful suit under the 
corresponding state laws 
a medical technologist mrs english was earning between 30000 
and 35000 a year at the time of her firing she said she has been 
unable to find comparable work because ge publicized her failure to 
clean up the contamination 
it destroyed my credibility my integrity she said 
a widow with two grown children mrs english has held numerous 
lowpaying jobs and is now living in someone elses home caring 
for foster children in exchange for room and board 
i had to sell my home to finance my losses she said i 
knew the company had more power money money more witnesses i had 
to penny pinch

police chief donald grady ii dresses 
sharply in tailored suits in a farming town where blue jeans and 
boots fit the fashion scene he drives a porsche on streets where 
pickups frequently cruise 
the 6foot5 chief is a staunch lawandorder advocate who 
angered residents when he had officers write 285 tickets to 
property owners who failed to clear sidewalks of ice after a storm 
he even gave himself a ticket 
the 36yearold grady became wisconsins first black police 
chief last year breaking the color barrier in a white 
middleclass town of 3500 in northwest wisconsin 
now some of those residents arent happy and although they 
claim it has nothing to do with race they are miffed at gradys 
attitude as car repair show owner tom kludt said 
folks are used to a more lowkey police department in this town 
95 miles east of st paul minn 
the city council recently disbanded the police commission that 
hired grady though his critics deny any movement is afoot to get 
rid of him 
interviewed in his office grady said there is no question 
about it there are a few people in this community who would like 
to see me disappear if they are looking for someone to play 
the good ol boy network thats not me he said i have chosen 
to do good law enforcement and i am making people unhappy 
grady who was a sergeant at the rock county sheriffs 
department before moving to the eightperson force in bloomer 
refuses to brand his critics as racists although he believes race 
is an issue 
unfortunately you are going to get some ridicule he is just 
an uppity nigger and just wants to control everything i might be 
an uppity nigger but i dont want to control everything just the 
police department he said 
mayor art stuck said grady the towns fourth police chief in 10 
years has done a good job but residents arent accustomed to his 
style 
there is no doubt he is enforcing the law the way the book 
reads the mayor said i think if his own wife made a mistake 
she would get a ticket like anybody else that is the way it should 
be 
grady who has a masters degree in management and is working 
toward a doctorate hasnt been afraid to pursue criminal offenses 
even ones long accepted as general town practices for instance 
he ordered a gambling raid up to that point gambling at some 
businesses was just looked at as augmenting ones salary grady 
said well the law says you cant gamble 
he exposed an illegal beer cooler in the fire department 
fireman could go in and pop a quarter or 40 cents i forget what 
it was into the soda machine and instead of getting a soda he 
would get a millers grady said you cant dispense alcohol 
without a license they didnt have one 
he cracked down on speeders the number of traffic tickets 
issued since he took over has tripled while the number of 
accidents has dropped 43 percent he said that means my wife is 
43 percent safer when she goes to the grocery store 
the citations in november for slippery sidewalks are already 
legend though none was prosecuted 
the first citation was issued to me the next group of 
citations 13 were issued to the mayor the chief recalled 
shaking his head at the furor that erupted 
one businessman stormed into the department holding his ticket 
he said what the hell is this i showed him my citation

a prominent panamanian jeweler accused of 
conspiring wth manuel noriega to smuggle 14 million pounds of 
marijuana and launder the profits will remain in federal custody 
until his trial in april 
a federal magistrate refused bond monday for enrique a pretelt 
who is charged with plotting with noriega to smuggle colombian 
marijuana into the united states during 198384 
the defendant has no ties to the united states hes a pilot 
which is always a concern and he has apparently substantial 
wealth us magistrate thomas g wilson said at the end of a 
40minute bond hearing all of those factors point to detention 
pretelt pleaded innocent in federal court thursday to charges 
carrying a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison and fines 
totaling 265000 
he voluntarily surrendered last wednesday in panama to face 
allegations in a threecount indictment returned feb 4 1988 
fbi agent stan jacobsen told the court pretelt was a fugitive 
for nearly two years helped launder drug money through panamanian 
banks helped disguise a 400000pound load of colombian marijuana 
that was to be shipped through panama and pocketed several thousand 
dollars in drug profits 
defense attorney george tragos said the 47yearold panamanian 
had enough money to afford an apartment and security guards and 
would even agree to be monitored electronically if allowed to 
remain free until trial 
pretelt is accused of taking bribes from tampabased smugglers 
to help ferry millions of dollars worth of the illicit drug safely 
through panama 
while federal officials hope pretelt will cooperate and 
strengthen the case against noriega tragos said his client will go 
to trial and fight the charges 
meanwhile in another federal courtroom in tampa jury selection 
continued in a 32 million money laundering case with links to 
noriega a 12member panel was picked monday now opposing 
attorneys must decide on six alternates 
five former officials with the bank of credit and commerce 
international are on trial including amjad awan who once claimed 
to be noriegas personal banker 
two divisions of luxembourgbased bcci pleaded guilty last week 
to money laundering charges forfeited a record 14 million and 
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and turn over bank records

a federal appeals court upheld the mailand 
taxfraud conspiracy convictions of fringe presidential candidate 
lyndon h larouche jr but larouche promised to continue his legal 
battle 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals on 
monday also upheld the convictions of six larouche associates in a 
case that stemmed from more than 30 million in loans raised by 
larouches political supporters 
this is a pure and simple travesty of justice larouche 
imprisoned in rochester minn said through spokeswoman dana 
scanlon this travesty will be overturned some way eventually 
larouche was convicted in december 1988 on 11 counts of mail 
fraud one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count 
of conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service he was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison 
convicted with larouche were william wertz edward spannaus 
michael billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce 
rubinstein wertz and spannaus were sentenced to five years in 
prison and fined 1000 each the other four defendants were 
sentenced to three years and ordered to pay various fines 
in arguments last october former attorney general ramsey clark 
the chief attorney for larouches appeal said us district judge 
albert v bryan jr of alexandria allowed only 34 days from 
arraignment to trial and failed to adequately question jurors on 
how much they knew about the defendant 
but in a unanimous ruling the appeals judges who heard the case 
kenneth k hall francis d murnaghan jr and john d butzner jr 
rejected claims that the trial was procedurally flawed 
when judge bryan denied the defendants motion for a 
continuance he possessed a highly relevant piece of information 
the defense waited 18 days to move for a continuance the panel 
said defense counsels prolonged silence leads to the reasonable 
inference that 34 days was not a clearly insufficient period of 
time between arraignment and trial 
the panel also said larouches lawyers made no attempt to press 
potential jurors to determine if they had heard of larouche who 
ran for president several times and espouses theories of world 
conspiracies including allegations of drug dealing and other 
crimes by world leaders 
according to court records from the trial the larouche 
organization used heavyhanded tactics to raise money larouche and 
wertz who was in charge of fundraising set high goals for 
individual fundraisers 
fundraisers began to take loans from potential contributors as 
opposed to donations the records showed 
lenders later were asked to convert their funds into donations 
and one former larouche fundraiser testified that wertz 
characterized lenders who asked for their money back as immoral 
the government said larouche had no intention of repaying the 
loans and that he avoided taxes by reporting no income and having 
his personal expenses paid through corporations he controlled

the government said today that it is 
easing its total suspension of visits by cabinet ministers to china 
and will approve them on a casebycase basis 
foreign affairs minister gareth evans said after a cabinet 
meeting that the policy shift does not signal a return to 
business as usual after the bloody chinese crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in june 
evans said that despite beijings lifting of martial law in 
beijing earlier this month the atmosphere in china had not altered 
substantially 
people arrested for demonstrating are still in jail reports of 
human rights abuses continue and the prevailing conservative 
political mood has stalled political and economic reform he said 
on the other hand it is not in the interests of australia the 
region or the international community to have an isolated and 
inwardlooking china evans said 
regional stability is influenced by chinas role in issues such 
as ending the war in cambodia he said while the extent of chinas 
openness to outside economic forces will have crucial influence on 
the future of the asiapacific regional economic growth and 
integration 
china also is an important player on issues such as disarmament 
and the environment evans said noting that the government has 
balanced these various considerations in making its decision on a 
resumption of ministerial visits

opposition leader kim daejung today 
announced a petition campaign for new elections in an effort to 
overcome a setback from the governing partys plans to merge with 
centrist opposition groups 
we can see a harsh suppression prepared against democratic 
forces but we are ready to crush any dictatorial regime kims 
party said in a resolution 
president roh taewoo said monday that his conservative 
democratic justice party would form an alliance with the two 
moderate opposition groups the reunification democratic party and 
new democratic republican party 
such a merger will isolate kims party for peace and democracy 
the largest opposition group and limit its chances of gaining 
power kim describes himself as a liberal centrist but others say 
he is more radical 
roh also announced plans to change the government from a 
presidential system to a parliamentary one with a prime minister 
we will have to begin a pannational campaign to make rohs 
government give in kim told a party caucus today as he announced 
the petition drive 
governing party officials said a sweeping cabinet reshuffle was 
expected in february to introduce figures from the absorbed 
opposition parties and test a fresh political structure before 
inaugurating a new party 
leaders plan to form the party within six months it will be the 
first time in koreas history that a new political party is formed 
by governing and opposition parties 
on major campuses in seoul students put up wall posters calling 
for a civil uprising to overthrow rohs government and block its 
alliance with opposition groups 
in kwangju kim daejungs hometown hundreds of students 
shouting overthrow roh taewoo fought riot police with 
firebombs and rocks on two university campuses no injuries were 
reported 
at todays party caucus kim daejung vowed to collect 
signatures of 10 million supporters to push for new elections and 
block what his party called a oneparty dictatorship 
the party resolution denounced as a coup the plans for a new 
governing party with opposition leaders kim youngsam of the 
reunification party and kim jongpil of the new democrats 
it demanded roh step down if he wants to change the countrys 
current government system to a parliamentary structure 
we would not reject constitutional changes for a cabinet 
structure if a majority of voters endorsed it the party said 
but it said rohs government will be responsible for any political 
unrest afterward 
government party chairman park taejun told a news conference 
today that the issue of adopting a parliamentary system would be 
discussed by a 15member working committee to be formed wednesday 
the new party will be assured of a twothirds majority of the 
national assembly seats which is needed to revise the constitution 
the new political alignment boosted the chances of kim youngsam 
coming to power after roh steps down in feburary 1993 after a 
single fiveyear term roh defeated him kim daejung and kim 
jongpil in the 1987 presidential election many koreans blamed kim 
youngsam and kim daejung for splitting the opposition vote at

mayor marion barrys arrest last week on a 
cocaine charge has dealt a setback to the uphill fight to win 
statehood for the district of columbia says a congressman 
but the nonvoting delegate to congress for the past 19 years 
said he believes every cloud has a silver lining and barrys 
arrest may work in the districts favor 
rep stan parris of virginia a republican on the house 
appropriations subcommittee on the district of columbia and a 
longtime critic of the district government said the mayors arrest 
cannot be beneficial to the statehood advocates clearly this 
sets that back 
members of congress who would use a man who admittedly has a 
problem as a reason for opposing dc statehood no longer have 
that excuse delegate walter fauntroy said in a telephone 
interview monday 
the delegate said lawmakers will return to washington today 
praising emerging democracies in poland romania and panama and be 
hardpressed to explain why 650000 citizens in the district are 
without representation 
congress granted home rule for the district in 1974 under that 
system the citys 670000 residents have the right to elect a 
mayor and city council but do not have a vote in congress 
the city budget is approved by congress and lawmakers can veto 
laws enacted by the city council 
but after granting home rule congress took some of it back in 
1988 overriding the city council congress voted to require the 
city to stop using medicaid money to pay for abortions to allow 
georgetown university to deny facilities to homosexual campus 
groups and to compel the city to repeal a law barring mandatory 
aids tests by applicants for life insurance 
there is not an organized crescendo against home rule 
said parris there is an increased discussion about whether this 
thing is really working theres a growing perception among the 
members of congress who live here 
fauntroy and city administrator carol thompson who has assumed 
most of the governmental powers of mayor since barrys arrest met 
with the house and senate leadership monday 
we wanted to assure leaders of the house and senate just as 
members of the council and others in the city have been assured 
that the government is in good hands that indeed the ability now 
is to focus attention exclusively and primarily on delivery of 
services fauntroy told reporters

former mayor frank rizzo wanted sylvester 
stallone on his radio show so an onair phone call seemed the next 
best thing to interviewing the rocky star in person 
it also turned out to be the next best thing to actually talking 
with stallone because the caller was an impostor 
he really sounded like stallone rizzo said of dennis 
malloy wsnifm disc jockey 
rizzo whose program is on wcauam had reason to expect a call 
from stallone because the mayor had seen the actor at dinner and 
asked him to go on the program 
on friday two days later the mayor got the call but from 
malloy rizzo spent six minutes asking him about rocky v which 
is being filmed in philadelphia 
asked about the call later malloy said it was a quiet 
afternoon id lost my street hockey ball it was too cold 
to play golf nobody was using the phone 
rizzo wasnt bothered by the hoax i enjoyed it he said

a group of relieved polish sailors came 
home today 19 days after they were captured by ethiopian 
guerrillas and led on a harrowing trek through caves desert 
hideouts and mountain ravines 
the sailors were reportedly captured because the rebels believed 
their vessel was carrying arms to ethiopias marxist government 
polish news accounts indicated today that the ship at one point 
carried weapons for south yemen and acknowledged that poland has 
indeed shipped arms to ethiopia 
the sailors said that after their vessel was riddled by gunfire 
on the red sea they were captured and led on a 600mile journey 
afterwards the guerrillas admitted that it was a mistake 
they apologized to us capt andrzej sikorski told the official 
polish news agency pap 
his freighter the 8137ton boleslaw krzywousty was attacked 
jan 3 as it steamed from port sudan to massawa a red sea port in 
eritrea 
the director of the polish ocean lines told the sailors 
families the ship carried no arms when it was attacked but had 
unloaded polish hunting weapons and ammunition in south yemen 
after legally registering the cargo at each port according to a 
jan 15 report in the sztandar mlodych newspaper 
however the gazeta wyborcza newspaper reported today that arms 
shipments for ethiopia had been loaded as recently as jan 12 onto 
an ethiopian plane at the warsaw airport 
poland has sold ethiopia arms worth 83 million during the last 
two years according to an official from the foreign trade 
ministrys central board of engineers quoted by the newspaper 
representatives of the polish government and us diplomats 
arranged the monday release of the 28 crewmen the ships doctor 
and the captains wife 
im still alive shouted dr krystyna dabrowska as the crew 
emerged from a chartered plane that landed early today at the 
baltic port of gdansk 
according to accounts published by pap and polish newspapers 
the freighter was attacked by rebels firing machine guns from three 
motorboats 
the assault turned the right side of the ship into a sieve 
sikorski said 
the rebels who have been fighting almost three decades to free 
their northern eritrea province from ethiopia acknowledged the 
attack through a spokesman speaking anonymously from bahrain jan 7 
as the crew took cover on deck a fire broke out below sikorski 
said there were no injuries however 
the assault continued for two hours despite a white flag raised 
by the crew and appeals for the attackers to cease fire made 
through a loud speaker the captain said 
we could not make any contact with them during the attack 
they simply showed no reaction to our signals he said 
when the firing did cease the crew was ordered onto the 
motorboats as they reached shore they heard explosions aboard the 
ship 
the first two weeks the crew was held captive were spent in very 
difficult conditions the reports said 
the rebels fearing an ethiopian government attack moved the 
prisoners only at night sometimes by car and at other times on 
foot 
during 19 days we changed our position five times we stayed 
in ravines caverns in the desert said sikorski 
the last week was spent at a medical base where the sailors 
said they were given beds and larger portions of food than the 
guerrillas received 
the gazeta wyborcza newspaper said it withheld information about 
the arms shipments while the sailors were in captivity and 
reported that government officials had suspended two additional 
shipments for the ethiopian order totaling 23 million 
it is true that we should have turned the ethiopian plane 
back but we cant afford that and we cant stop the business 
said the engineering board official identified by the newspaper as 
director pawluczuk 
an unidenfied foreign ministry official was quoted in the 
newspaper saying trade in arms no longer needed by polands army 
as weapons levels are reduced is a lucrative source of income for 
the beleagured polish economy 
we are disarming ourselves the official said the arms we 
sell cannot be taken advantage of in the civil economy and 
therefore we have the problem off our hands and proper payment 
according to the newspaper polish ships carry not only 
polishmade arms but shipments from other nations loaded at western 
european ports in sealed containers without labels identifying the 
cargo

iranian lawmakers today warned moscow not 
to be influenced by american conspiracies as the soviets seek 
to stop ethnic violence in the republic of azerbaijan tehran radio 
said 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the warning was 
contained in a letter to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
signed by 160 deputies in the 270seat parliament 
more than 170 people have died since last week in ethnic 
violence between the republics azerbaijani majority and armenians 
according to official soviet reports 
gorbachev declared a state of emergency in azerbaijan and red 
army troops stormed the azerbaijani capital of baku on saturday to 
quell the fighting 
thousands of soviet azerbaijanis who are bound by a common 
language culture and religion with their iranian kin across the 
border poured into iran during last weeks violence 
tehran television reported monday that soviet troops had sealed 
the border to prevent further crossings 
the letter by the iranian lawmakers urged gorbachev not to be 
influenced by the conspiracies of global arrogance and the criminal 
america and to deal with the moslems of the soviet union with 
compassion 
global arrogance is a term used to refer to the west 
the iranian foreign ministry issued a statement sunday that 
warned moscow that imperialist governments and the 
zionistcontrolled media were distorting what was happening in 
azerbaijan portraying the moslem azerbaijanis as belligerents 
attacking helpless armenians 
the parliaments letter said the moslems of soviet 
azerbaijan by protesting in their cities and gathering on the 
iranian border are demonstrating their desire to return to the 
fold of islam and regain their lost identitity 
the letter called on gorbachev to defuse the situation 
peacefully 
moscow has long feared that irans revolutionary zealots who 
came to power in 1979 would seek to export their brand of islam to 
the 70 million moslems who live in the soviet unions southern 
republics 
soviet media have accused iran of supplying arms to the moslems 
in azerbaijan a claim denied by iran 
the mass border crossings have heightened fears in tehran that 
nationalistic passions among its own 15 million azerbaijanis could 
be aroused 
soviet nationalists want to establish an independent homeland 
for the 20 million azerbaijanis on both sides of the border 
the azerbaijanis lived together under persian rule until 1828 
when part of their homeland was ceded to czarist russia 
the violence between the soviet republics mostly moslem 
azerbaijanis and christian armenians erupted jan 13 when a 
historical feud flared over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
the predominantly armenian enclave has been part of azerbaijan 
since 1923

when richard a stahls wife of 46 years 
died his buddy for more than a half century warren goodnow was 
there to help him through the grief 
stahl 71 was so grateful he told goodnow that he arranged to 
leave him everything he owned when he died including 70000 from 
the sale of his house 
but now he says goodnow took the money too soon and stole his 
car as well 
goodnow 70 was arraigned monday in warwick on charges of 
larceny and auto theft and was jailed on 50000 bail 
stahl says goodnow suggested that rather than go to a lawyer to 
draw up a will stahl deposit the 70000 in a joint account stahl 
says goodnow then ran off to florida in september with the money 
and the cadillac he bought after his wifes death last year 
goodnow who had been friends with stahl since they met in high 
school in 1935 contends he took the 70000 from the joint account 
to prevent stahl from spending it 
coventry police capt walter p hennessy who flew to florida 
two weeks ago to drive the cadillac back said 50000 was returned 
to stahl 
stahl who lives in a trailer said he was so broke volunteers 
had to bring him meals to get him through thanksgiving and 
christmas 
his trust in others has been shattered stahl said i feel 
hurt 
i think i could forgive him if he asked for it he said 
but i dont think he will

only 18 seconds before liftoff space 
officials today postponed a rocket launch that would have made 
japan only the third country to send a spacecraft around the moon 
officials said the flight was canceled after a problem arose in 
the hydraulic control system used to move the nozzle of a booster 
rocket 
i dont think it is a serious problem mission chief hiroki 
matsuo said if things go well there is still a chance of a 
launch tomorrow 
the mission received little advance publicity in japan and 
todays countdown was not shown live on television 
dozens of reporters had gathered on a dark hillside several 
miles from the oceanside launch site to watch the liftoff but 
officials stopped the countdown with only 18 seconds to go 
if the mission goes as planned the musesa would be the 
first spacecraft to orbit the moon since the soviet union landed 
the unmanned vehicle luna 24 on its surface in 1976 on july 20 
1969 americans neil armstrong and edwin aldrin became the first 
astronauts to set foot on the moon 
the japanese hope to use the mission to develop techniques for 
an eventual manned lunar flight and exploration of other planets 
said kuninori uesugi an official with the institute of space and 
astronautical science 
japans emergence as a possible lunar power comes after a late 
start in space but a series of launch successes has led to worry 
overseas that japan could develop an aerospace industry rivaling 
other nations in the lucrative commercial business of 
communications satellites 
the institute plans to send the musesa into a highly oval earth 
orbit that will bring it about 10000 miles from the moon on march 
18 
japanese space centers cannot trace the flight all the way so 
centers in canberra australia and at the california institute of 
technology will help said center spokesman tadashige takiya 
just before crossing the moons orbit the craft is to release a 
smaller satellite equipped with a kick motor that will propel 
it into its own lunar orbit 
the smaller craft will send data to the mother satellite on 
space temperatures and electric fields the larger craft 
meanwhile will continue circling earth swinging by the moon and 
collecting data on space dust and other phenomena 
the governmentfunded flight will be the 13th satellite launched 
by japan and the fifth use of nissan motor cos m3s2 rocket a 
threestage solidfuel rocket that weighs 62 tons japan launched 
its first experimental satellite in 1970 
nissan japans secondlargest automobile maker opened its 
aerospace division in 1953 and has since played a key role in 
developing and manufacturing japans solidfuel rocket engines 
rocket launches in japan have a high success rate but the 
national space development agency had its first failure in 20 
launchings in august when the first stage of an h1 rocket failed 
to ignite 
launches are limited to a 90day period each year 45 days in 
august and 45 in january and february because tuna fishermen near 
the space center off the southern main island of kyushu complain 
the liftoffs are dangerous 
the space development agency and the space institute which is 
affiliated with the education ministry share control of japans 
space program

a scholar says johannes kepler the father of 
modern astronomy fabricated data to support his theory of how the 
planets move around the sun 
the new york times reported today that kepler apparently 
resorted to scientific fakery to bolster acceptance of his theory 
which turned out to be valid 
william h donahue a science historian who lives in santa fe 
nm said in an article in the journal of the history of astronomy 
that the evidence of keplers deceit is contained in an elaborate 
chart kepler created in 1609 
kepler showed that planets move in elliptical orbits rather 
than circles in his book on the subject he wrote that his 
conclusion was confirmed by independent calculations of the 
planets positions 
in fact donahue said kepler derived the data based by 
calculations based on the theory itself 
donahue said he made the discovery while translating keplers 
master work astronomia nova into english 
several experts have defended kepler arguing that standards of 
scientific research and reporting have changed over the past 400 
years 
kepler was one of the people who invented modern science 
said walter w stewart a researcher with the national institutes 
of health its not clear his standards were the same as ours

portauprince haiti ap the military government tightened 
restrictions on the media today by barring radio stations from 
carrying foreign news about haiti or broadcasting reports likely 
to incite agitation 
the announcement came two days after lt gen prosper avrils 
government announced a state of siege it followed reported raids 
on three independent radio stations and a weekend of arrests 
beatings and deportations of leaders of the democratic opposition 
an information ministry communique ordered radio and tv stations 
to refrain from relaying or broadcasting any information on haiti 
from stations broadcasting outside of the national territory it 
also said the stations should refrain from broadcasting anything 
likely to incite agitation 
in recent days local stations have relayed statements by exiled 
opposition leaders broadcast by radio france internationale and the 
voice of america radio is the main source of news in haiti 
the military government has insisted restrictions on civil 
liberties were needed to maintain order but opponents say the 
moves are intended to silence critics and prolong its rule 
the information ministry also told radio stations to check with 
it to confirm the exactness of any local news reports before 
broadcasting them the communique also requires provincial news 
reports be prerecorded rather than live 
raymond exume news director of the protestant churchrun radio 
lumiere said he was astonished by the communique he said the 
station would stop giving local news radio soleil run by the 
roman catholic church also said it would cease broadcasting local 
news 
in washington haitis ambassador to the united states pierre 
francois benoit resigned monday to protest the repeated 
violations of human rights by haitis government 
benoit a proponent of democratic reform told a news conference 
that the 16monthold regime in haiti which has described itself 
as provisional in my view is becoming permanent 
avrils government declared a 30day state of siege and began 
expelling prominent political leaders on saturday one day after 
unidentified attackers killed an army colonel 
dozens of government critics also were reported arrested but 
most were thought to have been released 
it is the governments toughest crackdown on its critics since 
coming to power in a september 1988 soldiers revolt critics 
accuse avril of using the colonels killing as a pretext to assume 
dictatorial powers and renege on his pledge to cede power to a 
civilian government after free elections in october 
avril claimed the curbs on civil liberties were necessary to 
protect democratic accomplishments against terrorism 
staterun television and radio reported international 
condemnation of the governments action but said the state of 
siege and expulsions were justified by destabilizing activities 
by the political opposition 
the bush administration said it deplores the actions taken by 
the government of haiti france and canada issued similar 
protests 
this impoverished caribbean nation of 5 million people has been 
ruled almost exclusively by dictators since winning independence 
from france in 1804 
after jeanclaude baby doc duvalier was forced into exile in 
france in february 1986 by a popular uprising ending a 
threedecade family reign there was hope among haitians that 
democracy might actually be on the horizon

november 1987 elections that were canceled after thugs in collusion 
with the army massacred at least 34 people at polling stations 
namphy was overthrown in the revolt avril rode into power 
noncommissioned officers who led the coup claimed they ousted 
namphy because they were outraged by statesponsored murder and 
political repression 
under its state of siege the government also suspended a law 
forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa requirement for 
haitians returning from abroad 
the government has acknowledged the expulsions of three 
prominent activists dr louis roy principal author of the 1987

communist khmer rouge guerrillas are 
preventing cambodian refugees from going to a un camp and instead 
are moving them toward an area that has been a combat zone un 
officials said today 
also today a thai military spokesman said cambodian guerrillas 
have cut parts of important government supply lines from the 
cambodian interior to battlefields in the west 
the sound of gunfire crackled in the isolated borai camp shortly 
after un trucks arrived there monday to take refugees to the site 
k camp said patrick van de velde deputy director of the un 
border relief operation 
the 10 trucks remained outside borai today and repeated 
shooting appeared designed to stop the refugees from leaving said 
another relief official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
borai run by the khmer rouge is near thailands eastern 
province of trat and a few miles from site k 
none of the borai refugees had boarded the trucks by today 
although some refugees in the past have pressed relief officials to 
be transferred to site k 
they are too scared to leave said another aid official 
also speaking anonymously 
there was no statement from the khmer rouge 
he said camp authorities had ordered the refugees to head toward 
areas along the cambodian frontier recently secured by the 
guerrillas since jan 15 the khmer rouge have moved about 
threefourths of 4000 to 4500 people at borai to the border area 
the aid official said 
urs boegli head of the thailand office of the international 
committee of the red cross said the danger is they are being 
moved toward a combat zone 
the khmer rouge is the largest guerrilla group fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia 
during a 3year rule that was ended by vietnams invasion in 
late 1978 the communist fanatics slaughtered hundreds of thousands 
of people in an attempt to radically restructure cambodian society 
the guerrillas took tens of thousands of civilians along as they 
retreated to the thai border in 1979 and widespread human rights 
violations have been reported in its civilian camps 
the khmer rouge have resisted moving refugees to unaided 
camps for fear of losing control over them but amid mounting 
international pressure the guerrillas in the past year have let 
nearly 30000 refugees from secretive militaryrun camps resettle 
in two un camps otrao and site k 
this had raised hopes for transferring the people from borai 
the most hardline of four khmer rouge camps where the united 
nations has had access 
just last week after months of negotiations borai 
administrator lok tia assured a un official the refugees could 
freely decided whether to go to site k 
a coalition of three guerrilla factions is fighting cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government 
the coalition including the khmer rouge and the noncommunist 
forces of prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer peoples national 
liberation front has made major gains since late september when 
vietnam withdrew what it said were its last troops in cambodia 
at a press briefing in bangkok today thai military spokesman 
rear adm kraichit sirisombat confirmed guerrilla claims they cut 
parts of route 5 and route 6 which run the length of cambodia to 
the western border with thailand 
government forces now were concentrating on securing the most 
important cities he said

cia director william webster said today that 
the soviet threat to the united states and its nato allies has 
diminished as a result of the dramatic changes in eastern europe 
in an unusual public appearance before congress webster said 
the soviet union continues to modernize its strategic forces with 
deployment last year of landbased nuclear missiles and the 
launching of ballistic missile submarines 
however he told the senate armed services committee the 
conventional threat to the united states and our alliance partners 
in europe has decreased as a result of changes in eastern europe 
and soviet force reductions 
the result of these reductions is that the length of time it 
would take the soviet union and the warsaw pact nations to mobilize 
any largescale attack in europe has increased webster said 
moscow is not likely to be confident therefore of eastern 
european readiness to respond to soviet requirements he said 
in addition soviet leader mikhail gorbachev faced with 
economic pressures at home and the growing demands of 
nationalities will be forced to reduce defense spending he added 
we can probably expect a continued diminution but not 
elimination of soviet threats to us interests webster said 
in his opening statement a questionandanswer period with members 
of the armed services committee was closed to the public and news 
media 
the hearing marked the first in a series of sessions the 
committee has scheduled to assess the soviet threat and use the 
information as a basis for crafting a defense budget for the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 
president bush will send his budget proposal to congress next 
monday 
weve seen the threat change on tv every night sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the committee said in beginning the 
hearing well be looking at this changed threat as the 
foundation on which we build the budget which we will be asking the 
american people to pay for 
sen james exon of nebraska the secondranking democrat on the 
panel stressed the importance of the threat assessment hearings 
and said the worst thing the panel could do would be to approach 
the budget with a machete type of approach 
one budget issue sure to attract controversy is the b2 stealth 
bomber the air forces costly plane designed to evade soviet radar 
detection in the opening shots over the b2 republican sen 
william cohen of maine expressed his opposition to the aircraft if 
it means crippling the air force budget 
but another republican sen slade gorton of washington said 
there may be an even greater need for the b2 which has come under 
attack for its price of about 530 million a copy 
already weve identified one debate nunn said theyll be 
many more to follow

promised a share of power by the ruling 
communists east germanys inexperienced opposition groups failed 
to agree today on whether to join the government they eventually 
hope to replace 
a leader of the opposition social democrats conceded that 
informal discussions among the numerous prodemocracy groups has 
yet to yield a common strategy on how closely the opposition should 
work with the rival communists 
meanwhile east german border guards worked through the night 
dismantling a 325yard stretch of the berlin wall they planned to 
replace the section with a simple metal fence 
communist premier hans modrow offered monday to rebuild his 
cabinet to include opposition forces such as the social democrats 
and new forum the largest of the reform movements challenging the 
communists 
modrow called for talks wednesday to determine which ministerial 
posts could be filled by reform activists and social democrat 
leader ibrahim boehme agreed that swift and united action was 
needed to avert collapse of the east german economy 
but ingrid koeppe a prominent new forum activist said the 
opposition needed time to consult with grassroots activists and to 
coordinate positions of the different groups she told the 
associated press she did not know when negotiations on an 
opposition role in the leadership could begin 
ulrich kasparech business manager of the social democrats also 
said further talks among the fractious new political groups are 
needed 
there is no consensus yet kasparech told the ap this 
will depend on the groups being able to come to agreement and they 
have no further meetings set at this time 
prodemocracy protests late last year toppled the old stalinist 
regime which was replaced by reformoriented communists the new 
regime has promised free and open elections on may 6 
but the opposition which hopes to handily defeat the communists 
in the balloting has been split sharply over strategy and 
direction 
kasparech said other reform advocates met with boehme earlier 
but that the groups currently disagree about the share of cabinet 
seats they should seek 
boehme in an interview today with the communist party daily 
neues deutschland appealed to west german social democrats to 
provide immediate aid to east germany to halt the exodus of workers 
fearing no change in their spartan lifestyles can be expected soon 
nearly 2000 east germans per day have been fleeing to west 
germany a sign of dwindling hope for an east german recovery 
communists currently hold 16 ministerial posts in modrows 
27member cabinet with liberal democrats in four christian 
democrats with three and two each for the national democrats and 
the farmers party 
the noncommunist cabinet members are from officially recognized 
parties once aligned with the communists 
since the communists were stripped in december of their 
constitutional guarantee of a leading role reform groups have 
argued that modrows government lacks a political mandate and 
therefore is a transitional force with limited powers 
until monday the groups had resisted formally joining modrows 
government partly from fear they would share the blame for the 
economic mess left by 40 years of monopoly communism 
since setting the election date in december the regular talks 
between the communists and the opposition have been mired in 
procedural squabbles and infighting 
in west berlin several hundred gathered along crowd control 
barriers lined up along the graffitisplattered berlin wall to 
watch east german border guards begin dismantling the hated 
barrier it is to be replaced this week by a fence 
west berlin government spokesman werner kolhoff said he was 
informed by east berlin officials that other segments of the wall 
would be removed later 
the wall was symbolically breached on nov 9 when east germany 
scrapped travel restrictions on its citizens and began opening new 
border crossings to west germany

more people were killed in clashes between the moslems and 
government forces

involved in the agitation pakistan denied the accusation 
loudspeakers at mosques blared victory is ours and urged 
people to stop paying taxes the kashmirilanguage broadcasts were 
audible over much of the city and were repeated regularly

capt idesbald van diesebroeck of the un military observers 
group in india and pakistan said the mob stopped the two cars and 
someone in the crowd threw a clay pot containing hot coals at the 
guards vehicle 
many kashmiris tie the pots to their bodies to keep warm during 
winter 
the pot hit the eye of one of the guards and the others 
apparently thought it was an attack so they fired back van 
diesebroeck said 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said they counted 
at least four bodies after the shooting

gov james florio immediately set to work 
on a campaign promise and unveiled a plan to bring down auto 
insurance rates which are among the nations highest at an average 
of 1000 a year per car 
our car insurance system is a disgrace florio said monday 
it costs drivers too much its too generous to insurance 
companies its unfair as we describe a car wrecked beyond repair 
our system of insurance is totaled and we might as well scrap it 
florio a democrat who took office last week said his reforms 
that would save motorists an average of 225 the average percar 
surcharge motorists pay to support the joint underwriting 
association in which insurance companies pool the cost of insuring 
highrisk drivers 
florios plan would disband the association and require the 
insurance industry to pay off 14 billion of the pools 3 billion 
debt over seven years without passing the cost on to customers 
a replacement baddriver plan would have tighter state controls 
to make sure it includes no more than 10 percent of new jersey 
motorists compared with the more than 50 percent once covered 
critics of the current arrangement say it does not encourage 
insurers to save the pool money in the payment of claims and 
settlements after a lack of state oversight allowed the pool and 
its debt to grow far beyond anyones expectations a state audit 
accused insurers of systematically overcharging the pool 
florio would have the state limit how much doctors can charge 
for treating accident victims and how much may be charged for 
towing and storing vehicles 
the plan would eliminate what florio says is pricefixing by the 
auto insurance companies by taking away their antitrust exemption 
motorists would also have to pay higher auto registration fees 
the plan was was praised by democrats and lawyers but received a 
cool reaction from republicans and the insurance industry leaders 
of the democratcontrolled legislature said the proposal will get a 
swift hearing 
robert gaines vice president of the american insurance 
association said it would be illegal to require the industry to 
pay off the joint underwriting association debt without passing the 
cost on to drivers 
florio insisted the state is on firm legal ground

preacher who once sold insurance and took up the junk business 
about three years ago was released after questioning and was back 
at his home this morning 
he told reporters he was cooperating in the investigation and 
may have a statement at an appropriate time he then asked the 
reporters to leave his property 
court records show oferrell was involved in a case heard by 
us circuit judge robert vance killed last month when a package 
bomb sent through the mail exploded at his home near birmingham 
oferrell had sued gulf life insurance co of jacksonville 
fla for firing him disputing the companys claim that he held 
licenses with other insurance companies oferrell also claimed 
gulf life owed him commissions 
a federal judge in montgomery dismissed the lawsuit in june 
1988 last april vance and two other judges on the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld the lower court ruling in a 
onepage unsigned decision 
the atlanta constitution quoting unidentified federal sources 
reported today that an agent reviewing files at the appeals court 
discovered correspondence from oferrell that apparently matched 
typewritten letters from the bomber 
oferrells sonilaw john cauley who lives with his wife on 
oferrells property said agents asked family members about an old 
typewriter but did not indicate why they were interested in it 
cauley said he told them his fatherinlaw had several old 
typewriters at his business but none at home 
they asked me all kinds of stuff like if he knew about the 
letter bombs and if he was violent cauley said i told them he 
wasnt violent and that he couldnt hurt anybody cauley said 
oferrell never mentioned the mailbombings when they happened 
package bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed vance on 
dec 16 and a black lawyer robert robinson of savannah ga two 
days later other mailed bombs were defused at the 11th circuit 
courthouse in atlanta and the naacp office in jacksonville fla 
the fbi has said one or more white racists appeared to be behind 
the attacks one agent said a possible profile of the bomber was a 
man in his 50s not connected with any white supremacist group 
wayne oferrells name is not in a file of white hate group members 
kept by the klanwatch program of the southern poverty law center in 
montgomery director morris dees said today 
archer declined to say what evidence brought the investigation 
to oferrells property archer also would not say specifically 
what the agents were looking for in the search or what if 
anything was found 
fbi agents also questioned oferrells neighbors 
tina sommerville who lives across the street from the 
warehouse said the fbi asked me had i ever noticed any strange 
activity or if i had ever noticed any unusual number of cars over 
there or unusual number of people over there or if he had ever 
shown a violent temper 
i said no i had never seen any of that 
they are just average people she said of oferrell his 
wife and two daughters he was always reading the bible 
neighbors jim and joan ziglar said oferrell had always referred 
to himself as a minister on his mailbox but they had never known 
him to preach regularly at any church during his 13 years at the 
small woodframe home 
another neighbor robert thomas said oferrell didnt have the 
expertise to pull off the bombings he couldnt even do the 
wiring in his house hows he going to build a bomb

the new government today postponed the 
first democratic elections in more than four decades until may 20 
because fledgling opposition parties asked for more time to 
organize a senior official said 
dimitru mazilu a senior member of the governing national 
salvation front also said members of the front would run for 
parliament he said un observers would be asked to monitor the 
balloting which had been planned for april 
earlier today justice minister teodor vasiliu said four close 
associates of toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu will stand trial 
saturday on charges that include aiding in mass killings 
a historian meanwhile said ceasuescu and his wife bolted in 
panic and tried to flee the firing squad that lined up to execute 
them the dictator was finally cornered and shot while his wife 
was initially shot in the back said historian cristian popisteanu 
quoting a witness he did not identify 
the governing council recently agreed in principle that a delay 
in the elections was necessary mazilu said the postponement was 
decided on following requests from the more than one dozen new and 
revived opposition parties seeking more time to prepare for 
balloting 
the council to demonstrate good will and the desire to 
ensure objectivity in the elections has declared its readiness to 
receive a group of observers from the united nations he added 
communists took power in romania after world war ii and no 
democratic elections have been held the national salvation front 
promised free elections after taking power in the popular 
revolution that toppled ceausescu dec 22 
the front also said it had no political aspirations and would 
only be a transition government its announcement that the front 
also would field candidates is a reversal from that earlier stand 
justice minister teodor vasiliu told state radio that the four 
ceausescu aides to be tried saturday are former communist party 
secretary emil bobu no 3 in the party hierarchy behind ceausescu 
and his wife elena former interior minister tudor postelnicu who 
was in charge of the secret police and expolitburo members manea 
manesacu and ion dinca

sibiu 180 miles northwest of bucharest 
gheorghe robu the prosecutorgeneral told the newspaper 
adevarul that the four will be tried by a military tribunal at the 
ministry of defense the trial will be telecast live 
the new government said more than 60000 people were killed 
during ceausescus 24year rule and it characterizes the deaths as 
genocide 
a military court sentenced ceausescu and his wife to death dec 
25 after their conviction on charges of genocide and other crimes 
adevarul said the four to be tried are charged with abetting 
genocide which is punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison 
relating the ceausescus last moments popisteanu said the 
ceausescus bolted from soldiers in a courtyard of the garrison 
where they were held and were chased through the courtyard for 10 
minutes or more before being gunned down 
he ceausescu was forced into a corner and shot 
popisteanu editor of the magazin istoric said in an interview 
she was shot in the back but only to stop her then all the 
soldiers shot at her from the front the historian said 
popisteanu said he did not know how many soldiers were involved 
but a leader of the national salvation front silviu brucan told 
the french daily le figaro on monday that the entire 80man squad 
fired at ceausescu and elena they reportedly found a total of 120 
bullet holes in their bodies

gheorghiu social and political academy which had been used to

extremists ambushed a military convoy carrying 
women and children in azerbaijan and two soldiers and a bystander 
were killed official media said today the kgb said the republic 
was on the brink of chaos 
hopes for an end to 10 days of ethnic strife between armenia and 
azerbaijan surfaced monday when communist party and government 
officials from the republics agreed to try to end the fighting 
but radio moscow reported today the situation in baku remained 
very very tense it said the military commander of 
azerbaijans capital vowed his troops were ready to stop further 
attacks 
antiarmenian riots and killings in baku on jan 13 ignited 
ethnic warfare between azerbaijanis and armenians azerbaijanis 
have since threatened to secede from the soviet union 
soviet troops smashed their way into baku on saturday to quell 
the nationalist uprising and soviet officials said the assault 
left 83 dead including 14 soldiers and members of their families 
on monday azerbaijanis marched through the caspian sea port 
city of 18 million to mourn those killed when the soviet troops 
moved in radio moscow said antiarmy and antirussian sentiments 
were being whipped up by irresponsible people sending 
threatening unsigned letters and making anonymous phone calls 
suspicious baku residents also prevented two ships carrying the 
families of soldiers stationed in the area from leaving the port 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said in moscow 
today 
he said azerbaijanis suspected bodies of people killed in the 
assault on baku were being smuggled out they apparently thought 
authorities wanted to claim casualties were lower than in reality 
nothing was found in the holds gerasimov told a news 
briefing 
radio moscow in a broadcast monitored in london by the british 
broadcasting corp said troops sent to azerbaijan came under fire 
four times monday and overnight including an attack on a convoy of 
recently demobilized servicemen also carrying women 
baku radio also monitored by the bbc said two soldiers and a 
woman bystander were killed in that attack 
the extremists are thus continuing their criminal 
activities bakus military commander lt gen vladimir 
dubinyak was quoted by the azerbaijani radio as saying 
the deaths brought the overall toll in the unrest to 170 killed 
since the baku riots with more than 600 wounded 
azerbaijans kgb expressed alarm in its appeal to residents of 
the republic for calm radio moscow said 
azerbaijan is on the edge of the abyss beyond which lie chaos 
and anarchy the kgb warned 
arif yunusov a spokesman for the independent social democratic 
group political organization said baku was paralyzed today by a 
general strike 
all shops in the major oil refining center were closed no 
morning newspapers were published and azerbaijans staterun 
television was off the air said sivinch abdullayeva an editor at 
azerinform the republics official news agency 
yunusov said fighting continued near salyanskiye barracks in 
baku with 263 azerbaijani military cadets and more than 130 
classmates of other soviet ethnic groups opposing soviet troops who 
have cordoned off the area 
dubinyak told the krasnaya zvezda military daily there was still 
intermittent gunfire in the city but gave no details in a 
statement broadcast on radio moscow the general said there are 
forces here with an interest in maintaining tension at the highest 
level 
his wording indicated disagreement over how to deal with groups 
such as the azerbaijan peoples front the political group 
organized antiarmenian rallies and led a drive to retain 
sovereignty over nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian enclave in 
azerbaijan whose demand to become part of armenia in february 1988 
ignited the nearly 2yearold ethnic feud 
a reporter for soviet tv news on monday spoke more favorably of 
the peoples front saying its members had ensured order that day 
at funeral services in baku attended by hundreds of thousands of 
azerbaijanis and were in control of some regions of azerbaijan 
perhaps it is high time to sit down with them at the 
negotiating table perhaps this could in some way prevent further 
bloodshed the correspondent said on the evening television news 
program vremya 
it was not known whether the front participated in the 
negotiations in the armenian town of yeraskh that led to the peace 
accord between officials of azerbaijan and armenia 
in yerevan armenias capital activist samvel gevorkyan said 
the negotiations were supposed to resume today but it was not yet 
clear whether they had 
he accused azerbaijanis of dragging out the talks because of 
reluctance to admit a young armenian taken hostage in the fighting 
was dead as soon as all hostages are released gevorkyan said 
negotiators will discuss more crucial issues such as a formal 
ceasefire and an end to azerbaijans rail blockade of armenia 
the explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility 
between mostly christian armenia and predominantly moslem 
azerbaijan is one of the worst crises gorbachev has faced in his 
nearly fiveyear tenure as soviet leader 
his fostering of greater freedoms has fueled ethnic unrest 
throughout the culturally diverse nation 
boris yeltsin an outspoken maverick in the soviet communist 
party and a central committee member predicted during a visit to 
tokyo today that gorbachevs rule would not last long unless he 
carried out radical reforms that included autonomy for ethnic 
groups and their republics 
he accused gorbachev of becoming more conservative gorbachev 
is in very difficult position and the blame should be put mainly 
on himself yeltsin said 
at mondays mass rally in baku demonstrators carried posters 
reading gorbachev is the butcher of the azerbaijani people 
said shain gajiyev a local journalist 
in moscow azerbaijani activists claimed 3700 people were 
killed when soviet troops stormed baku the official tass news 
agency said emphasizing that the figure was unconfirmed 
foreign reporters were barred from the region so it was 
difficult to determine the exact death toll or reconcile 
conflicting information 
armenias popular movements also condemned moscow for the baku 
deaths 
when armenians demanded protection for themselves and punishment 
for azerbaijani extremists who victimized them they did not mean 
a deployment of the soviet army in a largescale bloody action 
but the use of civilized methods proper to a lawbased state the 
armenian board of national movements said in a statement read over 
the phone by yerevan activist rafael popayan 
the total number of soviet forces now combating the violence in 
armenia and azerbaijan is reported to be 29000 the number of 
militants is reported in the thousands

the countrys communist leaders 
failed today to reunite their fractured party after delegates from 
liberalminded slovenia stormed out of a party congress and said 
they would form a new party 
delegates from croatia the second largest of yugoslavias six 
republics today appeared to back the slovenian move which 
threatened the unity of the ethnically diverse and economically 
troubled yugoslav federation 
slovenian party spokeman peter bekes said his republics 
delegation would establish an independent party on the basis of 
democratic socialism at a regional party conference on feb 2 
the republics party leader ciril ribicic said the slovenian 
party could never again be a part of the communist party of 
yugoslavia in the manner that it has been up to now an 
institutionalized permanent minority his comments were carried 
by tanjug the state news agency 
the croatian delegates in a statement said voting would be 
invalid without the participation of delegations from all of the 
countrys six republics and two provinces 
the statement made clear the croatian communists would not 
return to the congress if slovenia doesnt also 
the dramatic walkout came as delegates were preparing for a 
final vote on a reform document that would relinquish the partys 
45year monopoly on power 
but the vote never came and the congress was forced to adjourn 
late monday a day ahead of schedule with no date set for a new 
session 
leading slovenian communist milan kucan told journalists that 
the breakup of the league of communists of yugoslavia the official 
name of the ruling party is the only possible consequence of 
this action 
in announcing the slovenian decision ribicic said the congress 
had failed to accept any of his delegations proposals 
the delegates from the relatively prosperous northern republic 
wanted a declaration of greater autonomy for the countrys six 
republics a promise to end persecution of political opponents and 
greater cooperation with the west 
we are not going to take part in the agony of the communist 
party in yugoslavia he said and the entire slovenian delegation 
grimly left the hall 
slovenia is to hold the countrys first multiparty elections in 
march and its moves toward democracy and tolerance of dissent are 
opposed by hardliners such as the leaders of the serbian republic 
the countrys most populous 
serbias president slobodan milosevic took the podium after 
the walkout and said the suspension of the congress would mean that 
the party would be practically disbanded and decapitated 
he said this could have grave consequences for the communist 
party and future of the country 
the serbian leadership opposes doing away with central economic 
planning and milosevic seeks to impose stronger central control on 
the republics some critics say he deliberately sought a showdown 
with the slovenians to deflect attention from his economic and 
political failures 
the serbians comprise 9 million of the countrys 23 million 
people and many consider themselves yugoslavias ethnic core 
slovenia has a population of 2 million 
party president milan pancevski speaking to tired delegates 
early today after the partys leadership failed in a fourhour 
emergency session to end the crisis called on regional party 
bodies to work for a solution 
the congress broke down after it cast a preliminary vote early 
monday in favor of relinquishing the partys monopoly on power 
the slovenians complained that hardliners had watered down key 
reform points in the document they criticized those who voted 
against abolishing all laws allowing the persecution of political 
opponents 
they also complained about delegates scrapping of a statement 
that backed seeking membership in european organizations such as 
the european community 
until last years upheaval in eastern europe the communist 
regime in nonaligned yugoslavia had been considered progressive 
when compared to those in the soviet bloc 
but the country has long struggled with ethnic tensions and 
rivalries among its republics it also faces mounting labor unrest 
stemming largely from inefficient centralized economic planning 
its decentralized and often inefficient system of government 
which includes a collective federal presidency was devised in the 
1974 constitution of the late president josip broz tito to prevent 
one republic from dominating the others 
the federal government has pledged to introduce a multiparty 
system before the countrys first free elections which are set for 
april 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany poland and hungary have 
abolished the leading role of the communist party in recent months

pressurized air from a tunnel under construction caused a street to 
erupt showering pedestrians with water stones and mud 
ten people were injured including three who were hurt as a 
crowd jostled for a better view 
officials pulled out two cars and a motor scooter that had been 
swallowed up in the hole that was 42 feet long 32 feet wide and 17 
feet deep no one fell in 
a police official emphasized that investigators had not 
determined the exact cause of mondays eruption but believed the 
pressurized air was to blame 
air pressure in the tunnel is being kept high to prevent 
underground water from entering and there is a strong possibility 
that pressurized air escaped to the surface 46 feet above the 
tunnel said tadao hasegawa an engineer of the construction 
company kumagaigumi ltd 
under a contract with japan railways kumagaigumi is digging a 
tunnel for express trains

a senior administration arms control adviser 
raised concerns tuesday about unilateral soviet troop withdrawals 
from eastern and central europe saying they could increase 
political pressure for titfortat cutbacks in the west 
edward l rowny a former negotiator who counsels president bush 
and secretary of state james a baker iii on arms control issues 
said it would be far better to carry out troop withdrawals under a 
treaty now being negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact 
despite unprecedented progress rowny said several vital 
issues remained unresolved in the vienna talks he said they 
include soviet insistence on excluding large numbers of combat 
aircraft from treaty controls and not accepting western demands 
that withdrawn troops be demobolized 
also he said the soviets so far have agreed only to remove 
military equipment that would be barred under the treaty not to 
destroy it as negotiators for the north atlantic treaty 
organization insist 
and yet rowny said the end of the communist partys monopoly 
on power in the soviet bloc makes prospects for completing a 
sound conventional forces reduction treaty more promising 
the senior us official spoke at yale university in new haven 
conn his prepared remarks were distributed in washington 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev have 
set completion of the treaty as one of their arms control goals for 
1990 and rowny in a detailed review listed many more issues as 
being resolved than still unsettled 
he also raised several questions about the withdrawals of troops 
and tanks that the soviets have begun from central and eastern 
europe outside the treaty pressure is building from the new 
leaders of czechoslovakia and hungary for further reductions 
rowny said pullouts could be verified only under a treaty 
he noted that congressional observers last summer determined 
that while the soviets had withdrawn some tanks from eastern europe 
they had left other weapons including artillery behind 
it is also significant that unilateral cuts can be reversed 
unilaterally he said 
and in another cautionary note the former lieutenant 
general said soviet reductions announced with the full fanfare of 
the soviet public relations apparatus tends to increase political 
pressure for equal unilateral cuts in the west 
rowny referred to bushs proposal for deeper soviet troops cuts 
than the united states would make under the treaty his call for a 
ceiling of 275000 for each side in europe would mean a pullback of 
nearly 300000 soviet soldiers and 38000 american troops 
titfortat reductions not only would blur the asymmetry 
problem but also would blur the distinction between the nature of 
the us military presence in europe versus the soviets armed 
presence there rowny said 
there are an estimated 52000 soviet troops in hungary 40000 
in poland and 75000 in czechoslovakia most of the us troops are 
in west germany

congress came together today for an 
electionyear session with leaders predicting a quick override of 
president bushs veto of legislation protecting chinese students in 
the united states from being forced to return to their homeland 
republicans predicted bush would get no more than a handful of 
votes in the house where the veto override was expected to come up 
on wednesday 
were working to sustain the veto presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air force one as bush flew 
to kansas city to deliver an antidrug message he said the 
president has talked to some members of congress on the matter and 
plans to continue that lobbying 
the house had approved the legislation 4030 last nov 19 and 
it was virtually certain that backers could obtain the twothirds 
majority needed to put the bill into law over the presidents 
objections 
senate minority whip alan simpson rwyo who was supporting 
the white house predicted the override would nevertheless pass in 
the senate like a dose of salts 
the issue is the first major fight of what promises to be a busy 
and potentially contentious year on capitol hill further 
complicated by the partisanship that will arise as november 
elections draw near for all 435 house seats and 34 of the 100 
senate seats 
house speaker thomas foley dwash predicted the 
democraticcontrolled congress will turn attention from the 
military and international problems he said have been governments 
focus for the past decade to the domestic problems we face as a 
society competitiveness education health the strength of our 
economy and society 
topping the agenda are initiatives on clean air child care and 
campaign finance reform as well as the intractable budget deficit 
and decisions on how much to cut from defense spending and how much 
to give to emerging democracies in eastern europe and panama 
fights also loom on bushs proposal to cut the capital gains tax 
and on competing democratic proposals to cut social security taxes 
or revive taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
the veto override was the only substantive business before the 
house in its first week back after a twomonth holiday recess the 
bill bush vetoed nov 30 would let some 32000 chinese students 
extend their stays and avoid political persecution stemming from 
last junes brutally repressed prodemocracy movement a senate 
vote is expected as early as thursday 
how can we the united states of america lead people on to 
talk about democracy and human rights and then when they speak out 
for it say dont look to us to protect you said rep nancy 
pelosi dcalif the bills sponsor 
backers of the chinese students bill say the lifting of martial 
law in beijing on jan 10 was little more than a cosmetic gesture 
students testifying at a senate hearing today said they had been 
harassed by chinese consular officials in this country including 
veiled threats against family members still in china 
republicans have joined in publicly criticizing bushs veto 
theres been no letup in the beatings and trials of 
dissidents said rep william broomfield of michigan the senior 
republican on the house foreign affairs committee to let the veto 
stand would be obviously sending the wrong signal to the rest of 
the world about what took place just a few months ago he said 
members of congress in both parties were angered by bushs 
efforts to warm relations with beijing in the absence of human 
rights concessions they were particularly incensed by the 
presidents secret dispatching of highlevel emissaries to beijing 
on at least two occasions since the crackdown a move bush said he 
made to prevent isolating china 
the administration is fighting the veto override in the senate 
where it needs to enlist 34 senators to block the attempt 
before bushs nov 30 veto 74 senators including 26 
republicans signed a letter urging him not to kill the measure 
but the white house argues that since then bush has provided at 
least as much protection to the students through administrative 
steps as the bill would have afforded the veto preserves bushs 
foreign policy prerogatives but does not affect the students the 
administration contends a vote to override will be simply 
gratuitously bashing the president said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan 
pelosi contended however bush doesnt have authority to give 
airtight protection to the students through administrative actions 
and noted the bush gesture could be revoked at any time 
the vetoed bill would affect 32000 of the estimated 40000 
chinese students in the united states those who hold exchange 
visitor visas such visas require students to return to china for 
at least two years following their time in the united states before 
being able to return or go elsewhere the bill would waive that 
requirement 
even if the override attempt succeeds the bush administration 
still could raise constitutional objections and force congress to 
go to court to enforce its action the white house regards its 
action as a pocket veto and not subject to an override because it 
came eight days after congress had adjourned for the year

the french celebrated snoopy on tuesday saying 
that happiness is a warm puppy even one thats 40 years old 
the beguiling beagle who appears in charles schulzs comic strip 
peanuts was honored with a blockbuster retrospective worthy of 
the world war i flying ace birdlover and faithful friend to that 
roundheaded kid 
schulz by the way also was honored he was named commander of 
arts and letters one of frances highest awards for excellence in 
the arts 
thank you for being the creator of snoopy full of humor and 
with a zest for life culture minister jack lang told schulz 
your character is both mythical and hedonistic and he has taken 
over our collective consciousness and become a part of our everyday 
lives 
schulz beaming but appearing slightly embarrassed by the 
attention said that during snoopys war years when he battled the 
red baron he once explained how he learned to speak french 
he said he had a small tourist phrase book but he told me you 
only really need to know one word and that is merci schulz 
said in english 
ceremonies took place at the decorative arts museum which is 
honoring the whimsical dog with a retrospective featuring snoopy 
memorabilia 
eve dutton director of special events at determined 
productions which cosponsored the show with the paris museum 
said schulz was shocked when asked to participate in the show 
which opens to the public wednesday and runs through april 22 
he considers himself a simple cartoonist not a great artist 
worthy of a show at the louvre he just couldnt believe it she 
said 
as an art collector himself snoopy once had a van gogh but 
lost it when his dog house caught fire in 1966 the beagle knew he 
was in good company schulz said 
he said snoopy felt quite humble about being hung not far 
from the mona lisa 
schulz 67 recounted that on his first day of school his 
teacher had predicted he would be an artist 
im glad she didnt say someday youll be in the louvre 
because i would have been nervous for 60 years waiting for it he 
said the decorative arts museum is in the northern wing of the 
louvre palace not actually part of the main museum 
the show is sure to please snoopy lovers born in 1950 he is a 
dreamer and a gourmet a heartwarming mix of fun deadpan wit and 
even sarcasm when dealing with his master charlie brown lucy and 
the other peanuts characters who are much less familiar to 
french audiences than snoopy himself 
at the show children can catch up on old strips in a special 
reading corner watch snoopy videos or listen to snoopys music 
recorded by several leading american jazz musicians 
the highlight of the exhibit is snoopy as a chic chien 300 
stuffed versions of the beagle and his sister belle dressed by 
the worlds leading fashion designers including chanel christian 
lacroix hermes and georgio armani 
youngsters are invited to design their own outfit for snoopy 
and the winner will receive a giant stuffed beagle 
original peanuts drawings in the show came from schulzs 
vault in santa rosa calif other items are from schulzs private 
collection including commemorative plates and souvenirs from the 
apollo 10 mission in 1969 when the command module was named charlie 
brown and the lunar module was named snoopy 
after paris the show will travel to japans mitsukoshi 
department store in toyko and the los angeles country museum of 
natural history 
asked how snoopy is facing up to 40 schulz said he stays in 
good shape and hell be better than ever

jury room after entering the courthouse under tight security the 
38yearold former model said nothing as she entered or left the 
building through the back door 
amid the political maneuvering barry flew south on monday and 
checked into a substance abuse treatment center in west palm beach 
fla to be treated for alcoholism according to his spokeswoman 
lurma rackley

the associate who insisted on anonymity 
ron richardson president of the local chapter of the hotel and 
restaurant workers aflcio said he met with a variety of community 
activists and organizers about mounting a draftjackson campaign 
we are going to plead with him to submerge his personal 
interests and help heal this city which is what we need right 
now richardson said my indications are that people that ive 
been talking to labor leaders ministers others are 
overwhelmingly in favor of trying to get jackson in the race 
eric easter jacksons press secretary said the former 
democratic presidential hopeful has been ill in bed since returning 
to washington on saturday and has met with no one regarding a 
mayoral draft campaign 
jacksons move to washington in april 1989 fueled rumors that he 
would run for mayor but jackson has repeatedly said he would never 
oppose barry a friend and former civil rights colleague 
early surveys of public sentiment gave jackson a wide lead over 
all other potential contenders including barry 
a local political organizer said 20 labor leaders business 
officials and political activists from this heavily democratic town 
met for more than four hours on sunday to discuss a jackson 
candidacy 
when the meeting was over 14 of those present said their 
companies or groups would be willing to woo jackson while three 
others said they would support his candidacy if he enters the race 
said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity

possession of crack cocaine he said sunday he would take steps to 
heal my body mind and soul barry who did not specifically 
refer to a drug or alcohol problem in his remarks did not speak to 
reporters as he left home monday accompanied by his wife effi she 
later left florida 
barrys plans to announce his candidacy sunday for a fourth term 
as mayor of the nations capital were abruptly canceled he tested 
positive for cocaine in blood and urine tests administered after 
his arrest officials said 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks said monday after

officials for selective enforcement of the law

sixteen of the 24 tenured musicians of the 
minneapolis chamber symphony have quit after abstaining from voting 
on a contract proposal

any concerts the orchestra usually plays with 26 musicians 
weve got a rolodex full of people who want to audition for 
this orchestra he said we anticipate well have musicians of 
as good or better caliber 
concerning the boards threat to shut down the orchestra 
coughlin said it wasnt a threat against any specific musicians 
but a statement that we had to get moving on this thing we have a 
concert in two weeks 
the boards threat to sue the union concerned whether the 
artistic committee would have hiring and firing power of the music 
director he said 
the musicians who quit said the contract violates union bylaws 
including provisions for donated services and broadcast recordings 
they also objected to being barred from board meetings and the 
refusal of the board to divulge financial information

three american college teachers mark 
their third year as hostages of shiite moslem kidnappers wednesday 
and there is little hope they or 15 other westerners missing in 
lebanon will be freed soon 
lebanese police and intelligence officials said they had no new 
information about alann steen robert polhill and jesse turner 
they were abducted jan 24 1987 from the campus of the 
usaffiliated beirut university college in moslem west beirut by 
gunmen dressed as policemen 
the hostage held longest also is an american terry a anderson 
42 chief middle east correspondent of the associated press who 
was seized by shiite gunmen march 16 1985 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine a group believed 
loyal to iran claimed responsibility for abducting the teachers 
a fourth teacher kidnapped from the campus mithileshwar singh 
an indian national with resident alien status in the united states 
was released oct 3 1988 
steen 50 taught journalism at the college polhill 55 was 
assistant professor of business and a lecturer in accounting and 
turner 42 was a visiting professor of mathematics and computer 
science 
we all feel humiliated that our uniforms were used in such 
a crime a police officer said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
he said police were not in a position to make any move with 
regard to the hostages most of whom are believed held gangs 
affiliated with hezbollah a fundamentalist shiite group loyal to 
iran 
the hostages are not just a security case theyre a political 
case the officer said foreign nations are involved 
his apparent reference was to iran and the home countries of the 
hostages the 18 include eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss citizens an irishman and an italian 
a shiite source familiar with efforts to free the hostages said 
any settlement must await the outcome of the power struggle 
in iran between hardliners and the faction led by president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
rafsanjai is believed to favor releasing the hostages as part of 
his attempt to improve relations with the west and secure foreign 
funds to help rebuild after eight years of war with iraq 
on the other side are radicals led by former interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi who is fervently antiwestern and helped 
establish hezbollah in the early 1980s 
hezbollah has split into prorafsanjani and promohtashemi 
factions but the shiite source said the groups holding hostages 
obey mohtashemi 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine has accused the 
three teachers of spying for the united states and israel and 
offered to exchange them for 400 arab prisoners held in israel 
israel refused to negotiate and the united states has said it 
will not insist the israelis do so 
a year after the kidnapping the captors appeared to ease their 
conditions offering in a statement to free the three hostages if 
the united states declared support for the palestinian uprising in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
when singh was released the kidnappers provided a photograph 
that showed steen polhill and turner saying goodbye to him

many people are scared to vacation in 
mississippi because they belive the magnolia state has long 
stretches of unpaved highways and a boss hog legal system a 
study found 
i was shocked that people actually feared for their safety 
said j mac holladay executive director of the mississippi 
department of economic and community development 
they think that boss hogg is around every corner holladay 
said monday referring to a corrupt character in the television 
series dukes of hazzard set in the rural south there is a 
pervasive fear of southern justice he said at the governors 
conference on tourism here 
the results of the study commissioned by the development agency 
to guide tourism planning didnt surprise ann woods owner of the 
mount holly bed and breakfast on lake washington near greenville 
she told of a new york lawyer and his wife who visited the 
delta she was frightened the whole time and she was from new 
york city woods said 
holladay said while he expected the study to reveal negatives 
the problems are certainly different than what i thought other 
problems included fear of widespread poverty and of unfriendly 
people and no knowledge of the states tourism resources 
a common attitude toward traveling in mississippi is get 
through that state as fast as you can holladay told about 200 
representatives of the states tourism industry all state roads 
and highways in the state are paved 
northerners feel especially unwelcome the study showed some 
visitors will not give where theyre from out of fear holladay

states tourism industry conducted by davidsonpeterson associates 
the company conducted indepth discussions with groups of people in 
memphis and chicago who had no intention of traveling to 
mississippi company president tom davidson said

black leader nelson mandela 
may be asked to mediate between the government and the outlawed 
african national congress after his release from prison the 
justice minister said tuesday 
in an interview with the governing national partys newspaper 
justice minister kobie coetsee the question no longer was whether 
the 71yearold anc leader would be freed but when and under 
what circumstances 
coetsee was reacting to intense speculation that mandela will be 
freed within weeks but he gave no hints about a date president 
fw de klerk is expected to elaborate in a speech opening 
parliament on feb 2 
the cabinet holds its first meeting of the year wednesday in 
cape town and likely will discuss mandelas release as well as the 
possible lifting of the 30year ban on the anc 
in downtown cape town scores of black and mixedrace youths 
went on a rampage tuesday after police used rubber bullets tear 
gas and a water cannon to disperse more than 5000 students 
protesting government education policies police had placed rolls 
of barbed wire along the intended protest route and rejected 
organizers requests to allow the march to proceed 
youths threw stones through windows and overturned trash cans as 
they fled from police some protesters were hurt when the water 
cannons spray knocked them into barbed wire and at least one 
youth was arrested 
another demonstration occurred inside a luxury hotel in 
johannesburgs northern suburbs when more than 200 black employees 
of the sandton sun paraded through the lobby and on escalators 
protesting the presence of an english cricket team on a 
boycottbreaking tour of south africa 
coetsee in his interview with the nationalist said the 
government had decided to free mandela in accordance with its 
policy of south africa first and not because of international 
pressure 
he said mandela was willing to serve as mediator between the 
government and the anc which has waged a bombing and sabotage 
campaign since 1961 aimed at undermining white domination 
it could be be expected that the government is considering mr 
mandela for this role of mediator coetsee said 
mandela the most popular leader among south africas blacks is 
serving a life term for planning the start of the anc sabotage 
campaign he has met regularly in recent months with government and 
opposition leaders 
the ancs exiled leaders at a conference last week expressed 
interest in negotiations but said the government must meet its 
preconditions these include mandelas release lifting of bans on 
the anc and other opposition groups lifting of the state of 
emergency imposed in 1986 and a halt to political trials 
beeld a progovernment johannesburg newspaper said tuesday 
that mandelas release would be accompanied by legalization of the 
anc however beeld said the government would not release jailed 
anc members convicted of violent crimes 
de klerk received a report this week on the security situation 
from top security officials to help him consider the timing of 
reforms police commanders said the ancs guerrilla campaign is 
subsiding an indication the government might lift or ease the 
state of emergency 
de klerk has said he wants to remove obstacles in the way of 
talks with the anc which has the largest following of any black 
political organization he is expected to outline plans for reform 
when parliament convenes next month 
de klerk has invited black leaders to negotiate a new 
constitution that would extend political rights to the 28 million 
blacks but the president envisions a system in which the 5 million 
whites would maintain some form of veto over major decisions 
the times of london in a dispatch from johannesburg reported 
tuesday it was possible mandela would propose an interim period of 
black and white power sharing before a final shift to the 
oneperson onevote system that the anc long has advocated

srinagar is the heart of the separatist movement in this 
northern region where militants like ahmed and hamid want to cast 
off rule by predominantly hindu india in favor of independence or 
union with their islamic neighbor pakistan 
the city of 1 million people has been under an aroundtheclock 
curfew since saturday except for a few hours tuesday to try to 
halt escalating attacks by the militants government troops have 
been authorized to shoot curfew violators on sight 
this is our holy war said ahmed 23 who gave up his 
college studies to join the guerrilla struggle there is no 
question of a truce the battle has begun and will end with our 
victory 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan in 1947 when the two countries were partitioned upon 
becoming independent from britain srinagar and the surrounding 
region became part of indias jammukashmir state the only state 
in india with a moslem majority 
nationwide moslems are only 12 percent of indias 880 million 
people but they are 64 percent of jammukashmirs population of 5 
million 
the movement for autonomy is nothing new in kashmir but we 
have to admit that today it appears it has come to a point of no 
return said sabir hussain a state information officer 
ignoring the presence of an estimated 10000 federal troops 
moslem snipers moved across rooftops on monday a paramilitary 
policeman wounded by sniper fire was stoned to death by a mob 
before the latest flareup the militants had already imposed 
their strict interpretations of the koran the holy book of the 
islamic faith 
restaurants and hotels stopped serving liquor in the kashmir 
valley which attracted 500000 indian and foreign tourists in 
1988 women were ordered to wear burkhas the allenveloping 
headtotoe veils discotheques and beauty parlors closed 
we have been told that all these things are against islam and 
ordered to stop said yogi raina a hotel manager 
the entire valley is under the process of observing strict 
islamic codes said a carpet dealer one of the few hindus left 
in the business in srinagar on condition of anonymity there is 
nothing we can do about it 
a new organization called the tigers of god issued threats last 
month to anyone who failed to follow islamic codes 
tiger leader noor khan led his guerrillas on a raid of hotel and 
restaurant bars smashing liquor bottles according to people who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
srinagars 10 cinemas and hundreds of video rental stores closed 
after receiving bomb threats so did beauty parlors 
frightened storekeepers dumped loads of playing cards in garbage 
heaps next to their shops to show the militants they are no longer 
selling items that can be used for gambling 
it will be wrong to say the situation is out of control 
said jagmohan who was appointed governor of jammukashmir state 
last week by the federal government 
you ask if things may have gone beyond repair maybe correct 
maybe not correct but try to understand that it is handful of 
people the rest do not want violence said jagmohan a hindu who 
uses only one name and has a reputation as a nononsense 
administrator 
but if the mood and scenes in the city are any indication many 
people believe independence is possible 
like me every day new holy warriors are born in kashmir 
said firdous ahmed the guerrilla he said excesses by indian 
troops such as firing on curfewbreaking crowds were spawning new 
converts to the militants cause 
jagmohan the state governor denied the charge of excesses 
it is propaganda just to raise the passion of the people he 
said 
abdul hamid who left his carpet business to join the 
guerrillas said the militants had enough arms ammunition and 
fighters to carry on their jihad or islamic holy war 
when people are with you you just need 100 guns to silence 
even a mighty army he said

three newspapers and the associated 
press filed papers opposing exxon corp attempts to keep secret 
most evidence gathered in more than 150 lawsuits arising from the 
nations worst oil spill 
exxon and other defendants arguing that vital trade secrets 
could be revealed in cases that might never go to trial asked a 
state court in december for an order barring pretrial disclosure of 
virtually anything learned during discovery the evidencegathering 
phase of a lawsuit 
in a response monday a lawyer for the wall street journal los 
angeles times anchorage daily news and the ap countered that exxon 
and the other defendants merely want to hide a variety of 
embarrassing details about the march 24 wreck of the exxon valdez 
a secrecy order could prevent the public from learning exactly 
what caused the disaster or why efforts to contain and clean up 
more than 10 million gallons of crude oil from prince william sound 
failed 
the public spectacle of what happened in prince william sound 
last spring and the defendants ensuing conduct raises serious 
questions about the credibility of the defendants said anchorage 
lawyer d john mackay 
there is every reason to worry that defendants are inclined to 
excessive secrecy and lack of candor mackay wrote in a 48page 
brief filed in anchorage superior court where more than 150 
lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial motions and discovery 
an attorney for exxon disputed those arguments today that 
contradicts the fundamental issues of privacy issues the papers 
are insistent upon when it comes to their own files pat lynch 
said in los angeles 
the orders proposed will expedite resolution of these cases 
and ultimately give the public full and complete access to the 
grounding and to all issues relevant to this case with the 
protections everyone is entitled to have lynch said 
mackay said he filed a similar brief today in federal court 
where a parallel case is progressing 
mackay argued that a protective order would infringe upon the 
first amendment in a case with national implications it would 
preclude a fisherman or processor from talking with the press or 
with his or her congressman or an environmental organization from 
talking to its members or a research scientist about information 
learned through the formal or informal discovery process 
acknowledging that true trade secrets need to be protected 
mackay said requests for protective orders should be evaluated on a 
documentbydocument basis 
in requesting the blanket protective order exxon asserted that 
while individual documents might not contain any trade secrets 
taken in the aggregate they could give competitors an inside look 
at the companys operations 
marnie isaacs a spokeswoman for the other main defendant 
alyeska pipeline co said the materials reviewed during discovery 
should be protected until the court decides they can be entered as 
evidence 
we rely on the courts judgment to balance the interest of the 
litigants with those of the public isaacs said 
alyeska is owned by seven oil companies including exxon that 
own the transalaska oil pipeline and pump about 2 million barrels 
of oil a day to the valdez tanker terminals and into tankers the 
exxon valdez was loaded there 
plaintiffs include fishermen tourism companies environmental 
groups and the state of alaska which wants to prove exxon and 
alyeska were negligent in preparing for and responding to the spill

pope john paul ii travels to 
africa for the sixth time to focus attention on one of the worlds 
poorest regions a decade after his first visit to subsaharan 
africa 
when the pontiff arrives in cape verde on thursday to begin his 
eightday fivenation trip he will be welcomed by a country of 
roman catholics living in peace and relative prosperity 
but this 10island nation is not typical of the region john 
paul will face the more familiar african problems of poverty 
hunger disease war and political instability in his visits to 
guineabissau mali burkina faso and chad 
the visit comes 10 years after the pope during a stop in 
burkina faso made an impassioned appeal for saving the region from 
hunger drought and encroaching deserts 
his plea led to the creation of the john paul ii foundation for 
the sahel which sponsors health and agricultural projects in the 
region 
it is the 45th foreign tour of john pauls 11yearold papacy 
he made his fifth trip to africa last spring visiting four 
southern african countries and plans another african swing later 
this year 
cape verde a former portuguese colony lying in the atlantic 
ocean about 300 miles west of senegal has the highest percentage 
of catholics of any african country about 90 percent of the 
population of 350000 
ferry boats will transport the faithful from outlying islands 
and officials expect at least 50000 to attend the papal mass on 
praias quebra canela beach 
the government of president aristides pereira has spent 600000 
to widen roads for the procession leading to an hillside platform 
above quebra canela and the harbor which is already being decked 
with posters and banners 
the country is very poor but there is no famine and the people 
are relatively well fed the country has flourished thanks to open 
economic policies massive foreign aid remittances from emigrants 
tourism and isolation from regional conflicts 
but when the pope arrives saturday in guineabissau another 
former portuguese colony he enters one of africas problem zones 
guineabissau sandwiched between senegal and guineaconakry on 
the atlantic coast is one of the worlds 15 poorest countries 
many of its 940000 people are reliant on international aid to keep 
them above subsistence level 
bissaus dusty unpaved streets are home to skinny children 
chickens goats and pigs health facilities are poor and dependent 
on foreign assistance the pontiff on sunday is to visit cumura 
hospital for leprosy the disease is one of the nations main 
scourges 
only 7 percent of guineans profess catholicism moslems make up 
about a third of the population and more than 50 percent are 
animists 
according to joao quintino director of the state newspaper no 
pintcha a recent border dispute with senegal will not stop 
thousands of senegalese catholics from crossing into bissau for the 
papal mass 
on saturday the ruling council of state announced it freed 16 
people convicted of plotting a 1985 coup to overthrow president 
joao bernardo vieira six others convicted in the same conspiracy 
were executed by firing squad in july 1986 despite pleas for 
clemency from the pope and other international figures 
political observers in guineabissau said the amnesty was 
decreed so the west african nation would have no political 
prisoners when john paul arrives 
the church in mali established only 102 years ago counts about 
75000 catholics in the predominantly moslem nation of 8 million 
people 
mali ranks as one of the five poorest nations in the world with 
an average life expectancy of 45 years 
the pope is expected to call for reconciliation in chad whose 
30 years of independence from france have been marred by civil war 
and fighting with neighboring libya the ndjamena cathedral was 
bombed during fighting in 197980 and has been restored 
on aug 31 president hissene habres government signed an 
accord with libya aimed at ending 16 years of hostilities

a sculpture intended to challenge 
perceptions of the corporate ladder has offended office building 
tenants who want the artwork dismantled and removed from their 
lobby 
the corporate ladder features a mailman at the foot of the 
ladder a young black man in a business suit near the bottom and a 
woman holding the papers of a middleaged white man grasping a 
briefcase on a middle rung on the top rung is an older grinning 
balding white man 
sculptor ed massey 26 who spent 3 months building the 18foot 
sculpture with the help of seven assistants said it is a social 
commentary on corporate life 
many of the 35 corporate tenants of lakeview office building 
disagree saying they find the depiction of the woman and black man 
insulting 
mark feinberg president of consumer first mortgage whose 
firstfloor office looks out at the sculpture complained in 
writing to the building manager that the sculpture shows the 
business world as mean cruel thoughtless and selfish he said 
he found it distasteful and personally offensive 
some tenants have put up posters suggesting that the sculpture 
is in the lobby because the building owners couldnt find pink 
flamingoes for the lawn said nanette wright who manages the 
building 
other tenants such as padraic kennedy president of the 
columbia association say the work is a fascinating piece that is 
bold and dramatic and meant to be satirical 
the uproar has led to the cancellation of a reception planned 
next month for massey of new york city building officials now 
plan to survey the tenants on whether to keep the artwork 
ed masseys intention was to challenge the thinking of 
peoples perception of the corporate ladder said ronald c 
hanser spokesman for principal financial group of des moines 
iowa which owns the building and commissioned the sculpture 
its our policy to decorate our buildings in an attractive way 
with pieces of art 
massey said he was disappointed that the sculpture might be 
removed but noted it might be better suited to another location 
maybe the sculpture will serve the purpose of educating people 
in columbia about art he said

featherylight fabrics and skinbaring styles 
pepped up the runways tuesday as designers revealed their happy 
holiday haute couture clothes for summer 
the day was a triumph for emanuel ungaro who has been totally 
seduced by a light new look hes simplified his feminine styles to 
essentials using gossamer fabrics and stunning colors to display 
his talents 
this is great news for his fans who found some of his recent 
shows overloaded with showoff trimmings and superfluous details 
cest la vie ungaro smiled after the show when asked if his 
recent marriage had been an influence on his fashion the 
italianborn couturier long a paris fixture married laura fanfani 
in november they are expecting a baby 
ungaros new looks started off with neatly fitted raw silk suits 
in shades of bordeaux and chrome yellow followed by bi and 
tricolored light gabardine suits with swirling details in shades 
from violet pink and orange to khaki and some peacock blues 
i was aiming for the elegance of my old master balenciaga 
said ungaro 
his remarkable daytime looks included satinlined short cashmere 
coats in sizzling colors topping some beautifully cut and draped 
short crepe dresses 
when it came to dressier clothes ungaro followed through 
beautifully his slinky short silk shifts in all colors topped by 
floaty mousseline squares were perfect in their understatement 
of course ungaro had to have some fun with rich fabrics he 
used plenty of heavy guipure lace draped lame floral fabrics and 
sequined brocaded jackets or blouses to haute couture advantage 
karl lagerfeld also had a light touch in his show for chanel 
which won warm praise from the fashion crowd 
the abbreviated styles were resolutely younger than ever they 
were so short and sweet they looked apt for the junior miss set 
lagerfeld continued some of his past chanel ideas for instance 
the shortie jacket over legs alone became a sort of pretty 
coatdress this time and in fact was cut sexily like a tulip it 
could be worn with a halfskirt or a puff of chiffon 
these lolitas often paraded down the runway in long amazon 
or fitted riding jackets with deep decolletes there were all kinds 
of couture details black velvet cuffs and lapels on the softest of 
pinks black and white raffia piping on many jackets and skirts 
graphic geometric patterns embroidered on a white minicoat 
to end it all in grand style lagerfeld brought out an array of 
shortlong evening gowns bathed in clouds of chiffon sometimes 
combined with elaborate guipure lace 
louis feraud turned out a smashing collection of bright 
beautiful clothes showing the creator from the south of france in 
top form he led off with a garden party of emerald and violet 
leafembroidered short suits with scoop necks setting a sunny tone 
everything was bright and wearable even the full iridescent 
taffeta gardenparty gowns in shades of goldred with tucks at 
bustier and hemline 
feraud had lots to put anybody in a good mood sportive women 
might like the emerald and black grosgrain blazer over a pleated 
light satin emerald short skirt 
a woman dressing for paris would like the ivory white suits with 
a black sunray yoke effect at the neck of a boxy jacket the 
broadstriped pastel linens would be winners for all kinds of 
summer moments 
an ebullient feraud turned out a rainbow of pastels in crepe 
dresses cut in arabesques or swirls topped by huge chiffon shawls 
it was down to the sea for the end of the show with a gorgeous 
line of sequined mermaid flapper dresses and prints in funny fish 
motifs 
all was light and lovely at philippe venet who turned out his 
usual superb couture looks this time sexier and more colorful 
than ever 
not known to the masses venet is one of the rare couturiers who 
owns his own business and makes a living by serving up custommade 
couture to a faithful clientele 
he led off with lean raw silk outfits piped in satin perhaps a 
strapless dress and fitted jacket in bordeaux and coral setting the 
tone for the clothes that followed he featured some particularly 
marvelous suits scooping out many necklines to daring decolletes 
the palette was lovely and full of warm tones like tangerine 
peach almond green lilac and tender pink but one shouldnt 
forget the incomparably lovely iridescent satin and taffeta short 
evening dresses with their huge bows and jeweled touches 
angelo tarlazzi the italianborn couturier at guy laroche since 
the designer died last year went south of the border for his 
inspiration some suggest he should have stayed there since the 
blouson toppers over narrow minis or ample peasant dresses with 
stitched details looked more like readytowear than couture 
not even the transparent chiffontopped evening wear had enough 
distinction to give the show cachet

many blacks want william lozano to spend a long 
time behind bars for the deaths of two unarmed young black men that 
sparked riots a year ago but the policemans backers hope to 
persuade a judge to let him stay free 
dade circuit judge joseph farina was scheduled to sentence 
lozano 31 on two counts of manslaughter wednesday 
the suspended officer free on 10000 bond faces from 12 to 17 
years in prison under state sentencing guidelines but could serve 
anything from probation to the maximum penalty of 45 years in 
prison 
defense attorneys say they plan to file an appeal immediately 
upon sentencing 
the only just sentence is one that does not cause him to be 
placed into prison and allows him to remain free on bond pending 
the resolution of his appeal said lawyer mark seiden who 
represents lozano to imprison him would be a total travesty and 
miscarriage of justice 
lozano having no criminal background before the onduty 
killings almost certainly would stay free during the appeal lead 
prosecutor john hogan said 
hogan said his sentencing recommendation would be influenced by 
potential aggravating factors including the amount of remorse and 
the officers candor on the stand 
although lozano was a highly commended officer hogan said 
we have to do a balancing somewhere and obviously two young 
people are dead 
motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 was shot and killed while being 
chased by police jan 16 1989 his passenger 24yearold allan 
blanchard died later from injuries sustained when the motorcycle 
crashed 
the deaths led to miamis fourth major outbreak of racial strife 
in the 1980s all linked to police incidents involving blacks 
acquittals of white policemen accused of killing blacks twice 
sparked violence 
miami had no problems when lozano was convicted dec 7 police 
did not anticipate any trouble after the sentencing and made no 
plans to mobilize the entire force as was done prior to the 
verdict 
were not doing anything differently said miami police 
spokesman angelo bitsis its going to be a normal operation 
the streets of overtown a mostly black area where the shooting 
occurred were filled with dancing and celebration after the 
verdict the judicial system had finally worked for them many 
blacks said but the highprofile case didnt end there 
many blacks have called for colombianborn lozano to receive the 
stiffest penalty possible 
i dont know if he should get life said clemon gardner 
but i think he should pay for the crime 
there also has been a groundswell of support for lozano 
especially from the hispanic community and fellow officers some of 
whom wore black wristbands in solidarity with the convicted officer 
carlos lopez station manager for colombianoriented wocnam 
said that thousands of letters had been received urging the judge 
not to send lozano to jail the station also collected some 40000 
for lozanos defense lopez said 
and lozanos defense attorneys say theyve collected more than 
10000 signatures from people urging the judge to free the officer 
while he waits out his appeal 
the sentencing in the emotionally charged case has brought the 
court numerous pieces of mail but not thousands said betty 
pottenger secretary for farina 
ive never seen anything like this she said but its a 
highinterest case and theres been that kind of outpouring from 
the community 
the miami times a weekly aimed at black readers said in a 
recent editorial that the highprofile support of lozano by some 
police officers was keeping the racial flames burning and stoking 
the fires of revenge while throwing a damper on the possibilities 
for reconciliation 
it added remorse seems the furthest thing from lozanos 
mind and theirs and when remorse is absent from a criminals 
behavior the full force of the law is expected 
willie sims crisis coordinator for the dade county community 
relations board said feelings about the sentencing are more mixed 
than they appear 
ive had numerous colombians tell me this guy should never be 
on the police force again but they cant come out publicly and say 
it said sims you have a segment of the black community 
calling for the maximum others are willing to take into 
consideration he was a city of miami officer and perhaps he made an 
error and theyre willing to go along with whatever the judge 
gives out

pentagon officials conceded today the military 
was wrong in claiming 50 pounds of powdery material found at a 
house used by deposed panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega was 
cocaine 
they were unable to say what the substance was but said it was 
not the makings of tamales as reported in todays editions of the 
washington post 
what was initially suspected to be cocaine was not said lt 
col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman it was some other 
type of powdery material he later described it as some kind of 
bonding material such as glue 
asked about the report that the substance was tamales schneider 
said i see absolutely no such connection or relationship 
another pentagon spokesman bob hall said clearly the guys 
who first saw this stuff did not know what cocaine was when the 
experts checked they said it wasnt 
in retrospect he added probably you shouldnt be announcing 
something i dont know how this was announced you need to be 
very careful obviously 
hall said he could not identify what the substance actually was 
that he had been supplied with less than satisfactory 
information by us military officials in panama 
the day after the dec 20 us invasion reporters were shown a 
socalled witch house that was said to have been frequented by 
noriega col mike snell the officer in charge of the area said 
some 50 pounds of cocaine had been found there along with voodoo 
paraphernalia 
people are making a very thorough investigation of all the 
evidence that theyve discovered hall said 
in a dispatch from panama city panama the post quoted military 
and civilian officials as saying that although 450 kilos of cocaine 
and assorted other drugs have been seized since us troops invaded 
panama on dec 20 none could be directly linked to noriega 
it was just a mistake in the confusion of the moment the 
post quoted a us officer in panama as saying of the earlier 
report the officer was not identified 
noriega is awaiting trial in miami on federal drugtrafficking 
and racketeering charges

a judge said tuesday the washington post had 
fabricated a report that 800 people have been imprisoned for taking 
part in the june prodemocracy protests 
the unidentified supreme court judge quoted by the official 
xinhua news agency also said posts beijingbased correspondent 
daniel southerland had fabricated information that 10000 people 
had been arrested and that new suspects were being picked up for 
joining the prodemocracy movement 
the post said it stood by the reports 
the story involving the arrests was published in july another 
published last week quoted communist party sources as saying that 
many of the 800 people sentenced had received prison terms of 10 
years on charges such as revealing state secrets disseminating 
counterrevolutionary propaganda or destroying state property 
the story came as the government announced it had released 573 
people detained during the bloody crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in june 
an official report called their release proof of the 
governments lenient treatment toward those who repented their 
crimes 
the judges criticism came three days after the government 
announced new regulations restricting the activities of foreign 
journalists and banning them from making reports it believes 
distort the facts violators face warnings or the loss of 
accreditation 
the judge also said the post had deliberately twisted chinese 
law in saying that counterrevolutionary crimes in china are so 
broadly defined that the state can imprison anyone who criticizes 
the communist party or party leaders 
mike getler the posts assistant managing editor for foreign 
news dismissed the criticism 
southerland is the senior us newspaper correspondent in 
china hes been there five years and we have great confidence in 
his reporting and his authoritativeness and no reason to back away 
from these stories getler said the attack on southerlands 
reporting by chinese authorities contains no actual evidence to 
discredit his reports the initial story on roughly 10000 people 
detained or arrested appeared last july quite some time ago and 
was attributed to chinese sources with access to communist party 
documents 
the judge said hostile forces abroad are not pleased with 
chinas current political and social stability and the improvement 
in chineseamerican relations so they distort reality in china 
in an attempt to mislead the public 
chinese sources and foreign observers agree that thousands of 
people were arrested throughout the country following the june 34 
military crackdown on prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
the sources say large numbers of the detained remain in prison 
without access to legal advice cut off from their families and not 
knowing if or when formal charges will be filed against them 
the judge quoted by xinhua denied widely circulated claims of 
secret trials and executions saying cases from the antigovernment 
riots did not involve national secrecy and thus were tried openly

president ali abdullah saleh left for 
washington on tuesday for the first us visit by a north yemeni 
leader and is expected to bring up allegations that israel has a 
new military base in the red sea 
saleh will meet with president bush later this week 
saleh also is to brief bush about efforts to unify capitalist 
north yemen with south yemen the only marxist nation in the arab 
world 
israel and ethiopia the only nonarab nations on the red sea 
restored diplomatic ties last year and arab diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said there is concern about growing 
cooperation between the countries 
arab newspapers and some arab politicians have said that 
ethiopia is leasing israel an island in the strategic bab almandab 
strait for a military base the reports have not been independently 
confirmed and israel does not comment on such military matters 
north yemen and south yemen are hosts to units of palestinian 
fighters who pulled out of lebanon during israels invasion in 1982 
north yemen and other arab powers on the red sea led by saudi 
arabia have voiced concern over an israeli military presence on 
their southern flanks 
the diplomats said saleh also is expected to press bush to 
restore diplomatic relations with sovietbacked south yemen 
washington broke off ties in 1969 and the diplomats said the 
united states is expected to refuse the request until it is 
convinced that south yemen does not support terrorism 
south yemen is one of six countries the united states has 
accused of international terrorism and placed under an economic 
boycott the others are libya cuba north korea syria and iran 
south yemen strategically placed at the tip of the arabian 
peninsula provides a major naval base for the soviets in the 
indian ocean 
us officials have been in contact with south yemen since it 
took the lead of other sovietbacked countries and began leaning 
toward reform 
the reform efforts also have given momentum to unification of 
north yemen and south yemen 
the countries have been working for unity for more than a decade 
despite differences in ideology 
in their latest step they began allowing citizens to move 
freely between the nations on monday 
the north yemeni capital of sana has been designated as the 
capital for the united country and both nations have agreed to 
prepare a joint constitution for a referendum by nov 30 
the us agency for international development has pumped about 
400 million into north yemen in the past two decades for 
agriculture education health and other programs 
the united states also has given north yemen 539 million to 
help reequip several infantry battalions including 400 million 
in weapons rushed in to help the nation in border clashes with 
south yemen in the mid1970s

president bush today attacked the 
anticrime bill sponsored by the democratic chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee calling it a sheep in wolfs clothing that 
would make life harder for crimefighters 
bush criticized the rival anticrime bill of sen joseph biden 
ddel after touring an innercity kansas city neighborhood and 
meeting with residents who have banded together to drive out drug 
dealers 
afterward in a speech prepared for an audience of law 
enforcement officials bush urged congress to pass the rest of his 
own anticrime strategy 
congress which returned today from a twomonth recess did 
enact much of the presidents anticrime initiative last november 
voting to spend 42 billion to expand federal prison capacity 
hire more prosecutors and federal agents and take other measures in 
the war on crime that was 500 million more than bush had asked 
for according to the senate judiciary committee 
bush is still pressing for passage of the rest of his anticrime 
package including tougher sentencing for hardened criminals 
restrictions on plea bargaining and the death penalty for drug 
dealers who kill police 
bush said he wants to back up our new lawmen with new laws 
laws that are fair fast and final including an exclusionary 
rule designed to protect the truth and punish the guilty and not 
good cops who have acted in good faith 
bushs bill would allow goodfaith exceptions even if no warrant 
were issued for a search later deemed illegal under the current 
exclusionary rule prosecutors may not use evidence gathered in an 
illegal search 
the president said he also wants habeas corpus reforms to stop 
the frivolous appeals that are choking the courts and 
constitutionally sound death penalty provisions 
but today theres another bill a trojan horse standing at 
the gates of congress bush said of bidens bill it looks like 
a real crime bill but in actuality it will be tougher on law 
enforcement than on criminals 
america needs a crime bill with teeth but this is a sheep in 
wolfs clothing the president said 
biden was in chicago and not immediately available for comment 
a judiciary committee aide who asked not to be identified said 
bidens legislation mirrors bushs in many respects but would ban 
racially discriminatory executions and allow goodfaith 
exceptions to the exclusionary rule only if the illegal search was 
conducted with a warrant 
bidens bill would also ban the assembly sale or transfer of 
assault weapons bush has banned the import of assault weapons 
in addition bidens measure would beef up the federal effort to 
stop international money laundering and block a proposed 
reorganization at the justice department 
elsewhere in his speech the president touted his antidrug 
program saying our national drug strategy calls for record 
levels of new funding for both education and treatment he did 
not offer a dollar amount 
earlier asked on air force one if he intended to bash 
congress bush replied im continuing to extend he hand to 
congress were just beginning this session were renewing 
the spirit of cooperation 
the president called house leaders from kansas city to 
congratulate them on the opening of the second session of the 101st 
congress i intend to operate in a cooperative spirit there is a 
lot we can do together this year i wish you the very best he 
said 
before the speech bush visited a onetime crack house here and 
met at the metropolitan missionary baptist church with members of 
the ad hoc group against crime a grassroots group formed in 1977 
by citizens alarmed by a series of unsolved drugrelated murders 
the president was accompanied by national drug policy 
coordinator william bennett and attorney general dick thornburgh 
as well as members of the missouri congressional delegation he 
left the church for a walk through a drugprone neighborhood 
bush has said nothing other than very sad about the arrest 
last week of district of columbia mayor marion barry on a 
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge by fbi undercover agents 
but naacp executive director benjamin hooks said monday after 
meeting with bush that to many blacks it appears the barry arrest 
was part of a pattern of singling out elected black officials for 
harassment 
attorney general dick thornburgh emphatically denied that 
government prosecutors have targeted black officials and said it 
would be intolerable if they did 
hooks interviewed on cbs this morning said i did not 
say and am not saying it is a justice department plot to single 
out black office holders for prosecution but he said there is a 
widespread perception that may be difficult to prove that 
blacks are being harassed 
hooks said the perception had been fueled by inquiries into the 
affairs of black mayors david dinkins of new york thomas bradley 
of los angeles coleman young of detroit and richard arrington of 
birmingham ala 
bush thornburgh and fbi director william sessions met with 
hooks and 16 other naacp officials to hear firsthand their account 
of mail bombs and threats directed against the civil rights 
organization 
the naacp leaders said thornburgh indicated there were some 
movements toward tracking the bombs that claimed the life of an 
alabama federal judge and a savannah ga civil rights lawyer

hugo victims said lee ann barrett a spokeswoman for the 
organizations charleston chapter 
mr marsh is a symbol of all the millions of people who have 
sent in anonymous donations ms zellem said the large gifts 
are really impressive but its really touching when we received

discovered they had been sent by marsh his identity was learned

community

space officials postponed japans first 
unmanned mission to the moon just 18 seconds before liftoff 
tuesday but said they will try again wednesday if they can fix a 
technical problem 
this time we are going to the moon but our objective is not 
the moon itself said mission chief hiroki matsuo our 
institute is getting into interplanetary missions in the 1990s and 
for that we need to refine our technology 
officials said they plan to try again wednesday after they 
correct the problem that forced the delay a failure in the 
hydraulic control system used to move the nozzle of a booster 
rocket 
i dont think it is a serious problem matsuo said at the 
oceanside launch site in southern japan 
if the hydraulic system is repaired the launch is expected at 
846 pm wednesday 646 am est wednesday 
a successful flight would make japan the third country after 
the soviet union and the united states to orbit the moon 
though the spacecraft failed to blast off on schedule its 
mission and japans broad goals in space make clear that this 
country is trying to be a strong competitor in space technology 
the united states has complained in trade disputes that japan is 
discriminating against us commercial satellites to help build its 
own space industry japans government space budget in 1989 was 
106 billion 
the mission received little advance publicity in japan and 
tuesdays countdown was not shown live on television 
dozens of reporters had gathered on a dark hillside several 
miles from the oceanside launch site to watch the liftoff 
if the mission goes as planned the musesa would be the 
first satellite to orbit the moon since the soviet union landed the 
unmanned vehicle luna 24 on its surface in 1976 on july 20 1969 
americans neil armstrong and edwin aldrin became the first 
astronauts to land on the moon 
matsuo said his agencys primary objective is not for missions 
to land on the moon we may go to the moon in the mid1990s we 
have various candidate missions to the moon or to venus and we 
havent decided yet 
the japanese hope to use the mission to develop techniques for 
an eventual manned lunar flight and exploration of other planets 
said kuninori uesugi an official with the institute of space and 
astronautical science 
the institute plans to send the musesa into a highly oval earth 
orbit that will bring it about 10000 miles from the moon in eight 
weeks 
it then will release a smaller satellite to go into orbit around 
the moon and send data to the larger satellite on temperatures and 
electrical fields 
the red and silver rocket cannot lift much more than the 
400pound musesa satellite but japan is developing the h2 rocket 
to lift twoton payloads into orbit equaling us and soviet 
capabilities 
the nissan motor co japans secondlargest automobile maker 
built the threestage 62ton m3s2 engine used in the lunar 
mission 
japans first satellite was launched in 1970 musesa would be 
the 13th japanese satellite in operation 
launches are limited to a 90day period each year because tuna 
fishermen near the space center off the southern main island of 
kyushu complain the liftoffs are dangerous

an international conference on vietnam refugees 
opened tuesday amid signs of a growing agreement that most people 
who flee the southeast asian nation should be forced to return home 
but sources at the unsponsored meeting said there was 
disagreement about how and when the controversial forced 
repatriations should take place thousands of vietnamese are in 
refugee centers in other asian nations 
most refugees contend they are fleeing political repression by 
the communist regime but nations that have been swamped with 
asylum seekers say the vast majority are only trying to escape 
vietnams poor economy 
in hong kong on tuesday about 1000 vietnamese boat people 
living in tents chanted and marched in the shek kong detention 
center to protest forced repatriations police said 
the united states also has opposed the mandatory returns a 
source at tuesdays gathering speaking on condition of anonymity 
said britain gave a lukewarm reception to a us offer to drop its 
opposition in exchange for a 12month moratorium on compulsory 
repatriations 
british delegates argued that such a plan would not deter a new 
influx of vietnamese into the british colony of hong kong which 
already is crowded with wouldbe refugees the source said 
the source said canada offered a compromise proposal for a 
yearlong delay in mandatory repatriation of vietnamese already in 
camps in southeast asia but a prompt return for any new arrivals 
the source said both plans were being discussed privately by 10 
countries including britain the united states canada australia 
vietnam and thailand and chaired by the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
government officials at the closeddoor meeting declined comment 
on the proposals and refused to speculate on the likelihood of 
agreement between the 25 participating countries at the end of the 
twoday session 
i simply do not know what the outcome will be said robin 
mcclaren head of the british delegation 
un refugees office spokesman raymond hall said there were 
signs of greater flexibility than at a meeting in october that 
ended in stalemate between britain and the united states 
britain forcibly sent back 51 boat people from hong kong in 
december despite an ensuing international outcry diplomats 
reported growing sympathy for british arguments that given the 
cramped conditions in its camps compulsory repatriation was the 
only option 
there are an estimated 109000 boat people in camps in southeast 
asia including 56000 in hong kong according to un figures the 
44000 boat people who arrived in the british colony after june 
1988 are subject to screening procedures to determine they fled 
political persecution rather than economic want the arrivals 
before june 1988 were granted refugee status without screening 
hall said about 7000 people have so far been screened in hong 
kong and only 15 percent of these were accepted as genuine refugees 
rather than economic migrants 
the bush administration during the weekend dropped its 
opposition to mandatory repatriation said returns should be delayed 
until jan 1 1991 to allow the united nations refugees agency to 
persuade vietnamese to go back of their own accord 
the agency also has softened its position on the boat people 
the new high ccmmissioner former norwegian foreign minister 
thorwald stoltenberg indicated friday that his agency would help 
monitor mandatory resettlements subject to a satisfactory 
consensus being reached at the meeting in geneva 
since march 1100 people have returned voluntarily and another 
1400 are registered to go back hall said all voluntary returnees 
receive 50 from the refugee agency and qualify for a years food 
aid from hanoi 
hall said united nations was very satisfied with the 
treatment given to voluntary returnees by vietnamese authorities

personal income growth in the rocky mountain 
region topped the national average for the first time in six years 
in the third quarter of 1989 while it slowed in new england the 
government reported tuesday 
the commerce department also said the plains states registered 
the fastest growth rate folowed by a 91 percent advance in the 
far west 
the department said rocky mountain income in the julyseptember 
quarter grew 87 percent over the same period of 1988 compared to 
a national growth rate of 85 percent 
it was the first time the rockies registered above the national 
average since 1983 and reflected increasing strength in 
manufacturing and mining the departments bureau of economic 
analysis said 
at the same time the department said income growth in new 
england declined during the third quarter to an 82 percent rate 
from 86 percent rate during the second quarter and 96 percent in 
the first 
the deceleration was blamed on slowdowns in the growth of 
construction and service payrolls 
joining new england with growth rates below the national average 
were the midatlantic region up 84 percent the southeast up 83 
percent the southwest up 82 percent and the great lakes up 81 
percent 
and because of the effects of hurricane hugo last september 
south carolina posted the first decline in any states nonfarm 
personal income growth since nebraska and north and south dakota 
recorded negatives in the fourth quarter of 1988 at the end of that 
years drought 
hurricane hugo which hit south carolina the hardest also 
affected income growth in neighboring states because of extensive 
damage to rental properties excluding the effects of the storms 
damage personal income would have increased 94 percent in south 
carolina and 89 percent in the southeast region 
rudolph e depass an economist for the bureau of economic 
analysis said that automation has replaced much of the antiquated 
durable manufacturing and mining infrastructure in the rocky 
mountain region making those industries more efficient and 
competitive 
but he said new england which in recent years had built up 
defenserelated hightech industries has been hit by the slowdown 
in defense spending in addition he said there is a shortage of 
skilled workers in the region because of highpriced housing 
nevertheless depass said new england still has a relatively 
high growth rate compared to other regions 
the plains income growth was attributed to rebounding farm 
income after the drought and to strong durable and nondurable 
manufacturing in the far west the report said growth reflected 
strength in manufacturing service industries and construction 
on the other hand in both the great lakes and midatlantic 
regions weakness in durable and nondurable manufacturing dampened 
growth weakness in motor vehicle production in michigan 
particularly affected the great lakes region the report said 
the southwest suffered slow growth in payrolls of most major 
industries with advances in service industries slower than in any 
other region 
states with the fastest growth in personal income were north 
dakota 169 percent alaska 153 percent south dakota 134 
percent nevada 133 percent washington state and hawaii 111 
percent each utah 106 percent and minnesota florida and iowa 
103 percent each 
states with the slowest growth in addition to south carolina 
were wyoming 54 percent west virginia 6 percent oklahoma 68 
percent akransas 69 percent michigan 72 percent louisiana 
73 percent nebraska 74 percent kansas 75 percent and ohio 
76 percent

and moisture were beneficial to livestock producers as they helped 
pastures 
however the report added that wheat farmers and fruit growers 
were concerned that the warm weather will start growth too soon 
leaving these crops more vulnerable to a hard freeze later on 
the report said the heavy wet snow in the plains was the first

hong kongs governor on tuesday urged china to 
take into account the mounting criticism of beijings plan to limit 
democracy when it takes control of the colony in 1997 
theres no doubt that the drafting on the political 
structure has been a disappointment to many people in hong kong 
gov sir david wilson said after addressing the executive council 
part of the territorys executive branch 
wilsons statement came a day after hong kongs legislature and 
executive branch rejected chinas plan saying it had been put 
forth with total disregard for the wishes of the hong kong 
people 
many political and business leaders in the territory of 57 
million also denounced it 
a committee meeting in the southern chinese city of canton 
decided saturday to limit the number of directly elected seats in 
hong kongs legislature divide the body into two houses and 
further restrict who could hold high office after beijing takes 
over 
the chineseappointed committee is writing what is known as the 
basic law the blueprint for hong kongs government after 1997 
none of the six committee delegates from hong kong voted for 
beijings plan which passed on the support of all 10 of chinas 
delegates 
on tuesday sanford yung a hong kong delegate called for all 
his colleagues to resign in opposition 
some senior hong kong officials took their concerns to prime 
minister margaret thatcher on tuesday and said after meeting with 
her in london that she was seriously considering their proposals to 
make the colony more democratic before it reverts to chinese 
sovereignty 
she was very very interested in our views we had a very 
very good exchange said dame lydia dunn of hong kongs 
policymaking executive council 
a spokesman for mrs thatchers office speaking anonymously in 
keeping with british custom said she would consider very 
carefully what they had said 
beijing has promised to maintain hong kongs capitalist economy 
for 50 years after it resumes control 
but faith has evaporated since beijings bloody crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in june and chinas increasingly hardline 
stance following democratic reforms in eastern europe 
members of hong kongs legislative and executive councils are 
particularly unhappy with the slow pace of democratization and 
restrictions that china will place on officeholders 
under beijings plan 18 of hong kongs 60 legislators will be 
elected in 1997 with the rest being chosen by special interest 
groups by 2003 half of the legislators will be elected by the 
people 
hong kong politicians have called for at least 20 seats to be 
directly elected in 1991 with substantial increases after that 
the beijing plan also says only 15 percent of the legislature 
can possess a foreign passport china earlier had planned to 
prohibit top officials such as the chief executive from holding a 
foreign passport

an alexander calder mobile with a 14 million 
pricetag has been stolen from a gallery authorities said tuesday 
the 30pound mobile white flag was stolen at 6 pm sunday 
from perls galleries on manhattans upper east side said police 
lt joseph pollini 
the gallery owner klaus perls discovered the burglary monday 
morning 
perls 78 was calders exclusive agent for 22 years until the 
artist died in 1976 
pollini said the burglars entered the sixstory building through 
a skylight white flag was hanging by a cable just beneath the 
skylight over a stairwell 
pollini said it wasnt clear whether the burglars were just 
stealing random objects there have been about 30 burglaries in the 
neighborhood in 18 months 
the burglars tripped the gallerys alarm perls said someone 
from the alarm company went to investigate but failed to notice 
that the skylight was open and the mobile missing 
pollini said there are 40 to 50 gallery burglaries a year in the 
city averaging 500000 to 15 million per theft 
usually stolen artwork is sold for about 10 percent of its real 
value in comparison most stolen goods are fenced for onethird of 
their value said pollini 
pollini believes white flag is still in the new york area 
us customs agents are watching for it 
the aluminum mobile created in 1962 suspends triangular flags 
one white the rest black on graceful stems it is 4 feet high 
and more than 8 feet wide but comes apart for shipping 
perls said he has little hope of getting it back 
two years ago burglars stole about 60 objects including two 
picassos valued at several hundred thousand dollars from the 
perls galleries about onethird of the items have been recovered 
not the picassos

a man who told counselors at a sex offender 
program about his involvement in 12 unsolved rapes has been 
convicted in four of those cases despite arguing the statements 
were confidential 
robert e mceiver 37 a former draftsman at honeywell inc was 
found guilty monday of criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in 
four rapes in minneapolis and suburban richfield in 1987 
the minneapolis mans written confession described three years 
of stalking and raping women in st paul minneapolis richfield 
and suburban edina he wrote it while he was in treatment in a 
program which encourages offenders to admit past sex crimes the 
treatment had been ordered for a conviction for a 1986 rape 
sentencing is set for feb 14 prosecutor william richardson 
said the county might consider trying to have him committed to the 
minnesota security hospital at st peter as mentally ill and 
dangerous 
defense attorney jerry strauss said mceiver is considering suing 
hennepin county for violation of his civil rights strauss also 
said he may appeal the judges ruling that allowed the confession 
to be used as evidence 
district judge robert lynn ruled that the information would be 
admissible at trial because there was no other way to identify the 
assailant in the crimes 
strauss had argued that admitting it would discourage others 
from being honest during treatment 
but lynn ruled that the series of rapes committed at knifepoint 
carried greater weight than any possible harm to the treatment 
program 
when a probation officer learned of mceivers admissions at the 
program alpha house in minneapolis officials removed him from the 
program and turned over the document to police 
i had thought about raping a woman for a long time mceiver 
said in the confession i decided i would take a knife with me so 
i could do this one day i did that i took a knife and started 
cruising 
he was convicted of raping a 14yearold girl while she 
delivered newspapers aug 2 1987 kidnapping and raping a 
28yearold woman june 30 1987 raping a 25yearold woman on june 
28 1987 and raping a 24yearold woman on nov 8 1987 
richardson said no other charges will be filed against mceiver 
for rapes identified in the confession in some cases the 
threeyear statute of limitations has passed he said 
in most of the cases mceiver told of approaching the women from 
behind and warning them not to look at him the confession told of 
two rapes in one night during 1987

extremists ambushed a military convoy in 
azerbaijan killing two reserve soldiers and a woman bystander 
soviet media said tuesday the kgb said the republic was on the 
brink of anarchy and local politicians pushed for secession 
radio moscow said the situation in the soviet caucasus where 
armenians and azerbaijanis have been battling for 11 days remained 
very very tense tuesday 
it said leaders of soviet azerbaijan and armenia continued 
negotiations to end the ethnic violence but little progress was 
reported 
the death toll rose to 170 including those killed in 
antiarmenian riots in the azerbaijani capital of baku and the 
clashes that ensued among armenians azerbaijanis and soviet troops 
the soldiers who smashed into baku to quell the ethnic uprising 
saturday are more and more often being chosen as targets by 
local fighters tass quoted interior ministry maj gen yevgeny 
nechayev as saying 
radio moscow said irresponsible people were spreading 
antiarmy and antirussian sentiments through unsigned letters and 
anonymous phone calls 
soviet tv reported tuesday night that gunfire continued in some 
areas of baku and warships remained blocked by militants from 
leaving the caspian sea citys port 
baku radio monitored by the bbc in london said two soldiers 
and a woman bystander were killed in an attack on a military convoy 
azerbaijans kgb expressed alarm in its appeal to residents of 
the republic for calm radio moscow said 
azerbaijan is on the edge of the abyss beyond which lie chaos 
and anarchy the kgb warned the public appeal was virtually 
unprecedented for the usually secretive state security agency 
azerbaijani activists said sentiment to break away from moscow 
was rising jeikhun mulazade a political scientist said the 
azerbaijani communist party leadership was meeting tuesday and 
wednesday and would consider a break from the national party as 
lithuanian communists did last month 
in gyanje azerbaijans secondbiggest city the city council 
demanded the azerbaijani parliament call a referendum on the 
republics secession from the soviet union according to lutviyar 
nusibov a baku attorney azerbaijani lawmakers have already 
threatened to do just that if soviet troops are not pulled out soon 
in washington the bush administration voiced support tuesday 
for the territorial integrity of the soviet union but it called 
for dialogue between moscow and azerbaijan saying peaceful changes 
are a matter for the parties affected to resolve 
baku residents prevented two ships carrying the families of 
soldiers stationed in the area from leaving the port because they 
thought the soviets were trying to smuggle out bodies of those 
killed in the soviet assault on baku a soviet spokesman said 
tuesday 
they apparently thought authorities wanted to claim casualties 
were lower than in reality foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov 
nothing was found in the holds gerasimov told a moscow 
briefing 
soviet troops managed to gain control of most of the 
iraniansoviet border stemming the mass crossings by thousands of 
azerbaijanis in and out of iran tass reported tuesday 
radio moscow accused the iranian press and the speaker of the 
iranian parliament mehdi karrubi of political blindness for 
their claims that the azerbaijani unrest meant a step forward for 
islam according to bbc monitors 
soviet troops also began to unblock roads in the disputed 
territory of nagornokarabakh on tuesday tass said 
nagornokarabakh which is controlled by azerbaijan but is 
populated mainly by armenians and claimed by both groups is at the 
crux of the regions conflict 
the explosion into violence of the longstanding hostility 
between mostly christian armenia and predominantly moslem 
azerbaijan is considered the worst ethnic crisis president mikhail 
s gorbachev has faced in his nearly fiveyear tenure as soviet 
leader 
he also faces nationalist unrest in the baltics georgia 
moldavia and parts of soviet central asia 
arif yunusov a spokesman for the independent social democratic 
group political organization said baku a major oilrefining 
center was paralyzed tuesday by a general strike 
the strike and unrest has created certain difficulties with 
extraction and transport of petroleum in the area said lev 
churilov a senior official in the moscow ministry that handles oil 
production he said he had no figures on the economic damage but 
so far all extraction is continuing and only one drill team has 
stopped working 
in yerevan armenias capital the azerbaijani blockade of most 
rail traffic into armenia has left many residents without 
electricity heat and water soviet tv said the republics tv 
station reduced its broadcast hours to save energy 
foreign reporters remained barred from the region 
the total number of soviet troops fighting in armenia and 
azerbaijan is reported to be 29000 including troops police 
cadets and interior ministry forces the number of militants is

in october lead singer axl rose told a los angeles memorial 
coliseum audience he was quitting the band because of excessive 
drug use in the group i just didnt want to see my friends slip 
away said rose 
he later apologized and said he wasnt leaving the group

the soviet union warned iran on tuesday 
about taking action behind moscows back in azerbaijan where 
the red army is trying to stop an ethnic war between azerbaijanis 
and armenians 
radio moscow said any such actions by neighboring iran would 
have irrevocable consequences the official radio broadcast the 
message after after 160 members of irans 270seat parliament urged 
the kremlin to find a peaceful solution 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said hundreds of people organized by the association of 
militant clergymen held a demonstration of mourning in tehran for 
moslems killed in azerbaijan 
legislator ali akbar nateqnouri a former interior minister 
accused president mikhail s gorbachev of ordering the massacre 
of azerbaijani nationalists and said the worlds 1 billion moslems 
cannot be indifferent to the killings irna reported 
most azerbaijanis whose historic homeland extends into iran 
are shiite moslems the predominant religion in iran 
any unconsidered nationalistic or religious appeals would be 
dangerous radio moscow said brutal and illusory nationalistic 
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of the 
precipice 
iran has become increasingly concerned about the crisis in 
soviet azerbaijan the leadership is torn between protecting the 
soviet moslems and risking vital economic agreements with moscow 
tehran radio said the legislators wrote a letter to gorbachev 
read aloud in the parliament expressing concern about the military 
crackdown on azerbaijani nationalists 
they urged gorbachev not to be influenced by the conspiracies 
of global arrogance a synonym for the west and the criminal 
america and to deal with the moslems of the soviet union with 
compassion 
official soviet reports have reported more than 170 people 
killed in violence that began nov 13 with battles between 
azerbaijanis and ethnic armenians most of whom are christians 
gorbachev declared a state of emergency and sent troops and 
tanks into the baku capital of azerbaijan on saturday 
a statement sunday by irans foreign ministry said imperialist 
governments and the zionistcontrolled media were distorting 
events in azerbaijan portraying moslem azerbaijanis as 
belligerents attacking helpless armenians 
the letter from legislators said the moslems of soviet 
azerbaijan by protesting in their cities and gathering on the 
iranian border are demonstrating their desire to return to the 
fold of islam and regain their lost identity 
it said moslems in iran were extremely worried about these 
events and together with the rest of the worlds moslems we 
express our deep regret about the grief and hardship inflicted 
on the moslems of soviet azerbaijan 
parliament speaker mahdi karrubi who advocates irans 
revolutionary brand of islam condemned the military action in 
remarks sunday and said it could create more problems for the 
soviet union 
he clearly was referring to the potential for unrest in other 
southern moslem republics of the soviet union 
on tuesday radio moscow called for restraint by iran and 
accused karrubi of political blindness 
the broadcast by its farsi language service said most iranian 
newspapers have interpreted the actions of the extremists as a step 
forward for islam 
what is the reason for this political blindness why do 
selfish interests blur the vision of individuals so they fail to 
see the truth 
every step taken in soviet azerbaijan behind moscows back can 
have unforseeable and irrevocable consequences constructive 
efforts make it possible to resolve the crisis through compromise 
gorbachev blames the violence on moslem fanatics the kremlin 
has worried for years that the revolutionary zealots who seized 
control of iran in 1979 would try to stir up the soviet unions 70 
million moslems 
soviet media have accused iran of supplying arms to moslems in 
azerbaijan but iranian media deny it 
thousands of soviet azerbaijanis bound by language culture and 
religion to their iranian kin have crossed the border since the 
violence began 
the flood of refugees and strong nationalistic attachments have 
caused fears in iran that passions could be aroused among its own 
15 million azerbaijanis 
nationalists in soviet azerbaijan agitate for greater 
azerbaijan an independent oilrich homeland for 20 million 
azerbaijanis on both sides of the border azerbaijanis lived 
together under persian rule until 1828 when part of their homeland 
was ceded to russia

claiming the b2 stealth bomber will cost its 
weight in gold two democratic senators introduced legislation 
tuesday that would end production of the radarevading aircraft 
patrick leahy of vermont and alan cranston of california said 
their bill which mirrors legislation they introduced last 
november would prohibit all spending on the aircraft beyond the 15 
now in production by northrop corp in cranstons home state 
the introduction of the bill marks the beginning of a 
sustained national campaign to give historys first 1 billion 
bomber a speedy and as far as the taxpayers are concerned a 
merciful death cranston told reporters at a news conference 
the lawmakers acknowledged however that the measure faces an 
uphill fight the bill introduced in november during a latenight 
session on the defense spending measure won just 29 votes in the 
senate and cranston and leahy estimate that they have about 32 
supporters this year 
air force plans for 132 of the batwinged aircraft came under 
attack last year as lawmakers expressed sticker shock over the 
singleplane cost of about 530 million 
cranston and leahy complained that this estimate was too small 
that the defense department omitted operation and maintenance 
expense over the life of the plane and failed to recognize that 
cost increases that plagued the b1b likely will befall the b2 
it now is a billiondollarplus bomber cranston said it 
does cost its weight in gold now and a bit more nobody not even 
the pentagon would claim its worth its weight in gold certainly 
no plane is worth its weight in gold 
cranston based his statement on a gold price of 40610 per troy 
ounce and the b2s weight of 174000 pounds avoirdupois simple 
math but crazy logic he said 
there are 1458 troy ounces in one pound avoirdupois cranstons 
gold price price would imply a plane costing 1030 billion gold 
prices have been rising lately at the tuesday afternoon london 
fixing the price was 40825 that would imply a b2 worth 1036 
billion 
the california democratic proposed using the money earmarked for 
the b2 for housing drug interdiction education and the 
environment 
continued excessive military spending heads us toward fiscal 
disaster he said 
leahy argued that last year defense secretary dick cheney urged 
congress not to nickel and dime the b2 program because that 
would only increase the aircrafts cost 
we should kill it outright leahy said to do otherwise 
would be to add to the cost i come today to bury the b2 not to 
praise it

fourteen high school athletes donned hospital 
gowns tuesday and provided urine samples for the launch of a random 
drugtesting program that drew little opposition from most students 
and parents 
it wasnt that bad said megan mulcahey an 18yearold 
member of the girls basketball team who was among the first tested 
only 305 students involved in winter sports at suburban 
homewoodflossmoor high school initially will undergo urine tests 
but officials hope to expand the program to all 1500 athletes at 
the 2000student school in the upper middleclass mostly white 
suburb southwest of chicago 
i dont think its fair that just us are being tested miss 
mulcahey said if theyre going to go ahead and have that it 
should be everyone 
miss mulcahey a senior said shes sure shell pass but she 
and several other students said they consider the tests a violation 
of privacy that unfairly single out athletes 
nevertheless students involved in such winter sports as 
swimming basketball wrestling and gymnastics and their parents 
signed consent forms allowing for the tests 
we really dont feel that we have as much of a drug problem 
as most schools but we feel that even if we have one or two its a 
problem we will address athletic director ken schultz said 
the homewoodflossmoor board of education approved the testing 
program in september at the suggestion of the high schools 
football coach john wrenn who suspected drug use by a couple of 
students schultz said 
a few members of the football team voluntarily sought treatment 
for substance abuse after the program was announced but before the 
testing began he said 
some parents expressed concerns about privacy to the school 
board but the program has generated no campus protests or 
organized opposition from parents schultz said 
amanda levenberg a 17yearold senior and president of the 
schools student government said the tests may help students 
resist peer pressure 
but she opposes them on constitutional grounds 
i was expecting a lot more friction from the student body 
people are complying and theyre not complaining miss levenberg 
said i think it wont hit kids until they have to go pee in a 
cup for someone to test them 
the winter athletes were assigned numbers earlier this year and 
schultz picked the first 15 to be tested in a random drawing all 
but one student who was absent tuesday were tested in a school 
athletic building schultz said 
under the program each student is asked to disrobe in the 
presence of a staff member from the hospital that is administering 
the tests they are then handed a hospital gown and provide the 
urine specimen in a stall separated by a partition from the 
hospital workerr schultz said 
the tests detect the presence of alcohol steroids and several 
other drugs including marijuana and cocaine they will be given 
once a week but students wont know when until the day of the 
tests 
students and their parents will be notified of the results 
within 48 hours of the tests said principal charles smith those 
who test positive must see a drug counselor within 48 hours 
students determined by the counselor to be drug abusers or 
chemically dependant will be suspended from sports and required to 
undergo treatment they will be tested again after 30 days and may 
return to athletics if they pass smith said more treatment is 
ordered for those who dont pass

the new government on tuesday delayed 
elections as requested by the opposition and accept un observers 
to ensure the balloting is fair a senior official said 
the national salvation front which has run the country since 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was toppled set the 
parliamentary elections for may 20 and also said it would run 
candidates on the ballot reversing its previous stand that it 
would serve only as a caretaker government 
there has been opposition from some members of the governing 
council and from rival parties to such a move because the grouping 
was not formally elected to office and it includes former 
communists who are equated with ceausescus brutal 24year rule 
in separate comments bound to raise fears that romanias 
government is not committed to democracy the soviet news agency 
tass quoted president ion iliescu as saying the idea of a 
multiparty system was a historically outdated model of 
democracy 
we do not want to follow any model including the model of 
bourgeois democracy in romania in the 30s tass quoted iliescu 
a former senior communist official as saying 
of political processes in other warsaw pact countries leading to 
westernstyle democracy iliescu reportedly said the experience 
of our neighbors countries in which the renewing processes are 
also being launched but in totally different conditions does not 
suit us either 
silviu brucan another prominent excommunist and senior 
government official told a news conference that romania would 
accept un observers for the balloting to ensure it is fair 
the council reversed its initial stance that it would play no 
role in elections in response to the many demands from the mining 
workers from various other workers students from the 
polytechnic insitute others and intellectuals he asserted 
brucan said the delay from april was in response to requests 
from new political parties for more time to campaign and was 
reached at a meeting of the front tuesday 
he was asked if the government had first consulted with the 15 
opposition parties which had suggested dates from june to 
september 
it is the right in every country for the government in power 
to set the date of the election he replied citing the example 
of british prime minister margaret thatcher deciding the date of 
balloting in her country 
you cant expect the romanians to be more democratic than the 
british he said 
when it was pointed out that mrs thatcher headed an elected 
government brucan argued that the provisional government gained 
its legitimacy from the role it played in the popular uprising that 
toppled ceausescu on dec 22 
the leadership of the front guided the army in the hot days of 
days of dec 22 23 24 25 he said the legitimacy of the 
front derives from its historical role this is a very sound 
kind of legitimacy 
he insisted the front was not a political party despite its 
intention to run candidates 
parties are organizations with firm discipline to which 
everybody adheres he argued adding the front is not such a 
rigid fixed structure 
the decision to have candidates contest the elections was made 
despite criticism that the councils high profile and domination of 
news media was a threat to the concept of multiparty democracy 
it continued a pattern of the front reversing its own announced 
decisions 
during massive anticommunist demonstrations jan 12 the front 
outlawed the communist party and set a referendum on renewing the 
death penalty only to withdraw the decree banning the communists 
and cancel the plebiscite 
ceausescu and his wife elena were convicted of grave 
crimes and executed dec 25 
immediately after ceausescus ouster front leaders declared 
they would not play a role in elections but brucan effectively 
reversed that stance tuesday 
if the front did not participate in the elections a political 
vacuum would be created he said 
asked how the opposition parties would obtain campaign funds and 
whether they would be assured time on state radio and tv brucan 
said this would be discussed at a meeting with the parties on 
saturday 
brucan became irritated when a questioner juxtaposed front 
participation in the elections meant to be the first democratic 
voting since the communists assumed control in 1947 with 
perpetuation of the communist party 
first of all the communist party no longer exists he said 
brucan said members of the military command would not be front 
candidates

researchers are combing the fields and 
forests of illinois in search of what owls spit up but some state 
lawmakers are gagging over the projected 180000 cost of studying 
the birds diets 
apparently the owl was wiser than we were said rep ted 
leverenz who wants to end funding for the project 
the researchers involved say their work could provide valuable 
information on how changes in the environment affect animals 
they will be the most vulnerable of any of the animals if 
there are significant changes in their prey as a result of mans 
activities habitat destruction politics or even natural 
changes climatic changes said russell graham an illinois state 
museum geologist and bone expert overseeing the study 
owls spit up pellets of hair bone and teeth indigestible 
leftovers from what theyve eaten at least once or twice a day 
since the study began in july 1988 about 3000 pellets have been 
collected 
the pellets have revealed that owls eat rabbits opossums 
ducks pheasants cardinals shrews fish and mice and other 
rodents 
pam fortado gibson field coordinator for the study said the 
information could eventually be used to help farmers reduce their 
dependence on pesticides 
we have no knowledge of our natural pest control she said 
it would help farmers move away from using carcinogenic chemicals 
that pollute our streams 
leverenz believes money for the study should be shifted to the 
department of conservations efforts to prevent poaching according 
to legislative aide mary riseling 
maybe its legitimate but should it be us paying for it 
said rep woods bowman cant we get the information elsewhere 
carol knowles a spokeswoman for the department of conservation 
said the department backs the study on which it has already spent 
almost 94000 
the study is one of the important studies that we carry out to 
see if wildlife will be around in future years she said it 
has implications for humans too

attorneys for a new york generic drug company 
said the company appears to have used false documents to challenge 
government action against one of its products according to letters 
released tuesday 
the leaders of a house investigations subcommittee which 
released the letters said it appears the company bolar 
pharmaceutical co inc was involved in a criminal coverup 
they called for bolar to remove its generic version of the 
brandname drug dyazide from the market 
dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication 
made by smithkline beecham two generic versions of the drug which 
is a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide were 
approved by the food and drug administration 
vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens ny took its 
version off the market last year after it admitted substituting the 
brandname drug for its product in tests required to win fda 
approval 
bolar based in copiague ny makes the only other generic 
dyazide it is the companys largestselling product 
the fda announced last august it was beginning proceedings to 
remove bolars dyazide from the market saying it questioned 
whether the product was therapeutically equivalent to the 
brandname drug the fda said bolar appeared to have misrepresented 
documentation and data 
bolar resisted the fda action maintaining that it had not 
misrepresented data to the agency and that the bolar drug approved 
by the fda was the same product found to be bioequivalent to 
dyazide by a testing laboratory 
eugene pfeifer a washingtonbased attorney representing the 
copiague ny company said in a letter to the fda dated last 
friday that there is reason to believe that a number of the 
documents used to support our sept 11 1989 submission defending 
bolars drug are false 
the letter said pfeifers law firm king amp spalding became 
aware of the apparent falsity during an internal investigation 
bolar authorized the firm to conduct on several drugs 
pfeifer was reported out of his office tuesday and calls to 
bolar were not returned 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee and rep thomas bliley jr of 
virginia ranking republican on the panel said there can be no 
defense of bolars conduct 
they said they will ask the justice department and the 
securities and exchange commission to investigate the allegations 
trading of bolar stock on the american stock exchange never 
opened tuesday 
dingell and bliley also asked the sec to investigate the sale of 
150000 shares of bolar stock by the companys three top 
stockholders around dec 18 about a week before the subcommittee 
sent a letter to the company 
the letter according to a subcommittee source put the company 
on notice that allegations that a bolar document had been altered 
were being sent to the justice department 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency is still proceeding 
with its intention to withdraw bolars approval to market its 
generic dyazide and the allegations of fraud will be considered 
during the proceedings

thirtyseven protesters against us military 
aid to el salvador including actor martin sheen were arrested 
tuesday as they demonstrated in the capitol rotunda on the opening 
day of the new session of congress 
dan nichols information officer for the capitol police said 
the protesters were charged with demonstrating within a capitol 
building and unlawful entry he said the offenses carry a maximum 
penalty of a 500 fine and six months imprisonment 
the arrests climaxed a day that began with an ecumenical prayer 
service at a nearby church and included a march to the capitol by 
demonstrators carrying cardboard caskets in protest of killings in 
el salvador 
the demonstrators in the rotunda knelt lay down chanted 
slogans and lifted banners protesting aid to the salvadoran 
government and calling for negotiations to end the prolonged civil 
war in that country 
sheen who knelt rather than lay was silent as he was led 
handcuffed from the rotunda 
others sang we shall overcome or called out such phrases as 
stop us aid to el salvador or in the name of god stop the 
repression 
some of the demonstrators would not stand and were dragged out 
by officers 
at the prayer service at st peters roman catholic church 
brother sean sammon president of the conference of major superiors 
of men said the groups message to congress must be clear and 
unequivocal end all military aid to that country and instead make 
all efforts to bring together the different factions 
the conference of major superiors of men is an organization of 
leaders of orders of brothers and priests in the roman catholic 
church 
at a nearby subway station people coming to work on capitol 
hill were greeted by demonstrators bearing a sign saying us 
tax dollars kill priests in el salvador 
a salvadoran army colonel three lieutenants and four soldiers 
have been implicated in a massacre of six jesuit priests on nov 
16 their cook and her 15yearold daughter was also murdered 
the killings prompted calls in congress for a reappraisal of the 
more than 1 million washington supplies daily in aid to the 
central american nation 
a statement printed with the program for the ecumenical service 
bearing the name of the interfaith office on accompaniment 
said we find our nations policy in el salvador politically 
manipulative humanly destructive economically counterproductive 
and morally bankrupt 
we therefore call upon congress and the bush administration to 
end the persecution of the churches and civilian communities of el 
salvador by cutting off all military aid to el salvador and by 
supporting genuine negotiations for peace the statement said

a mysterious oil spill that stretched for five 
miles along the mississippi river dissipated before anyone could 
identify its source amount or content authorities said 
the banktobank sheen was first reported last week and drifted 
about 100 miles south from st louis to cape girardeau before it 
disappeared after three days 
the spill caused no apparent environmental damage 
the sheen was first reported wednesday by a coast guard cutter 
said a coast guard spokesman ensign brian ellis 
the coast guard notified the us environmental protection 
agency the missouri department of natural resources and the 
illinois environmental protection agency illinois is on the other 
side of the river from the spill 
ellis said the sheen also was noticed by two other vessels 
judging from the description of the sheen the substance might have 
been diesel fuel ellis said even small amounts of oil can produce 
a large area of sheen he said 
because of fog emergency response officials from the state 
department of natureal resources waited until the next day to 
investigate while flying over the mississippi on thursday 
inspectors saw only occasional patches of a light oil sheen on the 
river 
by friday the sheen had been dispersed by wind and water 
currents and was no longer visible 
the oil could have come from a barge a tow boat or an 
industrial plant said scott holste a spokesman for the department 
of natural resources 
there is a definite possibility that we may never know what it 
was he said

the national communist party 
congress was suspended tuesday after the liberal slovenians walked 
out and it appeared unlikely to reconvene a prominent newspaper 
said the party was dead 
slovenias delegation left the meeting monday night and the 
party politburo announced early tuesday the congress had been 
adjourned indefinitely slovenian officials said they would not 
return to the meeting and the delegation of croatia yugoslavias 
secondlargest province supported them 
official media said that meant the party had split as the 
slovenians had said it would and the congress could not continue 
a headline in the daily borba declared the communist party of 
yugoslavia no longer exists 
the irreconcilable rift occurred between liberals frustrated in 
their efforts to achieve reform and conservatives resistant to 
change 
if advance plans had been followed the congress would have 
ended tuesday with adoption of a document calling for reforms 
including renunciation of the partys 45yearold power monopoly 
and election of a new leadership 
before leading his delegation out slovenian party leader ciril 
ribicic said the congress had rejected the republics proposals for 
significant reforms 
tanjug the official news agency quoted him as saying tuesday 
it was obvious the slovenian party could never again be a 
part of the communist party of yugoslavia in the manner that it has 
been up to now an institutionalized permanent minority 
deep divisions became increasingly evident after the congress 
began saturday and bitter debates developed between liberals and 
conservatives 
most representative of the opposites were slovenia the second 
smallest republic and conservative serbia the largest 
as reported by tanjug ribicic said a meeting tuesday of the 
slovenian party central committe in ljubljana capital of the 
republic decided to temporarily freeze formal relations with the 
rest of the communist party until feb 2 
on that day the slovenian party will hold its own conference to 
determine a future platform and define relations with the national 
party 
the official radio in zagreb capital of croatia accused 
president slobodan milosevic of serbia of trying to stage a 
coup in the party leadership it said delegates loyal to him had 
prevented passage of any liberal proposals put forward by slovenia 
earlier this month slovenian communists said the national 
organization should become a loose coalition of independent 
regional parties serbians want a strong central party and rejected 
the idea 
serbia equates the party with the nation a diverse federation 
of six republics and two provinces in which longtime leader 
president tito was the main unifying force until his death in 1980 
slovenian communists have expressed increasing frustration over 
resistance to reform as they prepare for multiparty elections the 
republic has scheduled for april 
ribicic said his delegations walkout was tantamount to 
establishing an autonomous slovenian party tanjug reported he 
said most delegates from the other five republics felt there could 
not be a yugoslav communist party without one of its national 
organizations 
after the slovenians left croatian party leader ivica racan 
asked that the congress be suspended and said his delegation would 
refuse to vote if it continued 
milan kucan a leading slovenian communist said tuesday the 
yugoslav communist party could no longer be constituted on the 
same basis as was valid until now 
premier ante markovic who advocates reform said he would 
propose legislation laying the groundwork for a multiparty system 
tanjug reported 
it quoted markovic as saying the government would pursue reform 
and it doesnt matter whether the party reunifies or splits into 
different organizations the state must function and it will do 
so

the skipper of the tanker exxon valdez says the 
most worrisome thing about his upcoming oil spill trial is that he 
is sailing into unknown territory which must be navigated 
without charts or compass 
but joseph hazelwood says he is confident that once the people 
of alaska hear the case against him stemming from the nations 
worst oil spill they will agree that this was a tragic accident 
nothing more 
i feel terrible about the tragedy that occurred up there 
hazelwood said in an interview id like to get rid of the 
misconception that i got drunk ran the ship aground and just 
shrugged my shoulders and walked away because thats just not 
what happened 
its been a gutwrenching experience for the people of alaska 
and for me too he said chainsmoking lucky strikes 
hazelwoods trial on charges of reckless endangerment is to 
begin monday in anchorage alaska 10 months and five days after 
his tanker struck a reef in prince william sound ripped its hull 
open and leaked nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in an area 
rich with wildlife 
it has been alleged that hazelwood was drunk before the accident 
and had left an uncertified third mate in control of the ship 
hazelwood 43 has a history of alcohol abuse and lost his 
drivers license in two states because of intoxication 
he faces up to seven years in prison and 65000 in fines if 
convicted 
he refused to discuss details of his defense except to protest 
his innocence and answered questions almost grudgingly 
ive accepted the cards that ive been dealt hazelwood said 
at his attorneys office in manhattan i cant wish it away or 
think it away 
he has received many letters from the public some pretty 
nasty he said i think it was more convenient for people to 
vent their frustration at a person rather than a corporation or 
government entity he said 
but others have been supportive twelveyearold jennifer w of 
hudson ohio wrote that she once thought hazelwood was scum 
but after reading a magazine article about the accident she 
believed that hazelwood probably wasnt drunk that the third mate 
was qualified that the coast guard wasnt monitoring and that 
you saved many lives and made the spill smaller by keeping the 
boat on the reef 
his fellow shipmates and other mariners have written to say that 
they agree that maritime casualties occur throughout the world 
said hazelwood the only obvious solution not to have any more 
groundings is dont have any more ships 
but to hazelwood a world without ships is unimaginable while 
awaiting trial living with his wife and teenage daughter in 
huntington on long island he has earned his living lobstering 
he said he is mindful of the harmful effects of the valdez spill 
almost daily as he works long island sound in a friends fishing 
boat 
i see the pollution on the sound the industrial waste and 
its effects on fishing he said i can relate to the alaskans 
and their anguish 
before his tanker ran aground the longest he had been ashore 
since he was an adolescent was two or three months 
i get stark crazy when i am too far from the salt water he 
said

three us engineers remained under house 
arrest tuesday following a dispute over a destroyed technical 
manual and an official from their company said they had no word 
about when the men would be released 
we know nothing about their departure said len r webb 
lockheeds regional manager for africa and the middle east 
the three irving thrash marvin gambill and ernest ruse were 
arrested jan 5 and taken to ndjamena police barracks after they 
burned a technical instruction manual on maintenance procedures for 
the two new c130 transport aircraft purchased by chad 
they were held in the barracks for 10 days then transferred to 
the hotel la tchadienne in ndjamena where they had lived for a 
year fulfilling the maintenance contract on the c130s 
the three have been confined to the hotel grounds while waiting 
for their passports and chadian permission to leave 
webb said no charges were ever filed against the men nor were 
they illtreated their arrest was due to a misunderstanding 
he said and their continued detention was due to an 
administrative procedure 
no chadian officials seemed able to give any information tuesday 
night on how long it would be before they could leave 
you must remember they burned their maintenance document 
said information minister adoum moussaseif that is not in 
dispute but it is very serious the french colonial power did that 
sort of thing when they left chad 30 years ago 
we did not charge them but they really should not have burned 
the instruction manual to prevent it falling into our hands it 
reminded us too much of the colonial days 
the mens argument was that they had no state department export 
license for the disputed manual and there was no chadian who could 
understand it 
webbs assistant paul a lanegger arranged for an export 
license to be issued when he arrived in ndjamena and a full copy 
of the document has been handed to the chadians long ago 
but the three men two of them accompanied by their wives 
remained under house arrest in the hotel and armed soldiers and 
police patrolled the perimeter 
however there were reasons to hope the remaining difficulties 
would be resolved to allow them to leave the country before next 
tuesday the scheduled date of arrival of pope john paul ii on his 
first visit to chad 
one official said privately he was sure the government of 
president hissene habre would not want the americans still held 
when the pope arrived

bills that would fatten most americans 
paychecks and free billions of dollars in highway funds were among 
legislation introduced tuesday as congress returned to work 
other bills introduced when the second session of the 101st 
congress convened would raise the environmental protection agency 
to cabinet status and ban all spending for further production of 
the b2 stealth bomber 
aside from the epa legislation most of the bills would likely 
have a direct impact on the budget deficit and how the government 
raises money 
the b2 legislation aims to cash in on the easing of eastwest 
tensions while giving historys first 1 billion bomber a speedy 
and as far as the taxpayers are concerned merciful death 
said sen alan cranston dcalif a cosponsor with sen patrick 
leahy dvt 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny formally introduced a bill 
to reduce social security taxes which are withheld from every 
paycheck moynihan says social security taxes are being used to 
make the federal deficit appear far smaller as it it 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and chairman of the finance 
committee has already scheduled hearings for feb 5 and feb 8 on 
the proposal which has put the bush administration in the position 
of opposing a tax cut 
sen ernest f hollings dsc rolled democratic and 
administration tax proposals in one big ball he is calling the tax 
reform and competitiveness act 
that legislation offers some concessions to the bush proposal to 
lower the capital gains tax which spurred a host of 
counterproposals from the democrats including hollings own 
suggestion of creating a national sales tax 
the bill also embraces moynihans social security proposal and 
one by bentsen to restore the tax deduction for individual 
retirement accounts 
the bill additionally earmarks 45 billion in state revenue 
sharing and calls for 5 billion in tax credits for research and 
investment 
on budget and fiscal issues the political jousting and 
oneupmanship not to mention outright fraud and deceit threaten 
to spin out of control hollings said 
this is the fifth straight year that hollings has introduced 
legislation for a valueadded tax as the sales tax is technically 
known 
on another budgetary front sen richard bryan dnev 
introduced legislation that he said would free over 105 billion 
in highway money he says is being wrongly held in the federal 
highway trust fund 
the unspent balance represents the accumulated difference 
between revenues largely from the 9centagallon gasoline tax 
and federal highway authorizations critics say the money is 
deliberately underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a 
source of cheap money for government borrowing 
over the last decade the federal government has used the 
money collected by the federal gas tax as a deficitreduction 
gimmick bryan said 
legislation that would elevate the environmental protection 
agency to cabinet status was introduced in both the house and 
senate with supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear 
congress within several months 
sen john glenn dohio and chairman of the senate government 
operations committee said that the epa needs more clout and higher 
visibility in the adminstration because of the importance of 
environmental issues in the 1990s 
as for defense spending leahy said in a reference to the 
eastwest thaw that recent events have made the argument against 
the b2 even stronger 
his and cranstons bill would cancel the program except for the 
15 planes now in production leahy said taxpayers would save 40 
billion as a result 
cranston one of the socalled keating five introduced 
legislation that would allow the 23000 holders of worthless junk 
bonds sold through the lincoln savings and loan to sue federal 
regulators for approving the sale 
cranston is one of five senators undergoing an ethics inquiry 
for receiving contributions from lincoln owner charles keating jr 
and intervening with federal regulators on his behalf 
ethics legislation was introduced by sen chris dodd dconn 
whose proposal would prohibit senators from taking honoraria 
basically speaking fees and limiting outside earned income to 15 
percent of congressional salary he said the measure would bring 
senate rules in line with those approved by the house last year 
other bills 
reps silvio conte rmass and joseph brennan dmaine 
introduced bills to increase lowincome energy assistance subsidies 
after decembers unseasonable cold and low inventories sent heating 
oil costs skyrocketing 50 percent 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo introduced a bill she has 
been touting since the us invasion of panama last month that 
would remove existing congressinal prohibitions on women serving in 
combat 
banks and thrifts that launder drug money would lose their 
charters under a bill introduced by rep frank annunzio dill and 
chairman of the house banking financial institutions subcommittee 
and rep james trafficant dohio contributed to the budget 
fray by introducing a bill to repeal the 1985 grammrudman 
deficitreduction law which he referred to as that turkey that 
should be shot down

a major opposition leader said tuesday 
that bulgaria must follow the democratization model of east germany 
and czechoslovakia rather than soviet perestroika because the 
soviet union faces chaos 
zhelyu zhelev leader of the union of democratic forces was 
addressing talks attended by communists the opposition and other 
political and social groups aimed at achieving a national consensus 
on the pace and extent of democratization here the udf is made up 
of 12 independent parties 
the bta news agency quoted zhelev as saying the soviet union was 
faced with the danger of plunging into a civil war and military 
dictatorship 
the bulgarian restructuring should be modeled after the east 
european one based on the models of east germany and 
czechoslovakia a model of rapid changes unlike the soviet one 
zhelev was quoted as saying 
the faster bulgaria switches to the east european models of 
restructuring the more it will help the soviet union make the 
reforms irreversible which will result in the complete 
disintegration of the bastion of totalitarian regimes in europe and 
in the world 
zvetla daskalova justice minister and leader of the agrarian 
union told the meeting her party was opposed to retaining in the 
constitution bulgarias definition as a socialist state 
until recently the agrarians were completely dominated by the 
ruling communist party but now are showing increasing independence 
the opposition said the first free legislative elections should 
take place in november not in may as proposed by the communists 
and the agrarians to give the newly formed parties time to prepare 
and canvass for votes 
ms daskalova also said the the countrys name should be changed 
from the peoples republic of bulgaria to the republic of bulgaria 
or simply bulgaria 
she said her party does not agree with the communists that 
bulgaria must remain a socialist state and said this should be 
deleted from the constitution if there is to be a multiparty system 
the opposition earlier called for removing the constitutional 
clause defining bulgaria as a socialist state of the working 
class 
it also proposed partial elections to parliament in may but 
insisted the main parliamentary elections be held in november 
politburo member andrei lukanov protested tuesday the communist 
party wants may elections and any delay would slow down the 
entire process of democratization 
lukanov the chief communist delegate raised the possibility of 
a broad coalition government after the first multiparty elections 
saying we do not want to cling to power at any price 
but lukanov as quoted by bta suggested the communists were 
opposed to removing communist political control of the armed forces 
he said he agreed with defense minister dobri dzhurov who 
pleaded for a cautious approach to removing politics from the armed 
forces because of national security considerations 
bulgaria known for years as one of the kremlins most loyal 
allies was swept by reform demands last fall as was most of 
eastern europe communist leader todor zhivkov was replaced on nov 
10 after 35 years in power

an inmate who has refused to eat since 
march to protest his conviction on drug charges praised god tuesday 
after the michigan court of appeals threw out the convictions and 
life sentences 
one time more i say god gives me his blessings now i can 
show the people the power of our god is uneualed he is powerful 
said rene acuna 37 of detroit 
acuna who claimed he has lived on spiritual nutrition from god 
said he still will not eat until he is released from prison and can 
return home to his longtime companion anna sossa and his two 
daughters 
i keep my hunger strike that is my decision i will eat in 
the table of my house said acuna who now weighs 112 pounds 
down from 180 in a telephone interview 
the cuban immigrant insisted he was innocent of charges of 
delivery and conspiracy to deliver more than two pounds of cocaine 
the appeals court dismissed the prosecutions contention he was a 
lookout for drug dealers and said there was too little evidence to 
support his convictions noting others convicted with acuna said 
they had never heard of him 
the court declined to order a new trial for acuna who is 
serving a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole at 
the state prison of southern michigan at jackson 
this has been probably the most gutwrenching case i ever 
handled as a lawyer and the system has worked said paul 
denenfeld legal director for the michigan chapter of the american 
civil liberties union which defended acunas right to hunger 
strike 
we all believed this was simply a person who was in the wrong 
place at the wrong time and i think renes courageous hunger strike 
has vindicated him and we are thrilled we are just really 
pleased he said 
acunas appeal attorney michael schuck said the ruling does 
not mean immediate freedom for acuna a selfemployed handyman 
preparation for acunas appeal was shortened said assistant 
macomb county prosecutor michael suhy because this comedian was 
on a hunger strike and the appeals court speeded up the case 
he said he will appeal the decision and oppose efforts to have 
acuna released on bond pending the new appeal because of the 
possibility that he would flee but acunas lawyer said he should 
reconsider 
were in a situation where someones life is on the line he 
has been on a hunger strike about 10 months now and his life is in 
danger every day said schuck 
the man has suffered enough said denenfeld 
acuna has lived on a diet of water and sugarladen coffee since 
march 3 after a macomb county circuit court jury convicted him on 
the drug charges 
his weight had plunged to 106 pounds by sept 13 when doctors 
began forcefeeding him until he reached 125 pounds and acuna 
returned to his hunger strike 
sossa who was appointed his guardian said she wont sign 
papers permitting forcefeeding to resume 
acuna contended he was convicted solely because he was an 
hispanic who happened to be in an allwhite neighborhood when 
undercover agents bought drugs from other hispanics in a hotel 
parking lot in august 1988

an effort to stop youngsters from smoking 
at school was effectively snuffed out tuesday by cigarettepuffing 
lawmakers who said they wouldnt tamper with local school control 
over policies 
supporters of a bill to prohibit oncampus smoking by elementary 
and high school students accused the house agriculture committee of 
giving more weight to localcontrol concerns than to the health of 
youngsters 
on a vote of 103 the committee rejected sending the measure to 
the house floor and took no further action meaning the bill will 
languish in the committee probably for the remainder of the session 
some of the lawmakers lit cigarettes moments before the meeting 
began sending up a light haze that covered part of the room the 
committee has been a traditional ally of the tobacco industry 
which produces kentuckys leading cash crop 
kentucky is the nations no 2 tobacco producer and the top 
producer of aircured burley variety of tobacco in 1988 the 
latest year for which figures are available the state reported 
tobacco sales totaling 4717 million 
while saying they do not condone student smoking at school some 
committee members complained that the measure would reverse state 
policy by replacing local option with a state mandate banning 
student smoking 
i think it should be a superintendents decision and not the 
state legislatures said rep ray altman why are they asking 
us to tell their kids not to smoke when they have that authority 
themselves 
in 1988 the general assembly passed a law giving local school 
administrators the option of establishing smoking areas for 
students 
supporters of the bill said antismoking policy should become a 
state policy just like curriculum and attendance standards 
rep tom burch a cosponsor of the measure said the overriding 
issue is protecting the health of children 
cigarettes kill you he said do we just feed poison to 
our kids from now on if youre for the health of our children in 
the commonwealth you will support this bill 
theres a lot of support in the state to make it less possible 
and less acceptible for children to smoke said rep anne meagher 
northup the measures other cosponsor 
the concern about preserving local control seems a little 
frivolous when compared with protecting the health of 
youngsters northup said 
she said she would introduce legislation that would prohibit 
youngsters under the age of 16 from purchasing cigarettes state 
law currently has no minimum age for buying cigarettes 
in an attempt to do better with the next bill she said she 
hoped that measure would be assigned to the house health and 
welfare committee which might be more amenable to antismoking 
legislation 
wayne young executive director of the kentucky association of 
school administrators testified tuesday the bills enactment would 
free teachers from monitoring designated student smoking areas in 
schools 
thats a burden on the school staff that could be eliminated 
with passage of this bill he told the committee 
various other school and public health groups also supported the 
bill

house members were eager to vote to override president bushs 
veto of a bill allowing chinese students in the united states to 
remain here with republicans as well as democrats predicting the 
president will lose 
the vote was put off for a day but house members gathered 
outside the capitol for the television cameras in front of a 
replica of the statue of liberty dubbed goddess of democracy it 
was like the one the chinese students erected in beijing before the 
tanks rolled in last year 
rep richard gephardt dmo solemnly invoked the memory of 
jesus christ gandhi and martin luther king jr all in his first 
sentence 
before proceeding however the congressmen had to wait while 
capitol police used bombsniffing dogs to inspect the statue from 
all angles 
it seemed a bit undignified for a goddess 
the triumph of bureaucracy over democracy said one observer

congress will override president bushs veto 
of a bill protecting visiting chinese students in a dazzler of 
onesided sentiment the chief republican senate votecounter 
predicted tuesday 
the first showdown of the newly convened 1990 congress will come 
wednesday in the house where republicans already had conceded they 
would not muster more than a handful of votes to support bushs 
position 
the administration has concentrated its lobbying efforts on the 
senate hoping to get the 34 votes there that would be needed to 
stave off a twothirds majority vote to override but alan simpson 
rwyo who is supporting bush said the president wouldnt get 
five votes 
this thing is gonna be overridden and it will be a dazzler 
he said 
however a gop source speaking only on condition of anonymity 
said simpson was reporting a far closer tally privately and 
suggested his rhetoric may be designed to hold wavering republicans 
in line 
bush invited senate republicans to the white house for breakfast 
thursday to lobby them personally on the bill 
bush on nov 30 vetoed the bill which would allow as many as 
32000 eligible chinese students to extend their stays in the 
united states and avoid persecution in their homeland stemming from 
last junes government crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
the president says he has effectively taken the same action as 
the bill by executive order and that the legislation amounts to 
unwarranted congressional meddling 
secretary of state james a baker iii dispatched to meet with 
senate republicans over lunch said afterward that it was too early 
to say how the vote would go and added we found some support in 
there this afternoon 
simpson while conceding defeat criticized democrats for using 
the issue as a blunt cudgel to inflict unfair political damage 
on bush 
does anyone in the congress really truly believe that the 
president will require students to return home to face persecution 
come on for heavens sakes the veto override is being led by 
those who would like to scrape a little luster off bushs high 
approval ratings in the polls he said 
simpsons prediction came as supporters of the bill sought to 
build momentum putting chinese students before television cameras 
to allege harassment by their countrys consular officials in the 
united states and to denounce administration policy toward china 
mr president america is on the side of the students who 
stood in the square and called for freedom not the dictators who 
called out the tanks said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo 
haiching zhao a harvard biology scholar and an official of the 
independent federation of chinese students and scholars said at a 
senate judiciary subcommittee hearing that the bill is necessary to 
protect students and help shield them from harassment 
but in addition it would help persuade the beijing government 
that the only way to ensure our return is not through 
negotiations with the white house but through genuine improvement 
of human rights in china zhao said 
while bush has taken administrative steps to shield students 
from being forced back to china and into unsafe conditions he 
said those steps offer only tenuous protection and send no signal 
at all to the chinese government 
as an example of harassment zhao said chinese consular 
officials a week ago visited an unidentified california school and 
warned students that the prodemocracy movement was an outlaw 
organization and that participation will trigger severe 
reprisals against the students and their relatives back in china 
the president has simply made a mistake said rep mickey 
edwards rokla a member of the house gop leadership but the 
american congress and the american people stand very strongly with 
those people in china 
the vetoed bill would affect 32000 of the estimated 40000 
chinese students in the united states those who hold exchange 
visitor visas such visas require students to return to china for 
at least two years following their time in the united states before 
being able to return or go elsewhere the bill would waive that 
requirement 
if the override attempt succeeds the bush administration still 
could raise constitutional objections and force congress to go to 
court to enforce its action the white house regards its action as 
a pocket veto and not subject to an override because it came eight 
days after congress had adjourned for the year

a new financial evaluation of the thrift 
industry may show that a second installment is needed on president 
bushs 50 billion savings and loan bailout a senior treasury 
department official said tuesday 
it is possible that the 50 billion will prove inadequate 
deputy secretary john e robson the departments no 2 official 
told the house banking committee 
his testimony marks a subtle shift in the administration 
position although officials had previously acknowledged they could 
not guarantee 50 billion was enough to shut down failed thrifts 
through august 1992 they had always maintained they knew of no 
reason why their estimate would prove wrong 
on tuesday robson said treasurys office of thrift supervision 
is compiling a new watch list of weak sampls that may indicate 
resolution costs beyond the original estimates 
at the end of last week the resolution trust corp created by 
legislation in august to handle failed thrifts had taken over 342 
institutions disposing of 40 of them 
it had been expecting to take over an additional 200 thrifts 
from regulators over the next 2 years and robson acknowledged that 
the new watch list due to be completed early next month will 
likely be bigger 
if we come to a point where we dont have enough funds to 
continue well come up and ask for more he said 
private analysts and some members of congress have been saying 
for months that the 50 billion will amount to little more than a 
down payment on the cost of resolving the nations worse financial 
problem since the depression 
committee members warned robson that congress had little stomach 
for earmarking additional taxpayer money for sampls 
its quite clear at least at this point in time that theres 
not a great steamroller moving to appropriate additional funds 
said rep jim leach riowa 
robson indicated that by late february or march the rtc would 
need to begin borrowing the first installments of 40 billion to 
100 billion in working capital this would be repaid by 
selling assets from failed sampls and would not add to the 50 
billion cost of covering thrift losses he said 
panel members were skeptical however saying that the 
administration could use the additional borrowing to disguise 
whether the sampl problem had grown 
frankly working capital is a euphemism for an increased cost 
of the problem said rep bruce vento dminn 
robson however promised that the administration would 
separately account for the working capital 
tuesdays hearing was the first of three by the house panel into 
the administrations conduct of the cleanup since enactment of the 
bush plan aug 9 the senate banking committee is following with a 
fourth session next week 
robson was representing an administration oversight board that 
controls the pursestrings and policy of the bailout also appearing 
were oversight board members alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve board and jack kemp secretary of housing 
resolution trust corp officials including federal deposit 
insurance corp chairman l william seidman are scheduled to 
testify wednesday

a military transport plane crashed and 
exploded in the hills west of the capital shortly after takeoff 
tuesday morning killing all 24 people aboard officials said 
investigators said fog and rain was probably to blame for the 
crash of the spanishbuilt twinengine aviocar which was carrying 
13 venezuelan navy men eight civilians and three crew 
rescue officials said the craft en route to a port on the 
orinoco river crashed just outside the hamlet of la sabaneta 
little blanket 15 miles west of caracas 
the pilot apparently was able to maneuver the plane at the last 
moment to crash in a deserted area rather than strike houses in the 
poor neighborhood according to preliminary reports by civil 
defense officials 
the airplane had just taken off from caracass simon bolivar 
international airport on a flight to puerto ayacucho on the 
orinoco 400 miles south of caracas the military personnel were to 
serve at an outpost near the brazilian border 
with the fog in those hills it must have been hard for them 
even with radar said antonio vargas an official with civil 
defense crews working in the cleanup operation 
a man living nearby said the plane was flying low it 
didnt sound like motor trouble 
residents rushed to the scene but the flames and repeated 
explosions kept them from approaching the plane firefighters 
quickly extinguished the blaze 
so far 19 bodies have been recovered by rescue workers most of 
them burned beyond recognition officials said among the bodies 
were two women and a child presumably military dependents 
we brought three ambulances up here immediately but all weve 
found are corpses said mercedes vivas a doctor with caracas 
firefighters 
national guard troops firefighters and police rescue workers 
combed the rubble 
military and civilian officials are not expected to determine 
the official cause of the accident for several days said vargas 
but nearly all speculation points to bad weather as the culprit he 
added 
the caracas area has been shrouded in heavy fog and rain the 
last three days due to an unusual low pressure system over the 
area according to the observatorio cajigal a local meteorological 
station

the soviets agree they have no reason 
to keep soldiers in hungary and negotiations will begin within days 
on withdrawing all 52000 premier miklos nemeth said tuesday 
i have spoken with premier ryzhkov twice in recent weeks and 
we agreed that the basis for stationing soviet troops on 
hungarian soil has outlived itself nemeth told parliament 
referring to premier nikolai ryzhkov of the soviet union 
there are neither military nor political reasons for their 
being here 
much of the parliament session was dominated by the resignation 
of interior minister istvan horvath because of a scandal about 
government spying on the political opposition 
mti the official news agency said the first session of 1990 is 
to consider an array of bills and amendments on religious freedom 
the media and selling state assets to private owners 
in a live telecast horvath said the dismantling of the old 
communist structure is very complicated reforming the state 
security apparatus was left for last if i am guilty i am so of 
not having been consistent enough in seeing that the changes are 
implemented 
jozsef horvath head of the state security services internal 
department and ferenc pallagi deputy interior minister and state 
security chief both resigned recently the horvaths are not 
related 
last week a security service officer said he fed information to 
the political opposition about surveillance by his service as the 
country prepares for its first free elections in 40 years 
after the minister stepped down tuesday miklos haraszti a 
leading member of the league of free democrats said in a telephone 
interview horvaths resignation was inevitable but we are not 
in the least satisfied 
he said the security force must be disbanded by an impartial 
commissioner or it will be business as usual without the public 
knowing who these people are 
nemeth suggested creation of a parliament committee to supervise 
security organizations 
about the withdrawal of soviet troops nemeth said the hungarian 
armed forces are fully capable of defending the territorial 
integrity and sovereignty of the country hungarys strategic and 
geopolitical position makes it possible for the ussr to 
withdraw its troops at the earliest possible time 
he said hungarian and soviet experts would meet in budapest in 
the next few days the withdrawal schedule will be determined 
by technical factors and the hungarian militarys capacity to 
meet the new situation he told parliament 
the international situation is favorable and our image of the 
enemy has changed nemeth declared 
limited troop withdrawals began last april and 10000 soldiers 
left in 1989 czechoslovakia and poland also seek total withdrawal 
of soviet forces from their territory but there has been no word 
on whether moscow has agreed

the director of the central intelligence 
agency told congress tuesday that eastern europes tumultuous push 
for democracy has cut the soviet threat to the west and that we 
can probably expect a continued diminution 
william webster in an unusual public appearance before the 
senate armed services committee said that as unchallenged 
communist control comes to an end in the eastern bloc those 
nations links to moscow have been radically changed 
the result he said is a severe blow to the soviet unions 
certainty that eastern europe will respond to moscows military 
directives 
the armed services committee is beginning work on writing a 
defense budget for fiscal 1991 with an assessment of the soviet 
threat to the west 
overall the conventional threat to the united states and our 
alliance partners in europe has decreased as a result of changes in 
eastern europe and soviet force reductions webster told the 
panel 
the cia director cautioned however that the soviet union is 
vigorously upgrading its strategic forces 
webster cited the soviets deployment last year of two new 
silobased nuclear missiles the continued deployment of ss25 and 
ss24 railmobile missiles and the launching of new typhoon and 
deltaiv ballistic missile submarines 
the soviets also have made considerable gains in the 
antisubmarine effort but they still will be unable at least in 
this decade to threaten us subs in the open ocean webster said 
in what appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for the 
cia and other intelligence agencies webster said the united states 
must maintain its intelligence capability he pointed to the 
continued soviet strategic modernization and to terrorism illegal 
drugs uncertainty in latin america asia and the middle east and 
weapons proliferation 
intelligence operations are hidden in the defense department 
budget which faces significant cuts on capitol hill this year 
although the exact figures are secret us intelligence reportedly 
spends 25 billion to 30 billion a year just under 10 percent of 
the defense budget 
in his public statement webster emphasized that the situation 
in eastern europe and the soviet union is in constant flux with 
widespread economic problems turmoil in regional areas and the 
communist partys reduced power 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is committed to reforms 
but they have been slow in coming the cia director said the 
chance of gorbachevs removal as kremlin leader is unlikely and a 
major reversal of his policies would come only if he is removed 
from power webster said 
nevertheless we can probably expect a continued diminution 
but not elimination of soviet threats to us interests the 
cia director said 
a questionandanswer session with members of the committee was 
held in closed session 
the director of the defense intelligence agency agreed with 
webster telling the committee that the threat of deliberate 
aggression directed against europe and its extension to global 
conflict is much reduced 
lt gen harry soyster said he based his assessment on 
developments in eastern europe and on soviet armed forces 
reductions in keeping with gorbachevs december 1988 proposal to 
cut troop strength 
soyster said that by the middle of the decade independently 
developed political and economic relationships will likely lead to 
the phase out of the warsaw pacts collective military security 
role a new series of security agreements between the soviet union 
and east european nations could emerge 
the defense intelligence director said the fastmoving events 
may speed up the removal of soviet forces and the the evolution 
toward such a new security order 
he also told the panel he believes that the soviets would 
consider largescale theater operations against nato with only 
their own forces as highly risky if not impractical soyster 
said 
the hearing marked the first in a series of committee sessions 
to assess the soviet threat the panel will use that data when it 
writes a defense budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
president bush plans to submit his budget proposal next week 
weve seen the threat change on tv every night sen sam 
nunn dga and the committees chairman said as the hearing 
beganwell be looking at this changed threat as the foundation 
on which we build the budget which we will be asking the american 
people to pay for

john poindexter must produce a list of 
specific questions he intends to ask former president reagan at 
poindexters irancontra trial a federal judge ordered tuesday 
us district court judge harold greene said poindexters 
request for reagans testimony was too broad encompassing 
wideranging subjects such as us use of foreign airfields and 
meetings between reagan and the tower commission 
greene said that until such focused questions are submitted 
he will be unable to decide whether to approve poindexters request 
to subpoena reagan at the former national security advisers trial 
scheduled to begin feb 20 
the questions to be submitted by monday will be given to 
reagan and the justice department but not to irancontra 
prosecutors 
poindexters lawyers argued before the ruling that reagan is 
erecting a smokescreen of legal objections and is engaging in 
graymail to avoid testifying in the irancontra scandal 
attorneys for the former president say poindexter must show a 
specific need for reagans testimony and raised the possibility 
that he might inadvertently divulge national secrets while 
testifying 
that is basically graymail your honor said poindexter 
lawyer frederick robinson its a tactic to avoid having to 
testify in this case we think the whole issue of constitutionality 
is a smokescreen to avoid coming to court 
reagan has time to go to japan and write a book he certainly 
has time to come to court robinson said 
graymail is the tactic of trying to inject as much classified 
information into a criminal case as possible the term usually is 
used in the context of defense lawyers who are trying to force the 
government to seek dismissal of charges on national security 
grounds 
reagan lawyer theodore olson said poindexter must show the 
former presidents testimony would be favorable to the defendant 
and would be information not available from other witnesses 
poindexter has submitted a secret document to the judge saying 
he frequently met alone with reagan 
olson questioned that assertion saying white house chief of 
staff donald regan and a poindexter aide as well as thenvice 
president bush were present at daily morning meetings in 1986 
on another matter irancontra prosecutors said richard secord 
is refusing to recant or modify his testimony in the scandal 
the government and secord continue to be at odds over the 
truth of the testimony about his profits the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh said in a court filing 
the government alleged in an indictment that secord made more 
than 1 million by assisting norths resupply network to the 
contras and the administrations secret arms sales to iran 
secord who faces sentencing wednesday pleaded guilty to making 
a false statement when he said he was unaware that any proceeds 
from the irancontra scandal benefitted former white house aide 
oliver north secord paid for a 13800 security system at norths 
home 
secord faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine

medellin cartel leader pablo escobar 
said tuesday he still was in control of colombias most powerful 
cocaine trafficking outfit and that it was united in its decision 
to seek peace with the government 
escobar no 1 on the most wanted list also swore his cartel 
would continue a war with a rival organization based in the 
southern city of cali 
he accused the cali cartel of providing authorities with 
information that led to the death of his close associate gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha in a shootout with police last month 
escobar wrote to el tiempo publisher hernando santos castillo 
denying a report monday in the bogota newspaper that the medellin 
cartel was split the article quoted security force officials as 
saying escobars main allies were abandoning him as police and the 
military closed in 
my freedom is the best proof i have to show the country that 
the people are not selling me out and that my friends are neither 
abandoning nor betraying me said the letter also sent to other 
news media 
it bore escobars signature and what was apparently the imprint 
of his index finger intended to prove its authenticity 
authorities have failed to apprehend escobar despite a 
government offer of 500000 for information leading to his capture 
dead or alive 
escobar said the entire cartel was behind a peace offer made by 
its leaders last week to the government of president virgilio barco 
military forces said meanwhile on tuesday that they were taking 
the necessary measures to protect president bush from escobar and 
other traffickers when bush attends an antidrug summit in the 
coastal city of cartagena on feb 15 
us authorities have reportedly said traffickers are preparing 
an attempt on bushs life during the five hours he is to spend in 
cartagena 
the barco administration has extradited 13 trafficking suspects 
to the united states as part of an antidrug campaign that was 
intensified last august 
the drug lords responded with a terror campaign that killed 209 
people including bombing a colombian airliner 
the peace offer by the medellin cartel last week unlike 
previous proposals did not specifically demand an end to 
extradition of suspects to the united states the measure 
traffickers fear most 
it asked only for constitutional and legal guarantees in 
exchange for the cartels agreeing to abandon the cocaine trade 
lay down its arms and release its hostages 
since last week the cartel has released five hostages 
including the son of barcos closest aide but still holds 16 
people 
el tiempo reported monday the peace offer was made by the 
cartels leaders escobar and jorge luis ochoa and that other 
traffickers in the organization opposed any accommodation with the 
government 
escobars message tuesday seemed to confirm the belief that 
traffickers still demand an end to extradition he underscored his 
desire for a peace with the government that would stress colombian 
sovereignty 
he also indicated no disagreement existed in the cartel over the 
peace offer 
if the colombian government someday decides to fight for the 
peace of our nation in a sovereign and courageous way it will find 
an interminable list of extradition candidates drug traffickers 
hired assassins and paramilitary forces that want to join it in the 
process the letter read 
the letter said cali cartel member jorge valasquez gave police 
information that led them to rodriguez gacha who was considered 
the most violent of the medellin drug bosses 
the government scored its most notable success in the antidrug

the senate began consideration of a sweeping 
air pollution control bill tuesday that president bush calls too 
expensive but which supporters maintain is needed to protect the 
health of millions of americans 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
legislation essential to protect the health of americans but 
said he does not intend to force the pace of the legislation 
he said none of the bills controversial provisions would be 
considered before next week 
in opening remarks sen max baucus dmont one of the bills 
floor managers predicted some of the strongest provisons would be 
fought by industry especially automakers 
we can appease the special interests or we can meet them 
head on he declared 
the senate bill calls for cutting acidrain pollutants from 
electric power plants in half tightening auto emission controls 
and requiring industries to install new technology to curb toxic 
chemical releases its tougher than a cleanair bill before the 
house and the proposal sent to congress by president bush last year 
senate leaders said there was bipartisan support for toughening 
the 1970 clean air act but they acknowledged that regional 
opposition to portions of the bill especially the acidrain 
provisions is likely to prompt heated debate in the coming weeks 
midwestern senators whose state have many of the utility plants 
that would have to install expensive pollutioncontrol equipment 
argue the costs should be shared by other parts of the country 
other senators and the white house strongly oppose such cost 
sharing arguing it amounts to a national electricity tax 
baucus in opening the floor debate noted that it has been 20 
years since the first federal clean air law was enacted and 13 
years since it was last amended our action we take will 
affect public health well into the 21st century he said he 
noted at another point that 150 million americans now live in areas 
where the air at times does not meet federal health standards 
but as the 101st congress convened its second session tuesday 
some senators grumbled about the sweeping provisions in the bill 
mitchell agreed that many of the senators had not yet had an 
opportunity to examine the 500page bill which cleared the senate 
environment and public works committee in november and was not in 
print until late december 
earlier senate minority leader bob dole rkan said theres 
division among republicans not based on partisanship so much as on 
geography to the legislation the bill will take some time 
he added 
earlier in the week bush raised objections to the senate 
legislation which is more stringent than the house bill or the 
administrations proposal bush maintained the senate bill will 
cost double the estimated 19 billion annual cost of the 
administration proposal senate democrats called the presidents 
estimates inflated 
both the senate and house bills as well as the bush proposal 
call for a 10 million ton reduction in acidrain pollutants 
require automakers to tighten tailpipe emission controls to meet 
california standards nationwide and require industry to install the 
best available technology to control toxicair releases

a west german newspaper on tuesday 
quoted an adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as 
saying the soviets would not stop german unification if the east 
germans want it 
but nikolai portugalov gorbachevs adviser on german affairs 
was also quoted by the hamburgbased bild newspaper as cautioning 
against forced acceleration of unification because it could 
undermine europe 
germany was divided into communist east and capitalist west 
after adolf hitlers nazi regime was defeated in world war ii 
asked about his feelings on the berlin wall being opened and on 
german unification portugalov was quoted as saying its 
refreshing its in the atmosphere in berlin and at the borders 
which have finally fallen 
if the people of the german democratic republic want 
reunification it will come we will in no case be against this 
decision and interfere but a chaotic reunification serves no one 
portugalov said he sees some danger of chaos resulting from 
exalted emotions of certain circles in the federal republic west 
germany which are a mistake bild reported 
we must be careful that the national order doesnt break down 
in east germany 
the interview is to appear in bilds wednesday editions it was 
provided in advance to other news media 
portugalov reportedly said that reality and stability in europe 
cannot be fully ignored and the process of unifying should only be 
within the entire european concept 
why should this process be artifically speeded up 
sometimes you germans remind me of someone who has won a 
lotto jackpot and have nothing more in your heads than to rush to 
monte carlo to gamble away your winnings bild quoted him as 
saying 
asked what benefits he could see for the soviets if the germans 
united economically portugalov was quoted as saying he saw it as a 
positive move 
if everything goes well it would help us enormously it

blacks and other ethnic minorities are 
underrepresented in the british military because they fear racial 
discrimination according to a governmentcommissioned report 
released tuesday 
the researchers also said they encountered racially offensive 
language from armed forces personnel at all levels during the 
investigation 
management consultants peat marwick mclintock who conducted 
the study for the defense ministry said minorities comprised only 
11 percent of the military compared with about four percent of 
the population 
during interviews with all levels views were expressed to us 
and phrases used which would be considered racially offensive 
the report said 
we cannot be certain the use of racist language or 
stereotyping betrays underlying racist attitudes the report 
added we do believe however that such views have no place in 
an organization committed to providing equal opportunities 
armed forces minister archie hamilton said minority recruitment 
will be stepped up following the report 
in a written statement to parliament he said the results of the 
report suggested many attitudes of young whites and blacks were 
similar 
however they blacks are less likely to consider a career in 
the armed forces for a number of reasons including in many cases 
they fear that they will encounter racial discrimination 
hamilton said 
in a test case a governmentfunded labor tribunal said monday 
it will hear allegations of racial discrimination against the 
defense ministry by a black former member of the elite grenadier 
guards 
winston lindsay 25 one of only two black guardsmen went 
absent without leave in october 1988 after allegedly being 
ridiculed bullied and assaulted by white guardsmen 
he was later discharged from the army for failing to disclose a 
previous assault conviction and turned down when he tried to 
reenlist 
most blacks in britain are immigrants from former colonies in 
africa asia and the caribbean and their descendants 
london metropolitan police have eliminated minimum height 
restrictions in a bid to attract more minorities to the force 
assistant commissioner wyn jones said monday that the minimum 
5foot8 for men and 5foot4 for women represented aboveaverage 
heights for people from the bangladeshi chinese and vietnamese 
communities 
london has 440 minority police officers or 15 percent of the 
force in a city where nonwhites constitute 10 percent of the 67 
million residents 
about 60 percent of the citys 30000strong force lives outside 
the city 
the metropolitan police will spend 24 million on an 
advertising campaign to attract minority recruits

the white house expressed confidence tuesday 
that president bush can be adequately protected during a visit to 
colombia despite reports that drug lords may try to shoot down air 
force one with a shoulderfired missile 
bush on a trip to kansas city mo merely smiled when 
reporters asked him about the reported threat 
the secret service says it can provide the president security 
and the president intends to go to a drug summit in cartagena 
colombia on feb 15 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said 
likewise the colombian ambassador to the united states victor 
mosquera chaux dismissed the report 
i believe colombian terrorists dont yet have missiles he 
said i believe that its a simple rumor if they had them they 
would have used them already against government helicopters and 
aircraft 
mosquera said his government is confident that we can and will 
provide the necessary security required for this meeting 
cbs news reported monday the secret service was checking the 
reports that colombian drug lords were smuggling sa7 
shoulderfired antiaircraft missiles into colombia for an attempt 
to shoot down bushs plane 
but fitzwater said that his own inquiries on the matter had 
drawn a blank and that the secret service apparently also is 
unaware of such specific threats 
nobody here seems to have heard of missiles fitzwater said 
he said the secret service has made several survey tours to 
the summit site and is convinced it can protect the president 
the report was the latest in a string of purported threats on 
the president or members of his family by colombian drug cartels

president vaclav havel said 
tuesday he would invite presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev to 
hold a summit meeting in prague 
havel told parliament he would propose his capital for the 
ussoviet meeting during visits this year to moscow and 
washington 
he also proposed the word socialist be dropped from the 
official name of the czechoslovak socialist republic 
part of the session was taken up by legislators demands for 
withdrawal of soviet soldiers stationed in czechoslovakia since 
1968 when a warsaw pact invasion ended the prague spring 
reforms 
legislator michael kocab said the agreement on temporary 
deployment of soviet troops on czechoslovak territory is an 
obvious violation of international law especially the un charter 
and the warsaw treaty the agreement should be declared null and 
void from the beginning 
a joint commission discussed the matter jan 10 in prague and 
indicated it would be settled next month 
since czechoslovakias whirlwind revolution which took less 
than a month and led to a noncommunist government in december 
officials have demanded the estimated 75000 soviet troops leave 
leave by the end of 1990 
havel a dissident playwright often jailed before the 
revolution told legislators tuesday that he would like to 
present to mr gorbachev various important and mutually 
interconnected proposals including the offer to hold his future 
meeting with mr bush in prague 
naturally i will present the same proposal shortly afterward 
to mr bush during the big state visit to the united states 
havel said in his first major speech to parliament since it elected 
him president dec 29 
dates of the visit to moscow have not been announced but 
presidential spokesman michael zantovsky said it was scheduled for 
beginning of february he did not say when havel would visit 
the united states 
bush and gorbachev are tentatively scheduled to meet in june in 
the united states it was not clear whether havel was suggesting 
that summit be moved to prague 
in washington bush spokesman roman popadiuk said no official 
word of the invitation had arrived and there are no plans for 
anything beyond the june summit at this time 
there was no immediate reaction from moscow 
in suggesting the change in czechoslovakias official name 
havel said the word socialism lost meaning in our linguistic 
context the moral political and economic crisis in our country is 
linguistically inseparable from this word 
he said the national coat of arms that combined traditional and 
communist symbols was heraldic nonsense parliament has adopted 
a new coat of arms that includes the historic christian symbols of 
the czechs and slovaks

president bush has decided to endorse a 
proposal that would elevate the environmental protection agency to 
cabinet status and give it greater clout within the government 
administration and congressional sources said tuesday 
the president was expected to meet wednesday with key sponsors 
of legislation that would create a department of the environment 
and afterward announce his support for the move the sources said 
earlier this week administration officials confirmed that key 
presidential advisers in recent months have expressed support for 
elevating the epa a regulatory agency created in 1970 to a higher 
status but that the president had not made a final decision 
bush during his first year in office had not looked favorably at 
expanding the cabinet maintaining that such a move would interfere 
with efficient management of the government the epa would become 
the 15th cabinet agency 
but as the environment has become an increasingly highprofile 
issue there has been growing momentum in congress to put the epa 
on par with other agencies of the government supporters argued 
that in an era in which environmental issues are often global the 
united states is one of only a few industrial nations that does not 
have an environmental advocate on the ministerial or cabinet 
level 
bipartisan bills were introduced in the house and senate on 
tuesday calling for the creation of a department of the environment 
and elevating the epa administrator to a cabinet secretary 
the bills also call for creation of a presidential commission 
that would examine the effectiveness of current environmental laws 
and recommend ways to streamline the governments effeciveness in 
implementing environmental regulations 
administration sources said that while bush continues to have 
concerns about some aspects of the bills he plans to express his 
support for adding the epa to the cabinet 
sen john glenn dohio and a cosponsor of the senate 
legislation said the senate government operations committee which 
he chairs will give the measure an early hearing 
glenn said he expected the bill to have widespread support 
in the house similar legislation was introduced with two dozen 
cosponsors 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house governor 
operations committee said he hoped the bill could be approved 
before the earth day celebrations in late april

alcohol consumption is at its lowest level in 
two decades but it still is more widely used than any other drug 
or cigarettes a government report said tuesday 
the report said a steady decline in alcohol consumption since 
1981 may be the result of increased public awareness about the 
risks of alcohol use as well as the aging of the population 
consumption is lower among people over 60 
another reason the report suggested is increasing concern 
about health and fitness which also has contributed to the 
decrease in smoking said the report by the department of health 
and human services 
the 400page document the seventh special report to the us 
congress on alcohol and health compiles the latest scientific 
advances in understanding the health consequences of alcohol abuse 
the report is issued every three years 
the report calculates that per capita consumption was 254 
gallons of pure alcohol in 1987 the lowest level since 1970 the 
formula used for the calculation takes into account the relative 
differences in alcohol content of beer wine and spirits 
consumption of spirits dropped to its lowest level since 1958 
estimated at 083 gallons of pure alcohol per capita in 1987 the 
report said beer and wine consumption remained about the same in 
1987 as in the previous year 
the report also cites a us household survey of people over age 
12 in 1988 by the national institute on drug abuse showing that 
734 percent reported drinking alcohol in the past year while 362 
percent reported smoking cigarettes 
the report also found 
about 105 million us adults show signs of alcoholism and 72 
million suffer from alcohol abuse although they do now show signs 
of dependence 
high school seniors showed a decline in alcohol use during the 
1980s but in 1988 one study showed 92 percent had tried alcohol 
nearly twothirds were current drinkers and more than a third were 
occasional heavy drinkers 
nearly half of all motor vehicle accidents are alcoholrelated 
about 25 percent of hospital patients have alcoholrelated 
problems 
the cost of alcohol abuse and dependence is estimated at 1363 
billion 
the report can be obtained from the national clearinghouse for 
alcohol and drug information po box 2345 rockville md 20852 
it will be available in about six weeks the department said

a moslem from soviet central asia has been 
sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of spying for afghan 
rebels the tass news agency reported tuesday 
tass said abdulkhamid davlatov tried to set up an underground 
group of soviet moslems in the southern republic of tadzhikistan 
to struggle for the overthrow of the existing system 
davlatov admitted his guilt tass said he was charged with high 
treason antisoviet activity and illegally crossing the border 
some previous high treason convictions have been punished with 
death 
the report came at a time when predominantly moslem azerbaijanis 
have torn down large sections of the border with iran entered open 
battles with their mainly christian armenian neighbors and begun 
calling for secession 
the unrest which has evoked approving reaction in 
fundamentalist iran has raised the prospect long predicted by 
western scholars of an islamic awakening among the soviet unions 
tens of millions of moslems 
davlatov 34 crossed the border into afghanistan in mid1988 
and was sent by afghan rebels he tied up with to an intelligence 
center in pakistan tass said recruited by a spy chief tass 
identified as a certain bashir he agreed to return to the 
soviet union and foment subversion 
but tadzhikistans kgb chief vladimir petkel told tass 
davlatov was under surveillance as soon as he crossed back into the 
soviet union and his network of contacts has been uncovered 
petkel said the kgb had foiled several attempts by pakistani 
intelligence and afghan rebels to involve soviet citizens in 
hostile actions on soviet territory he gave no details 
tass said bashir had been active in trying to foster subversion 
in central asia there have been few previous reports of afghan 
rebels actively trying to recruit their fellow moslems across the 
border 
the rebels fought soviet troops during their nineyear 
involvement in afghanistan which ended last february and are 
continuing to oppose the countrys sovietbacked government

the interior department is preparing to 
announce a new computer system aimed at blocking violators of the 
nations strip mining laws from receiving new coal mining permits 
sources said tuesday 
the agreement said to have been approved by interior secretary 
manuel lujan is aimed at settling the latest skirmish in a 10year 
legal battle to compel the department to rigidly enforce 
stripmining laws 
sources close to the negotiations who spoke on condition that 
they not be identified said lujan was ready to announce the terms 
of the agreement at a news conference on wednesday 
filed in 1980 by an environmental group named save our 
cumberland mountains the suit arose out of the conviction of many 
residents of the coal mining regions of appalachia that strip 
mining laws were going unenforced under interior secretary james 
watt 
an initial settlement was reached in 1981 with the filing of a 
court order directing the department to install a computer system 
to match up past violators of the law with new applicants for coal 
mining permits 
critics of the previous enforcement system complained that in 
many cases stip mine operators found to have violated the law 
simply changed the name of their companies and applied for a new 
permit at another location 
many such operators were failing to comply with the provisions 
of the law that the land be restored after the mining was completed 
but the computer did not end complaints and environmentalists 
contended it had been wholly ineffective 
early last year the save our cumberland mountains organization 
sought a court order to hold the interior department in contempt of 
court for alleged noncompliance with the earlier court order that 
it strictly enforce the stripmining law 
the groups action resulted in intense negotiations with the 
department and leading to the reported agreement 
details of how the new system would improve on the old system 
were not immediately available

congressional budget experts believe it will 
take 74 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases to meet next 
years federal deficit target about twice as much as the bush 
administration believes a congressional source said tuesday 
the congressional budget office is projecting that the budget 
deficit for the 1991 fiscal year beginning oct 1 short of any 
action by lawmakers would be 138 billion the official said that 
would mean that 74 billion in higher revenues or spending cuts 
would be needed to meet the 64 billion target set for next year by 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the budget office is scheduled to release its official 
projection of the 1991 budget shortfall on wednesday to the senate 
budget committee 
when president bush unveils his proposed 1991 budget on monday 
he is expected to say that 30 billion to 35 billion in budget 
savings are needed to meet grammrudmans 64 billion deficit 
target bush is expected to propose spending 123 trillion next 
year 
the estimates are different because the administration is using 
more optimistic forecasts for economic growth than the budget 
office is using 
by law the administrations shortfall forecast is binding 
leaving the budget office figures little more than advisory but 
the projections by the nonpartisan office are considered by many 
lawmakers and budget observers to be more reliable than those from 
the white house 
under grammrudman automatic spending cuts are triggered in 
most federal programs should congress and the president fail to 
agree to savings that meet the deficit target that happened last 
fall but a compromise between president bush and congress was 
enacted that will lift the cuts early next month 
the deficit targets set by grammrudman however apply only to 
the coming fiscal year the law sets no penalties if the actual 
deficit ends up exceeding the legal target which has happened 
every year since grammrudman was enacted in 1985 
the white houses office of management and budget is expected to 
forecast that the economy will expand this year by about 26 
percent measured from the fourth quarter of last year through the 
third quarter of 1990 cbos projection will be 18 percent the 
source said 
as a rule of thumb every 1 percentage point in economic growth 
adds 25 billion to federal revenue collections since a healthier

a former plumber convicted then cleared in the 
murder of a newspaper reporter was ordered tuesday to stand trial 
again more than 13 years after the fatal car bombing 
maricopa county superior court judge thomas otooles order came 
during a preliminary hearing for james robison who was convicted 
with two other men in the slaying of investigative reporter don 
bolles of the arizona republic 
robisons 1977 conviction and that of max dunlap were overturned 
in 1980 by the arizona supreme court but state attorney general 
bob corbin reopened the case several months ago and filed a new 
murder charge against robison last november 
dunlap and the third man who remains in prison pending appeal 
were not charged again 
bolles 47 died 11 days after a remotecontrolled bomb attached 
to his car exploded june 2 1976 at a phoenix hotel the motive 
has remained murky with a tangle of theories about who ordered the 
death 
no mastermind has ever been charged 
robisons chief attorney tom henze did not immediately return 
a reporters telephone call after the preliminary hearing but 
contends that corbin lacked authority to file the new charge 
henze said state prosecutors lacked jurisdiction because only 
county attorneys and county grand juries can initiate murder cases 
otoole ruled state prosecutors filed the charge against robison 
pursuant to a grant of authority by maricopa county attorney 
richard romley 
henze challenged that ruling and went to the state court of 
appeals which scheduled arguments for feb 14 but refused to delay 
robisons preliminary hearing 
otoole heard four days of testimony at the preliminary hearing 
before ruling in a threeparagraph decision there was probable 
cause to hold a new trial for robison based on the evidence that 
had been presented 
prosecutors presented little new evidence during the preliminary 
hearing though they have hinted they are holding back until the 
new trial 
robison did not testify at the hearing but prosecutors 
introduced a transcript of an unpublished interview he gave 
magazine writers in 1979 in which he denied killing bolles but 
acknowledged having seen the bombs remote control and withholding 
evidence from police 
the judge scheduled robisons arraignment for feb 4 any trial 
date would be scheduled at that time 
bolles left notes saying he had gone to the clarendon hotel to 
meet john harvey adamson a racingdog breeder who remains in 
prison for the killing pending appeal 
a state grand jury in october began investigating conspiracy and 
obstruction of justice allegations in the bolles case

europeans and even poor countries have 
sent aid since romanias revolution but not the united states the 
government said tuesday the us embassy said american help had 
arrived but quietly 
the americans said they would give us some help but nothing 
has come we are still waiting said ion radulescu who organizes 
distribution of foreign aid for the interim national salvation 
front government 
embassy spokeswoman agota kuperman said in response the 
problem is that we didnt put red white and blue flags on it we 
didnt come in with a fanfare we did it very quietly and that 
might have been a mistake 
we gave 500000 worth of aid to the international committee 
of the red cross 250000 in medicine and 25000 from the 
ambassadors discretionary fund 
a tour of bucharests main exhibition center which has become a 
depot for supplies donated from abroad revealed little from the 
united states 
daniela calota who works for the government pharmaceutical 
office and was helping sort medical aid said only three large 
trucks of us supplies had arrived in the month since dictator 
nicolae ceausescu was overthrown 
the only us goods in the hall set aside for medicine were 
cartons of saline solution from the feed the children charity based 
in oklahoma and some usmade disposable syringes from an unknown 
donor 
cartons of drugs and medical supplies from china thailand 
mongolia zimbabwe egypt the un childrens fund and virtually 
all east and west european countries were in separate piles on the 
floor of the cavernous freezing building 
mrs calota picked up two packs of german bandages in old brown 
wrappers with the expiration dates june 29 1938 and nov 25 
1942 which had arrived in one shipment bandages from the third 
reich she said its amazing 
she displayed boxes of antibiotics from iran dated 1970 to 1973 
and picked up one of a dozen canvas stretchers this kind of 
stretcher is from the second world war she said 
an xray machine from the hospital broussais in paris stood in 
the hall its very old and its a problem she said 
asked what the government would do with the old drugs and 
bandages she said well put it on the fire its dangerous we 
made a revolution and we are poor but dont give us what you 
are throwing away 
with the exception of the shipment from iran all the medicine 
is very good and we need it because we have problems to eliminate 
from 10 to 15 years ago not just from now she said 
radulescu said we dont want to make a fuss about the 
outofdate material there have been some problems he said 
but in general the medicine we received is good new and its 
helping a lot 
france was the first and largest donor he said followed by 
belgium the netherlands west germany italy the moldavian region 
of the soviet union which has a large romanian population 
hungary czechoslovakia and yugoslavia 
west germany is providing 350 megawatts of electricity daily for 
two months without charge and the 12nation european economic 
community is giving 250000 tons of animal fodder 10000 tons of 
butter 20000 tons of beef and 5000 tons of cooking oil he said 
romania still urgently needs food and fodder along with 
medicine and medical equipment to maintain minimum standards of 
the hospitals and clinics radulescu said 
mrs calota said the greatest need in medical supplies was for 
disinfectant surgical instruments and drugs for heart and liver 
ailments 
nicolae constantinescu of the ministry of commerce was 
overseeing soldiers and workers who separated news shipments in the 
main exhibition hall 
he said part was going to poor people part to those who 
suffered from the revolution and part to families with more than 
five children new clothing was being given to stores for public 
sale he said 
maybe you can help us with soap toothpaste razor blades and 
all cosmetics for men and women because we have none 
constantinescu said we need cooking oil and flour all people 
want to make bread in the houses but we havent flour 
basketball is the third most popular sport in romania but we 
have no shoes he said the balls we imported from china but 
now we have no money 
a truck drove in to pick up salami casings from czechoslovakia 
the romanians love salami and we dont make these said 
adrian sucigan an economist at the popesti leordeni sausage 
factory we can use as much as we can get

shimon peres israels finance minister and 
deputy prime minister said tuesday that agreement toward holding 
palestinianisraeli peace talks is near but he still ruled out a 
role for the plo 
speaking to reporters at cairo international airport upon 
arrival for talks with egyptian officials peres said a few 
problems remained in plans for a palestinianisraeli dialogue to be 
held in this capital 
today we are so near to start meaningful negotations with 
palestinians it would be a fatal mistake to give it up said 
peres who is scheduled to meet wednesday with president hosni 
mubarak and foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
earlier tuesday abdelmeguid expressed cautious optimism 
about the peace efforts while admitting there were still some 
points of difference 
peres referring to recent washington talks that involved 
officials from egypt israel and the united states said he 
believes the parties have agreed on practically most of the 
issues 
he defined one of the remaining problems as being the inclusion 
of palestinians deported from israelioccupied territories in the 
the delegation that would meet with israelis in cairo 
i for one say yes i know there is very strong support 
in israel for the view that i have just expressed he said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has rejected that 
possibility on the grounds deported palestinians are active plo 
members 
when asked about participation by the palestine liberation 
organization peres said i dont think there is a need 
israels refusal to deal with the plo which it describes as a 
terrorist organization bent on destroying israel is one of the 
sticking points in discussions to arrange for a dialogue in cairo 
egypt and the palestinians insist on a role for the plo 
another problem in the proposed cairo dialogue is the arab 
demand for an open agenda while israel wants to focus only on its 
proposal for elections in the west bank and gaza to choose 
palestinian representatives for negotiations on limited interim 
autonomy 
washington has backed egyptian and palestinian demands that 
issues other than the elections can be raised

a junk dealer offered prayers and 
cooperation as fbi agents searched his warehouse tuesday looking 
for an old typewriter that could help solve the mail bomb killings 
of a judge and a civil rights lawyer 
wayne oferrell ate lunch with fbi agents and accompanied them 
to his warehouse tuesday afternoon one day after about 100 agents 
scoured oferrells home warehouse and abandoned store about 75 
miles from montgomery in southeastern alabama 
oferrell 46 a onetime rural preacher said he asked several 
members of his church to pray for my family that we can get 
through this thing and ive asked them to pray for the fbi to find 
whatever they are looking for 
fbi agent chuck archer said there have been no arrests and that 
three search warrants have been approved for property other than 
oferrells he did not identify the property 
agents unearthed the top of oferrells home septic tank tuesday 
afternoon and began pumping out its contents authorities also plan 
to dig up a septic tank at the warehouse archer refused to say 
what investigators were looking for in the septic tanks 
archer declined to describe oferrell as a suspect he is one 
of many people we have interviewed said the fbi agent 
court records show oferrell lost a lawsuit heard on appeal by 
us circuit judge robert vance the judge was killed dec 16 when 
a package bomb sent through the mail exploded at his home in 
suburban birmingham 
robert robinson a black civil rights lawyer in savannah ga 
was killed two days later by another exploding package and similar 
mail bombs were defused at the 11th circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta where vance served and at national association for the 
advancement of colored people headquarters in jacksonville fla 
fbi sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
published reports that typewritten correspondence in oferrells 
court case appears to match typewritten correspondence allegedly 
sent by the mail bomber 
archer asked about the typewriter said only that a news report 
this month mentioned that agents are looking for a typewriter used 
by the mail bomber 
they were looking for a typewriter that we may have sold 
oferrell said tuesday as fbi agents weighed the results of their 
search of the junk dealers warehouse and other family property 
its possible we could have had the typewriter in the last two 
years he told radio station wkmx in enterprise but we dont 
know what typewriter theyre talking about you dont keep a record 
of everything you sell 
i dont know anything about any of it he said i dont 
have anything to hide when its all over with ill be glad to get 
with the media and go into details 
he said the fbi asked him not to talk to the media until they 
get what they want done 
oferrell had sued gulf life insurance co of jacksonville for 
firing him challenging the companys claim that he held licenses 
with other insurance companies oferrell also claimed gulf life 
owed him commissions 
the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in montgomery in 
june 1988 last april vance and two other judges on the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld the lower court ruling in a 
onepage unsigned decision 
oferrell described by a neighbor as a former baptist preacher 
who took up the junk business about three years ago was questioned 
by investigators monday and joined them in a brief trip to the 
warehouse tuesday the mail bomb investigation team has been 
interviewing people and searching various locales in the enterprise 
vicinity since saturday 
us magistrate john carroll of montgomery has not released 
affidavits filed by fedeal investigators to get search warrants for 
oferrells property the case file of oferrells lawsuit against 
gulf life also has been sealed by court order and apparently has 
been taken by the fbi as potential evidence in the mail bomb case 
morris dees director of the southern poverty law center said 
tuesday that oferrells name is not in the files of white hate 
groups that the centers klanwatch project maintains the fbi has 
said it does not appear from a possible profile that the mail 
bomber would belong to any white supremacist organization 
a letter claiming responsibility for the mail bombs was received 
by wagatv in atlanta from an indvidual or group calling itself 
americans for a competent federal judicial system and expressing 
anger over racial desegregation cases and a homicide in which 
blacks are accused of raping and murdering a white woman

tens of thousands of oil workers voted 
tuesday night to accept a courtproposed raise of 31 percent and 
end their eightday nationwide walkout labor officials said 
luis fernando maia of the national strike command said workers 
at 10 refineries of the state oil monopoly petrobras accepted the 
pay hike and would return to work immediately 
the crisis is over all refineries have suspended the 
strike maia said in a telephone interview workers nationwide 
are heading back to their shifts 
maia said oil production in the northeastern states of alagoas 
sergipe and offshore platforms in pernambuco rio de janeiro and 
sao paulo would resume operations wednesday morning 
production and refining operations should be normalized within 
two days said maia he said brazils supply of gasoline would 
return to normal within a week 
maia said the strikers from 19 unions accepted a monday ruling 
by the superior labor court that oil workers were entitled to a 
raise of 312 percent to compensate for losses due to inflation 
the increase was less than half what strikers were demanding but 
more than petrobras offer 
it was a solomonic decision it should satisfy everyone and 
put an end to a strike that has anguished the nation labor court 
judge marco aurelio prates de macedo said after the eighthour 
session 
still maia warned of possible problems with the agreement down 
the road 
the agreement says nothing about retroactivity to the date of 
our salary readjustment which is sept 1 said maia this 
could be a future problem 
the strike began jan 16 when most of petrobras 60151 
employees walked off their jobs 
the strikers demanded a raise of 65 percent retroactive to 
sept 1 union leaders said the increase was to offset losses from 
two government antiinflation plans in 1987 and 1989 when wages 
and prices were frozen in an unsuccessful attempt to control 
inflation 
inflation was a record 1765 percent last year and has averaged 
about 50 percent a month since fall 
petrobras offered 215 percent the company claimed it had a 
deficit of more than 1 billion in 1989 and didnt have the money 
to pay more 
salaries for petrobras workers range from 3000 new cruzados a 
month or 220 to about 50000 cruzados or 3700 for top 
executives 
the strike shut down eight of brazils 11 refineries and reduced 
output at two others according to strike leaders however 
socalled essential areas such as production of cooking gas 
were kept operating were skeleton crews 
crude oil production of about 650000 barrels of oil a day was 
unaffected exports of petroleum products were maintained 
including shipments of about 80000 barrels of gasoline a day to 
the united states petrobras said

president bush on tuesday said a 
democratic anticrime bill is a sheep in wolfs clothing and 
promised he will recommend record spending on drug education and 
treatment 
after a tour of a once drug infested street bush said that an 
anticrime bill pending in the senate under the sponsorship of sen 
joseph biden ddel is merely a trojan horse 
it looks like a real crime bill sounds like a real crime 
bill but in actuality it will be tougher on law enforcement than 
on criminals he told a gathering of kansas city law enforecment 
officials america needs a crime bill with teeth but this is a 
sheep in wolfs clothing 
biden said in washington that the primary difference between the 
versions of the bill is over how much resources should be committed 
the president called my proposal a trojan horse standing at 
the gates of congress biden said in a release well the 
trojan horse was filled with soldiers who won their war and my 
crime bill is loaded with money for more police and drug agents 
soldiers we need to fight the war on crime today 
the white house contends bidens bill falls short as it pertains 
to exclusionary rules of evidence habeas corpus and the death 
penalty 
bidens provisions in those areas bush said will only 
entrench and extend the legal loopholes and red tape that disrupt 
law enforcement and have angered the american people for far too 
long 
bush toured a street where three socalled crack houses were 
boarded up and visited with residents who had helpled organize the 
neighborhood against crime 
several members from a committee called black men together 
demonstrated for the president how they discourage drug users by 
chanting hey pusher hey you black men out here are watching 
you and you better run dope pusher better run 
bush will announce the second phase of his national antidrug 
strategy thursday in a speech to newspaper publishers said white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
our national drug strategy calls for record levels of new 
funding for both education and treatment bush said referring to 
the plan his drug policy coordinator william bennett put forward 
sept 5 
the administration has not given any specific figures for the 
second phase 
fitzwater also said bush still intends to go to the feb 15 drug 
summit in cartagena colombia despite a news report tht druglords 
are procuring antiaircraft missiles in a plan to shoot down air 
force one 
the secret service assures us they can provide security 
fitzwater told reporters flying with the president tuesday 
bush professed as he flew to kanas city to be holding out a hand 
of cooperation to congress on its return tuesday from a twomonth 
recess 
were renewing the spirit of cooperation he said 
but he later noted one of points festering between the white 
house and capitol hill 
he said congress deserves our thanks for providing the new 
federal troops we asked for new agents new prosecutors and new 
prisons to catch convict and contain those who prey on our 
cities 
but its time for congress to finish the job because it does 
no good to send the troops into battle wearing handcuffs he told 
the law enforcement audience 
bennett is developing the second stage of an antidrug plan 
which features money for eradication and interdiction in the south 
american drug production countries as well as more money for 
prisons education and treatment programs and federal assistance 
for state and community crimefighting efforts 
bush has repeatedly criticized congress for enacting only part 
of his anticrime plan in november lawmakers voted 42 billion 
to expand federal prison capacity hire more prosecutors and 
federal agents and take other measures in the war on crime 
that was 500 million more than bush had asked for according to 
the senate judiciary committee 
but bush also is urging passage of tougher sentencing for 
hardened criminals restrictions on plea bargaining and the death 
penalty for drug dealers who kill police 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the administration 
considers bidens bill too weak because it 
contains too many exceptions on the death penalty 
does not incorporate bushs request for exclusionary laws to 
permit officers a good faith exception in evidence gathering if 
it is later found the search violated constitutional protections 
does not follow bushs proposal for habeas corpus reforms to 
stop the frivolous appeals that are choking the courts 
lacks the elements for coordination and cooperation between law 
enforcement agencies that bush is pushing 
a judiciary committee aide who asked not to be identified said 
bidens legislation is similar to bushs but bans racially 
discriminatory executions and allows goodfaith exceptions to the 
exclusionary rule only if the illegal search was conducted with a 
warrant 
bidens bill would also ban the assembly sale or transfer of 
assault weapons bush has banned import of semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
bidens bill would nearly double the amount of federal aid for 
local law enforcement recommended by bush from 350 million to 
600 million and add 1000 fbi agents 350 drug enforcement agents 
and 300 prosecutors

the state board of education approved rules 
tuesday that will do away with undergraduate education majors and 
instead require prospective teachers to focus on subjects such as 
history english and chemistry 
the action which also will require a masters degree for 
teacher certification reflects a national trend in which school 
systems are looking for instructors who know more about the subject 
they are teaching 
i think it will enhance the teachers enormously said susan 
tave zelman state assistant commissioner for education personnel 
it will better prepare them for their subject and give them 
better depth and breadth 
currently in massachusetts teachers can receive a permanent 
certificate by completing undergraduate studies in education 
but starting next fall students in both public and private 
colleges who plan to pursue a teaching career will be required to 
choose a major from the liberal arts and sciences 
you have to major in subjects like history chemistry or 
physics these sort of real subjects rather than education said 
terry zoulas spokesman for the state board of regents of higher 
education 
i think theres a consensus that the first prerequisite is to 
know your subject matter he said theres something to be said 
about knowing how to teach but it shouldnt be the only thing 
while students are majoring in these other subjects they also 
will take education courses to learn skills such as evaluating and 
communicating with students 
when they graduate they will receive a provisional teaching 
certificate that will be valid for five years during that time 
the prospective teachers will work toward a masters degree that 
also will combine education courses with their chosen field of 
expertise 
in addition they will get classroom experience under the 
guidance of mentor teachers 
education officials describe this element as the clinical 
component of the plan similar to medical students who work in 
hospitals receiving advice from practicing doctors if the 
candidates successfully complete their graduate work and 
provisional teaching experience they receive full certificates 
to make teaching a major profession is the goal of this 
zoulas said 
ernest boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching called the plan a really creative and 
responsible move 
i have never felt it was adequate for education to be the 
major field for teachers he said the first test of a teacher 
is what they teach 
teachers groups around the country have stressed a need to 
elevate the image of their profession which they say faces a 
shortage of quality instructors 
jamie horwitz spokesman for the american federation of teachers 
in washington dc said his group supports looking for new 
certification methods to draw more people into teaching 
this not only means drawing teachers from a pool of liberal arts 
and science majors but also includes offering the option of 
teaching to other professionals such as engineers who might want 
to leave their jobs 
we can get good people in the classroom he said we can 
upgrade the quality of professionals in the profession 
six other states connecticut illinois nevada north 
carolina texas and virginia have eliminated the undergraduate 
education major as a requirement for prospective teachers 
but steve wollmer a spokesman for the massachusetts teachers 
association said while his group supports the new program in 
general we are not convinced that it will work 
for example he said special education instructors who teach 
children with learning disabilities require very specific training 
its hard to expect someone who majors in liberal arts to walk 
into a special needs class and do a good job he said 
also a key element of the program is using mentor teachers but 
wollmer said with massachusetts already under budget strains the 
state might find it difficult to provide the teachers to serve in 
this program 
zelman said the mentor teachers will not be needed until 1995 
and were hoping by then the state will have its act together 
also regarding special education training the prospective 
teachers will complete the necessary classes its almost like a 
double major she said

the pentagon on tuesday retracted claims made 
during the panama invasion that us soldiers had found a large 
cache of cocaine in a guest house used by gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
it was not cocaine said pentagon spokesman bob hall 
however hall told reporters that he could not identify with any 
certainty what the substance was saying hed been supplied with 
less than satisfactory information by us military officials 
in panama 
one pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified by name said the substance had been found wrapped in 
banana leaves and has something to do with voodoo 
hall said us officials were seeking further clarification on 
the matter the washington post reported in tuesday editions that 
the find amounted to tamales used in voodoo ceremonies southern 
command spokesman capt art haubold in panama said experts had told 
the command the substance was used in voodoo ceremonies and he 
denied that the command had identified the find as tamales 
shortly after the invasion gen maxwell thurman commander of 
the panamabased southern command said the cocaine amounted to 50 
kilos or more than 100 pounds thurman was quoted in a dec 23 new 
york times article as saying the presence of the cocaine was an 
indication that noriega condones or uses the stuff himself 
hall pressed about why such unchecked claims were allowed to be 
made said that clearly the guys who first saw this stuff did not 
know what cocaine was when the experts checked they said it 
wasnt 
hall said he didnt know when that discovery had been made by 
us officials nor could he explain how the claim came to be made 
in retrospect probably you shouldnt be announcing something 
you need to do lab tests on things to be 100 percent sure he 
said 
hall said he could not provide any details about any other drugs 
that might have been found during operation just cause because of 
legal implications 
the day after the invasion reporters were shown a socalled 
witch house that supposedly had been frequented by noriega 
col mike snell the officer in charge of the area said some 50 
pounds of cocaine had been found there along with voodoo 
paraphernalia 
the washington post reported that although 450 kilos of cocaine 
and assorted other drugs have been seized since us troops invaded 
dec 20 none could be directly linked to noriega or used in the 
drugtrafficking trial against him 
noriega is awaiting trial in miami on federal drugtrafficking 
and racketeering charges 
tamales are made from ground cornmeal which is usually pale 
beige or white and filled with sweets meat or cheese they often 
are wrapped in banana leaves and boiled cocaine a white powder 
sometimes is packaged in plastic bags 
on other matters related to panama 
hall when asked about a report that two female soldiers had 
refused to drive troops into an area where shooting was going on 
during the invasion said the initial reading is there is 
nothing there 
pentagon officials had said friday that they were looking into

more than 10000 skilled workers held a rally 
tuesday to denounce communism for killing east german craftsmanship 
and demand freemarket reforms to revive it 
we absolutely and unconditionally need conversion to a full 
market economy burkhard schmidt spokesman for the craftmens 
union told the associated press before the rally many of those 
attending also favored reunification with west germany 
better to close for four hours than forever said lutz 
scheibner an electronics repairman we need to show the 
government we know what needs to be done 
the rally was called on short notice over the opposition of top 
union leaders still loyal to the communist system that rewarded 
them with comfortable bureaucratic positions 
while hans modrow the communist premier and opposition leaders 
dicker over how to share power before free elections may 6 the 
general attitude toward compromise has soured 
prodemocracy advocates from the social democratic party and new 
forum declared tuesday they were not prepared to negotiate a role 
in the interim government and said coalition talks have been 
postponed 
opposition reluctance to prop up the government reflects the 
atmosphere of uncertainty in east germany which does not have a 
unifying prodemocracy figure like czechoslovakias vaclav havel or 
lech walesa of poland 
since they have no obvious alternative to the distrusted 
communists east germans increasingly look to the west and call for 
unification with prosperous west germany 
up to 2000 east germans flee to the west every day bleeding 
the country of skilled workers and undermining chances for economic 
recovery 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann was in east 
berlin for the first session of a joint economic council searching 
for cooperative measures to bail east germany out of its crisis 
haussmann told reporters that modrow has agreed to accept west 
german aid of 6 billion marks or 35 billion in the recovery 
effort which bonn has tied to reforms that would allow more free 
enterprise and foreign investment 
weekly rallies by hundreds of thousands of people have moved 
from demanding reform to outright rejection of the communist system 
that has guided the nation through its entire four decades 
adn the official news agency said a clash between young 
leftists and supporters of german unity was narrowly averted at 
the rally of more than 100000 people monday in leipzig where zeal 
for reform is strong 
about 100 youths demonstrating against the rallys overwhelming 
support for unification chanted slogans for continued east german 
sovereignty and were chased by irate members of the crowd 
witnesses said only a priests intervention ensured the 
explosive situation did not escalate and end in violence adn 
reported 
tuesdays rally in east berlin and other demonstrations for 
freemarket reforms or reunification are quietly supported by west 
german industry 
businesses in west germany that seek access to cheaper labor and 
a ready market have supported the effort to establish an 
entrepreneurs association in the east 
leaflets printed by the west german council for trade and 
industry were distributed at the rally held to announce a free 
seminar on starting new businesses in east germany 
as at recent monday night rallies in leipzig workers at the 
tuesday demonstration chanted demands for german unity and 
denounced the interim governments search for compromise between a 
planned economy and capitalism 
there is no third way said schmidt the craftsmens union 
spokesman forty years of socialism has proved itself a failure 
and there is no time for further experiments 
his comments were greeted by nods and denunciations of communism 
from the crowd around him on the alexanderplatz in the heart of 
east berlin 
despite the short notice thousands of independent shop managers 
and skilled workers shut down their businesses to march in the 
crowd were artisans in leather aprons and beauticians in 
aquacolored uniforms 
taxes of 75 percent are death to our crafts a placard 
declared others read planned economy no thanks and down 
with the communists 
under the old system it was impossible for fathers to teach 
their sons the crafts they had practiced for life said andreas 
wiench a tv repairman we need to cure this illness in our 
economy 
public demand for dissolution of the communist party has 
increased in recent weeks and threatens the leadership of modrow 
who has enjoyed relative public trust 
the resignation of his finance minister after allegations of 
irregularities added another stain to the partys image and one of 
the most popular communists mayor wolfgang berghofer of dresden 
has left the party 
proposed regulations governing foreign investment have 
disappointed both westerners seeking joint projects and east german 
businessmen who need cash and a freer hand to boost production 
continuing lack of incentive to turn out more for the state has 
resulted in growing shortages 
the state office for statistics said tuesday the 1989 economic 
performance was far short of targets and some observers doubt the 
credibility even of the 2 percent growth claimed in the report

a manchester area school on tuesday 
bowed to local moslem criticism and partially lifted its ban on 
moslem head scarves after two sisters wearing them were kept out of 
class for more than a month 
they can wear blue ones in keeping with the schools uniforms 
said officials at altrincham grammar school for girls 
we felt we had to take account of changes in our society 
said gil thompson chairman of the school governors from time to 
time it is necessary to change them school rules and we have 
modified them 
fatima alvi 16 and sister aisha 14 had been sent home every 
school day since dec 14 when they began wearing their scarves to 
the school in altrincham near manchester about 160 miles northwest 
of london 
the public school initially argued that the scarves were a 
safety danger to the girls in school laboratories and the 
gymnasium the new regulations still do not allow the scarves to be 
worn in science and physical education classes the governors said 
because of safety concerns 
islamic law requires girls past puberty to cover their heads in 
the presence of men who are not close relatives three men teach at 
the school of 727 students and there is a male caretaker 
the manchester council of mosques ruled in december that the 
girls should conform to islamic law 
it was a very courageous decision to reverse the policy and 
means the idea of british justice and fairness has been upheld 
said council spokesman ahmad bashir 
abdurrab alvi the girls father said he was pleased they 
would be allowed to return to school wednesday wearing scarves 
it started as something in the family because the girls felt 
strongly about it and it became something of countrywide 
significance alvi said 
the school has said there are 18 other moslem pupils who have 
not requested to wear scarves 
largely as a result of asian immigration britain has 15 
million moslems 
in france last october three moslem girls in creil north of 
paris were banned from school because they refused to remove their 
scarves frances public school system bans all outward signs of 
religion 
the dispute sparked public demonstrations and became a national 
political issue frances highest administrative authority the 
council of state ruled in november that moslem girls may wear 
scarves to school as long as it causes no disruption 
there are no laws forbidding religion in britains public 
schools and the department of education said uniform regulations 
are decided by local school boards and teachers

a moslem fundamentalist one of about 350 
militants demonstrating outside a mosque was shot to death during 
a clash in which police used tear gas and demonstrators hurled 
stones officials said tuesday 
attorney general abdelaziz mokhtar said 11 people were 
arrested most of them students at assiut university before the 
crowd dispersed late monday 
police initially blamed stray shots fired from within the crowd 
for killing abdelsabbour hassanein and seriously wounding another 
man 
however the middle east news agency later said police gunfire 
killed hassanein the security forces were forced to open fire 
after one of the demonstrators shot at them and this led to the 
death mena said 
the university center of assiut about 240 miles south of cairo 
has been a focal point of moslem fundamentalist and extremist 
activity since 1981 when militants attempted a coup in its streets 
right after the assassination of president anwar sadat more than 
80 people died mostly police 
about 200 security troops accompanied hassaneins body to his 
hometown near assiut for burial apparently to prevent unrest 
during the funeral 
police said they found iron rods chains and knives inside the 
mosque 
the demonstration was to demand that former interior minister 
zaki badr be put on trial some participants called for his 
execution 
badr was fired on jan 12 after insulting cabinet colleagues a 
public outcry rose for him to be tried on charges of violating 
human rights and for other crimes 
badr led a harsh crackdown on religious fundamentalists after 
becoming minister in 1986 
mokhtar said tuesday that 20 moslem activists detained for more 
than five months were released he gave no details

the 101st congress convened its second session 
tuesday facing an agenda suddenly expanded by the emergence of 
democracy in eastern europe and a plan to cut social security taxes 
at home 
lingering issues also abound including child care 
capitalgains taxes and deficit reduction 
not waiting for president bush to send up his own budget and 
legislative proposals the senate almost immediately began debating 
a farreaching plan for cleaning up the air a bill that is more 
costly and more sweeping than the president wants opposition is 
based more on geography and competing regional interests than on 
party lines 
the house made plans for another confrontation on wednesday an 
attempt to override bushs veto of legislation aimed at preventing 
the deportation of chinese students who have sought refuge in the 
united states the house originally passed the bill on a 4030 vote 
there really is no good reason to override the presidents 
veto unless it is just straightout politics said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas he said bush has done as much 
for the students through administrative actions as the bill would 
do but republicans were generally conceding bush faces a onesided 
defeat 
the president traveling in the midwest said he is hoping to 
renew a spirit of cooperation with congress but he attacked as a 
sheep in wolfs clothing an anticrime bill sponsored by sen 
joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee 
it will be tougher on law enforcement than on criminals 
bush said of the bill the measure generally would prohibit use of 
tainted evidence bar racially discriminatory executions and ban 
sale of assault weapons 
the first day of the session was marked by friendly reunions 
rep jack brooks dtexas told colleagues hed nearly died of a 
pancreas ailment during the long break and he accepted hugs and 
applause on the house floor 
outside a halfdozen house members arrived on bicycles after a 
twoblock trip from a congressional office building to call 
attention to plans for earth day in the spring 
democrat craig washington was sworn in to fill the term of the 
late rep mickey leland one day after a judge back in texas 
sentenced washington to 30 days in jail accusing him of leaving 
legal clients in the lurch hearings have been scheduled for 
washington to show cause why he should not be sent to jail 
on the other side of the capitol sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny formally introduced a bill to reduce social security taxes 
an idea that had prompted a fullscale white house attack when he 
proposed it last month moynihan says workers are being deceived 
because their social security taxes are being used to make the 
federal deficit appear far smaller than it is 
these are insurance contributions they are premiums paid 
moynihan told a news conference they do not belong to the 
government if we are not going to save them we should return 
them 
his bill which has drawn widespread interest but few sponsors 
would roll back the tax increase that took effect jan 1 and reduce 
another scheduled for next ear that would save a worker with 
income over 51300 about 600 and leave the social security 
system with just enough money to pay retirees checks moynihan 
said 
the bush administration says such cuts would lead to reductions 
in benefits or to efforts to raise other taxes 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine told 
reporters moynihans proposal is developing what i think is 
growing support 
but house republican leader bob michel of illinois said in a 
letter to rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways 
and means committee that the proposed tax cut could inspire even 
more drastic threats to the system and ultimately bring it down 
sen ernest f hollings dsc a member of the budget 
committee did what is seldom done in congress these days he 
introduced a bill proposing a tax increase he recommended a 5 
percent national sales tax that would exempt food health care and 
housing 
hollings said that would raise enough money to roll back social 
security taxes cut taxes on capital gains from stocks and bonds 
expand taxdeductible individual retirement accounts and create a 
revenuesharing program for state and local education 
in advance of bushs budget which will be submitted on monday 
and his state of the union message which will follow on jan 31 
three of the presidents top aides met with republican senators to 
discuss the wealth of issues facing congress in this election year 
dole ticked off seven of those issues the chinesestudent bill 
clean air expanding childcare assistance campaign financing 
reform bushs proposed capitalgains tax reduction tougher crime 
legislation and the social security tax cut 
neither doles list nor one drawn by mitchell mentioned what 
likely will be attempts to send us financial aid to the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe most of the dramatic changes in 
governments in that region took place after the 101st congress 
wrapped up its first session on nov 23 
dole has proposed that the us foreign aid program be 
overhauled to help those countries even if that means cutting aid 
to some longtime allies 
the proposal encountered opposition from a group of republican 
senators who attended a luncheon meeting with secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
sens robert w kasten jr of wisconsin rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota don nickles of oklahoma and arlen specter of 
pennsylvania all told baker they were opposed to the idea a senate 
republican source said 
the meeting was not unfriendly said the source who 
demanded anonymity but not one person got up in support of 
doles proposal

the governments first conviction of a 
hacker under a 1986 computer tampering law may bolster the 
oftencriticized statute but experts said tuesday it still needs 
changes to improve computer security 
computer experts who testified during the trial of robert t 
morris and members of congress said the 1986 law will most likely 
be revised because it is vague and outdated 
we still need to amend the act to resolve the ambiguities 
said theodore hagelin director of syracuse universitys law 
technology and management program 
the fact that government has gotten a conviction takes some of 
the pressure off congress to do something immediately but the law 
as is remains insufficient he said 
morris 24 a suspended cornell university graduate student from 
arnold md was found guilty monday of intentionally breaking into 
a federal computer network without permission in november 1988 and 
preventing use of the system 
morris admitted designing a worm to invade internet a 
research network of about 6000 computers nationwide that links 
government military and major universities however he said a 
programming error caused his program to replicate wildly and 
paralyze the system 
he was the first person brought to trial under a section of the 
1986 computer fraud and abuse act dealing with illegal access to 
federal computer networks 
the law makes it a felony to intentionally access a federal 
interest computer without authorization and alter destroy or 
damage information or prevent authorized use of the computer if 
such conduct causes the loss of 1000 or more during any oneyear 
period 
the law applies only to us government computers computers of 
financial institutions and networks involving computers in more 
than one state 
joseph b tompkins jr chairman of the american bar 
associations task force on computer crime said the law fails to 
cover viruses that authorized users may release either mistakenly 
or deliberately but without malice 
another unresolved question is whether a hacker can be 
prosecuted if he sends a program with a hidden virus to an 
electronic bulletin board and other users transfer the 
virusinfected software into their own systems 
in his instructions to the jury us district judge howard 
munson said the government did not have to prove intent to convict 
morris 
but tompkins said because the judge ruled that way doesnt 
mean another judge in another court wont rule differently or 
that the same battles over intent wont go back and forth 
the ambiguities and gaps are still there congress has some 
work to do said tompkins 
eugene spafford a computer science professor at purdue 
university one of several major universities that suffered the 
worms attack said security systems on computers have to be 
improved 
but until thats accomplished we have to depend on legal means 
to serve as a deterrent said spafford a government witness at 
the trial 
spafford also said there are problems the law does not currently 
cover 
hightech crimes how do you investigate and prosecute crimes 
where immediacy is so important or where its difficult to trace it 
back to the perpetrator viruses dont leave fingerprints said 
spafford 
also there is no specific mention of viruses or worms in the 
law said tompkins 
dean krafft in charge of security at cornells computer science 
department said any new law should specify what constitutes a 
crime he suggested congress may want to provide several levels of 
criminal action 
a student trying to access a computer game at another 
university who somehow causes that system to crash shouldnt have 
to face a felony charge said krafft who also was a government 
witness 
rep william j hughes dnj the main sponsor of the 1986 
legislation said there was no question the issue needed to be 
reconsidered and that his proposal was never intended to be the 
last word on computer trespassing 
but hughes said was he pleased to see the law work despite the 
complaints 
congress is likely to return to the question of computer 
security this session 
the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice heard 
testimony on three antivirus bills last session but postponed 
work until the conclusion of the morris trial said eric hauser an 
aide to rep charles e schumer dny the subcommittee chairman

mrs arvidson said i know the jurys going to let me go home and 
be with my little girl

death row inmate clarence brandley was 
freed on bond tuesday one month after an appeals court threw out 
his conviction on charges of raping and killing a teenager in a 
case tainted by racism 
i was doubtful this day would ever come brandley said as he 
left the ellis 1 unit prison which houses texas death row im 
very thankful im going to take it one day at a time 
brandleys release came just hours after a state judge in conroe 
set his bond at 75000 and one month after the texas court of 
criminal appeals threw out brandleys capital murder conviction 
saying he didnt receive a fair trial 
brandleys attorneys have offered evidence that police and 
montgomery county prosecutors had set out to prove that brandley 
the only black janitor at conroe high school where the victim was 
killed was guilty rather than seeking the young white womans real 
killer montgomery county officials have denied the allegations 
brandleys release had been delayed while peter speers the 
district attorney in montgomery county filed motions asking the 
appeals court to reconsider the appeals court rejected those pleas 
last week 
i wouldnt say this is a vindication of the system said 
brandley who has been on death row since march 1981 
speers said he would appeal to the us supreme court but wont 
seek a new trial for brandley if the nations highest court refuses 
to consider the case 
the appeals court decision in december came more than two years 
after a special judge concluded that brandleys conviction was 
tainted by racism 
the victim 16yearold cheryl dee fergeson a bellville high 
school volleyball team manager was slain while attending a 
tournament at conroe high school in august 1980 
brandleys first trial ended in a hung jury and an allwhite 
jury convicted him of capital murder in his second trial 
speers has repeatedly indicated a third trial would be virtually 
impossible because of the time that has elapsed lost evidence and 
what he terms corrupted witnesses 
in another development the former janitor who found miss 
fergesons body has been charged with sexually assaulting two 
girls last year authorities said 
henry peace who was a coworker of brandleys at conroe high 
school was arrested friday and charged with five counts of sexual 
assault said oj stewart sheriff in liberty county which is 
near montgomery county 
prosecutors said there is no evidence linking peace to miss 
fergesons slaying 
peace testified in the brandley case but gave conflicting 
testimony during several court hearings 
brandley 38 said he wanted to see his mother his attorneys 
refused to disclose the location of the reunion 
when i get home with my family ill kiss the ground said 
brandley but its a great feeling just walking outside the gate 
knowing im standing on some grass not concrete and no nonstop 
handcuffs 
he said he hopes to get involved in helping people in 
circumstances similar to his people who have been hurt people 
who have felt injustice may have been made 
asked if he was bitter he responded i think anyone would be 
bitter but after a period of time that passes 
brandley said he did not sleep monday night after learning he 
likely would be released 
ive been just up and anxious for this big moment to come 
ive been just anxious for this moment he said 
when he walked out the door inmates in the prison recreation 
area waved and hollered way to go clarence 
the hardest part was getting someone to listen in the 
beginning said his attorney mike degeurin

jewish refugees from strifetorn soviet 
azerbaijan arrived tuesday and officials said they are speeding 
efforts to rescue others caught up in a revolt by the predominantly 
moslem population 
the refugees from the azerbaijani capital of baku who arrived 
early tuesday said the whole jewish community of about 20000 
seemed eager to emigrate but most denied any pattern of 
antisemitism in the violence 
at least 170 people were killed and more than 600 were wounded 
in the southern soviet republic since ethnic riots by moslem 
azerbaijanis against christian armenians exploded in baku jan 13 
open warfare broke out between them along the armenianazerbaijani 
border 
soviet officials said jews and russians were among the victims 
of riots and demostrations in baku and israeli reports said three 
jews were killed 
matatia elizarov a 39yearold grocer who arrived from baku on 
a flight via hungary said he did not feel the azerbaijani 
population was hostile toward jews 
they were telling us you jews are like brothers to us you 
just live quietly and when you emigrate you leave your apartments 
and other possessions behind you dont want to take our land like 
the armenians elizarov said 
still jews felt they were caught in the middle of the conflict 
and wanted to leave in increasing numbers he said in a telephone 
interview from the northern port of haifa 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said his government has taken 
measures to get jews out of there sooner 
last week we transferred a large number of emigration 
invitations so they wont have formal problems he said on a 
tour of immigrant resettlement sites in jerusalem 
gad benari spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
that helps handle immigration said any emigration invitation from 
israel to a jew in azerbaijan is getting top priority processing 
such invitations from abroad are necessary to start emigration 
procedures 
there are no signs of active antisemitism at the moment but 
we are worried jews would be hurt because of the overall 
situation he said 
elizarov said he has requests for emigration invitations from 
his three brothers a sister and 50 other jewish families 
other baku jews who arrived with elizarov early tuesday on the 
flight from budapest told reporters aboard the plane that they 
believe all the jews of azerbaijan would eventually emigrate 
some reported incidents of hostility by azerbaijani nationalists 
nathan sherinoff a trumpet player said slogans painted on the 
walls in baku read we give the armenians one year the russians 
three years the jews five years 
but the approach appeared ambivalent with moslem nationalists 
also pressing the jews to join them in fighting against armenians 
and the soviets he said 
elizarov who left baku shortly before the riots broke out with 
his wife marbari 34 and four children said the exodus was also 
motivated by the lack of basic products and total disbelief in the 
capacity of the soviet government to restore order 
there is even no canned meat in the city and people dont 
believe in anything any more they dont trust all this talk he 
said

the junk dealer thrust into the middle 
of a mail bombing investigation is a parttime preacher whose 
former job as an insurance agent indirectly led authorities to him 
federal agents have searched robert wayne oferrells warehouse 
salvage business and home looking for evidence in the deaths of a 
federal judge in suburban birmingham and a civil rights lawyer in 
savannah ga who were killed when they opened package bombs 
mailed to them 
no one has been arrested in the bombings and fbi agent chuck 
archer on tuesday declined to describe oferrell as a suspect he 
is one of many people we have interviewed archer said 
a person or group claimed responsibility for the bombings 
thought to be racially motivated in a letter to an atlanta 
television station 
oferrell 46 spoke to reporters briefly tuesday and said the 
fbi had asked him not to talk to the media until they are finished 
with their search

tough antidrug talk from president bush 
won praise from community activists and police in the mississippi 
river city bush said refused to surrender to the drug plague 
bush visited two blocks of some of kansas citys roughest 
streets where dealers peddled crack cocaine under a basketball 
hoop before neighbors took down the basket and chased out much of 
their business 
later he spoke to about 1300 law enforcement officials in a 
downtown auditorium saying cooperation between police and the 
community could win major battles against drugs 
people in this town refused to surrender to the drug plague 
you took back whats yours took back your kids took back your 
streets bush said 
bush along with us attorney general richard thornburgh 
federal drug czar william bennett and other dignitaries came to 
kansas city to meet members of the ad hoc group against crime a 
community organization that works with authorities to close drug 
houses 
what bush really did was give us a pep talk and congratulate 
us for what we have done and acknowledge that theres a long way 
to go ad hoc member p albert williams said after the 
presidents speech 
the federal government estimates that kansas city ranks sixth in 
the nation in availability of crack ranked 29th in metropolitan 
population the city had the ninthhighest murder rate in the 
country last year according to fbi figures 
to me its a genocide williams said if we keep up the 
drugs were going to kill ourselves 
at the speech to police bush stressed tough penalties for 
dealers 
police officers said the presidents visit meant a little 
recognition for their work and showed a commitment to fight drugs 
i think weve had some success here in kansas city and for the 
president to show his commitment to our work i think is going to be 
important said police sgt rick mclaughlin its nice to feel 
that youre appreciated 
ad hoc formed about 12 years ago to ease tensions between blacks 
and police today the group founded by city human relations 
director alvin brooks marches around suspected drug houses and 
shouts down dealers with bullhorns the group set up a hotline for 
citizens to report when new drug houses spring up 
our emphasis has been to try to raise the level of awareness 
and consciousness about what drugs and related crimes and violence 
are doing to our community and we attack those crack houses 
brooks told the president 
guided by brooks in an innercity area bush visited a tree with 
a basketball backboard attached to it the hoop has been stripped 
away by neighbors because it attracted drug dealers 
nearby members of black men together an anticrime group 
affliated with ad hoc demonstrated their chant to harass dealers

a former model who cooperated with the fbi in 
the arrest of mayor marion barry on a cocaine possession charge 
testified tuesday before a federal grand jury considering further 
criminal charges 
rasheeda moore 38 who law enforcement sources have said called 
barry to the hotel room where he was arrested appeared before the 
closed grand jury session for 2 hours she entered and left the 
us courthouse under tight security 
while her testimony was secret ms moore has previously told 
investigators that she and barry had used cocaine on numerous 
occasions during a lengthy relationship including a 1988 trip to 
the virgin islands according to law enforcement sources 
the mayor in sworn grand jury testimony last year denied 
allegations of drug use said the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
they said that her story corroborates statements by convicted 
drug dealer charles lewis 
lewis who was sentenced to 15 months in prison last friday on 
drug charges is also cooperating with the continuing federal 
investigation of barry which sources say involves allegations of 
perjury by the mayor 
under federal law the testimony of at least two witnesses is 
necessary in a perjury case involving a defendants sworn 
statements 
barry left the nations capital on monday for a florida 
rehabilitation center after turning over his daytoday municipal 
duties to the city administrator 
the probe of allegations of drug use by barry began more than a 
year ago when the us attorneys office received allegations that 
barry and lewis had smoked crack cocaine in a downtown hotel 
police who went to a hotel on dec 22 1988 to investigate 
reports that lewis was selling drugs from his room left when they 
discovered barry was there 
that hotel is located just blocks away from the one where the 
mayor was arrested last thursday night on a misdemeanor charge of 
possessing crack cocaine 
the yearlong investigation was stymied by the inability of 
prosecutors to obtain evidence to corroborate lewis testimony that 
he had sold barry cocaine and had smoked it with the mayor on 
numerous occasions including a 1988 trip the mayor took to the 
virgin islands 
following barrys court appearance last friday us attorney 
jay b stephens signaled that his office would consider bringing 
other charges 
the arrest was part of an ongoing public corruption probe 
stephens told reporters i view this not as the end of an event 
but as part of an ongoing investigation 
the fbis investigation is also focusing on allegations of 
contract fraud within city hall where several top aides to the 
mayor have been convicted and gone to prison in the past decade on 
corruption charges 
the sting operation that led to barrys arrest was approved at 
the highest levels of the fbi and was planned to counter any 
defense claims that the mayor was the victim of entrapment sources 
said 
ms moore was instructed not to suggest drug use when the mayor 
arrived at the hotel room rented by the fbi sources said she was 
also advised not to use cocaine herself during the mayors visit 
according to an fbi affidavit filed in support of the charge 
barry inquired about the availability of cocaine he then purchased 
the cocaine from an undercover agent who had obtained it from the 
drug enforcement administration the affidavit said 
meanwhile stephens filed court papers tuesday opposing a 
request by barrys lawyers to suspend courtordered weekly drug 
testing while the mayor is in a florida treatment center 
as an alternative a document filed with the court by stephens 
said the mayor could undergo the tests through a federal pretrial 
services agency in west palm beach where the rehabilitation center 
is located 
us magistrate deborah robinson has not ruled on the issue 
barry in a statement issued tuesday by his washington office 
asked the media to back away from the hanleyhazelden treatment 
center 
he said that he and his family were undergoing a demanding and 
painful ordeal and asked that reporters not make it any worse 
he asked the media to stay away for the sake of my privacy and 
that of others

a state appeals court tuesday cleared 
the way for results of a sobriety test failed by former exxon 
valdez skipper joseph hazelwood to be admitted as evidence in his 
trial 
the alaska court of appeals denied without explanation 
hazelwoods request for review of a lower court decision that 
results of the bloodalcohol test are admissible 
hazelwoods trial is scheduled to start monday in anchorage 
superior court 
his attorneys argued that results of the test were inadmissible 
as evidence because it was given illegally and the amount of time 
elapsed between the exxon valdez crash and the testing made the 
results of questionable worth 
the exxon valdez struck a reef march 24 and spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of oil into prince william sound 
hazelwood who was not on the bridge at the time underwent the 
coast guardadministered sobriety test aboard the ship about 10 
hours later the test revealed a bloodalcohol level of 061 the 
legal limit for operators of vessels such as tankers is 04 the 
coast guard said 
hazelwoods attorneys challenged the sobriety test on grounds it 
was administered according to federal rather than state law they 
also said hazelwood did not consent to the test 
one of hazelwoods attorneys dick madson said use of the test 
results will be appealed if hazelwood is convicted 
if hes convicted we will appeal everything madson said 
hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and 
misdemeanor charges of negligent discharge of oil reckless 
endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
the felony charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 5000 fine the misdemeanor charges combined maximum 
penalties total 2 years in prison and 11000 in fines

this will be an active week as every week is 
for shortterm interpreters of stock market action the folks who 
explain to you at the switch of a microphone why the market rose or 
fell 
there is plenty of resource material this week as there always 
is and it will not matter that yesterdays reason for the market 
falling might be put into service again to explain a subsequent 
improvement 
negatively losses at the bank of new england are making that 
industry look bad the bankruptcy of campeau corp might depress 
retailing the uprising in baku might fuel speculation about 
mikhail gorbachevs future 
as usual the negatives make up an endless list relatively new 
to the list this week are renewed fears of rising interest rates a 
spread of pessimism from tokyo stocks to new york and maybe a 
worsening of the budget deficit 
of use in explaining strength in the market would be any sign 
whatever that the federal reserve might consider the white house 
plea for lower borrowing rates peace in the soviet union or 
evidence of a pickup in corporate profits 
all these are underlying possibilities but they are not really 
immediate causes triggering them will be the usual statistical 
confetti from government and industry 
this weeks list includes an announcement about the federal 
deficit for december the weekly money supply figures and a really 
big one an estimate of fourthquarter gross national product 
in addition there will be the midjanuary report of automotive 
sales reports on new jobless claims and employment costs and the 
level of durable goods orders during december 
in action these triggers can be wonderfully imprecise some 
lend themselves to ambiguity and that makes them ideal for 
ambidextrous analysts the kind with a predisposition to the phrase 
on the other hand 
the same statistics can and often have been utilized by 
different interpreters to support opposite conclusions it is 
entirely legal to use the same set of statistics negatively one day 
and positively the next 
moreover government statistics often can be employed more than 
once because the initial announcement often is revised while 
revisions seldom are of major consequence they are there to serve 
the interpreters if necessary 
daily in fact hourly explanations are unusually complicated in 
recent weeks by a dichotomy in the ranks of economists and 
securities analysts it is this is a strong economy good and a 
weak one bad or is it the reverse 
specifically a gross national product gain of 3 percent to 6 
percent on an annual basis usually would be welcomed because it 
would suggest economic strength and good corporate profits but 
this week it might be bad news for stocks 
the explanation lies in the attitude of the federal reserve 
board whose primary goal in the past year has been to restrain 
inflation 
therefore an unexpectedly large gain might suggest an economy 
rising too fast and provide sufficient reason to abandon any 
immediate plans to let interest rates find a lower level 
the fourthquarter report to be announced this friday isnt 
likely to show any such gains the consensus seems to suggest a 
gain of less than 1 percent 
it could be good for the securities markets or it could be 
bad

presidents usually get a chance at leading roles so dan quayle 
expects to spend a good deal of his time on the road for 
republicans in a crucial year for me a crucial year for the 
party 
the vice president said he doesnt intend to be a gop hatchet 
man but we will be prepared to launch an offensive strike if we 
have to in the campaign for elections to choose a new house 34 
senators and 36 governors 
presidents tend to ration their own campaigning and turn to 
their no 2 men to carry the administration message and take on 
party fundraising missions in congressional election years 
ill spend a good chunk of my time on the chicken and barbecue 
circuit quayle said in an interview in his white house office 
while quayle said he expects to take on the traditional vice 
presidential role carrying a lot of the political 
responsibilities he added that president bush may do more 
offyear campaigning than some of his predecessors this 
president is very active very politically astute a former 
national chairman quayle said 
bush also is very popular riding higher in the public opinion 
polls a year into his term than any president in nearly 30 years 
quayle has had an image problem since he was nominated and it 
doesnt seem to be improving 
but he already has bushs public assurance of renomination for a 
second term in 1992 nobody took more heat and did a better job 
for our ticket and our election bush said of quayle at a 
campaign reunion the other night 
offyear campaign duties can provide a vice president a platform 
and an opportunity to boost his standing and his visibility that 
often is easier on the political circuit away from washington 
than in the strictly supporting role vice presidents have at home 
its a crucial year for me a crucial year for the party but 
ive come to the conclusion that even though this will be a more 
visible year for me in a political sense im not so sure its 
going to be that much more of a visible year on a substantive 
basis said quayle who has blamed his continuing image problems 
in large part on the critical drubbing he took during the 1988 
campaign 
the american people dont spend a lot of time thinking about 
vice presidents he said they think about their president 
and therefore as far as the poll numbers and everything you 
inherit where you end up after a campaign and you cant do a whole 
lot about it he said so you go about doing the job and one 
of the jobs i will have is political and raising money 
republican national chairman lee atwater credits quayle with 
raising more than 7 million for the party during his first year in 
office hes traveled to 38 states played a major role in 
candidate recruitment atwater said he understands the nuts 
and bolts of politics 
spencer abraham chairman of the michigan republican party 
became quayles deputy chief of staff this month with duties 
including political liaison with party leaders 
quayle said one of his priorities will be the election of 
republican state legislators he said thats vital if not as 
visible as the statewide and house elections the state governments 
chosen this year will have control of the process of congressional 
redistricting the political jackpot is going to be who gets to 
draw the lines come 1991 the vice president said 
he said his message and tone as a campaigner will depend on the 
political environment and the level of contention between the 
democratic congress and the republican white house we will 
certainly be prepared to launch an offensive strike against any 
misguided or unfair criticism that happens to come the presidents 
way he said i have no role assigned to me to go out and be 
the hatchet man or raise the partisan rhetoric to high decibels 
but he said he will be ready to toughen the line if necessary 
bush was heavily engaged in the two offyear elections of his 
vice presidency the 1986 campaign provided a highprofile 
assignment and an opportunity to collect some political ious for 
use when he sought the republican presidential nomination two years 
later in 1982 while the republicans were on the way to losing 26 
house seats in a recession year bush resisted white house pressure 
to sharpen his attack he said the colorful hatchet man kind of 
approach wasnt his style 
im not spiro agnew bush said then 
agnews 1970 campaign was the extravaganza of vice presidential 
political missions 51 days 32000 miles in a chartered jet 
denunciations of candidates he called radical liberals 
alliterative attacks on nattering nabobs of negativism and 
pusillanimous pussyfooters 
one of his target states was texas to campaign for a republican 
senate candidate who lost 
george bush

as they watch east european communism 
tumble out of orbit leaders in vietnam north korea and china are 
defiantly holding to their oldline course toward the 21st century 
they dont outwardly show concern that what is happening in 
eastern europe will happen to them for one thing asian communism 
is rooted in stillrevered nationalist heroes such as chinas mao 
tsetung and vietnams ho chi minh in vietnam 
nor do they agree that the upheaval in eastern europe resulted 
from a failure of the communist system itself 
its not that the tree is no good but the ones who planted 
the tree are no good as maj gen trang cong man permanent vice 
secretarygeneral of the vietnam journalists association explained 
it 
unlike eastern europes version asian communism finds strength 
in traditional confucianism which emphasizes respect for authority 
at the same time asian communists face no organized opposition 
comparable to polands solidarity labor movement that could form a 
rallying point for dissent 
thus even in the face of eastern europes sweeping changes 
asias communist nations are vigorously defending their oneparty 
rule 
chinas communist party chief jiang zemin said at year end the 
leadership of the party is a historical necessity without 
centralism we will have extreme democracy and anarchy and nothing 
can be accomplished 
highly regimented north korea which is largely closed off to 
the noncommunist world is reported to have recalled some of its 
students from eastern europe presumably so they would not witness 
the changes that pyongyang considers political heresy 
kim jong il son of longtime leader kim il sung and heir 
apparent said the north korean communist party must on no 
account admit hetergeneous ideas into it in party activity the 
unity of action based on a single ideology can be realized through 
monolithic leadership 
even tiny laos which has been led by communists since the 
indochina war had something to say its official radio opened the 
new year with a broadcast acknowledging that 1989 was a 
nightmare for communism and calling on the people to rally around 
the party 
no asian country has been more vocal than vietnam in defense of 
communism 
nguyen van linh the vietnamese party chief said in his new 
years message that building socialism would be a goal for vietnam 
in 1990 foreign minister nguyen co thach said the communism system 
would emerge reinvigorated after overcoming the crisis it faces in 
eastern europe 
still the asian nations clearly are troubled by the 
implications of the european revolution and are drawing lessons 
we follow these events in europe so we can distinguish what is 
good and what is bad said trang cong man of the journalists 
association the sweeping changes show for example that eastern 
europeans wanted more democracy and higher production levels he 
said 
hanoi already realizes that if communism is to survive it needs 
a dose of marketoriented reform to stimulate the economy 
after a decade of disastrous economic policies vietnam in 1986 
introduced reforms such as deregulating prices permitting private 
enterprise and vastly curtailing subsidies to state enterprises 
although vietnam remains one of the worlds poorest nations 
substantial gains in food production and in fighting inflation were 
made last year and consumerism is on the rise 
many hanoi stores already are stocked with the foreign color 
televisions and video cassette recorders favored by vietnamese 
in many ways the economic program is similar to that instituted 
in china in the early 1980s by deng xiaoping the senior leader 
deng refused to open up the political system however leading 
to widespread protests for democracy that eventually led to the 
bloody crackdown on dissent and the resurgence of aging 
conservative leaders who are turning back on economic reform 
hanoi also has opted to proceed with political change at a much 
slower pace than economic reform 
the vietnamese communist party newspaper nhan dan said in 
november the party does not accept opposition political parties 
in a socialist society the main feature of political pluralism 
has been rejected by our party 
exhausted from decades of fighting foreign armies the 
vietnamese dont seem to hold a multiparty system as one of their 
immediate aims 
what the people like most is peace and security and doing 
business and developing the economy that is the first and foremost 
demand of the vietnamese people said nguyen dinh thi a writer 
and a party member for 40 years 
however he indicated that while people are not necessarily 
interested now in a multiparty system they do want more openness 
from the leadership 
this party must accept pluralism of opinions he said in an 
interview i think we should have many social organizations but 
it is not necessary to have many parties 
in private conversations however vietnamese encountered by a 
visiting reporter indicated approval of what has happened in 
eastern europe 
yes i know what has happened in eastern europe said a 
store clerk in a typical reaction it is good and it will be 
good for vietnam too

with no major ratings wars afoot in january abc 
and cbs each have news specials this week abcs guns tonight 
is a serious venture while thursdays 48 hours on cbs takes a 
look at paul mccartney on tour 
neither is all that special abcs effort is a moderate 
evenhanded report from stockton calif where a suicidal madman 
with an ak47 killed five schoolchildren and wounded 30 others just 
over a year ago 
but in its broad look at the gun issue it doesnt delve very 
deeply into the matter of such military weapons as the ak47 or 
m16 or that their bullet magazines can hold 20 or more rounds or 
who would want to own one and why 
still guns is unique in two respects its the first of a 
series of prime time specials that abc will air under the title 
peter jennings reporting in the age of the vanishing 
singlesubject documentary its good to see someone abc news 
president roone arledge in this case attempting a modest comeback 
in the arena 
secondly guns followed tonight by a 90minute 
nightline forum on the subject is a collaboration of sorts by 
abc with time magazine which features the national rifle 
association on this weeks cover 
such a printnetwork link isnt new cbs and newsweek magazine 
had a similar effort in 1981 newsweek ran a cover story on the 
surviving members of an army rifle company who had fought in 
vietnam and cbs reunited 31 of them for a bill moyers special 
bittersweet memories a vietnam reunion 
the abctime venture differs in that each organization while 
simultaneously reporting on the gun controversy takes a different 
approach on the subject covering it in our own way a time 
executive says 
richard duncan times assistant managing editor says he thinks 
the word synergy is terrible but that it describes the idea 
here 
with both news organizations simultaneously reporting on guns 
he says maybe you get a little more attention for the subject 
certain people are likely to read the magazine or see it on abc 
or both 
time and abc he says have discussed trying the approach 
perhaps three or four times a year but doing no more than that 
and it would be remarkable given the way breaking news goes if 
we actually ended up doing that 
its not a longterm arrangement he adds this is all very 
informal this is testing see how it feels how it looks how it 
works 
it can be debated whether cbs news which earlier did separate 
specials on guns and assault rifles need have devoted 90 minutes 
to thursdays special 48 hours on tour with paul mccartney 
surveying mccartney on the chicago stop of his first north 
american tour in 13 years it has interviews with the former 
beatle his production troops a mccartneycrazed fan and 
plainclothes cops seeking ticket scalpers 
some of it is interesting and in one case hilarious the 
arrest of a professional ticket scalper who grouses that the 
mccartney crowd is just too damn old and makes it hard for him 
to detect plainclothes cops 
it does amply reestablish that rock is very big business as 
well as a form of music and that such british lords of rock as 
mccartney are durable indeed even though they and their fans are 
now fortysomething 
but the special in which mccartney comes across as a 
goodnatured gent with a sense of proportion about fame and life 
its ownself adds little to what has been written about him and the 
beatles over the years 
it might have been more interesting had it explored his musical 
tastes keeping in mind that mccartney who has written some fine 
lovely songs and many older british pop stars know far more of 
music than rock some even speak jazz or classical and know of the 
older pop standards 
after seeing cbs special you tend to wish it had skipped the 
mccartneymad fan who rapidly proves a pain and instead followed 
up on the stars remark about the early days 
back then he says we were really keen to emulate the 
songwriters that we loved i mean i was out to become like another 
cole porter still am babe 
 
elsewhere in television 
morning shows seek warmth both abcs good morning america 
and cbs this morning are escaping the chill of new york next 
month for the warmth of florida cbs program will be there the 
week of feb 12 followed the next week by abcs reveille patrol 
nbc says its today show will probably will brave it out here

see you in the morning warner home video vhsbeta 8995 
pg13 
 
see you in the morning takes a generally cheerful and 
occasionally sappy look at the confusion and pain as well as the 
joy of love and marriage the second time around 
divorced new york psychiatrist larry livingstone jeff bridges 
falls in love with and marries beth alice krige a widow having a 
hard time letting go of her husband a suicide victim 
while beth tries to take blame for every foible of family life 
larry can be a pain in the neck in his own style annoyingly 
insecure and selfdeprecating as even he says hes nice only 
during office hours 
but both are essentially good and do their best to negotiate the 
problems that musical families create for her two children and 
his two who live with their television model mom farrah fawcett 
director alan j pakula falls far short of his best efforts 
all the presidents men klute and sophies choice 
but presents a pleasant film with some funny and touching moments 
the latter include a lovely wedding reception scene in which their 
somewhat tipsy friend linda lavin gets the assembled to sing 
auld lang syne 
the characters of this film have no financial problems they are 
intelligent and talented and they have friends so its sometimes 
easy to lose patience with their problems which can seem a little 
precious 
bridges and krige are very good as are all four children 
frances sternhagen is memorable as larrys wise and loving first 
motherinlaw

march rca michael penn 
 
yes michael penn is youknowwhos younger brother and critics 
looking for an easy hook are quick to note his music is as sweet as 
seans temper is frequently sour 
despite the connection theres no evidence of nepotism here 
penns debut album is a pleasing slice of pure pop and if he errs 
its only on the side of boyish enthusiasm 
no myth the first single and the albums lead cut sets an 
immediate lighthearted tone penn sings beatlesque melodies in a 
slightly ragged tenor centering most songs around his acoustic 
guitar and building from there 
what takes the songs out of the rubber soul era are pounding 
drums emphasized in the mix a reflection of the current scenes 
preoccupation with the beat drum machines handle part of the load 
but jim keltners outstanding performance on brave new world 
shows how the real thing can never be completely duplicated 
penn collaborates with keyboardist patrick warren on most of the 
music although theres an occasional dud penn hits more often 
than he misses this and that and bedlam boys are the 
strongest after no myth and evenfall brings the album to a 
rollicking close 
penn tries hard lyrically and his dylanlike wordplay on 
brave new world works well sometimes he tries too hard as 
this couplet from the turgid cupids got a brand new gun 
attests it glitters like a viper readies its attack tears your 
flesh and soul apart then clings to your back 
march also sounds a tad overproduced bragging youve got 
studio pros like keltner and kenny aronoff dueting on drums may pad 
an industry reputation but their work doesnt mean anything if the 
song isnt there the songs are there but sometimes too much 
windowdressing is added 
if he can retain his ability to write catchy melodies and hack 
some of the unnecessary verbiage from his writing penn has a 
promising future

all the way solarepic calloway 
 
the proper way to listen to calloways first album is with your 
feet 
dance floor stompers and toetotoe swayers mix together on 
all the way 
this record is funky and soulful but its funky soulful lite 
nothing hits too hard theres a bit of rapping but public enemy 
it aint its thrown in as a little sample of contemporary sound 
sir lancelot the albums opener is the grooveiest cut 
it and all the way the hardesthitting track are dance 
raveups they wont burn down the house like a bobby brown or 
janet jackson cut but theyre warm enough 
the duos ballads slide along cozily without getting too deep 
or urgent 
on the first single calloway sings i wanna be rich but 
unlike the 9millionpoundsofgoldnecklaces bad attitude of some 
rappers calloway sings to be rich in love peace and happiness 
the energy level on all the way jumps up and down like a 
confused thermometer 
both sides start with pumpedup tunes but then flatten out into 
ballads 
another dance track freaks compete pops up between ballads 
on the first side 
all the way is brothers reggie and cinovincent calloways 
debut effort as calloway their recording history includes seven 
years one platinum album and two gold albums with the dancesoul

denny laine has traveled a long and 
stymied road from scotlands mull of kintyre to lock no 11 on the 
erie canal 
his nineyear odyssey into obscurity since leaving paul 
mccartneys postbeatles band wings reached a new low when his 
boat ran out of gas on the canal last november and fuel was 
nowhere to be found 
after an aborted boat trip to florida laine and a friend found 
themselves stranded in amsterdam 30 miles west of albany they 
eventually found fuel but the experience gave laine a few moments 
to wonder if the new world offered anything better than the old to 
revive his career 
ive always wanted to come here to work said laine who 
left england last fall to live in another friends canalside 
mansion in lockport 25 miles north of buffalo i felt this was 
where i needed to be to get started im in a beginagain 
situation over here ive got a nostalgia name and people will 
probably turn out to see what i can do 
after wings scored with britains biggest selling single ever 
mull of kintyre laines downward spiral began when he and 
mccartney parted company critics characterized their split as a 
minor version of the mccartneyjohn lennon rift that broke up the 
beatles 
theres no real animosity anymore me and paul had a good 
team and we still are a good team said laine founder of the 
moody blues and the only member of the original wings trio whose 
last name wasnt mccartney when lennon died paul said he was 
never going to let that happen again he was never going to fall 
out with anyone again 
in england laine left behind a messy divorce an ugly tax 
record and the remnants of a career that always kept him on the 
fringes of superstardom 
at 45 he is struggling to escape the shadow of the aging rock 
star with little left to say hes thought of doing an 
autobiography but hes not sure it would be popular who am i 
really laine said 
with the moody blues in the 1960s laine was as much a star as 
eric clapton with cream or steve winwood with traffic but his solo 
efforts in the 70s and 80s never lifted him above his early work 
with the moodys or his backseat efforts for wings 
such laine tunes as time to hide did offer a harderrocking 
edge to mccartneys pure pop formula which produced an assembly 
line of hits that included my love and let em in 
since leaving wings in 1981 laine has put out four obscure solo 
albums as a wandering exminstrel he spent much of his time in 
spain he learned to travel light partly by choice and partly 
because divorce and taxes claimed so many of his possessions 
i dont really own anything laine said it makes me more 
fluent er fluid more fluent too because ive learned a lot of 
languages by traveling around 
laine plans to travel the united states playing small clubs and 
writing material for a new album 
his first project will be a song called food for all a we 
are the worldstyle collaboration to raise money for the 
homeless he said he wants to get all his friends from the early 
days involved including mccartney clapton and ron wood of the 
rolling stones 
laine wrote the music while his friend geoffrey giuliano of 
lockport who has written three books on the beatles wrote the 
lyrics laine who is now staying with friends in boston lived 
with giuliano for about two months last fall 
giuliano said laines one real talent is to make good music 
but wrong choices have marked his career and laine tended to get 
suckered into bad business schemes giuliano said laine admits he 
put money where he shouldnt have backing a race car driver and a 
record shop when he should have been concentrating on his music 
he has been on his own since breaking with mccartney although 
he did play on mccartneys 1982 album tug of war after 10 
years with wings he was tired of being the bands lead guitar but 
second fiddle or perhaps third fiddle behind mccartney and his 
wife linda 
i know people who were a hell of a lot more bitter than i 
was laine said i wasnt bitter so much as sick of it all 
ive retreated to what i was originally which is an individual 
songwriter 
the driving force on the moody blues first two albums laine 
had trouble being the nameless face alongside the mccartneys on 
wings album covers 
he insists he and mccartney had a true partnership yet others 
associated with wings made him feel like mccartneys flunky a 
junior partner on the order of george harrison whom mccartney and 
lennon granted a token pair of songs on most beatles albums laine 
said 
other people made me feel like i was working for him instead 
of working with him laine said that was one of the reasons i 
did walk away from it 
another reason was mccartneys 1980 marijuana arrest in japan 
that and death threats mccartney received after lennon was killed 
kept the band from touring 
we would have been going back into the studio for two more 
years laine said i was bored with it 
laine also said he had wanted wings to turn toward more funky 
dancey stuff since laine left mccartney has done just that 
recording with michael jackson stevie wonder and elvis costello 
similarly laine said he left the moody blues in 1967 because 
the other band members seemed unwilling to hit the studio and 
record the splashy concept album he wanted to do 
a few months later laine was with lennon when the moodys 
brought over a tape of their new album days of future passed 
was the bands biggest success a rockclassical fusion that 
yielded nights in white satin and tuesday afternoon 
as a result of my leaving they did exactly what i wanted to 
do laine said but they wouldnt have done it if i had stayed 
i contributed my part and moved on 
his anthem could be the early hit he sang for the moody blues 
go now when real stardom neared laine went 
maybe i was scared of it or something he said if it 
doesnt feel right i dont stay around very long 
laine plans to marry his longtime girlfriend helen grant 
daughter of led zeppelin manager peter grant theyll stay in the 
united states for a year or two so laine can tour and record 
eventually dividing their time between the united states and 
england he said 
its my turn to put something together i cant wait around 
any longer for someone to approach me laine said i feel like 
ive been saving myself up for the last few years

a former methodist minister who was 
forced to leave the pulpit after a celebrated church trial arising 
from her practice of homosexuality has written an autobiography 
that concludes with an appeal for tolerance and acceptance 
let my people in william morrow and co 1895 traces 
rose mary denmans journey from her strict roman catholic childhood 
in a bluecollar rhode island family to her discovery of her 
lesbian identity that culminated in her relationship with the woman 
with whom she lives in portland 
along the way there was service in the air force marriage 
motherhood divorce seminary studies and yet another change in 
religious allegiance to the unitarian universalist association 
if nothing else denman 42 said she hopes the book will 
encourage readers to be more understanding and less judgmental of 
people whose sexual preferences differ from their own 
before anyone begins to judge they should think how many 
people out there are gay she said in an interview you could 
be judging your own child your minister or any number of other 
people 
estranged from her father and an outcast in her family after she 
defied her bishop and refused to keep her lesbianism a secret 
denman counsels family members to try to avoid laying blame or 
guilt 
if we could only begin to see that homosexuality is simply 
another alternative to loving perhaps we can stop trying to find a 
person or an event to blame she wrote homosexuality is not a 
disease to be cured or a sin to be healed it is a life to be lived 
and celebrated no less than heterosexuality 
the book is dedicated to winnie weir the exwife of a methodist 
minister who denman met while she served as pastor of a small 
church in north anson their friendship evolved into love leading 
to the break between denman and the united methodist church 
prior to that time denman said she was unaware of her sexual 
orientation although in retrospect there were indications she was 
gay her crush on a kindergarten teacher or her sorrow at being 
separated from her air force training instructor 
looking back it was like it was all there but i was too blind 
to see it i had a bad case of denial she said 
the book also details denmans 1987 church trial in dover nh 
where a jury of methodist ministers found her guilty of violating a 
3yearold church rule banning homosexual clergy she could have 
been expelled from the church or removed from the clergy but was 
given the lesser penalty of suspension which allowed her time to 
transfer to another denomination 
four months later she was accepted into the unitarian ministry 
where she fills in for other pastors and takes on various speaking 
engagements while she initially hoped to obtain her own parish 
she said she no longer aspires to the fulltime ministry 
parish ministry means living in a fish bowl and i dont like 
living a fishbowl life style she said somebody started the 
rumor that ministers are supposed to be perfect and 99 percent of 
us are not 
the public demands that a minister be always patient never 
tired ever the perfect listener she added i have to be more 
human than that 
instead she has found a fulfilling new career in teaching and 
now works as a parttime instructor in english and psychology at 
southern maine technical college in south portland 
denman says her book has a potentially broad audience 
the united methodists are going to buy the book because 
theyre nosy other gays and lesbians will buy it because its our 
story our struggle and others will buy it because they want to 
find out more about the issue of homosexuality and how the church 
relates to it 
denman says that while she had initially felt pain then anger 
and finally disillusionment after her split with the methodist 
church she harbors no grudges or feelings of bitterness 
they unwittingly gave me more opportunity for growth than ive 
ever had before she said

amy grant makes no apologies for her 
brand of popgospel music and in turn she doesnt criticize other 
more controversial singers 
as musicians we at the end of the day have to answer for what 
weve done thats true of everybody in life some handle that 
responsibility very poorly at times i do too says grant 
winner of four grammy awards 
she hopes her songs about the joy of living spiritual responses 
and her own failures and weaknesses are a positive alternative to 
other forms of music and entertainers who often greatly influence 
youngsters 
some kids try on different personalities and different 
expressions of behavior in life and the pendulum swings too far and 
they never come back she said its horrible and tragic 
uncontroversial and unfailingly pleasant the 29yearold singer 
has emerged from the gospel music field as a force in pop music 
with her millionselling albums unguarded age to age and 
most recently a christmas album 
she joined peter cetera former lead singer for chicago on a 
no 1 pop record in 1986 next time i fall 
they have not recorded together since grant said because she 
started a family she and her husband singersongwriter gary 
chapman have a son matthew 2 and a daughter gloria born in 
december 
and the right song hasnt come along she said 
the no 1 record she said raised her already blossoming career 
another peg or two everybody dreams of that kind of visibility 
grant describes next time i fall as a sweet song and 
beautifully produced peters voice is legendary people hear it 
and think of everything from saturday in the park to youre my 
inspiration its hard to lose when youre doing a song with 
someone whos that much of a heavyweight 
shes also featured in a duet with art garfunkel on his the 
animals christmas a delightful album of jimmy webb songs that 
came out in 1986 
grants career aim is to inspire and not to preach and the 
messages in her music are sometimes veiled but she says the 
reaction from the public has been a meaningful part of her life 
over the last 10 years i have received more letters and 
just one in a lifetime would make a life worthwhile she said in 
an interview at her secluded farm 30 minutes south of downtown 
nashville 
one response was from a kid saying you helped me survive a 
night that i didnt think i would live through thats enough 
appreciation to make you believe your whole career has been 
worthwhile 
grant was born in augusta ga and raised in nashville where 
her father a doctor moved to set up practice the youngest of 
four daughters she grew up listening to carole king and james 
taylor as her interest in bible studies and a love of singing drew 
her toward gospel music 
she was working in a recording studio sweeping floors at age 15 
when a record producer heard a tape of her singing and signed her 
to a contract she felt the demands of the business at a young age 
having to give up her english studies at vanderbilt university 
after three years because of the need to travel and record 
in the years since grant has become one of nashvilles biggest 
singing stars in a city dominated by more earthy country music 
she has released 11 albums and had hit single records such as 
angels find a way and el shaddai 
she has appeared on such diverse tv shows as the tonight show 
starring johnny carson hee haw and 700 club 
as a humanitarian she has been active in habitat for humanity 
an organization that helps build homes for lowincome families in 
rochester ny and birmingham ala she pitched in at 
construction sites by grabbing hammers and saws she spoke in 
support of the group during a 58city concert tour in 1988 
grant points to her songs her voice and stage manner as keys to 
her popularity i think my songs are easy to relate to i think 
my voice is easy to relate to i think theres something familiar 
about what i do because i sing from life experiences 
ive been told that in concert i have a gift of putting people 
at ease making an audience feel included in the experience and not 
watching from afar she said 
i think its because i like to be included in things its 
sort of a natural progression for me to put on a concert like 
that

jack nicklaus can scorch the fairways like 
practically no one else but this month he became just another 
statistic in a growing trend 
nicklaus who turned 50 on sunday is now eligible to join the 
pga seniors tour hes also joining albeit with not quite as much 
fanfare the exploding number of older americans who compete in 
agegroup sports 
the attraction is simple try your hardest be your best and in 
five to 10 years be reborn into an older group masters swimmers 
for example compete in fiveyear intervals up to 9094 the united 
states tennis federation sanctions matches for men 85 and older and 
women 75 and older agegroup competitions also are organized in 
bicycling track and field marathons and triathlons 
the system encourages older americans to keep competing because 
at least once every few years they get to be the youngest kid on 
the block 
you like to come in at the bottom of your age group and blow 
them away said dr george mcvey 62 of rochester ny who has 
competed for 17 years in masters swimming and has been 
internationally ranked in the breaststroke 
its amazing the condition of these people he said of 
those attending national masters swim meets 
seventyfiveyearolds can go up and down the pool like you 
wouldnt believe 
a couple of years ago our oldest category was 50plus said 
gary scott of triathlon federationusa now its 70plus 
these older triathletes arent running minievents either they 
are in the same grueling races attempted by athletes 50 years their 
junior 
we had one 64yearold woman who finished in a decent time at 
the ironman scott said she beat a lot of men in their 
thirties 
the ironman is one of the worlds most prestigious triathlons 
held in kailuakona hawaii each year the woman joanita reed of 
san antonio swam a 24mile ocean race cycled 112 miles over 
hills and ran a 262mile marathon all in the same day she 
finished in 14 hours 31 minutes and 55 seconds 
we have experienced a dramatic increase in masters riders in 
the last five years agreed kyle woodlief spokesman for the 
united states cycling federation in colorado springs colo our 
oldest licensed racer is 93 
that rider fred knoller of lauderdalebythesea fla 
competed in the us nationals from 1976 to 1985 when he was 89 
knoller has stopped competing but is still a big fan of the move 
toward smaller agegroup categories 
when i was in my 50s i was still racing against 
40yearolds he said he keeps his membership to get the 
newsletter and find out how friends are doing some of these boys 
60 65 are really good real pros 
last june the cream of american senior athletes gathered to go 
for the gold in st louis at the us national senior olympics 
the 3452 athletes ranging from 55 to 91 earned the chance to 
compete through strong performances at qualifying meets where more 
than 100000 seniors tested their mettle 
you know the saying if you dont use it you lose it said 
sylvia auerbach swartz 77 who with her sisters rose 74 and 
pearl 68 earned 12 medals at the senior olympics its 
important not to let the joints get stiff youve got to keep them 
going 
swartz of new york said a youthful diet of volleyball 
softball basketball lacrosse and speedball along with some 
middleaged tennis and pingpong laid the base for her success 
medals in field events came from weekly training pointers from 
local coaches and encouragement from her sisters 
we dont compete against each other though she said 
thats why we are still talking 
at the viii world veterans championships last summer in eugene 
ore billed as the largest track meet in history former olympic 
athletes faced topflight but unknown competitors from around the 
world many of the 4950 athletes produced times and distances that 
were the talk of the meet 
paula schneiderhan of west germany produced a world record in 
the womens 6569 200meter sprint with a time of 3165 seconds 
although seniors are still a rather small segment of the sports 
population one industry expert says when they do enjoy a sport 
they go at it with gusto 
the mature market incidence in most sports is pretty low 
said harvey lauer president of american sports data inc a 
research firm in hartsdale 
but if you look at the people who do run for example and are 
over 55 they do it with a vengeance he said tennis players 
over 55 play tennis more than tennis players in general its a 
time factor 
although some agegroup seniors were top athletes in their prime 
like rose auerbach national aau javelin champ in 1937 and 1938 
many more found the joy of competition much later in life the 
80to84 category for example is the fastestgrowing age group at 
us masters swimming meets 
dan gruender the president of us masters swimming began 
competing only after following his wife edie to masters swim 
meets at 61 mrs gruender is internationally ranked in the 
butterfly freestyle and individual medley 
as the greying of america takes place people realize that 
staying active is the one way to improve the quality of your life 
its also very satisfying and thats what its all about he 
said selfimprovement is the touchstone we push we dont care 
if it takes you 3 minutes to swim a lap next time make it 259

t franklin williams a geriatrics physician is 
director of the national institute on aging one of the 13 
institutes that comprise the national institutes of health of the 
department of health and human services

asked at her retirement luncheon what she 
was going to do with all the time shed have pearl peters said she 
and her husband planned to visit their grown children and shed 
paint visit friends maybe volunteer at the local hospital shed 
also spend more time with her parents 
but when planning her retirement mrs peters underestimated the 
amount of time and energy it would take to care for her parents 
how could she help them remain healthy active and independent for 
as long as possible 
mrs peters and others like her can succeed by starting to think 
about the special needs of aging parents long before a crisis so 
parents are included in the process every situation is different 
but most families should consider health care social support 
housing and legal and financial issues 
health strongly influences a persons sense of wellbeing while 
most older people are basically healthy and consider themselves to 
be many tend to underreport specific problems and mistakenly 
think they are caused by age research has shown that physical and 
mental decline are not inevitable and that aches and pains may be 
warnings of disease they should be discussed with a doctor 
preferably a specialist in the health problems of aging 
those who dont have a family doctor can contact a county 
medical society or state or local agency on aging other sources of 
information include local referral services health departments 
medical schools and medical centers 
caregiving adult children can help their parents stay healthy 
and active by encouraging them to have regular checkups exercise 
and eat properly 
most older people even those with an illness or disability 
can take part in moderate exercise programs before starting a 
fitness program however older adults should see their doctor 
the basic guidelines for a nutritious diet are the same for most 
healthy adults older people however need to pay special 
attention to the quality of foods a balanced diet provides 
vitamins minerals and calories from proteins carbohydrates and 
some fats and includes foods from each major group 
now that more women the traditional caregivers are working a 
greater need for a wide network of supportive services is emerging 
if additional help is needed a physician nurse and social worker 
trained in geriatrics can be asked for a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment thorough diagnosis appropriate treatment options and 
help in identifying supportive services an assessment will also 
identify medical and rehabilitation possibilities that may minimize 
the need for supportive services 
in assessing housing needs families should look at the safety 
and convenience of appliances furnishings and the layout of the 
house improved lighting and adjustments such as widening doors to 
accommodate wheelchairs or installing handrails on steps and in 
bathrooms are relatively simple and will permit older people to 
remain in their own homes longer 
a growing number of housing alternatives are available when an 
older person can no longer live alone choices depend on factors 
including health financial resources and family situation options 
include retirement communities senior citizen housing accessory 
apartments and shared housing adult children and their parents can 
consider sharing the same house but this often is not whaat either 
generation really prefers nursing homes are and should be only 
for those who really need them the decision to enter a nursing 
home should be made by both the person entering the home and the 
family 
the question of finances cannot be avoided medical and 
longterm care are expensive and can quickly deplete a familys 
savings one thing everyone can do to prepare for the future is to 
get records in order a financial records file should include such 
things as a persons social security number date and place of 
birth location of a will or trust sources of income and bank 
accounts 
caregiving for an older parent often involves a partnership of 
family friends support services and medical and legal 
professionals while devoting time and energy caregivers also must 
be sure to attend to their own interests and health it is 
important to recognize limitations to think creatively to ask for 
help if needed and to maintain a sense of humor

a us camera company has answered a lawsuit 
by the trading arm of japanese conglomerate mitsubishi with legal 
papers of its own in a dispute over parts supply and overseas 
marketing agreements 
keystone camera of clifton said monday it sued mitsubishi 
international corp in federal court here seeking more than 30 
million 
keystone accused mitsubishi of acting in bad faith with plans 
to either take over keystone or drive it out of business by 
wrongly charging it 19 million for parts and refusing to market 
keystone cameras overseas 
the suit filed friday seeks what it said were 2175 million 
in lost profits and 10 million in punitive damages 
mitsubishi sued keystone in us district court in manhattan 
last december accusing it of failing to pay the 19 million and 
of violating an agreement under which mitsubishi would be its 
exclusive importer 
keystones suit has a very strong element of fantasy said 
mitsubishis attorney marshall beil 
the japanese company has bent over backwards to help keystone 
work out payment terms he said it is in mitsubishis interest 
that keystone remain healthy he added 
keystone said mitsubishi failed to live up to arrangements 
reached in sept 1988 under which the japanese concern would 
supply it with electronic parts in exchange for 3 million in 
completed cameras 
the agreements also called for mitsubishi to sell keystone 
cameras in all foreign markets except for england said keystone 
chairman mike berman 
it was an extremely unusual agreement berman acknowledged 
and was made by previous management 
the lawsuit said mitsubishi continued to send keystone parts 
beyond the 3 million which werent needed because mitsubishi had 
failed to generate enough business overseas for the finished 
cameras 
when keystone balked at paying the 19 million for the extra 
parts mitsubishi allegedly cut off parts shipments and told its 
offices to stop selling keystone cameras 
mitsubishi was motivated in part because the parent company has 
a financial interest in nikon corp a major manufacturer and 
distributor of camera equipment said the lawsuit 
all the parts that mitsubishi shipped were specifically 
ordered and specifically requested by keystone said beil 
denying that the nikon interest influenced its actions nor did 
mitsubishi ever refuse to market keystone cameras he said 
keystone which predicts 42 million in 1989 sales said it and 
polaroid are the only us manufacturers of cameras after a 19 
million loss in the first quarter keystone reported earnings of 
521000 for the third quarter 
it has 800 employees at its headquarters and plant in clifton

access codes for rival telephone companies 
will be provided by atampt operators if another serious outage 
cripples its own longdistance service the company announced 
after a jan 15 breakdown that affected american telephone amp 
telegraph co customers nationwide the countrys largest 
longdistance carrier was criticized because its operators did not 
give out access codes for other carriers 
residential and most business customers are able to use any 
longdistance company but they need to dial a fivedigit access 
code to use a carrier other than the one assigned to a particular 
telephone 
we regret that at the start of last weeks service disruption 
atampt operators were unable to help customers because we did not 
have adequate procedures in place for such an unprecedented 
situation atampt chairman robert allen said monday 
atampt operators will now provide another carriers access code if 
they have the information the company said in a news release if 
they do not have the codes they will refer customers to local 
telephone directories 
atampt has about 70 percent of the long distance market in the 
united states mci communications corp is no 2 with about 12 
percent us sprint is third with about 8 percent and about 700 
other long distance carriers control the rest of the market 
each company has its own access code 
the access code for mci is 10222 us sprint is 10333 and atampt 
is 10288 
last weeks outage was the most widespread ever at atampt and 
effectively blocked about half the longdistance calls attempted 
company officials said 
the associated press quoting atampt spokesman harry baumgartner 
reported over the weekend that the company was considering a 
mutualaid agreement with its two top rivals 
but another atampt spokesman walter murphy said monday that the 
ap report was unrealistic and that baumgartner had either been 
quoted out of context or misunderstood 
baumgartner was interviewed last week by an ap reporter and said 
atampt was discussing the feasibility of asking mci and us sprint to 
join it in agreement to help one another should one of their 
systems shutdown 
walter murphy another atampt spokesman said monday the company 
had not discussed such a plan and that there are no plans to do so 
he said the company would consider a number of options but he 
refused to say whether or not it included a socalled mutualaid 
agreement 
im never going to say somethings going to be ruled out 
forever murphy said but he added from our point of view 
there are some obvious technical and legal problems in reaching 
this kind of agreement 
spokesmen for mci and us sprint told the ap last week that they 
would welcome discussing a mutual aid agreement

indias new government may only be 
playing politics by trying to get 25 billion more from union 
carbide corp for the 1984 bhopal gas disaster but the move could 
keep the company under a legal cloud for years to come some 
analysts and lawyers said 
prime minister vp singh traveled to an indian shantytown on 
sunday and announced the government would scrap a 470 million 
settlement to pursue criminal charges and the original 3 billion 
in damages sought from union carbide 
the news drove union carbides stock down sharply monday but 
some attorneys and the company say the settlement is perfectly 
legal and the government may only be trying to appeal to its new 
constituents 
im guessing but i think in an attempt to appear populist the 
new government might be doing a little bit of saber rattling 
said juan noble a chemical industry analyst for argus research 
corp in new york nobody wants to give the impression theyre 
caving in and throwing in the towel 
about 3500 were killed and 20000 injured when a gas used in 
making pesticides seeped from a storage tank at a union carbide 
plant in bhopal on dec 3 1984 
the government of rajiv gandhi originally sought 3 billion in 
damages but later settled for 470 million and agreed to absolve 
the company of further criminal or civil liability indias supreme 
court accepted the deal last february 
danburybased union carbide stands by the settlement as fair and 
binding 
the new administration may not dissolve the settlement because 
it disagrees with it said joseph e geoghan the companys 
general counsel in a statement issued last week he was 
unavailable for comment monday 
the case was settled and the government of india accepted the 
settlement said fred h siemer an analyst with chemical 
research in new yor so if i was carbide i would just consider 
the case closed 
andreas lowenfeld a law professor at new york university said 
he believed the settlement would stand unless bribery or other 
fraud were found to have influenced the agreement 
it was not just a settlement he said settlements are 
hard to overturn but this was a settlement affirmed by the 
supreme court the chances of overturning seem quite slight to me 
rob hagen a washington attorney following the litigation said 
the new government could argue that fraud and collusion were 
involved or attack the settlement as unfair he believes there is 
some legal basis to reopen the issue in the 37 petitions filed 
before a supreme court panel 
clearly its a new ball game hagen said its going to be 
an interesting story thats not going to go away 
but singhs challenge may only be an effort to appear 
sympathetic to his new constituents some observers said 
this could be just a political ploy said harvey wachsman 
president of the american board of professional liability 
attorneys the other side of it is maybe he can get something 
done then he looks like a prince hes done all of this and 
gandhi looks bad it depends on the laws of india and who knows 
whats what 
analysts were split on how the governments intervention could 
affect union carbide financially 
i would say as a practical matter this thing is probably going 
to drag on for 10 or 15 years at least and its going to result in 
extra legal expenses said donald a pattison an analyst with 
cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc in new york in the meantime 
its certainly not going to help the stock 
union carbides stock fell 1625 monday to 20875 a share 
but noble said he believed economic factors would continue to 
drive the price of the stock 
the bhopal thing hasnt really been factored into my thinking 
for quite a long time now he said

a blueribbon advisory panel has panned a 
congressional study critical of the specialist trading system at 
stock exchanges and sent it back for a major reworking 
the panel consisting of market professionals regulators 
academics and trade group representatives sharply criticized the 
draft report securities markets and information technology by 
the office of technology assessment a congressional think tank 
the chicago mercantile exchange in a memo submitted to the ota 
complained that important fundamental concepts are incorrecly 
stated and basic facts are plainly wrong 
among the points the cme disputed at a meeting of the advisory 
panel monday was the contention that intervention in securities 
markets by congress would make markets less efficient or drive them 
out of the country to lands with fewer restrictions 
in all categories were were unhappy with the way this was put 
together cme president william brodsky said after mondays 
session 
i think it was flawed and potentially disruptive said 
another panel member eric k clemons a professor of computer and 
information science at the university of pennsylvanias wharton 
school they were persuaded not to go forward yet with the 
report which has been in the works for 18 months 
thats the way the panel procedure works said jean 
mcdonald a spokeswoman for ota an arm of congress that analyzes 
science and technology and its potential impact 
the idea is to get as accurate a report as you can she 
said adding theyll go back to the draft and look at it based 
on the comments 
although the draft report has not been released numerous press 
accounts and some of the comment memos released by panel members 
indicated it called for a centralized computerized national market 
system 
the study also reportedly described the specialist system at the 
new york and american stock excahnges as faltering and possibly 
irredeemably obsolete 
under the specialist system of trading stock can be traded only 
through certain designated exchange members who are charged with 
maintaining an orderly market in that security even if it means 
buying or selling the stock because no other takers can be found 
critics have claimed the specialists are unable to keep up with 
the massive volume that occurs in a market crisis like the 1987 
crash but supporters have said specialists stayed by their posts 
taking orders when other traders werent answering their phones 
during the crash 
the new york stock exchange in a comment memo said the draft 
report in its present form does not meet its stated goal of 
balance fairly representing the views of major stakeholders 
among the other panelists was alan bretzer vice president for 
market regulation for the midwest stock exchange in chicago gene 
l finn chief economist for the national association of securities 
dealers and john c baldwin director of the utah securities 
division 
the final report will be submitted to a 12member congressional 
board equally divided between democrats and republicans house 
and senate members which oversees the ota 
if approved by the board the study will be released to the 
public said ms mcdonald adding that ota does not make any 
recommendations it only lays out policy options 
the study was begun as an outgrowth of the 1987 stock market 
crash which critics claimed was worsened by computerdriven 
program trading

chrysler corp and an austrian automaker are 
teaming up to begin european production of minivans hoping 
continental drivers will take a liking to the popular vehicle that 
has propped up chryslers us market share 
chrysler said monday it would form a joint venture with 
steyrdaimlerpuch fahrzeugtechnik of graz austria to make the 
vehicles beginning in the spring of 1991 
the move indicates the growing importance of the european market 
for american automakers general motors corp and ford motor co 
have had assembly plants on the continent for decades and strong 
profits there in recent years have helped offset weakness at home 
chrysler had european manufacturing interests in the past but 
because of worsening finances the company in 1978 sold its holdings 
in france britain and spain to peugeot for a 14 percent share in 
the french company and 230 million 
chrysler two years ago began exporting some cars and minivans to 
europe under the chrysler nameplate along with its jeep brand 
sportutility vehicles last year chrysler exported about 50000 
vehicles to europe 
it would be chryslers second joint venture with a european 
automaker nearly a year ago chrysler and the french automaker 
renault announced a plan to build small sportutility vehicles at 
sites yet to be identified in north america and either spain or 
portugal 
that vehicle codenamed the jj is go into production in 
1992 for the 1993 model year 
details of the chrysleraustrian project werent available 
monday chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said from company 
headquarters in highland park mich production targets and 
marketing plans wont be announced for about two months she said 
the minivan and sportutility segments are relatively small in 
the european market but hold good potential for growth analysts 
say 
for years volkswagen of west germany has produced and marketed 
a passenger van there but its design differs from us minivans 
the french vehicle maker renault sells the espace minivan but in 
relatively low volumes 
the us market is different chrysler controls more than half 
of the us minivan market with its plymouth voyager dodge caravan 
and chrysler town amp country vehicles selling more than 500000 of 
the vehicles last year in north america it exported about 8800 
minivans to europe in 1989 from assembly plants in st louis mo 
and windsor ontario 
us sales of minivans and jeeps which carry some of the 
largest profit margins in chryslers product line have helped the 
companys profits but as the entire auto market sags so do 
minivan and jeep sales 
analysts have predicted that chrysler will report little if 
any profit during the fourthquarter of 1989 meantime they have 
forecast that gm and ford will report sharply lower profits but 
that european operations will keep the nos 1 and 2 automakers in 
the black 
they had to so something a little different auto analyst 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc said of 
chryslers european ambitions if you wanted to start from 
scratch you would go to spain or portugal for the labor costs 
this is an existing facility she said of the austrian 
plant so they save a lot of money and its faster to get it into 
production 
in 1983 american motors corp established in china the beijing 
jeep corp which chrysler inherited when it bought amc from 
renault in 1987 chrysler owns about a third of beijing jeep which 
produces mostly commercial vehicles for the chinese market

a dramatic 470 million charge by merrill lynch 
amp co to cut businesses and personnel because of tough times on 
wall street could speed bloodletting at other securities firms 
analysts say 
the nations biggest brokerage on monday reported a 362 million 
fourthquarter loss including the onetime charge for an 
acrosstheboard restructuring expected to result in more than 
4000 staff cuts 
the pretax charge which analysts called the largest by a 
securities firm for a restructuring comes during wide retrenchment 
on wall street because of slow business since the october 1987 
stock market crash 
for all of 1989 merrill lynch reported a loss of 213 million 
compared to profits of 463 million the previous year 
lawrence eckenfelder a securities industry analyst with 
prudential bache securities corp in san francisco said the size 
of the charge may lead other firms that have not pruned as 
drastically to step up costcutting 
merrill was clearly the biggest and certainly one of the most 
inefficient firms out there he said what it suggests is 
theres an awful lot more to come im sure at other firms as 
well 
wall street has lost more than 23000 jobs since the crash 
which followed broad expansion during the heady bull market 
merrills cuts have been the most stunning because of the firms 
preeminence 
only drexel burnham lambert inc which has cut its work force 
by more than 50 percent since resolving government securities fraud 
charges has engineered a more severe reduction 
the restructuring charge that we took was planned and 
deliberate in response to the difficult market we face in our 
industry merrill lynch president daniel p tully said in an 
interview 
its a recognition that theres been a sea change in the 
industry he said 
tully said the charge included 120 million for severance 
payments 125 million to write down the value of existing assets 
and 220 million to cover office sales and lease payments 
merrill officials said they expected the restructuring 
eventually would save 100 million to 200 million a year 
merrill blamed the overall 1989 decline on hard times 
characterized by an exodus of small investors slumping investment 
banking profits that reflect a decline in merger activity a severe 
drop in the junk bond market and increased competition 
the firm touted as a breed apart in newspaper and 
television advertisements expanded aggressively during the 
mid1980s diversifying its businesses and reaching a peak 
employment of 47000 shortly before the crash 
by the end of the year merrill is expected to have a total work 
force of around 36800 compared with 40500 at the end of 1989 
this is a definite indication that no securities firm can be 
all things to all people said industry analyst perrin long of 
lipper analytical services 
merrills quarterly loss which amounted to 356 a share 
compared with earnings of 276 million or 269 a share for the 
same 1988 period revenue for the quarter ending dec 29 was 28 
billion up from 267 billion in the 1988 quarter 
for the full year merrill reported a pershare loss of 231 
in 1988 merrill reported a profit of 463 million or 429 a 
share revenue for 1989 was 113 billion up 16 percent from 975 
billion in 1988 
the revenue increase was due mainly to a 35 percent rise in 
interest and dividends revenue sank 186 percent for principal 
transactions and 63 percent from investment banking while 
commission revenue gained 123 percent 
merrill said the two areas of decline reflected markdowns in the 
firms inventory of highyield bonds the junk bond market was 
battered in 1989 because of a series of huge defaults and declines 
in the use of the securities to finance mergers and takeovers 
the firms 1988 fullyear and fourthquarter results included a 
255 million aftertax gain from the termination of a merrill 
pension plan 
merrill plans to eliminate about 3000 jobs by the end of 1990 
through layoffs attrition and selling off businesses in addition 
merrill recently cut 700 positions by selling its canadian retail 
brokerage operation and eliminated 300 more jobs through cuts in 
its broadcort capital corp accountclearing business 
since november merrill also has abandoned the european 
commercial paper business eliminated one equity division at its 
new york headquarters and reduced trading of british stocks

intel corp has entered into a joint 
venture with a japanese company to make and sell dynamic random 
access memory chips the most commonly used chip for storing 
information in computers the companies announced 
the japanese company nmb semiconductor has two factories in 
japan making 256k and 1megabit drams and it plans a third plant 
to build 4megabit chips 
the announcement said a fourth plant will be built in the united 
states but added that details regarding the us plant wont be 
disclosed until later 
under the agreement intel as majority partner in the joint 
venture will take over distribution of all of nmbs output by the 
third quarter of this year the companies said 
nmb currently sells its chips through minebea a major 
ballbearing maker that is a big shareholder in nmb the statement 
said 
american companies invented the dram but japanese companies in 
the past decade have taken over 75 percent of the market by 
underpricing us rivals 
this arrangement will provide our customers with another us 
source of drams which is critical to the us computer industry 
said intel chairman gordon moore 
concern about the dependability of foreign supplies led intel 
and six other hightechnology companies to band together in an 
effort to resume largescale domestic dram production but the 
planned venture us memories collapsed last week because of 
insufficient backing

corporate spending on research and development 
did not keep pace with inflation last year the first time american 
rampd outlays have declined in real terms in 14 years a newspaper 
reported monday 
figures due to be released within a week by the national science 
foundation shows that us corporations spent 688 billion on 
research and development in 1989 compared to 665 billion in 
1988 the new york times reported in tuesdays editions 
when adjusted for inflation however the 1989 spending total 
represented a decline of 09 percent from the previous year the 
newspaper said 
economists and corporate research executives say the decline is 
particularly worrying because rampd spending increasingly is being 
shifted from basic research to the development of specific 
products reducing the chances of fundamental breakthroughs the 
times said 
in addition a smaller portion of research is being done in 
large laboratories where resources can be pooled limiting the 
opportunity for significant advances the newspaper said 
the decline in corporate research spending has been attributed 
to a number of factors including high interest rates an increasing 
focus by company managers on shortterm performance and 
costcutting that accompanies corporate restructurings mergers and 
leveraged buyouts the times said

general motors corp will recall all 244000 
fourcylinder pontiac fieros because of a persistent engine fire 
threat but it wont say when 
weve notified nhtsa the national highway traffic safety 
administration of our intent to conduct a recall gm spokesman 
tom pyden said monday we are still determining the fix 
procedure and until that point it is premature to come out and 
notify owners and dealers 
nhtsa was fully aware of our actions and as soon as we were 
ready to go we were going to issue dealer and customer 
notification and a news release 
on friday the national transportation safety board caught gm by 
surprise when it included in its monthly safety investigation 
report that gm had notified it of plans to recall every 
fourcylinder fiero built 
engine fires contributed to the demise of the twoseat 
plasticbody sports car that pontiac dealers sold for five years 
the midengine car was introduced in september 1983 as a 1984 
model and got off to a quick sales start gm announced cancellation 
of the fiero in march 1988 after 1984 models were recalled once 
amid reports of engine malfunctions causing engine fires 
nhtsa spokesman tim hurd said monday the agency received a 
letter dated dec 28 1989 from gm saying the company would recall 
the cars hurd declined to say if it was unusual for a month to 
pass between the time the agency was notified and a recall actually 
being issued 
it is my understanding that the previous fix has not solved 
the problem of fires in fieros hurd said from washington im 
sure that gm is working as hard as it can in good faith to get this 
problem solved 
it is the second time the fourcylinder fiero has been recalled 
because of possible engine fires pontiac made about 100000 
sixcylinder fieros which will not be subject to the recall 
in 1987 gm recalled 125000 fieros after engine fires had 
occurred in one of every 400 cars the company said engine 
connecting rods which link pistons to the crankshaft could blast 
through the side of the engine causing an oil leak that could lead 
to fire 
during that recall gm made some alterations including boosting 
oil capacity to four quarts from three and urging motorists to 
check the engine oil every time they got gas 
gm spokesman reggie harris said the automaker was caught unaware 
by the nhtsas announcement of the recall 
we were working with nhtsa on the orderly process for 
preparing for the parts validation harris said of repair work 
tests this is unusual normally we would make our own 
announcement when we have a program in place 
gm began making the fiero at a plant in pontiac in january 1983 
for the 1984 model year when it sold 101720 fieros the first car 
rolled off the assembly line in july 1983 with a base price of 
7999 
in the 1985 modelyear sales slipped to 90691 falling to 
71283 in 1986 47156 in 1987 and 24621 in 1988

departments normal regulatory activity he noted that further

procedural and had to be filed to meet british statutory 
deadlines of government comment 
the us regulatory review of hoylakes offer isnt expected to

the government promised to drop several pending mail fraud counts 
against him in exchange for a guilty plea 
goberstein also agreed to cooperate fully with the ongoing 
investigation of trading practices at the chicago board of trade 
and chicago mercantile exchange

federal regulators today ordered a suspension of 
centrust savings bank stock trading because of what they called 
misleading and inaccurate financial reports from the troubled 
thrift 
the office of thrift supervision halted trading on centrust 
stock on the american and midwest stock exchanges at 9 am est 
said thrift office spokesman william fulwider in washington 
fulwider said the action stems from the miamibased thrifts 
jan 16 filing of its financial report for the fiscal year ending 
sept 30 1989 
the thrift office alleges centrust misrepresented various 
aspects of its portfolio including characterizing securities as 
commericial loans and failing to acknowledge certain securities 
were used for investment purposes 
fulwider also noted that centrust failed to provide the thrift 
office with three full years of audited financial statements 
despite repeated requests and the thrift did not accurately report 
losses that would have wiped out shareholder equity 
fulwider would not say if federal regulators would take control 
of centrust which reported a 119 million loss for the fiscal year 
centrust fails to appraise the impact of these issues and 
the impact on shareholders and disclose the magnitute of the 
dispute between the ots and centrust 
centrust stock closed monday at 75 cents on the american stock 
exchange 
the charges made today by the thrift office against centrust are 
similar to the claims made last month in a ceaseanddesist order 
filed with the us district court in washington 
centrust one of the most visible thrifts in the crisisridden 
thrift industry has been criticized for lavish and unorthodox 
spending including a 30 million art collection a company yacht 
and high executive salaries 
the state office of comptroller filed an order dec 20 seeking 
to oust centrust chairman david paul who took a 48 million 
salary from january 1988 to september 1989 
paul is challenging the removal order but a hearing has not 
been set 
a proposed merger between centrust and new yorkbased ensign 
bank was called off last week 
centrust spokesman roy winnick in new york said the company was 
preparing a statement on the thrift office action

billionaire financier michael milken was 
subpoenaed today by the house banking committee as part of a new 
investigation of the role of junk bonds in savings and loan 
failures 
the committee which conducted hearings last fall on the failure 
of charles h keating jrs lincoln savings and loan association of 
irvine calif voted 311 to subpoena milken and two men involved 
in land deals with lincoln ernest garcia and fernando acosta 
meanwhile deputy treasury secretary john e robson said a fresh 
look by thrift regulators at the financial condition of the sampl 
industry may determine that president bushs bailout plan which 
provides 50 billion over three years is inadequate 
we do not yet know whether the 50 billion estimate will 
prove accurate because of many variables that continue to exist 
these include the pattern of interest rates the performance of 
local real estate markets and the general condition of regional 
economies robson said adding it is possible that the 50 
billion will prove inadequate 
he said the office of thrift supervision is updating its list of 
institutions likely to fail in the next 2 years which may 
indicate resolution costs beyond the original estimates 
the committee is calling milken as part of an examination of the 
junk bond trading of several institutions including lincoln 
silverado banking savings and loan association of denver and 
centrust savings of miami president bushs son neil served on 
the board of silverado and regulators are considering action

federal regulators today ordered a suspension of centrust stock 
trading because of what they called misleading and inaccurate 
financial reports the office of thrift supervision alleges 
centrust misrepresented various aspects of its portfolio including 
characterizing securities as commericial loans and failing to 
acknowledge certain securities were used for investment purposes 
the appearance of garcia and acosta would complete phase one 
of the committees investigation of lincoln while milkens 
testimony would signal phase two and will concentrate on 
the extent to which trading in junk bonds and subordinated debt 
contributed to the collapse of lincoln and other savings 
institutions said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of 
the panel 
milken asserted his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination when he appeared in 1988 before a subcommittee 
of the house energy and commerce committee 
he since has been indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud 
related to deals he put together while head of the junk bond unit 
of drexel burnham lambert inc his trial is expected to start later 
this year 
earlier this month garcia refused to testify in us district 
court when summoned as a witness in keatings attempt to overturn 
the federal seizure of his thrift 
todays hearing was the first of three by the house panel into 
the administrations conduct of the cleanup since enactment of the 
bush plan aug 9 the senate banking committee is following with a 
fourth session next week 
democrats on the house panel were pressing for faster action on 
what amounts to the largest thrift institution and real estate sale 
in history 
the nature of the problem would have justified hitting the 
ground running in august but they didnt do that said rep 
bruce vento dminn who chairs a house task force overseeing the 
bailout we have to get them moving 
the resolution trust corp after an initial flurry of activity 
has dramatically slowed the pace of sampl sales in its first two 
months it disposed of 33 failed sampls out of the 262 it had 
inherited 
but in the three months since then it has disposed of only 
seven institutions and its portfolio of failed sampls is growing 
faster than its list of resolutions 
this month the rtc put 51 of its institutions on the auction 
block bringing the total offered for sale up to 70 it also 
released an inventory of 30000 pieces of real estate available in 
45 states 
at the end of last week the rtc had 302 institutions with 113 
billion in assets left and expected to take control of another 200 
bankrupt thrifts in coming months 
the sampl bill provided 50 billion to cover the losses in failed 
thrifts and rtc officials say they need an additional 40 billion 
to 100 billion in working capital the working capital would be 
repaid as the government sells assets from the failed sampls and 
would not increase the ultimate cost of the bailout

southwestern bell corp one of the seven 
regional telephone companies reported today a slight decline in 
profit for the fourth quarter primarily because of some 
endoftheyear accounting adjustments 
the company which serves about 95 million homes and businesses 
in five states had net income in the quarter of 2972 million or 
99 cents a share compared with 3052 million or 102 a share for 
the same period a year ago 
southwestern bell spokesman gary ford said the 26 percent 
decline in earnings was caused by several onetime bookkeeping 
changes including how the company accounts for its life insurance 
premiums 
sales for the quarter which ended dec 31 were 23 billion 
up 63 percent from last years 21 billion 
besides providing phone service in missouri oklahoma kansas 
arkansas and texas southwestern bell is one of the nations 
largest makers of pagers and is a major supplier of cellular 
telephone service 
for the year the companys profit and sales each increased just 
over 3 percent net income for 1989 was 109 billion or 364 a 
share compared to 106 billion or 353 a share in 1988 sales 
were 872 billion in 1989 compared to 845 billion in 1988 
last year was one of excellent growth for our business said 
edward whitacre jr chairman and chief executive officer for 
southwestern 
ford said the companys telephone operations grew faster in 1989 
than in any year since 1978 the phone company added 419000 access 
lines for the year compared with 235000 lines in 1988 
improved economies in texas and oklahoma prompted the growth 
spurt ford said but about a third of the increase came from the 
companys effort to persuade homeowners to put in a second phone 
line he said 
another strong area for the company in 1989 was its mobile 
cellular phone systems division which set its third quarterly 
record for customer growth in the fourth quarter 
overall the mobile systems division grew 57 percent in 1989

floridas revenue director was 
suspended today on suspicion of having a businessmans taxes 
investigated for political reasons 
gov bob martinez and the cabinet suspended katie tucker for 10 
days with pay to allow her to explain her role in the revenue 
department probe of businesses owned by donald g resha a 
political opponent of her husbands 
i think any time there is either the perception or in fact the 
reality that it is using power granted to it in a wrongful way 
it certainly gives me a great deal of concern gov bob martinez 
said before the cabinet meeting 
ms tucker was traveling to tallahassee this morning and was not 
available for comment 
the florida department of law enforcement released a report 
monday suggesting resha was investigated for political reasons 
resha unsuccessfully ran against ms tuckers husband daniel 
miller for president of the state aflcio in 1985 
the report said ms tucker did not break any laws 
reshas bookstore and two video stores were subjected to a 
fivemonth investigation into allegations of pornography and sales 
tax violations 
the probe found no wrongdoing but the businesses were then 
audited the audit found that resha owed 58818 in taxes 
penalties and interest which he paid 
last week ms tucker denied that she targeted reshas 
businesses and said she intended the first investigation to include 
all tallahassee book and video stores 
she told fdle investigators that a state legislator was 
concerned the stores were used as fronts for illegal activity 
including pornography 
but fdle investigators concluded the only intelligence 
information concerning reshas alleged involvement originated from 
ms tucker 
martinez said ms tucker should have taken any concerns she had 
about criminal wrongdoing in tallahassee bookstores to law 
enforcement authorities

the european community commission and 
japan have settled a threeyear inquiry into the dumping of 
japanese computer chips at unusually low prices in the european 
market the commission said tuesday 
in a statement the commission said that 11 japanese companies 
agreed to set a minimum price for their chips amounting to the 
average production cost plus a 95 percent profit margin 
the agreement was a sufficient guarantee against price 
competition from japan the commission said 
the companies involved were fujitsu hitachi mitsubishi nec 
nmb oki texas instruments japan toshiba matsushita sanyo and 
sharp 
the agreement also applies to new generation computer chips 
which is unprecedented in an antidumping accord although these 
chips could be sold beneath the minimum price for a certain 
period in the interests of users the commission said 
in addition minimum prices will not be imposed on samples it 
said 
the accord ends a threeyear inquiry into extensive dumping of 
dynamic random access memory chips known as drams in the 
12nation ec 
drams are highly standardized microcircuits used in great 
quantities in computers telecommunications products and other 
hightech applications 
japans share of the drams market rose to 81 percent in 1986 
from 246 percent in 1983 before and during this threeyear 
period dram prices fell considerably on the ec and world markets 
the sharp fall in prices was clearly the consequence of a 
deliberate pricing policy of the japanese producers the 
commission said 
evidence also was found of serious damage to european chip 
producers who either did not use their full production capacity or 
had to curtail plans to increase capacity because of the low 
prices companies had significant losses as a result the 
commission said 
the dumping allegations were made by the european electronic 
manufacturers association which includes sgs siemens ag and 
thomson sa 
the commission said the accord should not only stop massive 
dumping of chips but also should enable users to buy drams at 
competitive prices 
an ec commission spokesman said the commission had consulted 
users before setting the final terms of the agreement the 
agreement will be reviewed in september 1991 when a similar price 
accord between the united states and japan expires

shearson lehman hutton holdings inc on tuesday 
posted fourthquarter earnings of 38 million a slender profit 
but a big improvement from the 13 million loss a year earlier 
parent companies of two smaller brokerages morgan stanley group 
inc and piper jaffray inc reported substantial income growth 
morgan stanleys earnings rose 37 percent in the three months ended 
dec 31 while piper jaffray said its quarterly income almost 
doubled from the year before 
shearson which is partially owned by american express co said 
on a pershare basis it had a loss of 3 cents which was far 
narrower than the 22 cent loss in 1988s fourth quarter 
more shares of common stock and equivalents were outstanding in 
last years fourth quarter than in 1988 shearson said the 
pershare figures were computed after taking into account preferred 
stock dividend requirements 
revenue edged up less than 1 percent to 293 billion from 291 
billion in the closing three months of 1988 
higher commissions net interest income and revenue from 
marketmaking and principal transactions contributed to shearsons 
overall income growth 
these positive factors helped reduce the drag on earnings from 
the slowdown in investor activity after the oct 13 market slump 
and uncertainty in highyield bond markets shearson said 
but the gains were partially offset by a decline in investment 
banking revenue and by previously disclosed relocation and 
severance expenses 
shearson and american express announced on dec 14 a plan to 
raise about 900 million in new capital for shearson the plan 
included a reduction in american expresss stake in the brokerage 
to less than 50 percent from 61 percent 
american express which bought into shearson in 1981 had wanted 
to cut back its holding for some time to remove the brokerages 
erratic performance from its earnings report 
shearsons recapitalization is intended to shore up the 
investment companys balance sheet but it isnt expected to 
guarantee a turnaround during a time of sagging profits on wall 
street 
for all of 1989 shearson said its aftertax income rose 146 
percent to 110 million or 95 cents a share from 96 million or 
81 cents a share in 1988 revenue rose 19 percent to 125 billion 
from 105 billion in 1988 
morgan stanley based in new york as is shearson said it earned 
1486 million or 380 a share in the fourth quarter up from 
1083 million or 284 a share in 1988 
revenue boosted by 1377 million of investment gains from 
morgans restructuring of its stake in container corp of america 
rose 37 percent to 159 billion from 116 billion 
last years net income came to 443 million or 1121 a share 
up 12 percent from 3946 million or 1026 a share in 1988 
revenue rose 42 percent to 58 billion from 411 billion 
the company said it benefited from the diversification of its 
businesses many of which turned in strong performances its 
financial advisory business maintained an active pace and was 
reinforced by the growth of crossborder mergers and acquisitions 
as well as real estate advisory revenue 
in underwriting morgan stanley was among the industry leaders 
in raising capital and in merchant banking the company realized 
significant revenue from the restructuring of several of its 
leveraged equity investments 
in sales and trading international equities foreign exchange 
and commodities contributed to morgan stanleys overall revenue 
growth while fixed income did well considering the difficult market 
conditions 
piper jaffray parent of the minneapolisbased investment firm 
piper jaffray amp hopwood inc reported earnings of 32 million 
or 79 cents a share in the three months ended dec 31 the first 
quarter in the companys fiscal year that was up from 16 
million or 41 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue rose 20 percent to 488 million from 406 million 
charles n hayssen piper jaffrays chief financial officer 
said the total revenue growth reflected an almost 50 percent surge 
in commission revenue mutual fund commissions were up more than 80 
percent 
he said institutional equity commissions also grew 
institutions are increasing their business with firms that 
offer valueadded research timely investment advice and strong 
trading capability he said this has allowed top nonnew 
yorkbased firms like piper jaffray to capture more market share

soybean futures prices closed modestly higher 
tuesday in quiet trading on the chicago board of trade boosted by 
signs of stronger export sales and notions that the market was 
oversold and due for a rally 
wheat futures ended mostly lower while corn futures were 
narrowly mixed 
all in all it was a pretty subdued session said analyst 
joel karlin of research department inc a brokers advisory 
service based in chicago 
the agriculture department said late monday in a weekly report 
that it inspected 207 million bushels of soybeans for export last 
week a number higher than traders had expected 
wheat inspections of 21 million bushels also were above trade 
estimates while corn inspections of 539 million bushels were about 
as expected 
forecasts for abovenormal precipitation early next week in the 
winter wheat belt pressured wheat prices but selling enthusiasm 
was tempered by rumors that the usda is preparing to target china 
and the soviet union for more sales of us wheat at subsidized 
prices karlin said 
wheat futures closed unchanged to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 392 a bushel corn futures 
were cent lower to 1 cent higher with march at 240 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with march at 138 a bushel 
soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with march at 567 a

bell atlantic corp said tuesday its profit tumbled 81 percent 
in the fourth quarter due largely to restructuring costs and 
southwestern bell corp blamed bookkeeping changes for a slight 26 
percent quarterly income decline 
bell atlantics aftertax earnings dropped to 579 million or 
29 cents a share in 1989s fourth quarter from 3026 million or 
153 per share in the final three months of 1988 restructuring 
costs cut its profit by about 263 million 
the onetime charges covered the costs of inducing 1700 
managers to retire early or leave the company revaluing spare 
parts inventories and establishing a health and dental benefit 
trust as agreed to in the latest labor contract the company said 
a small amount of the restructuring charge included debt 
refinancing 
between 1000 and 1200 mangers were to be offered the early 
leave incentives but bell spokeswoman cynthia m ciangio said more 
managers than expected had asked to leave 
since more wanted to do it and we could do it as a corporation 
we thought we would she said 
when the company announced the restructuring in september 
officials predicted the company would break even or post a small 
profit in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of 1989 bell atlantic saw a 42 percent 
increase in operating revenue to 289 billion from 277 billion 
our operating performance was very strong said raymond w 
smith bell atlantic chairman and chief executive officer and we 
have full confidence that in the 1990s well achieve our 
earningsgrowth target which continues to be 6 to 9 percent per 
year 
for all of 1989 net income dropped 184 percent to 108 
billion or 543 per share from 132 billion or 665 per 
share annual revenue increased 52 percent to 1145 billion from 
1988s 1088 billion the impact of the restructuring on the 
annual profit was 320 
philadelphiabased bell atlantic is the parent company of new 
jersey bell bell of pennsylvania diamond state telephone in 
delaware and the chesapeake and potomac telephone companies in 
maryland virginia west virginia and washington dc subsidiaries 
also provide mobile telephone service and computer repair services 
southwestern bell said the dip in fourthquarter net income to 
2972 million or 99 cents a share from 3052 million or 102 
a share a year before mainly occurred because of some yearend 
accounting adjustments 
company spokesman gary ford said the onetime adjustments 
included how the company accounts for its life insurance premiums 
sales for the quarter ended dec 31 were 23 billion up 63 
percent from the prior years 21 billion 
southwestern bell based in st louis serves about 95 million 
homes and businesses in five states besides providing phone 
service in missouri oklahoma kansas arkansas and texas 
southwestern bell is one of the nations largest makers of pagers 
and is a major supplier of cellular telephone service 
for the year the companys profit and sales each increased just 
over 3 percent net income for 1989 was 109 billion or 364 a 
share compared to 106 billion or 353 a share in 1988 sales 
were 872 billion in 1989 compared to 845 billion in 1988 
last year was one of excellent growth for our business said 
edward whitacre jr chairman and chief executive officer of 
southwestern 
ford said the companys telephone operations grew faster in 1989 
than in any year since 1978 the phone company added 419000 access 
lines for the year compared with 235000 lines in 1988 
improved economies in texas and oklahoma prompted the growth 
spurt ford said but about a third of the increase came from the 
companys effort to persuade homeowners to put in a second phone 
line he said 
another strong area for the company in 1989 was its mobile 
cellular phone systems division which set its third quarterly 
record for customer growth in the fourth quarter

of the session 
analysts said there was not enough buying momentum for the 
market to recover from mondays sharp drop in which the dow jones 
industrial average fell more than 77 points 
investors and speculators dont have the courage to buy 
secondary stocks said michael metz an analyst with oppenheimer 
amp co 
mondays decline was attributed to concerns about interest rates 
and lower corporate profits and analysts said those fears lingered 
on wall street today 
jack baker head of block trading with shearson lehman hutton 
inc said the selling wave seemed to be running out of steam but 
that the market had no reason to start a rally

fiat group italys largest industrial 
concern reported tuesday that its operating profit jumped 29 
percent in 1989 as its revenue rose 178 percent 
the turinbased automaker said it earned 495 trillion lire or 
396 billion in 1989 compared with 383 trillion lire a year 
earlier 
its revenue climbed to 522 trillion lire or 418 billion 
from 4431 trillion lire a year earlier 
the announcements came in an annual letter from fiat spa 
chairman giovanni agnelli to shareholders 
although fiat didnt disclose net results it said net earnings 
of parent company fiat spa should have reached around 12 
trillion lire or 960 million up 20 percent from 1988 
the increase in operating results topped analysts expectations 
while the sales figures were roughly in line with industry 
estimates the operating margin operating income as a percentage 
of sales rose to 95 percent from 86 percent in 1988 
in his letter to shareholders agnelli noted that at the end of 
1989 fiat closed a tenyear cycle in which it reestablished its 
economic and financial equilibrium and subsequently advanced goals 
of expansion and economic and financial stability 
agnelli emphasized the need to respond to the integration of the 
western european marketplace scheduled for 1992 and new economic 
growth in eastern europe 
the globalization of our competition requires that we develop 
internationally through our internal capacity and the 
multiplication of our external ties agnelli said in the letter 
agnelli attributed the 1989 revenue growth to a strong 
performance by the companys auto division although he noted all 
divisions posted gains against those registered in 1988 
the fiat group which produces fiat alfa romeo and lancia 
models sold 23 million cars last year up 47 percent from the 
year before

with stock prices falling interest rates rising 
and warnings increasing of a worldwide business slump the 1990s 
are off to a scary start on wall street 
optimists still insist it is all nothing more than one of the 
passing spells of anxiety that afflict the financial world even in 
the best of times 
but many other analysts wonder whether the bills incurred in the 
ebullient 80s might at last be coming due in the form of debt 
defaults bear markets and worsening woes for those who make their 
living in the investment trade 
those fears in turn have stirred anxious visions of a 
sustained market decline unlike anything this country has seen for 
nearly a decade 
there were all sorts of euphoric pronouncements of what the 
new decade would bring said william lefevre at the firm advest 
inc now that were well into january we may be experiencing a 
sort of hangover from all that yearend euphoria 
in the stock market the widely recognized dow jones average of 
30 industrial stocks began 1990 by jumping to a record high of 
281015 on jan 2 
three weeks later at tuesdays close it had fallen to 
261532 for a drop of 19483 points or nearly 7 percent from 
that peak 
in the bond markets meanwhile interest rates have confounded 
many of the experts by reversing their decline of late 1989 pushed 
up by sharp rate increases in japan west germany and other foreign 
lands 
that gave rise to fears of a global interestrate war that could 
significantly increase the chances of a recession 
the recent decline in stock prices is in keeping with 
fundamental changes in the economy and the financial markets 
said abby joseph cohen an analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
the pace of economic activity has slowed and profits have 
declined stock prices could decline further if other investors 
come to share our conclusions 
worries about the stock market of late have focused not so much 
on another crash like the one that occurred in october 1987 or the 
smaller shock that drove the dow jones industrial average down 190 
points last oct 13 
though those experiences have shown that such calamities can hit 
with little or no warning what many observers fear most is these 
days is a more prolonged period of financial malaise like the bear 
markets of the 1970s and early 1980s 
such declines can devastate business and investment plans 
through steady erosion rather than sudden collapse 
so much time has passed since the last bear market and so much 
about the markets themselves has changed that no one is sure what 
a 1990sstyle bear market might look like 
a normal bear would last six to nine months speculates the 
hirsch organization an old tappan nj investment advisory firm 
in the current edition of its newsletter ground floor 
on the other hand the organization says given the modern 
influences of computerprogram trading and nearlyinstant 
international flows of money it could be quicker and sicker 
should an extended decline in stock prices occur it would stand 
to deepen many economic worries now facing the country but a good 
many analysts hold out hope that it also would set the stage for 
renewed growth and optimism a few months or years in the future 
while stocks slumped in 198182 wall street veterans recall 
government policy measures and other events were working to curb 
inflation in a campaign that eventually paid big bullmarket 
dividends 
said rosanne cahn economist at first boston corp like the 
1980s the economic environment of the 1990s is starting with the 
job of correcting the prior decades excesses

its profit for the final quarter of 1989 plunged 55 percent from a 
year earlier and it reported a loss of nearly 1 billion for the

billion to its loanloss reserves excluding that provision the 
bank said it would have earned 6201 million or 751 a share 
bankers trust said it had a higher provision for credit losses 
in the fourth quarter 147 million vs 30 million in the 1988 
period that was partially offset by a drop in income taxes and 
noninterest expenses as well as higher noninterest revenue 
net chargeoffs of third world loans were 172 million in the 
fourth quarter including 1143 million in nonperforming 
mediumand longterm loans to brazil and 41 million to argentina

eddie antar founder of collapsed 
electronics retailer crazy eddie inc reaped more than 60 million 
by selling company stock based on figures in falsified financial 
records a federal judge said tuesday 
us district judge nicholas h politan found that antar was 
at the head of a scheme to overstate the companys income from 
1985 to 1987 and benefited from the resulting higher stock price 
when he sold his own crazy eddie shares 
the judge also ordered antar to repatriate 52 million that he 
allegedly had transferred in 1987 to bank accounts in israel 
politan made his findings in granting a motion by the securities 
and exchange commission to bar antar from violating securities 
laws which was part of the secs civil insider trading suit 
against antar 
the judges decision did not represent a criminal finding 
politan said he was relying on strong prima facie showings of 
securities fraud based on the record before him including included 
legal briefs and testimony by company officials 
antar did not submit a statement his attorneys opposed the 
repartriation order saying that even to admit the funds existed 
might compromise their clients constitutional right against 
selfincrimination 
the government which claims antar transferred up to 68 million 
out of the united states had asked for repatriation of the funds 
so that the money is available if it wins the insider trading case 
and a restitution order against antar 
any repatriated funds would be placed under supervision of a 
trustee 
it would be a compounding of a fraud to permit mr antar free 
reign over 60 million politan said 
antar built a single store in brooklyn ny into a 43outlet 
regional chain known for advertisements featuring a loudmouthed 
pitchman touting its insane prices 
the sec accused antar and other former top management of insider 
trading and altering the companys financial books the executives 
allegedly bought and sold crazy eddie stock based on inflated 
financial figures regarding the companys performance and prospects 
the company allegedly used a variety of methods to inflate 
earnings such as recording higher prices than actually were 
charged customers and fabricating the quantities of items returned 
to manufacturers 
crazy eddie went into involuntary bankruptcy in october antar 
and former officials also face a shareholder lawsuit in us 
district court in brooklyn and a criminal investigation by the 
us attorney in newark 
sec attorney richard simpson said a criminal indictment if 
returned would not come for another three months 
politan also accepted the request by antars attorneys to put 
the sec civil case on hold for the next four months 
the attorneys asked for the stay because they were unsure if the 
us attorney would seek forfeiture of antars legal fees under 
federal racketeering law 
antars lawyers argued that it was unfair for the justice 
department to seek attorney fees in a criminal case possibly 
depriving antar of legal defense against the sec lawsuit

during the session to 40470 representing a loss of 630 then 
bounced back to finish only 290 lower 
mondays late rebound and tuesdays rally appeared to stem from 
buying linked to mondays dive of more than 77 points in the dow

international inc a new york based dealer of foreign currencies 
and precious metals 
the dow finished with a gain of nearly 15 points tuesday but 
rollercoaster movement in bluechip stocks kept investors on edge 
and sent some running to the perceived safety of precious metals 
jonat said 
frankly i was a little worried when the stock market started 
to move on the downside and thats what got things going in gold 
he said 
the dollars pronounced weakness tuesday against other major 
currencies also prompted some buying of gold futures analysts said 
analysts said technical buy signals are surfacing in the 
gold silver and platinum markets and the continued unrest in 
soviet azerbaijan is also supportive

in crude oil stocks

perkinelmer corp which has been trying 
to sell its semiconductor equipment division for nine months has 
announced plans to cut 250 jobs within two weeks most of them in 
the semiconductor division 
perkinelmer spokesman edward bloch said monday sagging sales 
forced the layoffs most of which will be at the companys optical 
lithography unit in wilton he said the cuts will involve both 
skilled and unskilled jobs 
an industry analyst said the layoffs could indicate that 
perkinelmer is close to completing a deal to sell the 
semiconductor unit 
i suspect the company is starting to clear out the 
infrastructure as part of a semiconductor sale said l howard 
nichol vice president of research at hartfordbased advest inc 
this is not surprising since the company announced it would 
reduce employment last april 
perkinelmer based in norwalk makes measuring and analyzing 
equipment for hightechnology laboratories the company cut about 
300 jobs at its headquarters last april through attrition and 
contract buyouts 
last fall reports that perkinelmer was considering selling the 
semiconductor division to a japanese firm sparked a debate over 
usjapanese business relations and highlighted concerns that the 
united states was falling behind japan in computer technology 
international business machines corp publicly opposed such a sale

first interstate bancorp said monday that it 
lost 3443 million in the fourth quarter due to the previously 
announced addition of 400 million in reserves against losses at 
its texas subsidiary 
the loss for the octoberdecember quarter which works out to 
756 per share left first interstate with a yearly loss of 1245 
million or 330 per share it is due almost entirely to the 
collapse of real estate prices in texas and arizona 
first interstate the nations 10thlargest banking concern with 
58 billion in assets is struggling to put its losses behind it 
also took a 300 million charge this year because of problems with 
loans in arizona 
in the fourth quarter of 1988 first interstate earned 144 
million or 310 per share its profit for all of 1988 was 129 
million or 263 per share 
wall street reacted favorably to the report bidding up first 
interstate by 62 cents per share to 4462 in trading on the new 
york stock exchange 
theoretically they are clearing the decks so they can make 
some progress in 1990 said dan williams a banking analyst with 
sutro amp co in san francisco 
first interstates losses contrast sharply with record profits 
reported last week at big competitors like los angelesbased 
security pacific and san franciscobased bank of america 
by williams calculations first interstate owned 907 million 
in real estate starting this year compared to 498 million at the 
beginning of 1989 the big increase shows just how much property 
has been foreclosed 
it also should provide first interstate significant amounts of 
new funds williams said because with the big loss reserves first 
interstate can afford to sell off the property more aggressively 
they can move it out he said if they can liquidate a 
significant part of that they can redeploy the funds 
first interstate said last week that its longtime chairman and 
chief executive joseph j pinola would be succeeded as operating 
head of the company by president edward carson on june 1 after 
pinolas 65th birthday 
in his 12 years as first interstates chief pinola aggressively 
pursued interstate expansion a strategy that backfired in texas 
and arizona

supercomputer maker cray research inc said 
tuesday its profits dropped 41 percent in the fourth quarter and 43 
percent in 1989 because of the costs of product transitions and 
development of its new cray3 computer 
the results were roughtly in line with the companys earlier 
projections 
crays fourthquarter profits fell to 525 million or 178 a 
share from 8853 million or 280 a share a year earlier revenues 
for the quarter ended dec 31 were virtually unchanged at 3301 
million compared to 3309 million 
for the full year cray reported profits of 89 million or 302 
a share down from 1566 million or 499 a share in 1988 
revenues rose slightly to 7847 million from 7563 million 
customers accepted 35 computer systems with a contract value of 
300 million in the fourth quarter bringing totals for the year to 
73 systems worth 638 million cray said that compares with 65 
systems accepted in 1988 valued at 567 million 
president marcelo a gumucio who initially predicted 10 percent 
growth in revenue in 1989 said in july that revenue would likely 
remain unchanged he said contract signings had been delayed 
because of competitive and economic conditions 
cray research had a very strong fourth quarter in terms of 
systems accepted which helped us to meet the 1989 revenue and 
earnings guidance we gave in october said john rollwagen crays 
chairman and chief executive officer 
as expected revenue was approximately the same as 1988 
revenue and the decline in earnings from 1988 levels is due in 
large part to product transition costs and cray3 development 
expense incurred during 1989 
cray founder seymour cray left the company in may spinning off 
his development of the cray3 the first supercomputer to use 
gallium arsenide semiconductors into a separate company based in 
colorado springs colo the company was to start as a wholly owned 
subsidiary of cray research and evolve within a year into a company 
owned by existing cray shareholders 
plans called for the new company to receive 100 million in 
operating funds and 50 million in assets in the next two years 
from cray research 
rollwagen predicted that revenue would remain essentially 
unchanged in 1990 but added we are confident that we can improve 
profitability over 1989

the federated and allied department store 
groups may get quick approval when they ask a us bankruptcy court 
judge thursday for permission to continue paying employee benefits 
the us trustee handling the case said tuesday 
the companies also hope for quick approval to use 700 million 
in interim financing from new york banks 
us trustee conrad j morgenstern said in his view the requests 
by federated department stores inc and allied stores corp are 
necessary in order to assure continued funding of benefits that the 
companies 100000 employees nationwide are expecting 
the benefits include health and education plans disability 
insurance workers compensation bonus plans assistance for 
employees troubled by drug and alcohol abuse and 401k retirement 
plans funded by payroll deductions which serve a total of 44461 
allied and federated employees 
also among the benefits to be paid are merchandise discount 
plans for 8650 retirees who terminated employment with allied or 
federated before the chapter 11 filings those plans generate 
additional sales for the companies morgenstern said 
morgenstern said he and his staff have been examining the 
proposals to ensure they are appropriate and adequate 
i think all of these requests are entirely appropriate and 
necessary in order to have a company such as this which is so 
peopleoriented keep functioning at the high level of morale they 
strive to achieve morgenstern said in a telephone interview from 
his cleveland office our office will not be in opposition to 
those requests 
federated and allied the american retailing divisions of the 
canadian company campeau corp filed chapter 11 reorganization 
petitions jan 15 in cincinnati to obtain court protection from 
creditors the cincinnatibased retail companies listed 77 
billion in debts 
under the chapter 11 filing the companies must obtain the 
approval of us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr for paying 
operating expenses and other bills 
morgensterns office is assigned to assist federal bankrupcy 
courts in ohio and michigan his staff is to attend thursday 
mornings hearing in cincinnati before aug along with lawyers for 
federated allied and creditors 
federated and allied also filed a motion tuesday seeking augs 
approval to use interim financing money from banks new yorks 
citibank is the chief source of federateds 400 million in loans 
while chemical bank of new york is the major lender providing 300 
million for allied 
carol sanger a spokeswoman for allied and federated said the 
companies hope for quick approval most of this is housekeeping 
stuff ms sanger said 
its customary for debtors soon after they file under chapter 
11 to ask the court for authority to pay certain prepayment 
claims morgenstern said 
morgenstern said he thinks aug may give swift approval for the 
employee benefits but may take longer to approve the financing 
requests 
aug has declined to be interviewed about the case which 
represents the largest chapter 11 filing in american retailing 
history the parent campeau corp and the retailers have been 
struggling with debt accumulated when campeau bought allied in 1986 
and federated in 1988

ferranti international the british defense 
company hit by alleged fraud at a us subsidiary announced 
tuesday it is selling its main defense arm and its italian 
operations to britains general electric co for 5115 million 
shortly after the announcement britains customs and excise 
department said it is probing rumors involving ferranti that 
controls on the export of military equipment had been infringed 
a customs who declined to be named gave no details of the kind 
of equipment or the foreign countries rumored to be involved 
britains export of goods control order requiring export 
licences for goods with military uses is designed to prevent the 
export of sensitive equipment to countries including the soviet 
union china and south africa 
the financial times britains leading business newspaper 
quoted unidentified ferranti officials as denying that any of the 
companys exports had breached government rules 
the paper said the investigation focused on whether goods 
approved for export to friendly countries had been passed on to 
users in another country and whether descriptions of exports had 
been accurate 
earlier ferranti which has urgently sought new cash after the 
us debacle said gec will buy the whole of the scottishbased 
ferranti defense systems group and part of the italian subsidiary 
ferranti italia gec is not related to general electric co of the 
united states 
ferranti secured the deal two weeks before an emergency meeting 
of shareholders was scheduled to vote on a rights issue a special 
sale of shares to existing shareholders to try to raise 1871 
million to help cover the us loss 
the company said it now will postpone the feb 5 shareholders 
meeting 
ferranti announced last september it discovered bogus contracts 
following its acquisition of international signal and control ltd 
a us defense company based in lancaster pa ferranti is suing 
james guerin former chairman of the us company and others for 
2095 million in damages 
ferranti chairman sir derek alunjones said the deal will 
greatly strengthen the financial position of the group ferranti 
is retaining three businesses computer software a missile 
operation and electronic products 
the price we have agreed properly reflects the premium values 
of ferranti internationals excellent operations in scotland and 
italy alunjones added 
the deal means that ferrantis defense operations which is a 
major radar supplier for britains military will remain under 
british control a possible bidder for the company was frances 
thomson csf 
however the opposition labor party immediately demanded an 
investigation by the monopolies and mergers commission the party 
which has opposed the growing concentration of the countrys 
defense industry noted that last year gec and west germanys 
seimens ag took over another former defense rival in britain 
plessey 
the deal was announced after markets closed earlier ferranti 
shares rose 825 cents to 56 cents on leaked news that ferranti had 
won a 33billion order to supply the radar system for the 
fournation european fighter aircraft 
the deal was not conditional on the order but it obviously 
made ferranti more attractive to gec a ferranti spokesman said 
ferranti defense systems based in edinburgh with 6000 
employees accounts for about onefourth of ferrantis capital but 
nearly half its profits 
the edinburgh operation supplies navigation systems to the royal 
air force and has also become a major exporter of defense equipment 
ferranti italia makes civil and military communications 
equipment and electronics systems 
ferranti international announced this month it lost 2475 
million in the six months ended last september compared with a 
nearly 20 million profit in the same period in 1988

alaska airlines said tuesday it will buy or lease 
up to 64 mcdonnell douglas and boeing jetliners worth 25 billion 
and that as part of the deal a california leasing company will buy 
into the carriers holding company 
international lease finance corp of beverly hills which will 
lease 24 boeing 737400s to the airline will buy nearly all of a 
625 million new issue of alaska air group inc convertible 
preferred stock said bruce kennedy alaska airs chairman and 
chief executive 
kennedy also announced a share repurchase program and formation 
of an employee stock ownership plan 
industry analysts regarded the moves as insurance against a 
takeover 
we are pleased to have ilfc a company whose principals we 
have known and worked with for some nine years as a major 
shareholder kennedy said 
the plan to purchase 20 md9030s from mcdonnell douglas with 
options for another 20 and the lease of 24 boeing jets means 
that we have put together a plan to meet our aircraft requirements 
for the next 10 years kennedy said 
during the 1980s alaska airlines grew from a tiny carrier that 
served two states into an airline that now services washington 
alaska california oregon idaho montana utah arizona and 
mexico alaska air group also owns horizon air industries a 
pacific northwest commuter airline 
ilfc will buy the preferred stock issue for 594 million while 
about 1200 alaska air group management employees will be given the 
opportunity to pay 31 million for the rights to convert the 
preferred issue to common stock 
ilfc will receive all the dividends payable on the preferred and 
the shares voting rights equal to about 15 percent of the 
companys total voting power 
kennedy said ilfc will be a passive investor and will not sit on 
alaska airs board of directors 
alaska air also will lend 20 million to set up the employee 
stock ownership plan and its board has authorized the repurchase of 
up to 35 million shares of common stock 
william whitlow jr an analyst with dain bosworth inc in 
seattle said the arrangement appears to benefit all concerned 
alaska gets the aircraft and financing it needs and shark 
repellent against a hostile takeover by putting a large portion 
of its voting rights into friendly hands whitlow said ilfc in 
turn gets a large chunk of business with some protection on their 
investment he said 
kennedy said alaska airlines which has grown fivefold in the 
past decade expects 1989 to be its 17th consecutive profitable 
year 
were one of the few remaining specimens of an airline that 
was born before deregulation which managed to tough it out against 
the giants he said 
the twinengine md9030s will carry 145 passengers each with 
the first plane to be delivered in 1994 the 737400s also 
twinengined planes will carry 139 passengers in two classes 
both models are mediumrange jets and will be outfitted with the 
most quiet and fuelefficient engines available kennedy said 
the biggest factor probably driving us right now as we look 
ahead through the 1990s is the noise issue not only in seattle but 
the state of california kennedy said 
in east hartford conn international aero engines said alaska 
airlines had ordered 225 million worth of its new v2500 jet 
engines to power the 20 md9030s and had taken options on engines 
for another 20 aircraft
